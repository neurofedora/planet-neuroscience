     alt="Digital reconstruction and quantitative morphometric analysis of bipolar cells in live rat retinal slices"/>
<p>The tenet that structure is inextricably linked to function has inspired the characterization of complete morphologies of neurons since the time of Cajal. We have morphologically reconstructed and analyzed bipolar cells imaged with 2-photon microscopy in the rat retina. By precisely quantifying the level of stratification of the axon terminals in the inner plexiform layer, we have generated a reference system for reliable classification of individual cells in future studies focused on correlating morphological and physiological properties.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Bipolar cells convey signals from photoreceptors in the outer retina to amacrine and ganglion cells in the inner retina. In mammals, there are typically 10–15 types of cone bipolar cells and one type of rod bipolar cell. Different types of cone bipolar cells are thought to code and transmit different features of a complex visual stimulus, thereby generating parallel channels that uniquely filter and transform the photoreceptor outputs. Differential synaptic connectivity and expression of ligand- and voltage-gated ion channels are thought to be important mechanisms for processing and filtering visual signals. Whereas the biophysical basis for such mechanisms has been investigated more extensively in rat retina, there is a lack of quantitative morphological data necessary for advancing the structure–function correlation in this species, as recent connectomics investigations have focused on mouse retina. Here, we performed whole-cell recordings from cone and rod bipolar cells in rat retinal slices, filled the cells with fluorescent dyes, and acquired image stacks by multiphoton excitation microscopy. Following deconvolution, we performed digital reconstruction and morphometric analysis of 25 cone and 14 rod bipolar cells. Compared to previous descriptions, the extent and complexity of branching of the axon terminal was surprisingly high. By precisely quantifying the level of stratification of the axon terminals in the inner plexiform layer, we have generated a reference system for reliable classification of individual cells in future studies focused on correlating physiological and morphological properties. The implemented workflow can be extended to the development of morphologically realistic compartmental models for these neurons.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Strip1 regulates retinal ganglion cell survival by suppressing Jun-mediated apoptosis to promote retinal neural circuit formation</a></h4>

              
                In the vertebrate retina, an interplay between retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), amacrine (AC), and bipolar (BP) cells establishes a synaptic layer called the inner plexiform layer (IPL). This circuit conveys signals from photoreceptors to visual centers in the brain. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in its development remain poorly understood. Striatin-interacting protein 1 (Strip1) is a core component of the striatin-interacting phosphatases and kinases (STRIPAK) complex, and it has shown emerging roles in embryonic morphogenesis. Here, we uncover the importance of Strip1 in inner retina development. Using zebrafish, we show that loss of Strip1 causes defects in IPL formation. In <i>strip1</i> mutants, RGCs undergo dramatic cell death shortly after birth. AC and BP cells subsequently invade the degenerating RGC layer, leading to a disorganized IPL. Mechanistically, zebrafish Strip1 interacts with its STRIPAK partner, Striatin 3 (Strn3), and both show overlapping functions in RGC survival. Furthermore, loss of Strip1 or Strn3 leads to activation of the proapoptotic marker, Jun, within RGCs, and Jun knockdown rescues RGC survival in <i>strip1</i> mutants. In addition to its function in RGC maintenance, Strip1 is required for RGC dendritic patterning, which likely contributes to proper IPL formation. Taken together, we propose that a series of Strip1-mediated regulatory events coordinates inner retinal circuit formation by maintaining RGCs during development, which ensures proper positioning and neurite patterning of inner retinal neurons.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A novel immunopeptidomic-based pipeline for the generation of                    personalized oncolytic cancer vaccines</a></h4>

              
                Beside the isolation and identification of MHC-I restricted peptides from the                    surface of cancer cells, one of the challenges is eliciting an effective                    anti-tumor CD8+ T cell mediated response as part of therapeutic cancer vaccine.                    Therefore, the establishment of a solid pipeline for the downstream selection of                    clinically relevant peptides and the subsequent creation of therapeutic cancer                    vaccines are of utmost importance. Indeed, the use of peptides for eliciting                    specific anti-tumor adaptive immunity is hindered by two main limitations: the                    efficient selection of the most optimal candidate peptides and the use of a                    highly immunogenic platform to combine with the peptides to induce effective                    tumor-specific adaptive immune responses. Here, we describe for the first time a                    streamlined pipeline for the generation of personalized cancer vaccines starting                    from the isolation and selection of the most immunogenic peptide candidates                    expressed on the tumor cells and ending in the generation of efficient                    therapeutic oncolytic cancer vaccines. This immunopeptidomics-based pipeline was                    carefully validated in a murine colon tumor model CT26. Specifically, we used                    state-of-the-art immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometric methodologies to                    isolate &gt;8000 peptide targets from the CT26 tumor cell line. The selection of                    the target candidates was then based on two separate approaches: RNAseq analysis                    and the HEX software. The latter is a tool previously developed by Chiaro et al.                    (1), able to identify tumor antigens similar to pathogen antigens, in order to                    exploit molecular mimicry and tumor pathogen cross-reactive T-cells in cancer                    vaccine development. The generated list of candidates (twenty-six in total) was                    further tested in a functional characterization assay using interferon-g ELISpot                    (Enzyme-Linked Immunospot), reducing the number of candidates to six. These                    peptides were then tested in our previously described oncolytic cancer vaccine                    platform PeptiCRAd, a vaccine platform that combines an immunogenic oncolytic                    adenovirus (OAd) coated with tumor antigen peptides. In our work, PeptiCRAd was                    successfully used for the treatment of mice bearing CT26, controlling the                    primary malignant lesion and most importantly a secondary, non-treated, cancer                    lesion. These results confirmed the feasibility of applying the described                    pipeline for the selection of peptide candidates and generation of therapeutic                    oncolytic cancer vaccine, filling a gap in the field of cancer immunotherapy,                    and paving the way to translate our pipeline into human therapeutic                    approach.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Environmental overlap influences goal‐oriented coding of spatial sequences differently along the long‐axis of hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>When navigating our world we often first plan or retrieve a route to our goal, avoiding alternative paths to other destinations. Inspired by computational and animal models, we have recently demonstrated evidence that the human hippocampus supports prospective spatial coding, mediated by interactions with the prefrontal cortex. But the relationship between such signals and the need to discriminate possible routes based on their goal remains unclear. In the current study, we combined human fMRI, multi-voxel pattern analysis, and an established paradigm for contrasting memories of nonoverlapping routes with those of routes that cross paths and must be disambiguated. By classifying goal-oriented representations at the initiation of a navigational route, we demonstrate that environmental overlap modulates goal-oriented representations in the hippocampus. This modulation manifest through representational shifts from posterior to anterior components of the right hippocampus. Moreover, declines in goal-oriented decoding due to overlapping memories were predicted by the strength of the alternative memory, suggesting co-expression and competition between alternatives in the hippocampus during prospective thought. Moreover, exploratory whole-brain analyses revealed that a region of frontopolar cortex, which we have previously tied to prospective route planning, represented goal-states in new overlapping routes. Together, our findings provide insight into the influences of contextual overlap on the long-axis of the hippocampus and a broader memory and planning network that we have long-associated with such navigation tasks.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Large self-assembled clathrin lattices spontaneously disassemble without sufficient adaptor proteins</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Si-Kao Guo, Alexander J. Sodt, Margaret E. Johnson</p>

Clathrin-coated structures must assemble on cell membranes to internalize receptors, with the clathrin protein only linked to the membrane via adaptor proteins. These structures can grow surprisingly large, containing over 20 clathrin, yet they often fail to form productive vesicles, instead aborting and disassembling. We show that clathrin structures of this size can both form and disassemble spontaneously when adaptor protein availability is low, despite high abundance of clathrin. Here, we combine recent <i>in vitro</i> kinetic measurements with microscopic reaction-diffusion simulations and theory to differentiate mechanisms of stable vs unstable clathrin assembly on membranes. While <i>in vitro</i> conditions drive assembly of robust, stable lattices, we show that concentrations, geometry, and dimensional reduction in physiologic-like conditions do not support nucleation if only the key adaptor AP-2 is included, due to its insufficient abundance. Nucleation requires a stoichiometry of adaptor to clathrin that exceeds 1:1, meaning additional adaptor types are necessary to form lattices successfully and efficiently. We show that the critical nucleus contains ~25 clathrin, remarkably similar to sizes of the transient and abortive structures observed <i>in vivo</i>. Lastly, we quantify the cost of bending the membrane under our curved clathrin lattices using a continuum membrane model. We find that the cost of bending the membrane could be largely offset by the energetic benefit of forming curved rather than flat structures, with numbers comparable to experiments. Our model predicts how adaptor density can tune clathrin-coated structures from the transient to the stable, showing that active energy consumption is therefore not required for lattice disassembly or remodeling during growth, which is a critical advance towards predicting productive vesicle formation.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Determining clinically relevant features in cytometry data using persistent homology</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Soham Mukherjee, Darren Wethington, Tamal K. Dey, Jayajit Das</p>

Cytometry experiments yield high-dimensional point cloud data that is difficult to interpret manually. Boolean gating techniques coupled with comparisons of relative abundances of cellular subsets is the current standard for cytometry data analysis. However, this approach is unable to capture more subtle topological features hidden in data, especially if those features are further masked by data transforms or significant batch effects or donor-to-donor variations in clinical data. We present that persistent homology, a mathematical structure that summarizes the topological features, can distinguish different sources of data, such as from groups of healthy donors or patients, effectively. Analysis of publicly available cytometry data describing non-naïve CD8+ T cells in COVID-19 patients and healthy controls shows that systematic structural differences exist between single cell protein expressions in COVID-19 patients and healthy controls. We identify proteins of interest by a decision-tree based classifier, sample points randomly and compute persistence diagrams from these sampled points. The resulting persistence diagrams identify regions in cytometry datasets of varying density and identify protruded structures such as ‘elbows’. We compute Wasserstein distances between these persistence diagrams for random pairs of healthy controls and COVID-19 patients and find that systematic structural differences exist between COVID-19 patients and healthy controls in the expression data for T-bet, Eomes, and Ki-67. Further analysis shows that expression of T-bet and Eomes are significantly downregulated in COVID-19 patient non-naïve CD8+ T cells compared to healthy controls. This counter-intuitive finding may indicate that canonical effector CD8+ T cells are less prevalent in COVID-19 patients than healthy controls. This method is applicable to any cytometry dataset for discovering novel insights through <i>topological data analysis</i> which may be difficult to ascertain otherwise with a standard gating strategy or existing bioinformatic tools.

Focal sources (FS) are believed to be important triggers and a perpetuation mechanism for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF). Detecting FS and determining AF sustainability in atrial tissue can help guide ablation targeting. We hypothesized that sustained rotors during FS-driven episodes indicate an arrhythmogenic substrate for sustained AF, and that non-invasive electrical recordings, like electrocardiograms (ECGs) or body surface potential maps (BSPMs), could be used to detect FS and AF sustainability. Computer simulations were performed on five bi-atrial geometries. FS were induced by pacing at cycle lengths of 120–270 ms from 32 atrial sites and four pulmonary veins. Self-sustained reentrant activities were also initiated around the same 32 atrial sites with inexcitable cores of radii of 0, 0.5 and 1 cm. FS fired for two seconds and then AF inducibility was tested by whether activation was sustained for another second. ECGs and BSPMs were simulated. Equivalent atrial sources were extracted using second-order blind source separation, and their cycle length, periodicity and contribution, were used as features for random forest classifiers. Longer rotor duration during FS-driven episodes indicates higher AF inducibility (area under ROC curve = 0.83). Our method had accuracy of 90.6±1.0% and 90.6±0.6% in detecting FS presence, and 93.1±0.6% and 94.2±1.2% in identifying AF sustainability, and 80.0±6.6% and 61.0±5.2% in determining the atrium of the focal site, from BSPMs and ECGs of five atria. The detection of FS presence and AF sustainability were insensitive to vest placement (±9.6%). On pre-operative BSPMs of 52 paroxysmal AF patients, patients classified with initiator-type FS on a single atrium resulted in improved two-to-three-year AF-free likelihoods (p-value < 0.01, logrank tests). Detection of FS and arrhythmogenic substrate can be performed from ECGs and BSPMs, enabling non-invasive mapping towards mechanism-targeted AF treatment, and malignant ectopic beat detection with likely AF progression.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Chemotherapy-induced cachexia and model-informed dosing to preserve lean mass in cancer treatment</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Suzan Farhang-Sardroodi, Michael A. La Croix, Kathleen P. Wilkie</p>

Although chemotherapy is a standard treatment for cancer, it comes with significant side effects. In particular, certain agents can induce severe muscle loss, known as cachexia, worsening patient quality of life and treatment outcomes. 5-fluorouracil, an anti-cancer agent used to treat several cancers, has been shown to cause muscle loss. Experimental data indicates a non-linear dose-dependence for muscle loss in mice treated with daily or week-day schedules. We present a mathematical model of chemotherapy-induced muscle wasting that captures this non-linear dose-dependence. Area-under-the-curve metrics are proposed to quantify the treatment’s effects on lean mass and tumour control. Model simulations are used to explore alternate dosing schedules, aging effects, and morphine use in chemotherapy treatment with the aim of better protecting lean mass while actively targeting the tumour, ultimately leading to improved personalization of treatment planning and improved patient quality of life.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">The synaptic scaffold protein MPP2 interacts with GABAA receptors at the periphery of the postsynaptic density of glutamatergic synapses</a></h4>

Recent advances in imaging technology have highlighted that scaffold proteins and receptors are arranged in subsynaptic nanodomains. The synaptic membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) scaffold protein membrane protein palmitoylated 2 (MPP2) is a component of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor–associated protein complexes and also binds to the synaptic cell adhesion molecule SynCAM 1. Using superresolution imaging, we show that—like SynCAM 1—MPP2 is situated at the periphery of the postsynaptic density (PSD). In order to explore MPP2-associated protein complexes, we used a quantitative comparative proteomics approach and identified multiple γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)<sub>A</sub> receptor subunits among novel synaptic MPP2 interactors. In line with a scaffold function for MPP2 in the assembly and/or modulation of intact GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors, manipulating MPP2 expression had effects on inhibitory synaptic transmission. We further show that GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors are found together with MPP2 in a subset of dendritic spines and thus highlight MPP2 as a scaffold that serves as an adaptor molecule, linking peripheral synaptic elements critical for inhibitory regulation to central structures at the PSD of glutamatergic synapses.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">FtsZ filament structures in different nucleotide states reveal the mechanism of assembly dynamics</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Federico M. Ruiz, Sonia Huecas, Alicia Santos-Aledo, Elena A. Prim, José M. Andreu, Carlos Fernández-Tornero</p>

Treadmilling protein filaments perform essential cellular functions by growing from one end while shrinking from the other, driven by nucleotide hydrolysis. Bacterial cell division relies on the primitive tubulin homolog FtsZ, a target for antibiotic discovery that assembles into single treadmilling filaments that hydrolyse GTP at an active site formed upon subunit association. We determined high-resolution filament structures of FtsZ from the pathogen <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> in complex with different nucleotide analogs and cations, including mimetics of the ground and transition states of catalysis. Together with mutational and biochemical analyses, our structures reveal interactions made by the GTP γ-phosphate and Mg<sup>2+</sup> at the subunit interface, a K<sup>+</sup> ion stabilizing loop T7 for co-catalysis, new roles of key residues at the active site and a nearby crosstalk area, and rearrangements of a dynamic water shell bridging adjacent subunits upon GTP hydrolysis. We propose a mechanistic model that integrates nucleotide hydrolysis signaling with assembly-associated conformational changes and filament treadmilling. Equivalent assembly mechanisms may apply to more complex tubulin and actin cytomotive filaments that share analogous features with FtsZ.

                <img src="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/9adc16b3-5b62-4ba3-a966-5e12fc622927/cne25318-gra-0001-m.png"
     alt="Inhibition of androgenic pathway impairs encoding of cerebellar-dependent motor learning in male rats"/>
<p>Gaze stabilization reflexes such as the vestibuloocular reflex (VOR) and the optokinetic reflex (OKR) share some neuronal circuitry and interact in oculomotor adaptation phenomena. The presence of androgen receptors (Ars) in the cerebellar–vestibular network that mediates the adaptive modification of the VOR makes the VOR an excellent model to study the impact of androgens on cerebellar-dependent learning. In young male rats, the androgen receptor antagonist flutamide (FLUT) acutely impairs the capability of VOR to encode gain-increase and gain-decrease adaptation without influencing basal VOR and OKR. Such findings imply that the androgenic neuronal pathway activation participates in the VOR adaptation phenomenon probably via nonclassical mechanisms of regulation. We suggested that androgens, possibly testosterone (T) and dihydrotestosterone (DHT), by binding Ars may rapidly regulate cerebellar and extracerebellar plastic sites responsible for VOR adaptation.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Cerebellar-dependent learning is essential for the adaptation of motor and no motor behaviors to changing contexts, and neuroactive steroids—mainly referred to as estrogens—may regulate this process. However, the role of androgens in this process has not been established, although they may affect cerebellar physiology. Thus, this study aims to determine whether the activation of androgenic neural pathways may take part in controlling the vestibuloocular (VOR) and optokinetic reflexes (OKR), which depend on a defined cerebellar circuitry. To answer this question, we acutely blocked the activation of androgen receptors (Ars) using systemic administration of the Ars antagonist flutamide (FLUT; 20 mg/Kg) in peripubertal male rats. Then, we evaluated the FLUT effect on general oculomotor performance in the VOR and OKR as well as VOR adaptive gain increases and decreases. We used a paradigm causing fast VOR adaptation that combined in phase/out phase visuo-vestibular stimulations. We found that FLUT impaired the gain increase and decrease in VOR adaptation. However, FLUT altered neither acute nor overtime basal ocular-motor performance in the VOR or OKR. These findings indicate that the activation of androgenic neural pathways participates in phenomena leading to fast VOR adaptation, probably through the modulation of plasticity mechanisms that underlie adaptation of this reflex. Conversely, androgens may not be essential for neural information processing demands in basal ocular-motor reflexes. Moreover, our results suggest that androgens, possibly testosterone and dihydrotestosterone, could rapidly regulate motor memory encoding in the VOR adaptation, acting at both cerebellar and extracerebellar plasticity sites.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>This study aimed to determine the pattern of <sup>18</sup>F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) related to postmortem Lewy body disease (LBD) pathology in clinical Alzheimer’s disease (AD).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>FDG-PET scans were analyzed in 62 autopsy-confirmed patients and 110 controls in the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. Based on neuropathologic evaluations on Braak’s stage for neurofibrillary tangle, Consortium to Establish a Registry for AD score for neuritic plaque, and Lewy-related pathology, subjects were classified into AD(-)/LBD(-), AD(-)/LBD(+), AD(+)/LBD(-), and AD(+)/LBD(+) groups. The association between postmortem LBD and AD pathologies and antemortem brain metabolism was evaluated.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>AD and LBD pathologies had significant interaction effects to decrease metabolism in the cerebellar vermis, bilateral caudate, putamen, basal frontal cortex, and anterior cingulate cortex in addition to the left side of entorhinal cortex and amygdala; and those to increase metabolism in the bilateral parietal and occipital cortices. LBD pathology was associated with hypermetabolism in the cerebellar vermis, bilateral putamen, anterior cingulate cortex, and basal frontal cortex, corresponding to the LB-related hypermetabolic patterns. AD pathology was associated with hypometabolism in the bilateral hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, and posterior cingulate cortex regardless of LBD pathology, while LBD pathology was associated with hypermetabolism in the bilateral putamen and anterior cingulate cortex regardless of AD pathology.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Postmortem LBD and AD pathologies had significant interaction effects on the antemortem brain metabolism in clinical AD patients. Specific metabolic patterns related to AD and LBD pathologies could be elucidated when simultaneously considering the two pathologies.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Restoring anti-JC virus (JCV) immunity is the only treatment of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). Interleukin-7 is a cytokine that increases number and function of T cells. We analyzed a population of PML patients who received recombinant human IL-7 (rhIL-7) to estimate survival and its determinants.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>After exclusion of patients with missing data or receiving other immunotherapies, findings from 64 patients with proven PML who received rhIL-7 between 2007 and 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. Logistic regression was used to analyze variables associated with one-year survival.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Underlying conditions were HIV/AIDS (n = 27, 42%), hematological malignancies (n = 16, 25%), primary immunodeficiencies (n = 13, 20%), solid organ transplantation (n = 4, 6%) and chronic inflammatory diseases (n = 4, 6%). One-year survival was 54.7% and did not differ by underlying condition. Survival was not associated with baseline characteristics, but with a &gt;50% increase in blood lymphocytes (OR 4.1, 95%CI 1.2–14.9) and CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (OR 5.9, 95%CI 1.7–23.3), and a &gt; 1 log copies/mL decrease in cerebrospinal fluid JCV DNA (OR 7.6, 95%CI 1.6–56.1) during the first month after rhIL-7 initiation. Side effects were mainly local and flu-like symptoms (n = 8, 12.5%) and PML-immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) (n = 5, 8%).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>In this non-controlled retrospective study, survival did not differ from that expected in HIV/AIDS patients, but might have been improved in those with hematological malignancies, primary immunodeficiencies and transplant recipients. RhIL-7 might have contributed to the increase in blood lymphocytes and decrease in CSF JCV replication that were associated with better survival. ANN NEUROL 2022;91:496–505</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The objective of this study was to evaluate novel plasma p-tau231 and p-tau181, as well as Aβ<sub>40</sub> and Aβ<sub>42</sub> assays as indicators of tau and Aβ pathologies measured with positron emission tomography (PET), and their association with cognitive change, in cognitively unimpaired older adults.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In a cohort of 244 older adults at risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) owing to a family history of AD dementia, we measured single molecule array (Simoa)-based plasma tau biomarkers (p-tau231 and p-tau181), Aβ<sub>40</sub> and Aβ<sub>42</sub> with immunoprecipitation mass spectrometry, and Simoa neurofilament light (NfL). A subset of 129 participants underwent amyloid-β (<sup>18</sup>F-NAV4694) and tau (<sup>18</sup>F-flortaucipir) PET assessments. We investigated plasma biomarker associations with Aβ and tau PET at the global and voxel level and tested plasma biomarker combinations for improved detection of Aβ-PET positivity. We also investigated associations with 8-year cognitive change.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Plasma p-tau biomarkers correlated with flortaucipir binding in medial temporal, parietal, and inferior temporal regions. P-tau231 showed further associations in lateral parietal and occipital cortices. Plasma Aβ<sub>42/40</sub> explained more variance in global Aβ-PET binding than Aβ<sub>42</sub> alone. P-tau231 also showed strong and widespread associations with cortical Aβ-PET binding. Combining Aβ<sub>42/40</sub> with p-tau231 or p-tau181 allowed for good distinction between Aβ-negative and -positive participants (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC] range = 0.81–0.86). Individuals with low plasma Aβ<sub>42/40</sub> and high p-tau experienced faster cognitive decline.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Plasma p-tau231 showed more robust associations with PET biomarkers than p-tau181 in presymptomatic individuals. The combination of p-tau and Aβ<sub>42/40</sub> biomarkers detected early AD pathology and cognitive decline. Such markers could be used as prescreening tools to reduce the cost of prevention trials.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Leigh Syndrome: A Study of 209 Patients at the Beijing Children's Hospital</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Leigh syndrome (LS) is a heterogeneous neurodegenerative disease and the most frequent pediatric manifestation of mitochondrial disease. In the largest patient collection to date, this study aimed to provide new insights into the clinical and genetic spectrum of LS, defect-specific associations, and predictors of disease course and survival.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Clinical, metabolic, neuroimaging, onset, and survival data were collected from the medical records of 209 patients referred to the Beijing Children's Hospital with symmetrical basal ganglia and/or brainstem neuroimaging changes indicative of LS by 30 centers from the Chinese network of mitochondrial disease (mitoC-NET) between January 2013 and July 2021 for exploratory analysis.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Pathogenic variants were identified in 52 genes, most frequently <i>MT-ATP6</i>, <i>SURF1</i>, and <i>PDHA1</i>. Maternally inherited variants accounted for 42% (heteroplasmy level ≥90% in 64%). Phenotypes spanned 92 Human Phenotype Ontology terms. Elevated serum lactate (144/195), global developmental delay (142/209), and developmental regression (103/209) were most frequent. Discriminating neuroimaging and/or clinical features were identified for <i>MT-ATP6</i> (m.9176T&gt;C), <i>MT-ND5</i>, <i>PDHA1</i>, <i>SUCLG1</i>, and <i>SURF1</i>. Poorest survival was associated with <i>MT-ND5</i>, <i>MT-ATP6</i> (m.8993T&gt;C and m.9176T&gt;C), <i>SURF1</i>, and <i>ALDH5A1</i> (≤50% 3 year's survival), in contrast to milder defects with specific treatment (<i>ECHS1</i> and <i>SLC19A3</i>, 100% 3 year's survival).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our data define phenotype, onset, and survival of LS in a defect-specific manner, identifying features discriminating between genetic defects and predictive of disease outcome. These findings are essential to early diagnosis, in optimizing family counseling, and to the design and monitoring of future clinical trials, the next frontier of LS research.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>This study aimed to validate the Erasmus Guillain–Barré Syndrome Respiratory Insufficiency Score in the International Guillain–Barré Syndrome Outcome Study cohort, and to improve its performance and region-specificity.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We examined data from the first 1,500 included patients, aged ≥6 years and not ventilated prior to study entry. Patients with a clinical variant or mild symptoms were also included. Outcome was mechanical ventilation within the first week from study entry. Model performance was assessed regarding the discriminative ability (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve) and the calibration (observed vs predicted probability of mechanical ventilation), in the full cohort and in Europe/North America and Asia separately. We recalibrated the model to improve its performance and region-specificity.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In the group of 1,023 eligible patients (Europe/North America n = 842, Asia n = 104, other n = 77), 104 (10%) required mechanical ventilation within the first week from study entry. Area under the curve values were ≥0.80 for all validation subgroups. Mean observed proportions of mechanical ventilation were lower than predicted risks: full cohort 10% versus 21%, Europe/North America 9% versus 21%, and Asia 17% versus 23%. After recalibration, predicted risks for the full cohort and Europe/North America corresponded to observed proportions.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This prospective, international cohort study validated the Erasmus Guillain–Barré Syndrome Respiratory Insufficiency Score, and showed that the model can be used in the full spectrum of Guillain–Barré syndrome patients. In addition, a more accurate, region-specific version of the model was developed for patients from Europe/North America. ANN NEUROL 2022;91:521–531</p>

                <p>Retromer deficiency is reported in Down syndrome and correlates with amyloidosis, however, its association with tau neuropathology remains unclear. Down syndrome and control brain tissues were evaluated for phosphorylated tau, tau modulators, and cathepsin-D activity. Several kinases and phosphatase PP2A were unchanged, but tau phosphorylation was elevated, and cathepsin-D activity decreased in aged patients with Down syndrome. Retromer proteins positively associated with soluble tau, whereas pathogenic tau negatively correlated with retromer proteins and cathepsin-D activity. Retromer deficiency and consequent reduction of cathepsin-D activity may contribute to pathogenic tau accumulation, thus, retromer represents a viable therapeutic target against tau pathology in Down syndrome.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>This study was undertaken to describe and compare disease course and prognosis of early (ie, disease onset before age 11 years) and late (ie, disease onset after age 11 years) onset pediatric multiple sclerosis.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Prospectively collected clinical information from Italian Multiple Sclerosis Register of 1993 pediatric multiple sclerosis patients, of whom 172 had early onset, was analyzed. Cox models adjusted for sex, baseline Expanded Disability Status Scale score, and disease-modifying treatments and stratified for diagnostic criteria adopted (Poser vs McDonald) were used to assess the risk of reaching irreversible Expanded Disability Status Scale scores of 3, 4, and 6, and conversion to secondary progressive phenotype in early versus late onset pediatric patients. Prognostic factors were also evaluated.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A greater proportion of males, isolated brainstem involvement, and longer time interval between first and second clinical episode were observed in early versus late onset pediatric patients. Compared to late onset, early onset pediatric patients took longer from disease onset to convert to secondary progressive phenotype and to reach all disability milestones. Recovery from first demyelinating event, time to first relapse, annualized relapse rate during the first 3 years of disease, and disease-modifying treatment exposure were independent predictors for long-term disability in early onset pediatric patients. In late onset pediatric patients, isolated optic neuritis, multifocal symptoms, and progressive course at disease onset were additional predictors for long-term disability.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>These findings point toward the existence of a different natural history in early versus late onset pediatric multiple sclerosis patients. ANN NEUROL 2022;91:483–495</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Axonal excitability reflects ion channel function, and it is proposed that this may be a biomarker in painful (vs painless) polyneuropathy. Our objective was to investigate the relationship between axonal excitability parameters and chronic neuropathic pain in deeply phenotyped cohorts with diabetic or chemotherapy-induced distal symmetrical polyneuropathy.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Two hundred thirty-nine participants with diabetic polyneuropathy were recruited from sites in the UK and Denmark, and 39 participants who developed chemotherapy-induced polyneuropathy were recruited from Denmark. Participants were separated into those with probable or definite neuropathic pain and those without neuropathic pain. Axonal excitability of large myelinated fibers was measured with the threshold tracking technique. The stimulus site was the median nerve, and the recording sites were the index finger (sensory studies) and abductor pollicis brevis muscle (motor studies).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Participants with painless and painful polyneuropathy were well matched across clinical variables. Sensory and motor axonal excitability measures, including recovery cycle, threshold electrotonus, strength–duration time constant, and current–threshold relationship, did not show differences between participants with painful and painless diabetic polyneuropathy, and there were only minor changes for chemotherapy-induced polyneuropathy.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Axonal excitability did not significantly differ between painful and painless diabetic or chemotherapy-induced polyneuropathy in a multicenter observational study. Threshold tracking assesses the excitability of myelinated axons; the majority of nociceptors are unmyelinated, and although there is some overlap of the "channelome" between these axonal populations, our results suggest that alternative measures such as microneurography are required to understand the relationship between sensory neuron excitability and neuropathic pain.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The objective of this study was to assess the feasibility, acceptability, and benefits of a teleneurology clinic serving adults usually attending a neurology outpatient clinic in Lusaka, Zambia during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Televisits were offered to patients scheduled for neurology appointments between March and July 2020 using the telephone, WhatsApp video, or Zoom calls based on patient accessibility. Visit outcomes were documented, and patient and neurologist satisfaction surveys were completed.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Of 323 patients, 195 (60%) were reachable by telephone, 179 of these were alive, and 74% (133/179) of those alive agreed to a televisit. Stroke (30%), seizures (20%), and headache (16%) were the most common diagnoses seen via televisit. Most televisits (80%) were by telephone call, 14% by WhatsApp video call, and 6% by Zoom. Nearly one-third (30%) of the patients were stable and discharged from the clinic, 32% only required medication refills, and 19% required an in-person visit. Sixty patients (out of 85 reachable and 71% response rate) and 7 of 9 neurologists (78% response rate) completed satisfaction surveys. Neurologists reported greater assessment confidence with Zoom, but confidence was high for all modalities. Patients preferring televisits (75%, 45/60) noted reduced expense and time requirements, whereas those preferring in-person visits (22%, 13/60) cited the desire for physical examinations. Overall, 98% of patients and 100% of neurologists were satisfied with televisits.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Teleneurology visits were acceptable and feasible for adults attending an outpatient neurology clinic in Zambia and their neurologists. They offer a promising supplement to in-person visits in resource-limited settings, even when video-conference capabilities and electronic medical records are absent.

                <p>Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2 infection) can lead to intensive care unit (ICU) admission and critical illness myopathy (CIM). We examined 3 ICU patients with COVID-19 who required mechanical ventilation for pneumonia and developed CIM. Pathological examination of the skeletal muscle biopsies revealed myopathic changes consistent with CIM, variable inflammation with autophagic vacuoles, SARS-CoV immunostaining + fibers/granules, and electron microscopy findings of mitochondrial abnormalities and coronavirus-like particles. Although mitochondrial dysfunction with compromised energy production is a critical pathogenic mechanism of non-COVID-19-associated CIM, in our series of COVID-19-associated CIM, myopathic changes including prominent mitochondrial damage suggest a similar mechanism and association with direct SARS-CoV-2 muscle infection.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Maternal Epilepsy and Long‐term Offspring Mortality: A Nationwide Cohort Study</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>We examined how maternal epilepsy and use of antiseizure medications in pregnancy was associated with offspring mortality.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This population-based cohort study included all live- and stillborn singletons in Denmark between 1981 and 2016. We used nation-wide registers to retrieve information on pregnancy characteristics, epilepsy diagnoses, use of antiseizure medications, and mortality. Adjusted mortality rate ratios (MRR) were estimated using log-linear Poisson regression.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The cohort consisted of 1,862,474 children. In total, 12,026 live-born children died during follow-up, of whom 170 (1.4%) were offspring of mothers with epilepsy. Overall mortality was increased in offspring of mothers with epilepsy compared to offspring of mothers without epilepsy (MRR = 1.46, 95% CI: 1.23–1.71), driven by an excess mortality only in the first year of life. Mortality was increased for natural deaths (MRR = 1.50, 95% CI: 1.25–1.78) but not from unnatural deaths (MRR = 1.38, 95% CI: 0.84–2.14), and only in offspring of women with epilepsy who used antiseizure medications during pregnancy (MRR = 1.51, 95% CI: 1.00–2.17), but not in offspring of women with epilepsy who did not use antiseizure medications while pregnant (MRR = 0.97, 95% CI: 0.69–1.31). When analyses were restricted to children born from 2000 and onwards, the excess mortality that was observed in the first year of life among children of mothers with epilepsy, was no longer evident.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>During the 1981 to 1999 epoch, offspring of women with epilepsy were at increased risk of dying in the first year of life. However, this risk did not extend to children born after 2000. Future retrospective studies of the effects of maternal epilepsy on the health of the offspring should take this difference into account. ANN NEUROL 2022;91:455–465</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">RGMa Signal in Macrophages Induces Neutrophil‐Related Astrocytopathy in NMO</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Repulsive guidance molecule-a (RGMa) is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked glycoprotein which has multiple functions including axon growth inhibition and immune regulation. However, its role in the pathophysiology of neuromyelitis optica (NMO) is poorly understood. Perivascular astrocytopathy, which is induced by the leakage of aquaporin-4 (AQP4)-specific IgG into the central nervous system parenchyma, is a key feature of NMO pathology. We investigated the RGMa involvement in the pathology of NMO astrocytopathy, and tested a therapeutic potential of humanized anti-RGMa monoclonal antibody (RGMa-mAb).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Using a clinically relevant NMO rat model, we evaluated the therapeutic effect of a RGMa-mAb by behavioral testing, immunohistochemistry, and gene expression assay. We further performed in vitro experiments to address the RGMa-signaling in macrophages.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In both NMO rats and an NMO-autopsied sample, RGMa was expressed by the spared neurons and astrocytes, whereas its receptor neogenin was expressed by infiltrating macrophages. AQP4-IgG-induced astrocytopathy and clinical exacerbation in NMO rats were ameliorated by RGMa-mAb treatment. RGMa-mAb treatment significantly suppressed neutrophil infiltration, and decreased the expression of neutrophil chemoattractants. Interestingly, neogenin-expressing macrophages accumulated in the lesion expressed CXCL2, a strong neutrophil chemoattractant, and further analysis revealed that RGMa directly regulated CXCL2 expression in macrophages. Finally, we found that our NMO rats developed neuropathic pain, and RGMa-mAb treatment effectively ameliorated the severity of neuropathic pain.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>RGMa signaling in infiltrated macrophages is a critical driver of neutrophil-related astrocytopathy in NMO lesions, and RGMa-mAb may provide an efficient therapeutic strategy for NMO-associated neuropathic pain and motor deficits in patients with NMO.

                The fern <i>Ceratopteris richardii</i> has been studied as a model organism for over 50 years because it is easy to grow and has a short life cycle. In particular, as the first homosporous vascular plant for which genomic resources were developed, <i>C. richardii</i> has been an important system for studying plant evolution. However, we know relatively little about the natural history of <i>C. richardii</i>. In this article, we summarize what is known about this aspect of <i>C. richardii</i>, and discuss how learning more about its natural history could greatly increase our understanding of the evolution of land plants.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Ligand binding remodels protein side chain conformational heterogeneity</a></h4>

              
                While protein conformational heterogeneity plays an important role in many aspects of biological function, including ligand binding, its impact has been difficult to quantify. Macromolecular X-ray diffraction is commonly interpreted with a static structure, but it can provide information on both the anharmonic and harmonic contributions to conformational heterogeneity. Here, through multiconformer modeling of time- and space-averaged electron density, we measure conformational heterogeneity of 743 stringently matched pairs of crystallographic datasets that reflect unbound/apo and ligand-bound/holo states. When comparing the conformational heterogeneity of side chains, we observe that when binding site residues become more rigid upon ligand binding, distant residues tend to become more flexible, especially in non-solvent exposed regions. Among ligand properties, we observe increased protein flexibility as the number of hydrogen bonds decrease and relative hydrophobicity increases. Across a series of 13 inhibitor bound structures of CDK2, we find that conformational heterogeneity is correlated with inhibitor features and identify how conformational changes propagate differences in conformational heterogeneity away from the binding site. Collectively, our findings agree with models emerging from NMR studies suggesting that residual side chain entropy can modulate affinity and point to the need to integrate both static conformational changes and conformational heterogeneity in models of ligand binding.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Perceptual coupling and decoupling of the default mode network during mind-wandering and reading</a></h4>

              
                While reading, our mind can wander to unrelated autobiographical information, creating a perceptually decoupled state detrimental to narrative comprehension. To understand how this mind-wandering state emerges, we asked whether retrieving autobiographical content necessitates functional disengagement from visual input. In Experiment 1, brain activity was recorded using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in an experimental situation mimicking naturally occurring mind-wandering, allowing us to precisely delineate neural regions involved in memory and reading. Individuals read expository texts and ignored personally relevant autobiographical memories, as well as the opposite situation. Medial regions of the default mode network (DMN) were recruited during memory retrieval. In contrast, left temporal and lateral prefrontal regions of the DMN, as well as ventral visual cortex, were recruited when reading for comprehension. Experiment two used functional connectivity both at rest and during tasks to establish that (i) DMN regions linked to memory are more functionally decoupled from regions of ventral visual cortex than regions in the same network engaged when reading; and (ii) individuals with more self-generated mental contents and poorer comprehension, while reading in the lab, showed more decoupling between visually connected DMN sites important for reading and primary visual cortex. A similar pattern of connectivity was found in Experiment 1, with greater coupling between this DMN site and visual cortex when participants reported greater focus on reading in the face of conflict from autobiographical memory cues; moreover, the retrieval of personally relevant memories increased the decoupling of these sites. These converging data suggest we lose track of the narrative when our minds wander because generating autobiographical mental content relies on cortical regions within the DMN which are functionally decoupled from ventral visual regions engaged during reading.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Inhibiting USP16 rescues stem cell aging and memory in an Alzheimer's model</a></h4>

              
                Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease observed with aging that represents the most common form of dementia. To date, therapies targeting end-stage disease plaques, tangles, or inflammation have limited efficacy. Therefore, we set out to identify a potential earlier targetable phenotype. Utilizing a mouse model of AD and human fetal cells harboring mutant amyloid precursor protein, we show cell intrinsic neural precursor cell (NPC) dysfunction precedes widespread inflammation and amyloid plaque pathology, making it the earliest defect in the evolution of the disease. We demonstrate that reversing impaired NPC self-renewal <i>via</i> genetic reduction of USP16, a histone modifier and critical physiological antagonist of the Polycomb Repressor Complex 1, can prevent downstream cognitive defects and decrease astrogliosis<i> in vivo</i>. Reduction of USP16 led to decreased expression of senescence gene <i>Cdkn2a</i> and mitigated aberrant regulation of the BMP pathway, a previously unknown function of USP16. Thus, we reveal USP16 as a novel target in an AD model that can both ameliorate the NPC defect and rescue memory and learning through its regulation of both <i>Cdkn2a</i> and BMP signaling.'

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Structural insights into recognition of chemokine receptors by Staphylococcus aureus leukotoxins</a></h4>

              
                Staphylococcus aureus (SA) leukocidin LukED belongs to a family of bicomponent pore forming toxins that play important roles in SA immune evasion and nutrient acquisition. LukED targets specific G protein-coupled chemokine receptors to lyse human erythrocytes (red blood cells) and leukocytes (white blood cells). The first recognition step of receptors is critical for specific cell targeting and lysis. The structural and molecular bases for this mechanism are not well understood but could constitute essential information to guide antibiotic development. Here, we characterized the interaction of LukE with chemokine receptors ACKR1, CCR2 and CCR5 using a combination of structural, pharmacological and computational approaches. First, crystal structures of LukE in complex with a small molecule mimicking sulfotyrosine side chain (p-cresyl sulfate) and with peptides containing sulfotyrosines issued from receptor sequences revealed the location of receptor sulfotyrosine binding sites in the toxins. Then, by combining previous and novel experimental data with protein docking, classical and accelerated weight histogram (AWH) molecular dynamics we propose models of the ACKR1-LukE and CCR5-LukE complexes. This work provides novel insights into chemokine receptor recognition by leukotoxins and suggests that the conserved sulfotyrosine binding pocket could be a target of choice for future drug development.

                Intracellular protein gradients serve a variety of functions, such as the establishment of cell polarity or to provide positional information for gene expression in developing embryos. Given that cell size in a population can vary considerably, for the protein gradients to work properly they often have to be scaled to the size of the cell. Here we examine a model of protein gradient formation within a cell that relies on cytoplasmic diffusion and cortical transport of proteins toward a cell pole. We show that the shape of the protein gradient is determined solely by the cell geometry. Furthermore, we show that the length scale over which the protein concentration in the gradient varies is determined by the linear dimensions of the cell, independent of the diffusion constant or the transport speed. This gradient provides scale-invariant positional information within a cell, which can be used for assembly of intracellular structures whose size is scaled to the linear dimensions of the cell, such as the cytokinetic ring and actin cables in budding yeast cells.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Activity in perirhinal and entorhinal cortex predicts perceived visual similarities among category exemplars with highest precision</a></h4>

              
                Vision neuroscience has made great strides in understanding the hierarchical organization of object representations along the ventral visual stream (VVS). How VVS representations capture fine-grained visual similarities between objects that observers subjectively perceive has received limited examination so far. In the current study, we addressed this question by focusing on perceived visual similarities among subordinate exemplars of real world-categories. We hypothesized that these perceived similarities are reflected with highest fidelity in neural activity patterns downstream from inferotemporal regions, namely in perirhinal and anterolateral entorhinal cortex in the medial temporal-lobe. To address this issue with fMRI, we administered a modified 1-Back task that required discrimination between category exemplars as well as categorization. Further, we obtained observer-specific ratings of perceived visual similarities, which predicted behavioural performance during scanning. As anticipated, we found that activity patterns in perirhinal and anterolateral entorhinal cortex predicted the structure of perceived visual similarity relationships among category exemplars, including its observer-specific component, with higher precision than any other VVS region. Our findings provide new evidence that subjective aspects of object perception that rely on fine-grained visual differentiation are reflected with highest fidelity in the medial temporal lobe.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Nucleoporin107 mediates female sexual differentiation via Dsx</a></h4>

              
                We recently identified a missense mutation in Nucleoporin107 (Nup107; D447N) underlying XX-ovarian-dysgenesis, a rare disorder characterized by underdeveloped and dysfunctional ovaries. Modeling of the human mutation in <i>Drosophila</i> or specific knockdown of Nup107 in the gonadal soma resulted in ovarian-dysgenesis-like phenotypes. Transcriptomic analysis identified the somatic sex-determination gene <i>doublesex (dsx)</i> as a target of Nup107. Establishing Dsx as a primary relevant target of Nup107, either loss or gain of Dsx in the gonadal soma is sufficient to mimic or rescue the phenotypes induced by <i>Nup107</i> loss. Importantly, the aberrant phenotypes induced by compromising either <i>Nup107</i> or <i>dsx</i> are reminiscent of BMP signaling hyperactivation. Remarkably, in this context, the metalloprotease AdamTS-A, a transcriptional target of both Dsx and Nup107, is necessary for the calibration of BMP signaling. As modulation of BMP signaling is a conserved critical determinant of soma-germline interaction, the sex and tissue specific deployment of Dsx-F by Nup107 seems crucial for the maintenance of the homeostatic balance between the germ cells and somatic gonadal cells.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Modular, robust and extendible multicellular circuit design in yeast</a></h4>

              
                Division of labor between cells is ubiquitous in biology but the use of multi-cellular consortia for engineering applications is only beginning to be explored. A significant advantage of multi-cellular circuits is their potential to be modular with respect to composition but this claim has not yet been extensively tested using experiments and quantitative modeling. Here, we construct a library of 24 yeast strains capable of sending, receiving or responding to three molecular signals, characterize them experimentally and build quantitative models of their input-output relationships. We then compose these strains into two- and three-strain cascades as well as a four-strain bistable switch and show that experimentally measured consortia dynamics can be predicted from the models of the constituent parts. To further explore the achievable range of behaviors, we perform a fully automated computational search over all two-, three- and four-strain consortia to identify combinations that realize target behaviors including logic gates, band-pass filters and time pulses. Strain combinations that are predicted to map onto a target behavior are further computationally optimized and then experimentally tested. Experiments closely track computational predictions. The high reliability of these model descriptions further strengthens the feasibility and highlights the potential for distributed computing in synthetic biology.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Stage-specific control of oligodendrocyte survival and morphogenesis by TDP-43</a></h4>

              
                Generation of oligodendrocytes in the adult brain enables both adaptive changes in neural circuits and regeneration of myelin sheaths destroyed by injury, disease, and normal aging. This transformation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) into myelinating oligodendrocytes requires processing of distinct mRNAs at different stages of cell maturation. Although mislocalization and aggregation of the RNA binding protein, TDP-43, occur in both neurons and glia in neurodegenerative diseases, the consequences of TDP-43 loss within different stages of the oligodendrocyte lineage are not well understood. By performing stage-specific genetic inactivation of <i>Tardbp in vivo</i>, we show that oligodendrocyte lineage cells are differentially sensitive to loss of TDP-43. While OPCs depend on TDP-43 for survival, with conditional deletion resulting in cascading cell loss followed by rapid regeneration to restore their density, oligodendrocytes become less sensitive to TDP-43 depletion as they mature. Deletion of TDP-43 early in the maturation process led to eventual oligodendrocyte degeneration, seizures and premature lethality, while oligodendrocytes that experienced late deletion survived and mice exhibited a normal lifespan. At both stages, TDP-43 deficient oligodendrocytes formed fewer and thinner myelin sheaths and extended new processes that inappropriately wrapped neuronal somata and blood vessels. Transcriptional analysis revealed that in the absence of TDP-43, key proteins involved in oligodendrocyte maturation and myelination were misspliced, leading to aberrant incorporation of cryptic exons. Inducible deletion of TDP-43 from oligodendrocytes in the adult CNS induced the same progressive morphological changes and mice acquired profound hindlimb weakness, suggesting that loss of TDP-43 function in oligodendrocytes may contribute to neuronal dysfunction in neurodegenerative disease.

                Technologies for detecting cell-cell contacts are powerful tools for studying a wide range of biological processes, from neuronal signaling to cancer-immune interactions within the tumor microenvironment. Here, we report TRACC (Transcriptional Readout Activated by Cell-cell Contacts), a GPCR-based transcriptional recorder of cellular contacts, which converts contact events into stable transgene expression. TRACC is derived from our previous protein-protein interaction recorders, SPARK (Kim et al., 2017) and SPARK2 (Kim et al., 2019), reported in this journal. TRACC incorporates light gating via the light-oxygen-voltage-sensing (LOV) domain, which provides user-defined temporal control of tool activation and reduces background. We show that TRACC detects cell-cell contacts with high specificity and sensitivity in mammalian cell culture and that it can be used to interrogate interactions between neurons and glioma, a form of brain cancer.

                Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is characterized by nerve tumors called neurofibromas, in which Schwann cells (SCs) show deregulated RAS signaling. NF1 is also implicated in regulation of cAMP. We identified the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) P2RY14 in human neurofibromas, neurofibroma-derived SC precursors (SCPs), mature SCs and mouse SCPs. Mouse <i>Nf1-/-</i>SCP self-renewal was reduced by genetic or pharmacological inhibition of P2RY14. In a mouse model of NF1, genetic deletion of P2RY14 rescued low cAMP signaling, increased mouse survival, delayed neurofibroma initiation, and improved SC Remak bundles. P2RY14 signals via Gi to increase intracellular cAMP, implicating P2RY14 as a key upstream regulator of cAMP. We found that elevation of cAMP by either blocking the degradation of cAMP or by using a P2RY14 inhibitor diminished <i>NF1-/-</i>SCP self-renewal <i>in vitro</i> and neurofibroma SC proliferation in <i>in vivo</i>. These studies identifyP2RY14 as a critical regulator of SCP self-renewal, SC proliferation and neurofibroma initiation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Implicit versus explicit timing - separate or shared mechanisms?</a></h4>

              
                Time implicitly shapes cognition, but time is also explicitly represented, for instance in the form of durations. Parsimoniously, the brain could use the same mechanisms for implicit and explicit timing. Yet, the evidence has been equivocal, revealing both joint versus separate signatures of timing. Here, we directly compared implicit and explicit timing using magnetoencephalography, whose temporal resolution allows investigating the different stages of the timing processes. Implicit temporal predictability was induced in an auditory paradigm by a manipulation of the foreperiod. Participants received two consecutive task instructions: discriminate pitch (indirect measure of implicit timing) or duration (direct measure of explicit timing). The results show that the human brain efficiently extracts implicit temporal statistics of sensory environments, to enhance the behavioral and neural responses to auditory stimuli, but that those temporal predictions did not improve explicit timing. In both tasks, attentional orienting in time during predictive foreperiods was indexed by an increase in alpha power over visual and parietal areas. Furthermore, pre-target induced beta power in sensorimotor and parietal areas increased during implicit compared to explicit timing, in line with the suggested role for beta oscillations in temporal prediction. Interestingly, no distinct neural dynamics emerged when participants explicitly paid attention to time, compared to implicit timing. Our work thus indicates that implicit timing shapes the behavioral and sensory response in an automatic way, and is reflected in oscillatory neural dynamics, while the translation of implicit temporal statistics to explicit durations remains somewhat inconclusive, possibly due to the more abstract nature of this task.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Multisensory integration in neurons of the medial pulvinar of macaque monkey</a></h4>

              
                The pulvinar is a heterogeneous thalamic nucleus, which is well developed in primates. One of its subdivisions, the medial pulvinar, is connected to many cortical areas, including the visual, auditory and somatosensory cortices, as well as with multisensory areas and premotor areas. However, except for the visual modality, little is known about its sensory functions. A hypothesis is that, as a region of convergence of information from different sensory modalities, the medial pulvinar plays a role in multisensory integration. To test this hypothesis, two macaque monkeys were trained to a fixation task and the responses of single-units to visual, auditory and auditory-visual stimuli were examined. Analysis revealed auditory, visual and multisensory neurons in the medial pulvinar. It also revealed multisensory integration in this structure, mainly subadditive and suppressive. These findings show that the medial pulvinar is involved in multisensory integration.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Investigating the "two-hit hypothesis": effects of prenatal maternal immune activation and adolescent cannabis use on neurodevelopment in mice</a></h4>

              
                Background: Prenatal exposure to maternal immune activation (MIA) and chronic adolescent cannabis use are both risk factors for neuropsychiatric disorders. However, exposure to a single risk factor may not result in major mental illness, indicating that multiple exposures may be required for illness onset. Here, we examine whether combined exposure to prenatal MIA and adolescent delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the main psychoactive component of cannabis, lead to enduring neuroanatomical and behavioural changes in adulthood. Methods: Mice were prenatally exposed to viral mimetic, poly I:C (5mg/kg), or vehicle at gestational day (GD)9, and postnatally exposed to chronic THC (5mg/kg, intraperitoneal) or vehicle during adolescence (postnatal day [PND]28-45). Longitudinal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed pre-treatment, PND25, post-treatment, PND50, and in adulthood, PND85, followed by behavioural tests for anxiety-like, social, and sensorimotor gating. Post-mortem assessment of cannabinoid (CB)1 and 2 receptor expressing cells was performed in altered regions identified by MRI (anterior cingulate and somatosensory cortices, striatum, and hippocampus). Results: Subtle deviations in neurodevelopmental trajectory and subthreshold anxiety-like behaviours were observed in mice exposed to both risk factors. Sex-dependent effects were observed in patterns of shared brain-behaviour covariation, indicative of potential sex differences in response to MIA and THC. Density of CB1 and CB2 receptor positive cells was significantly decreased in all mice exposed to MIA, THC, or both. Conclusions: These findings suggest that there may be a cumulative effect of risk factor exposure on gross neuroanatomical development, and that the endocannabinoid system may be sensitive to both prenatal MIA, adolescent THC, or the combination.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Lipid Accumulation Induced by APOE4 Impairs Microglial Surveillance of Neuronal-Network Activity</a></h4>

              
                Apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4) is the greatest known genetic risk factor for developing late-onset Alzheimers disease and its expression in microglia is associated with pro-inflammatory states. How the interaction of APOE4 microglia with neurons differs from microglia expressing the disease-neutral allele APOE3 is currently unknown. Here, we employ CRISPR-edited induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) to dissect the impact of APOE4 in neuron-microglia communication. Our results reveal that APOE4 induces a distinct metabolic program in microglia that is marked by the accumulation of intracellular neutral lipid stores through impaired lipid catabolism. Importantly, this altered lipid-accumulated state shifts microglia away from homeostatic surveillance and renders APOE4 microglia weakly responsive to neuronal activity. By examining the transcriptional signatures of APOE3 versus APOE4 microglia before and after exposure to neuronal conditioned media, we further established that neuronal soluble cues differentially induce a lipogenic program in APOE4 microglia that exacerbates pro-inflammatory signals. Pharmacological blockade of lipogenesis in APOE4 microglia is sufficient to diminish intracellular lipid accumulation and restore microglial homeostasis. Remarkably, unlike APOE3 microglia that support neuronal network activity, co-culture of APOE4 microglia with neurons disrupts the coordinated activity of neuronal ensembles. We identified that through decreased uptake of extracellular fatty acids and lipoproteins, APOE4 microglia disrupts the net flux of lipids which results in decreased neuronal activity via the potentiation of the lipid-gated K+ channel, GIRK3. These findings suggest that neurological diseases that exhibit abnormal neuronal network-level disturbances may in part be triggered by impairment in lipid homeostasis in non-neuronal cells, underscoring a novel therapeutic route to restore circuit function in the diseased brain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Sleep Deprivation Induces Acute Dissociation via Altered EEG Rhythms Expression and Connectivity.</a></h4>

              
                The fragmented sleep, fragmented mind hypothesis has associated sleep disturbances and dissociative states in subjects with dissociative traits, as supported by neurophysiological theories of consciousness stating that altered states might result from an altered functional interaction among brain modules due to inefficient sleep processes. Irrespective of dissociative traits, it is conceivable that a labile sleep-wake cycle might fuel dissociative states such as derealization, depersonalization, and dissociative amnesia. To verify whether acute sleep loss can prompt dissociative states and to identify possible psychophysiological correlates, we evaluated dissociative experiences (by means of Phenomenology of Consciousness Inventory and Clinician Administered Dissociative State Scale) and resting state EEG features (band-wise spectral content and phase synchronization) after total sleep deprivation. After deprivation, participants reported increased perception of altered state of consciousness and dissociative experiences, and a decreased perception of cognitive control. Analyzing the psychophysiological correlates of dissociative states following deprivation, we observed the following results: the higher the prefrontal theta spectral content, the higher the depersonalization state and the lower the self-awareness; the higher the intensity of the dissociative experiences, the higher the synchronization increase in alpha, beta, and gamma bands; the higher the decrease of higher-order functions, the higher the synchronization in the aforementioned bands. Thus, acute sleep deprivation appears to fuel dissociative experiences by establishing a state of consciousness promoted by a higher large-scale synchronization at high frequencies.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Novel method for reliably measuring spontaneous postsynaptic potentials/currents in whole-cell patch clamp recordings in the central nervous system</a></h4>

              
                In chemical synapses of the central nervous system (CNS) an information unit is transmitted via the presynaptic release of a neurotransmitter vesicle, a quantum, eliciting a postsynaptic membrane electric response of a certain amplitude, a quantal size. This key determinant of neural computation has not been reliably measured due to the nature of synaptic communication and technical limitations of electrophysiological recordings in the CNS. Measuring amplitudes of spontaneous postsynaptic currents (sPSCs) or potentials (sPSPs) at the cell soma potentially offers a technically straight forward way to estimate the quantal size as these miniature responses (minis) are ellicited by the spontaneous release of a single neurotransmitter vesicle. However, somatically recorded minis are massively attenuated and, for the most part, are indistinguishable from background noise fluctuations. For them to be accurately estimated, a revised method would have to isolate the noise component. As the first step in devising such a method, we developed and described a novel sPSP/sPSC detection algorithm as part of our quantal analysis software called 'minis'. We tested the performance of the algorithm in detecting real and simulated minis in rat cortical slice whole-cell recordings and compared it to other most commonly used similar detection algorithms in the field of the synaptic function research. This benchmarking analysis revealed superior detection performance by our algorithm. The release version of the algorithm also offers great flexibility as it can be controlled through graphical and programming interfaces making it suitable for the needs of most individual researchers studying the central synapse function.

                In-vivo electrophysiology requires direct access to brain tissue, necessitating the development and refinement of surgical procedures and techniques that promote the health and well-being of the animal subjects. Here, we report a series of findings noted on structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans in monkeys with MRI-compatible implants following small craniotomies that provide access for intracranial electrophysiology. We found distinct brain regions exhibiting hyperintensities in T2-weighted scans that were prominent underneath the sites at which craniotomies had been performed. We interpreted these hyperintensities as edema of the neural tissue and found that they were predominantly present following electric drilling, but not when manual, hand-operated drills were used. Further, the anomalies subsided within 2-3 weeks following surgery. Our report highlights the utility of MRI-compatible implants that promote clinical examination of the animal's brain, sometimes revealing findings that may go unnoticed when incompatible implants are used. We show replicable differences in outcome when using electric vs. mechanical devices, both ubiquitous in the field. If electric drills are used, our report cautions electrophysiological recordings from tissue directly underneath the craniotomy for the first 2-3 weeks following the procedure due to putative edema.

                Cognitive functional neuroimaging has been around for over 30 years and has shed light on the brain areas relevant for reading. However, new methodological developments enable mapping the interaction between functional imaging and the underlying white matter networks. In this study, we used such a novel method, called the disconnectome, to decode the reading circuitry in the brain. We used the resulting disconnection patterns to predict the typical lesion that would lead to reading deficits after brain damage. Our results suggest that white matter connections critical for reading include fronto-parietal U-shaped fibres and the vertical occipital fasciculus (VOF). The lesion most predictive of a reading deficit would impinge on the left inferior parietal and the three temporal and occipital gyri. This novel framework can systematically be applied to bridge the gap between the neuropathology of language and cognitive neuroscience.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Task feedback suggests a post-perceptual locus of serial dependence</a></h4>

              
                Decisions across a range of perceptual tasks are known to be biased toward stimuli and choices from the past. So-called serial dependence is thought to be an adaptive low-level mechanism that promotes perceptual stability across visual inputs. However, recent studies suggest post-perceptual mechanisms may instead contribute to serially-biased responses, calling into question the locus of serial dependence and the nature of integration of past and present sensory inputs. Here, we uncover decisional contributions to serial dependence that account for the majority, if not all of the bias. We measured serial dependence in a 3D motion extrapolation task where uncertainty in the sensory information varied from trial to trial. Furthermore, visual and auditory response feedback were provided to a subset of participants on every trial. We found that responses were significantly more biased toward the previously reported motion direction rather than the previously presented direction, with larger biases on trials with greater uncertainty in the sensory input. Critically, response feedback was associated with an abolishment of bias toward the previously presented direction, and a significant reduction of bias toward the previously reported direction. These results provide clear evidence for a post-perceptual locus of serial dependence and support the role of serial dependence as a behavioral strategy to overcome sensory uncertainty.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A passive computational marker for individual differences in non-reinforced learning</a></h4>

              
                Although research about preference formation and modification has classically focused on the role of external reinforcements, there is also increasing evidence for a key role of non-externally reinforced cognitive mechanisms such as attention and memory in preference modification. In a novel paradigm for behavioral change called the Cue-Approach training (CAT) task, preferences are modified via the mere association of images of stimuli with a neutral cue and a rapid motor response, without external reinforcements. The procedure's efficacy has been replicated across dozens of studies, and the net behavioral change was linked with increased activity in a frontal value-based decision-making brain region during the post-training probe choice phase. However, the cognitive mechanisms during the training phase itself have not been elucidated. Based on the structure of the task alongside recent findings of the involvement of striatal and supplementary motor regions during training, we hypothesized that a motor-related learning process could be a prospective candidate. To test this hypothesis, we developed a computational model of the motor response pattern during training in a large corpus of data collected from 864 participants across 29 different CAT experiments. Using Bayesian modeling of the meta-analysis data, we developed a computational marker for individualized learning in the training task, which was found to be associated with the preference modification effect in the subsequent probe task, both at the participant-level as well as in the more granular individual-item level. Following the conclusions of the meta-analysis, in two additional experiments (a pilot study and a larger preregistered replication study) we aimed to affect learning efficacy by manipulating the training procedure difficulty. As hypothesized and preregistered, training difficulty was captured by the new computational marker identified on the previously collected samples. Manipulation of the training difficulty also resulted in a differential preference modification effect, suggesting a causal relationship between the motor learning captured by the computational model and the post-training behavioral change effect. Our work highlights a novel non-reinforced preference modification pathway, suggesting that attention and motor learning are linked to preference formation, and provides a computational framework to identify individualized training markers which could predict future behavioral change effects.

                Response time (RT) data collected from cognitive tasks are a cornerstone of psychology and neuroscience research, yet existing models of these data either make strong assumptions about the data generating process or are limited to modeling single trials. We introduce task-DyVA, a deep learning framework in which expressive dynamical systems are trained to reproduce sequences of RTs observed in data from individual human subjects. Models fitted to a large task-switching dataset captured subject-specific behavioral differences with high temporal precision, including task-switching costs. Through perturbation experiments and analyses of the models' latent dynamics, we find support for a rational account of switch costs in terms of a stability-flexibility tradeoff. Thus, our framework can be used to discover interpretable cognitive theories that explain how the brain dynamically gives rise to behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins uptake mediated by lipid raft ganglioside GM1 in human cerebrovascular cells</a></h4>

              
                SARS-CoV-2 and its spike protein (SP) interact with the endothelium but the roles of extracellular peptidase domain on angiotensin converting enzyme 2 receptors (ACE2) and ACE2 independent pathways (such as glycans) are not fully elucidated. In addition, for SARS-CoV-2 to enter the brain parenchyma from blood it has to cross several cell types, including the endothelium, pericytes and vascular smooth muscle. Since SARS-CoV-2 interacts with host cells via it SP at the entry point of it life cycle, we used fluorescently labelled SP (SP-555) (wild type and mutants) to model viral behaviour, in vitro, for these cell types (endothelial, pericytes and vascular smooth muscle) to explore pathways of viral entry into brain from blood. There was differential SP uptake by these cell types. The endothelial cells had the least uptake, which may limit SP uptake into brain from blood. Uptake was mediated by ACE2, but it was dependent on SP interaction with ganglioside GM1 in the lipid raft. Mutation sites, N501Yand E484K and D614G, as seen in variants of interest, were differentially taken up by these cell types. There was greater uptake but neutralization with anti-ACE2 and anti-GM1antibodies was less effective. Our data suggested that GM1/lipid raft is an important entry point of SARS-CoV-2 into these cells since inhibition of SP uptake with both anti-ACE2 and anti-GM1 together was similar to that with only anti-GM1, and both ACE2 and GM1 are within the lipid raft region of plasma membrane. Thus, GM1 is a potential SARS-CoV-2 and therapeutic target at the cerebrovasculature.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Long-distance axon growth ability of corticospinal neurons is lost in a segmentally-distinct manner.</a></h4>

              
                The neonatal central nervous system (CNS) in mammals is known to support greater regeneration than the adult CNS. Established models of neonatal CNS injuries cause significant disruption to the microenvironments needed for axon growth and guidance. This limits their ability to investigate long-distance axon growth ability. We established a novel microsurgical approach to transect developing corticospinal neuron (CSN) axons, without producing an overt spinal lesion and investigated long-distance growth ability of the developing corticospinal tract (CST) in neonatal mice. We identified, rather surprisingly, that this ability is not equivalently lost at distinct spinal levels. At postnatal day 4 (P4), while this ability is robustly maintained at thoracic T11, it is completely abolished at cervical C2. We further identify that thoraco-lumbar-projecting CSN lose growth ability at cervical C2 even while extending axons to thoraco-lumbar segments. Further, long-distance regrowth is possible even when CSN axons are displaced from their normal location in the dorsal funiculus to the dorsolateral funiculus, where only a minority of the CST normally traverses. The differential loss of long-distance growth at distinct spinal levels does not appear to be due to segmental differences in astrocytic or microglial activation. Our results suggest that the initial control over long-distance axon growth is differentially governed across the length of an axon by context-specific mechanisms.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Target-agnostic discovery of Rett Syndrome therapeutics by coupling computational network analysis and CRISPR-enabled in vivo disease modeling</a></h4>

              
                It is difficult to develop effective treatments for neurodevelopmental genetic disorders, such as Rett syndrome, which are caused by a single gene mutation but trigger changes in numerous other genes, and thereby also severely impair functions of organs beyond the central nervous system (CNS). This challenge is further complicated by the lack of sufficiently broad and biologically relevant drug screens, and the inherent complexity in identifying clinically relevant targets responsible for diverse phenotypes. Here, we combined human gene regulatory network-based computational drug prediction with in vivo screening in a population-level diversity, CRISPR-edited, Xenopus laevis tadpole model of Rett syndrome to carry out target-agnostic drug discovery, which rapidly led to the identification of the FDA-approved drug vorinostat as a potential repurposing candidate. Vorinostat broadly improved both CNS and non-CNS (e.g., gastrointestinal, respiratory, inflammatory) abnormalities in a pre-clinical mouse model of Rett syndrome. This is the first Rett syndrome treatment to demonstrate pre-clinical efficacy across multiple organ systems when dosed after the onset of symptoms, and network analysis revealed a putative therapeutic mechanism for its cross-organ normalizing effects based on its impact on acetylation metabolism and post-translational modifications of microtubules.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Unsupervised approach to decomposing neural tuning variability</a></h4>

              
                Neural representation is often described by the tuning curves of individual neurons with respect to certain stimulus variables. Despite this tradition, it has become increasingly clear that neural tuning can vary substantially in accordance with a collection of internal and external factors. A challenge we are facing is the lack of appropriate methods to accurately capture trial-to-trial tuning variability directly from the noisy neural responses. Here we introduce an unsupervised statistical approach, Poisson functional principal component analysis (PfPCA), which identifies different sources of systematic tuning fluctuations, moreover encompassing several current models (e.g.,multiplicative gain models) as special cases. Applying this method to neural data recorded from macaque primary visual cortex, a paradigmatic case for which the tuning curve approach has been scientific essential, we discovered a novel simple relationship governing the variability of orientation tuning, which unifies different types of gain changes proposed previously. By decomposing the neural tuning variability into interpretable components, our method enables discovery of new structure of the neural code, capturing the influence of the stimulus drive and internal states simultaneously.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The effect of type and context of sensorimotor information on corticospinal excitability</a></h4>

              
                During skilled hand-object interactions, the human sensorimotor system generates predictive motor commands based on visual information and sensorimotor memories established from previous experience. Here we investigated whether predictive force scaling could be adapted to context-dependent information that is not always explicitly available. We probed the effect of motor prediction mechanisms on corticospinal excitability (CSE) with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). In experiment 1, participants performed a continuous force tracking task by squeezing a manipulandum. We varied the type of visual information for predicting motor output by displaying either the actual target force curve participants had to match (sinusoidal curve condition) or the visual error between the required and exerted force (horizontal line condition). CSE was modulated by the rate of change of forces (speed) in both conditions. Force direction changes further modulated CSE but in the sinusoidal curve condition only. These findings indicate that the corticospinal output mainly reflects the ongoing motor command, but can also be modulated by less explicit contextual information. In experiment 2, we tested whether participants could accurately predict the required force scaling in a standard random weight object lifting task, which also included series of small weight increments. Results showed that participants were unable to generate accurate force predictions by extrapolating weight from the implicit series, which failed to modulate CSE, unsurprisingly. Altogether, these findings suggest that corticospinal output is modulated based on context-dependent information when mediated by explicit visual cues, but not when sensorimotor cues are presented in an implicit manner.

                The neural substrates for processing classical rewards such as food or drugs of abuse are well-understood. In contrast, the mechanisms by which organisms perceive social contact as rewarding and subsequently modify their interactions are unclear. Here we tracked the gradual emergence of a repetitive and highly-stereotyped parental behavior and show that trial-by-trial performance correlates with the history of midbrain dopamine (DA) neuron activity. We used a novel behavior paradigm to manipulate the subject's expectation of imminent pup contact and show that DA signals conform to reward prediction error, a fundamental component of reinforcement learning (RL). Finally, closed-loop optogenetic inactivation of DA neurons at the onset of pup contact dramatically slowed emergence of parental care. We conclude that this prosocial behavior is shaped by an RL mechanism in which social contact itself is the primary reward.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Mapping the Neural Dynamics of Locomotion across the Drosophila Brain</a></h4>

              
                Locomotion engages widely distributed networks of neurons. However, the spatial architecture and temporal dynamics of the networks that underpin walking, a fundamental mode of locomotion, have not been described at brain-wide scale in any animal. We use volumetric two-photon imaging to map neural activity associated with walking across the entire brain of Drosophila. We define spatially clustered neural signals selectively associated with changes in either forward or angular velocity, revealing distinct topographic maps in diverse brain regions involved in navigation, memory, sensory processing, and motor control. We discover temporal trajectories of neural activity that sweep across these maps as behavior is performed, representing the sequential engagement of clusters with different behavioral selectivity. These motor maps suggest a dynamical systems framework for constructing walking maneuvers reminiscent of models of forelimb reaching in primates and set a foundation for understanding how local circuits interact within large-scale networks.

	<p>Although allophonic speech processing has been hypothesized to be a contributing factor in developmental dyslexia, experimental evidence is limited and inconsistent. The current study compared the categorization of native similar sounding vowels of typically developing (TD) children and children at familial risk (FR) of dyslexia. EEG response was collected in a non-attentive passive oddball paradigm from 35 TD and 35 FR Dutch 20-month-old infants who were matched on vocabulary. The children were presented with two nonwords &amp;amp;ldquo;giep&amp;amp;rdquo; [&amp;amp;#611;ip] and &amp;amp;ldquo;gip&amp;amp;rdquo; [&amp;amp;#611;Ip] that contrasted solely with respect to the vowel. In the multiple-speaker condition, both nonwords were produced by twelve different speakers while in the single-speaker condition, single tokens of each word were used as stimuli. For both conditions and for both groups, infant positive mismatch response (p-MMR) was elicited, and the p-MMR amplitude was comparable between the two groups, although the FR children had a later p-MMR peak than the TD children in the multiple-speaker condition. These findings indicate that FR children are able to categorize speech sounds, but that they may do so in a more effortful way than TDs.</p>

	<p>The self is one of the most important concepts in psychology, which is of great significance for human survival and development. As an important self-related stimulus, the subject&amp;amp;rsquo;s own name (SON) shows great advantages in cognitive and social processing and is widely used as an oddball stimulus in previous studies. However, it remained unknown whether the multiple repetition of stimulus would have similar influence on the neural response to SON and the other names under equal probability. In this study, adopting EEG and an equal&amp;amp;ndash;probability paradigm, we first detected the SON-related ERP components which could differentiate SON from other names, and then investigated how these components are influenced by repeated exposure of the stimulus. Our results showed that SON evoked an earlier SON-related negativity (SRN) at the fronto-central region and a late positive potential (LPP) at the centro-parietal region. More intriguingly, the earlier SRN demonstrated reduction after multiple repetitions, whereas LPP did not exhibit significant changes. In conclusion, these findings revealed that multiple repetitions of the stimulus might influence the various temporal stages in SON-related processing and highlighted the robustness of the late stage in this processing.</p>

	<p>The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of metacognitive training (MCT) on improving the neurocognitive function of Chinese patients with schizophrenia. One hundred inpatients with schizophrenia were selected by regional group randomization and divided into the control (treated as usual, TAU) group (n = 50) and the TAU + MCT group (n = 50). In this study, a 10-module MCT was used and the intervention process lasted 30 days. Cognitive function was assessed blindly using the Repeatable Battery of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) scale at baseline, 24 h post-treatment, and 12 weeks&amp;amp;rsquo; post-treatment. The differences between the total RBANS score and baseline (pre-test) for the post-test and 12-week-follow-up tests were used as the primary outcome, and the difference between the RBANS dimension scores and baseline (pre-test) were used as a secondary outcome in this study. The completion rate at follow-up was high in the TAU + MCT group (94%). Intention-to-treat analysis and per-protocol analysis showed a significant increase in total neurocognitive function scores and three-dimensional scores (delayed memory, visual breadth, and attention) in the TAU + MCT group immediately after the intervention and at the 12-week follow-up compared with baseline. This study provides support for the efficacy of 10 module MCT concerning neurocognition.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A deep learning classification task for accurate brain navigation during functional ultrasound imaging</a></h4>

              
                Functional ultrasound imaging is a breakthrough technology for imaging brain activity at high spatiotemporal resolution. As it monitors hemodynamic activity, the resulting images are a non-standard representation of local anatomy. This leads to difficulties when determining the exact anatomical location of the recorded image, which is necessary for correctly interpreting the data. Here we propose a convolutional neural network-based framework for accurately navigating the brain during functional ultrasound imaging solely based on vascular landmarks. Our approach uses an image classification task to identify a suitable set of reference positions, from which the anatomical position of an image can be inferred with a precision of 102 {+/-} 98 m. Further analysis revealed that the predictions are driven by deep brain areas. The robustness of our approach was validated using an ischemic stroke model. It confirms that functional ultrasound imaging information is sufficient for positioning even when local blood flow is disrupted, as observed in many brain pathologies.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Structural connectivity gradient associated with a dichotomy reveals the topographic organization of the macaque insular cortex</a></h4>

              
                Histology studies revealed that the macaque insular cortex was characterized by the gradual organizations containing agranular, dysgranular and granular insula. However, no consensus has been reached on the elaborate subdivisions of macaque insula. Until now, no neuroimaging study to our knowledge combining connectivity-based gradients and parcellation has been performed to investigate the topographic organization of the macaque insular cortex. In this study, we used high-resolution ex vivo diffusion-weighted imaging data to explore the macaque insular cortex's global gradient organization and subdivisions. We found a rostrocaudal organization of the dominant gradient in the macaque insula using a diffusion map embedding. Meanwhile, extracting the 25% top and bottom components from the dominant and second gradient, which explained variance over 60% in total within ten gradients, the connectivity-based parcellation method was performed to subdivide each component into two subregions confirmed by the cross-validation analysis. Furthermore, permutations tests identified that two subregions from each component showed significant differences between their connectivity fingerprints. Finally, we found that the dominant and second gradients were significantly correlated with the T1w/T2w and cortical thickness maps in the macaque insula. Taken together, the global gradients combining the subdivisions examined the topographic organization of the macaque insular cortex based on the structural connectivity, which may contribute to a better understanding of the intricate insular cortex anatomy.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Shared and distinct brain regions targeted for immediate early gene expression by ketamine and psilocybin</a></h4>

              
                Background: Psilocybin is a psychedelic with therapeutic potential. While there is growing evidence that psilocybin exerts its beneficial effects through enhancing neural plasticity, the exact brain regions involved are not completely understood. Determining the impact of psilocybin on plasticity-related gene expression throughout the brain can broaden our understanding of the neural circuits involved in psychedelic-evoked neural plasticity. Methods: Whole-brain serial two-photon microscopy and light sheet microscopy were employed to map the expression of the immediate early gene, c-Fos, in male and female mice. The drug-induced c-Fos expression following psilocybin administration was compared to that of subanesthetic ketamine and saline control. To gain insights into the contributions of receptors and cell types, the c-Fos expression maps were related to brain-wide in situ hybridization data. Results: Psilocybin and ketamine produced acutely comparable elevations in c-Fos expression in numerous brain regions, including anterior cingulate cortex, locus coeruleus, primary visual cortex, central and basolateral amygdala, and claustrum. Select regions exhibited drug-preferential differences, such as dorsal raphe, lateral habenula, and insular cortex for psilocybin and retrosplenial cortex for ketamine. Correlation of psilocybin's effects with gene expression highlighted potential roles of 5-HT2A and GluN2B subunit of NMDA receptors. Conclusions: The systematic mapping approach produced an unbiased list of brain regions impacted by psilocybin and ketamine. The data are a valuable resource that highlights previously underappreciated regions for future investigations. By identifying regions with similar and disparate effects, the results provide insights into how psilocybin and ketamine may produce their rapid-acting and long-lasting therapeutic effects.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Investigating the temporal pattern of neuroimaging-based brain age estimation as a biomarker for Alzheimer's Disease related neurodegeneration</a></h4>

              
                Background: The difference between one's estimated brain age and chronological age, the brain age gap (BAG), has been proposed as an Alzheimer's Disease (AD) biomarker. However, most past studies on the BAG have been cross-sectional. As AD-related neurodegeneration precedes clinical diagnosis, a longitudinal understanding of the BAG's temporal pattern is required to validate its use as an AD biomarker. Objective: This study investigated how the BAG's trajectory varies by subject characteristics using data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. Methods: Brain age was estimated using a support vector regression model trained with multimodal features of cortical thickness via magnetic resonance imaging, and standardized uptake value ratios via fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography data. Using multilevel modeling, the temporal pattern of the BAG was examined between participants given characteristics including clinical outcome, gender, and APOEe4 carriership. Results: Performance of the brain age prediction model was comparable to past studies (mean absolute error = 3.71 years). The BAG was observed to have a linear increasing trajectory across the 8-year period. Additionally, the BAG of individuals with progressive mild cognitive impairment increased at a significantly faster rate across time compared to stable groups, where this effect was stronger in female patients. This accelerated BAG trajectory was not moderated by AD diagnosis time. Conclusion: Our observations strengthen support for the BAG as a potential biomarker of AD by prioritizing a longitudinal design and interpretation, as opposed to previously reported cross-sectional evidence.

                Magnetic brain stimulation is a promising treatment for neurological and psychiatric disorders. However, a better understanding of its effects at the individual neuron level is essential to improve its clinical application. We combined focal low-intensity repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (LI-rTMS) to the rat somatosensory cortex with intracellular recordings of subjacent pyramidal neurons in vivo. Continuous 10 Hz LI-rTMS reliably evoked neuronal firing at 4-5 Hz during the stimulation period, and induced durable attenuation of synaptic activity and spontaneous firing in cortical neurons, through membrane hyperpolarization and a reduced intrinsic excitability. However, inducing firing in individual neurons by repeated intracellular current injection did not reproduce LI-rTMS effects on neuronal properties. These data provide novel understanding of mechanisms underlying magnetic brain stimulation showing that, in addition to inducing biochemical plasticity, even weak magnetic fields can activate neurons and enduringly modulate their excitability.

                Transcranial focused ultrasound (tFUS) is a neuromodulation technique which has been the focus of increasing interest for noninvasive brain stimulation with high spatial specificity. Its ability to excite and inhibit neural circuits as well as to modulate perception and behavior has been demonstrated, however, we currently lack understanding of how tFUS modulates the ways neurons interact with each other. This understanding would help explain tFUS's mechanism of high-level neuromodulation and allow future development of therapies for neurological disorders. In this study we investigate how tFUS modulates neural interaction and response to peripheral electrical limb stimulation through intracranial multi-electrode recordings in the rat somatosensory cortex. We deliver ultrasound in a pulsed pattern to attempt to induce frequency dependent plasticity in a manner similar to that found following electrical stimulation. We show that neural firing in response to peripheral electrical stimulation is increased after ultrasound stimulation at all frequencies, showing tFUS induced excitation in individual neurons in vivo. We demonstrate tFUS frequency dependent pairwise correlation changes between neurons, with both potentiation and depression observed at different frequencies. These results extend previous research showing tFUS to be capable of inducing synaptic depression and demonstrate its ability to modulate network dynamics as a whole.

                In young adults, pairing a taxing cognitive task with walking can have different effects on gait and cognitive task performance. In some cases, performance clearly declines whereas in others compensatory mechanisms maintain performance even under dual-task conditions. This study set out to investigate the preliminary finding of behavioral improvement in Go-NoGo response inhibition task performance during walking compared to sitting, which was observed at the piloting stage. Mobile Brain/Body Imaging (MoBI) was used to record electroencephalographic (EEG) activity, three-dimensional (3D) gait kinematics and behavioral responses in the cognitive task, during sitting or walking on a treadmill. In a cohort of twenty-six (26) young adults, fourteen (14) participants improved in measures of cognitive task performance while walking compared to sitting. These participants exhibited walking-related EEG amplitude reductions over frontal brain scalp regions during key stages of inhibitory control (conflict monitoring, control implementation and pre-motor stages), accompanied by reduced stride-to-stride variability and faster responses to stimuli compared to those who did not improve. In contrast, the twelve (12) participants who did not improve exhibited no EEG amplitude differences across physical condition. The neural activity changes associated with performance improvement during dual tasking hold promise as cognitive flexibility markers that can potentially help assess cognitive decline in aging and neurodegeneration.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Lack of a key stage of hyper-connectivity between deep and superficial layers during barrel cortex development in a rat model of Absence Epilepsy</a></h4>

              
                The development of cortical neuronal wiring is precisely orchestrated and goes through several stages, some of which coincide with critical periods when sensory experience is most influential. In particular, even if ascending excitatory and inhibitory projections from the deep layer 5 to upper layers (1 to 4) are first strong, they recede by the end of the critical period of their targets cells located in upper layers. Although alterations in these transient innervations were shown to impair the construction of the later circuits that will persist into adulthood, it is unknown whether they could lead to pathologies. Here, we address this question in a genetic model of Absence Epilepsy, a neuro-developmental disease, where epileptogenesis occurs during the postnatal maturation of barrel cortex, the seizure initiation site. Using functional mapping by laser scanning photostimulation with glutamate uncaging in slices, we investigated the pattern of projections onto layers 2/3 pyramidal cells from 2-week old rats and found that its maturation skipped the key stage during which pyramidal cells received strong projections from both excitatory and inhibitory neurons located in deeper layers. At the same age, neuron activity recorded in vivo with two-photon functional imaging was organized in fewer clusters than expected during this transient hyper-innervation. Later, around the onset of typical absence seizures (~1 month old), over-excitability of cells was observed across layers. Using this genetic model of childhood epilepsy, we provide first evidence that failure to develop this transient hyper-innervation from deep cortical layers plays a role in pathological neural dysfunctions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cannabinoids regulate an insula circuit controlling water intake</a></h4>

              
                The insular cortex, or insula, is a large brain region involved in the detection of thirst and the control of water intake. However our understanding of the topographical, circuit and molecular mechanisms the controlling water intake within the insula remains parcellated. We found that type-1 cannabinoid receptors (CB1) within the insular cortex participate to the regulation of water intake, and deconstructed circuit mechanisms of this control. Topographically, we revealed that the activity of excitatory neurons in both anterior (aIC) and posterior (pIC) insula increases in response to water intake, yet removal of CB1 receptors only in the pIC decreases water intake. Interestingly, we found that CB1 receptors are highly expressed in insula projections to the basolateral amygdala (BLA), while undetectable in the neighboring central part of the amygdala. Thus, we imaged the neurons of the anterior or posterior insula targeting the BLA (aIC BLA and pIC-BLA), and found they oppositely respond to water intake, respectively decreasing and increasing their activity upon water drinking. Consistently, chemogenetic activation of pIC-BLA neurons decreased water intake. Finally, we uncovered CB1-dependent short term synaptic plasticity (depolarization-induced suppression of excitation, DSE) selectively in pIC-BLA, compared to aIC-BLA synapses. Altogether, our results support a model where CB1 signaling in the pIC-BLA pathway exerts a positive control on water intake.

                Exercise training is one of the most effective ways of preventing dementia. In this study, we focus on exercise training using a dart game called Wellness Darts. Previous studies have shown that Wellness Darts is effective in preventing dementia through cognitive memory testing. However, the effects of continual Wellness Dart training on brain function are unclear. The purpose of this study was to elucidate the effects of sustained Wellness Darts practice on brain function in older adults. Here, we cross-sectionally compared the brain activity patterns between an expert older group who practiced darts continually against control groups of a non-expert older group and a younger group who had no experience with darts. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) was used to measure brain activity, and their patterns were quantified by lateralization index (LI). The results showed that the younger group and the expert older group had significantly higher LI values than the non-expert older group and that these values did not differ between the expert older and younger groups. In addition, the accuracy of the dart-throwing test in the expert older group was positively correlated with the LI value. These results suggest that the Wellness Dart promotes hemispheric lateralization and has potential as exercise training in the prevention of dementia.

                Enteroendocrine cells are specialized sensory cells of the gut-brain axis that are sparsely distributed along the intestinal epithelium. The functions of enteroendocrine cells have classically been inferred by the gut hormones they release. However, individual enteroendocrine cells typically produce multiple, sometimes apparently opposing, gut hormones in combination, and some gut hormones are also produced elsewhere in the body. Here, we developed approaches involving intersectional genetics to enable selective access to enteroendocrine cells in vivo. We constructed Villin1-p2a-FlpO knock-in mice to restrict reporter expression to intestinal epithelium and through combined use of Cre and Flp alleles, effectively targeted major transcriptome-defined enteroendocrine cell lineages that produce serotonin, glucagon-like peptide 1, cholecystokinin, somatostatin, or glucose insulinotropic peptide. Chemogenetic activation of different enteroendocrine cell types variably impacted feeding behavior, nausea-associated behaviors (conditioned flavor avoidance), and gut motility. Defining the physiological roles of different enteroendocrine cell types provides an essential framework for understanding sensory biology of the intestine.

                In the natural environment, we often form stable perceptual experiences from ambiguous and fleeting sensory inputs. Which neural activity underlies the content of perception and which neural activity supports perceptual stability remains an open question. We used a bistable perception paradigm involving ambiguous images to behaviorally dissociate perceptual content from perceptual stability, and magnetoencephalography (MEG) to measure whole-brain neural dynamics in humans. Combining multivariate decoding and neural state-space analyses, we found frequency band-specific neural signatures that underlie the content of perception and promote perceptual stability, respectively. Across different types of images, non-oscillatory neural activity in the slow cortical potential (SCP, <5 Hz) range supported the content of perception. By contrast, perceptual stability is influenced by the amplitude of alpha and beta oscillations. In addition, neural activity underlying perceptual memory, which supports perceptual stability when sensory input is temporally removed from view, also encodes elapsed time. Together, these results reveal distinct neural mechanisms that support the content vs. stability of visual perception.

                In immersive Virtual Reality (VR), users can experience the subjective feeling of embodiment for the avatar representing them in a virtual world. This is known to be strongly supported by a high Sense of Agency (SoA) for the movements of the avatar that follows the user. In general, users do not self-attribute actions of their avatar that are different from the one they actually performed. The situation is less clear when actions of the avatar satisfies the intention of the user despite distortions and noticeable differences between user and avatar movements. A within-subject experiment was here conducted to determine whether a finger swap helping users achieve a task would be more tolerated than one penalizing them. In particular, in a context of fast-paced finger movements and with clear correct or incorrect responses, we swapped the finger animation of the avatar (e.g. user moves the index finger, the avatar moves the middle one) to either automatically correct for spontaneous mistakes or to introduce incorrect responses. Subjects playing a VR game were asked to report when they noticed the introduction of a finger swap. Results based on 3256 trials ([~]24% of swaps noticed) show that swaps helping users have significantly fewer odds of being noticed (and with higher confidence) than the ones penalizing users. This demonstrates how the context and the intention for motor action are important factors for the SoA and for  embodiment, opening new perspectives on how to design and study interactions in immersive VR.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Persistent postnatal migration of interneurons into the human entorhinal cortex</a></h4>

              
                The entorhinal cortex (EC) is a highly-interconnected hub for multisensory integration and memory processing1-3, containing diverse neuronal subtypes4,5 including subpopulations that are uniquely spatially-tuned6,7. Although many spatial and memory functions develop in infancy, it is considered that neurogenesis and neuronal migration to the EC occurs prenatally. Here we show that the postnatal human temporal lobe contains a prominent stream with large chains of young migrating neurons and many individual neurons breaking away directed into the EC. The EC stream forms between the second and third trimesters of prenatal development when the lateral ventricle walls in the temporal lobe collapse, displacing the subventricular zone (SVZ) and dividing radial glia. At birth, the EC stream follows a path of radial glial fibers in the site of the collapsed ventricle. Migratory chains persist up to 11 months postnatally; however, many individually migrating young neurons can still be detected in the EC at 2 years of age and a few isolated cells at 3 years of age. Within the EC at birth, immature neurons are a mixed population expressing markers of the medial ganglionic eminence (MGE) and caudal ganglionic eminence (CGE), but postnatally rapidly become primarily CGE-derived. Using single-nuclei RNAseq we identified these lineages and found that the MGE-derived neurons matured at earlier postnatal ages compared to those derived from the CGE. The CGE interneurons arriving and maturing the latest included subtypes expressing calretinin (CR), reelin (RELN), and vasoactive intestinal protein (VIP) many of which settle in layer II of the entorhinal cortex. This study reveals that the human EC is still being constructed during the first years of life revealing the largest known postnatal stream of migratory neurons in humans. The protracted postnatal arrival of a diverse population of interneurons could contribute to plasticity8,9 and proper excitation-inhibition balance10,11 within these highly connected brain circuits.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A new method and tool for volumetric estimation of brain structures after serial sectioning.</a></h4>

              
                Volume estimations are crucial for many neuroscience studies, allowing the evaluation of changes in the size of brain areas that may have relevant functional consequences. Classical histological methods and modern human brain imaging techniques rely on obtaining physical or digital sections, with a known thickness, of the organ to be analyzed. This "slicing" strategy is associated with an ineludible loss of information about the three-dimensional organization of the analyzed structures, especially affecting the precision of volumetric measurements. To overcome this problem, several methods have been developed. One of the most commonly used approaches for volume estimation is the classical Cavalieri's method. Within this book chapter, we provide first an overview of Cavalieri's method and propose a new one, named the Truncated Cone Shape method, for the estimation of volumes from tissue sections. Second, we compare the accuracy of both methods using computer-generated objects of different shapes and sizes. We conclude that, more frequently, the TCS method provides a better estimate of real volumes than Cavalieri's method. And third, we describe a protocol to estimate volumes using a self-developed and freely available tool for ImageJ: VolumestJ. This new tool helps to implement both Cavalieri's and TCS methods using digital images of tissue sections. We consider that VolumestJ will facilitate the labor of researchers interested in volume estimations.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">ASD modelling in organoids reveals imbalance of excitatory cortical neuron subtypes during early neurogenesis</a></h4>

              
                There is no clear genetic etiology or convergent pathophysiology for autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Using induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived brain organoids and single-cell transcriptomics, we modeled alterations in the formation of the forebrain between sons with ASD and their unaffected fathers in ten families. Relative to fathers, probands with macrocephaly presented an increase in dorsal cortical plate excitatory neurons (EN-DCP) to the detriment of preplate lineages, whereas normocephalic ASD probands presented an opposite decrease in EN-DCP-related gene expression. Both cohorts converged in a dysregulation of outer radial glia genes related to translation. In macrocephalic probands, an increase in progenitor self-renewal genes ID1/ID3 was coupled to a larger pool of cortical progenitors. Furthermore, changes in ID1/ID3 expression were best predictors of ASD clinical severity. We suggest that head circumference reveals a fundamental difference in etiological mechanisms of ASD rooted in alterations in progenitor fate and unbalanced excitatory cortical neuron diversity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Multifaceted Atlases of the Human Brain in its Infancy</a></h4>

              
                Brain atlases agglomerate structural and functional features of a population of individuals in a standard coordinate space. Here, we introduce for the first time a collection of atlases that charts postnatal development of the human brain in a spatio-temporally dense manner from two weeks to two years of age. Atlases capturing month-to-month changes of the human brain are essentially nonexistent for the first two years of life --- the critical developmental period during which the brain is evolving in virtually all facets at an exponential pace. This unmet need is compounded by the lack of atlases that provide a unified and holistic picture of the brain from both the perspectives of cortical surface convolutions and tissue volumetric characteristics. Existing surface and volumetric atlases are typically constructed independently in different coordinate spaces, causing discrepancies and complications in multifaceted analyses. Our month-specific conjoint surface and volumetric atlases chart normative patterns and capture key traits of early brain development and are therefore critical for identifying aberrations from normal developmental trajectories. Our atlases represent a major advance toward providing the neuroscience community an invaluable resource to facilitate the understanding of early structural and functional development by mapping multiple measurements of infant brains in a common reference frame for precise spatio-temporal quantification of cortical and subcortical changes.

	<p>Music&amp;amp;rsquo;s deeply interpersonal nature suggests that music-derived neuroplasticity relates to interpersonal temporal dynamics, or synchrony. Interpersonal neural synchrony (INS) has been found to correlate with increased behavioral synchrony during social interactions and may represent mechanisms that support them. As social interactions often do not have clearly delineated boundaries, and many start and stop intermittently, we hypothesize that a neural signature of INS may be detectable following an interaction. The present study aimed to investigate this hypothesis using a pre-post paradigm, measuring interbrain phase coherence before and after a cooperative dyadic musical interaction. Ten dyads underwent synchronous electroencephalographic (EEG) recording during silent, non-interactive periods before and after a musical interaction in the form of a cooperative tapping game. Significant post-interaction increases in delta band INS were found in the post-condition and were positively correlated with the duration of the preceding interaction. These findings suggest a mechanism by which social interaction may be efficiently continued after interruption and hold the potential for measuring neuroplastic adaption in longitudinal studies. These findings also support the idea that INS during social interaction represents active mechanisms for maintaining synchrony rather than mere parallel processing of stimuli and motor activity.</p>

	<p>Background: Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from patients with non-inflammatory neurological diseases are used for control groups in biomarker studies. Since large amounts of CSF are withdrawn, patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) or normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) are especially suitable. The serially taken CSF portions are usually collected in different tubes. We aimed to investigate whether the later random choice of one of these tubes for CSF investigations might harbor the risk of different CSF protein findings due to the so-called ventriculo-lumbar CSF gradient. Methods: Patients with IIH (9) and NPH (7) were included. CSF was serially taken and collected in six tubes of 5 mL each. Concentrations and CSF-serum quotients of immunoglobulins, albumin and the virus-specific antibody index (AI) were determined in the first, fourth and sixth CSF fraction. Results: CSF immunoglobulin and albumin concentrations and CSF-serum protein quotients were significantly lower in the fourth and sixth CSF fraction compared with the first CSF fraction. Virus-specific AI did not significantly differ in the different CSF fractions. Conclusions: CSF protein analytics should be performed in the first CSF fraction in order to avoid different measurement results and achieve comparability within a control group and between different control and patient groups.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Imaging Net Retrograde Axonal Transport In Vivo: A Physiological Biomarker</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The objective of this study is to develop a novel method for monitoring the integrity of motor neurons in vivo by quantifying net retrograde axonal transport.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>The method uses single photon emission computed tomography to quantify retrograde transport to spinal cord of tetanus toxin fragment C (<sup>125</sup>I-TTC) following intramuscular injection. We characterized the transport profiles in 3 transgenic mouse models carrying amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)-associated genes, aging mice, and SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> transgenic mice following CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing. Lastly, we studied the effect of prior immunization of tetanus toxoid on the transport profile of TTC.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>This technique defines a quantitative profile of net retrograde axonal transport of TTC in living mice. The profile is distinctly abnormal in transgenic SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice as young as 65 days (presymptomatic) and worsens with disease progression. Moreover, this method detects a distinct therapeutic benefit of gene editing in transgenic SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice well before other clinical parameters (eg, grip strength) show improvement. Symptomatic transgenic PFN1<sup>C71G/C71G</sup> ALS mice display gross reductions in net retrograde axonal transport, which is also disturbed in asymptomatic mice harboring a human <i>C9ORF72</i> transgene with an expanded GGGGCC repeat motif. In wild-type mice, net retrograde axonal transport declines with aging. Lastly, prior immunization with tetanus toxoid does not preclude use of this assay.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This assay of net retrograde axonal transport has broad potential clinical applications and should be particularly valuable as a physiological biomarker that permits early detection of benefit from potential therapies for motor neuron diseases. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Microglial amyloid beta clearance is driven by PIEZO1 channels</a></h4>

              
                Background: Microglia are the endogenous immune cells of the brain and act as sensors of pathology to maintain brain homeostasis and eliminate potential threats. In Alzheimer's disease (AD), toxic amyloid beta (A{beta}) accumulates in the brain and forms stiff plaques. In late-onset AD accounting for 95% of all cases, this is thought to be due to reduced clearance of A{beta}. Human genome-wide association studies and animal models suggest that reduced clearance results from aberrant function of microglia. While the impact of neurochemical pathways on microglia have been broadly studied, mechanical receptors regulating microglial functions remain largely unexplored. Methods: Here we showed that a mechanotransduction ion channel, PIEZO1, is expressed and functional in human and mouse microglia. We used a small molecule agonist, Yoda1, to study how activation of PIEZO1 affects AD-related functions in human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) -derived microglia-like cells (iMGL) under controlled laboratory experiments. Cell survival, metabolism, phagocytosis and lysosomal activity were assessed using real-time functional assays. To evaluate the effect of activation of PIEZO1 in vivo, 5-month-old 5xFAD male mice were infused daily with Yoda1 for two weeks through intracranial cannulas. Microglial Iba1 expression and A{beta} pathology were quantified with immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy. Published human and mouse AD datasets were used for in-depth analysis of PIEZO1 gene expression and related pathways in microglial subpopulations. Results: We show that PIEZO1 orchestrates A{beta} clearance by enhancing microglial survival, phagocytosis, and lysosomal activity. A{beta} inhibited PIEZO1-mediated calcium transients, whereas activation of PIEZO1 with a selective agonist, Yoda1, improved microglial phagocytosis resulting in A{beta} clearance both in human and mouse models of AD. Moreover, PIEZO1 expression was associated with a unique microglial transcriptional phenotype in AD as indicated by assessment of cellular metabolism, and human and mouse single cell datasets. Conclusion: These results indicate that the compromised function of microglia in AD could be improved by controlled activation of PIEZO1 channels resulting in alleviated A{beta} burden. Pharmacological regulation of these mechanoreceptors in microglia could represent a novel therapeutic paradigm for AD.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A microfluidic-based model of nociceptor sensitization reveals a direct activation of sensory axons by prostaglandin E2</a></h4>

              
                Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) is one of the major contributors to inflammatory pain hyperalgesia, however, the extent to which it modulates the activity of the nociceptive axons is incompletely understood. We used a microfluidic cell culture platform to investigate the changes in responsiveness of sensory axons following treatment with PGE2. We show that the application of PGE2 to fluidically isolated axons leads to sensitization of their responses to depolarising stimuli, and the inclusion of zatebradine, a blocker of HCN channels, blocks this enhancement. However, unexpectedly, we also found that the application of PGE2 to the axons elicited a direct and persistent spiking activity in the sensory neurons. We demonstrate that this persistent activity is due to a direct depolarization of axons by PGE2, which is inhibited by Nav1.8 sodium channel blockers but is mainly refractory to Nav1.7 channel blockade. Both the persistent activity and the membrane depolarization in the axons are abolished by the EP4 receptor inhibitor and a blocker of cAMP synthesis. Our data indicate that PGE2/EP4/cAMP pathway culminates in a sustained depolarization in the sensory axons, leading to the generation of action potentials propagating to the soma. PGE2 therefore, not only mediates nociceptor sensitization but can directly elicit discharges in nociceptive axons, hence redefining its role as a pain mediator in inflammatory conditions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">What happens after an error?</a></h4>

              
                A ubiquitous finding in cognitive science across a wide variety of tasks is that humans tend to slow down after making an error. The dominant account of this post error slowing is that people engage in adaptive control and are simply more cautious after an error. However, this explanation is challenged by the fact that, although people are slower, accuracy typically does not improve following an error. Errors negatively impact cognitive processing, but characterizing the nature of error-based impairments has been a challenge in standard paradigms. Here, we adopt a recently developed experimental approach to uncover the time course of stimulus-response processing following an error by exerting tight control over the timing of responses. This method allows us to apply a computational model of response preparation that allows us to estimate the latency of cognitive processing underlying responses. In a four alternative forced-choice task with arbitrary stimulus-response mappings, we find that human participants are less accurate after an error even when given up to two seconds to make a response. Our modeling results ruled out the possibility that errors lead to a subsequent slowing of the cognitive processing underlying responses. Instead, we found that the 'efficacy' of cognitive processing in producing an intended response is impaired following errors as people commit more perseverative slips of action regardless of when a response is made. These results suggest that prior observations of post-error slowing may be an adaptive response to impaired cognitive processing rather than a strategic shift in the speed-accuracy tradeoff.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Maternal separation induces autism spectrum disorder in young rhesus monkeys</a></h4>

              
                Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a class of severe neurodevelopmental disorders with a high incidence in young children, and its pathogenesis remains elusive. There is no effective treatment, and ASD children usually have a hard time in integrating into society and leading a normal life, which places a heavy burden on the families and society. Studies have shown that in addition to genetic factors, environmental factors are another important risk contributing to the pathogenesis of ASD. Early environmental adversity, which can lead to abnormal brain development and affect cognition and behavior, greatly increases the incidence of a variety of brain developmental diseases including ASD. However, studies on this aspect are inadequate at present, and no clear conclusions can be drawn. We explored whether early adversity could trigger ASD core clinical symptoms in macaques by modeling early adversity through maternal separation. In this study, we conducted a rigorous behavioral analysis of 64 male macaques (1.5-2 years old) that underwent maternal separation and 9 male normal macaques of the same age that had been mother raised, and found that maternal separation could induce a small number of the young individuals to develop three core symptoms of ASD, including social impairment, stereotyped behaviors, and restricted interest simultaneously. According to DSM-V and ASD clinical diagnostic criteria, these individuals should be ASD macaques for having all the three core ASD symptoms at the same time., For the first time, this study reveals that early environmental adversity can lead to ASD pathogenesis in monkeys, and provides a new approach for future ASD studies and modeling ASD monkeys.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Behavioral and dopaminergic signatures of resilience</a></h4>

              
                Chronic stress can have lasting adverse consequences in some individuals, yet others are resilient to the same stressor1,2. While previous work found differences in the intrinsic properties of mesolimbic dopamine (DA) neurons in susceptible and resilient individuals after stress was over;3-10 the causal links between DA activity during stress, dynamic stress-evoked behavior, and individual differences in susceptibility and resilience are not known. Here, we record behavior and neural activity in DA projections to the nucleus accumbens (NAc, signals reward11-14) and to the tail striatum (TS, signals threat15-18) during a multiday chronic social defeat paradigm and discover behavioral and neural signatures of resilience. Using supervised and unsupervised behavioral quantification, we find that resilient and susceptible individuals employ different behavioral strategies during stress. In addition, NAc-DA (but not TS-DA) activity is higher in the proximity of the aggressor in resilient mice, consistent with a greater subjective value of the aggressor. Moreover, NAc-DA tends to be elevated at the onset of fighting back in resilient mice and at the offset of attacks in susceptible mice. To test whether DA activation during defeat can generate resilience, and if its timing with respect to behavior is critical, we performed optogenetic stimulation of NAc-DA in open-loop (randomly timed) during defeat or timed to specific behaviors using real-time pose-tracking and behavioral classification. We find that both open-loop DA activation and fighting-back-timed activation promote resilience, in both cases reorganizing behavior during defeat toward resilience-associated patterns. Attack offset-timed activation promotes avoidance during defeat but does not promote susceptibility afterwards. Together, these data suggest a model whereby, during stress, DA in the NAc can increase resilience primarily by elevating the subjective value of the stressor rather than by reinforcing particular stress-responsive behaviors.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Emotional intensity can enrich or degrade memories: impact of the amygdalar pathway on hippocampus through inhibitory neurons</a></h4>

              
                The brain's emotional system powerfully modulates processing of context and episodic memory. A key pathway that mediates these effects is the projection from the amygdala to the hippocampus. Wang and Barbas (1) uncovered a distinctive pattern in the pathways from amygdala to hippocampus in primates. In hippocampal CA3, a pathway from the amygdala innervated excitatory pyramidal neurons as well as parvalbumin (PV) and calretinin (CR) inhibitory neurons. In hippocampal CA1, amygdalar projections also innervated pyramidal neurons and CR interneurons, but not PV interneurons. The effects of these complex circuits can best be probed using computational simulations. We developed a model of spiking neurons to investigate the implications and significance of these amygdala-hippocampal circuits for affective influence on processing mnemonic context, and to test their effects as input from the amygdala gradually increased. Our simulations revealed that moderate input from the amygdala can enhance detail in CA3 representations that can correctly sort out contexts and episodes from memory. However, high amygdalar input suppressed CA3 responses to non-amygdalar inputs through powerful inhibitory neurons, leading to memory representations that lack detail. Moreover, high amygdalar input prematurely hastened the timing of responses in CA1 occurring when the current situation broadly and non-specifically matched a remembered context. Amygdalar pathways to hippocampus enable a mechanism whereby affective signaling appropriately enhances hippocampal representations of remembered context. However, when amygdalar input is excessive in high emotional arousal, there is loss of memory detail and overgeneralization, as seen in post-traumatic stress disorder or pathologic phobias.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Heterocyclic aromatic amines (HAAs) target mitochondrial physiology</a></h4>

              
                Heterocyclic aromatic amines (HAA) may be found naturally in plants or are formed through the Maillard reaction when meat is cooked at high temperatures. Previous studies have indicated HAAs are especially toxic to dopaminergic neurons, whereas specific exposures may also affect other neuronal populations such as cholinergic neurons. Biochemical mechanisms of neurotoxic action implicate elevated oxidative stress and afflicted mitochondria. Notably, these mechanisms are of importance in Alzheimers disease (AD) and Parkinsons disease (PD). Most neurodegenerative disease cases are sporadic, where environmental and dietary factors may modulate risk. To further investigate HAA neurotoxicity, we tested the effect of common HAA (harmane, harmine, norharmane, PhIP, and HONH-PhIP) exposure on mitochondrial physiology, a key pathogenic target in AD and PD. Upon assessing mitochondrial bioenergetics, we observed a significant reduction in basal respiration, ATP production, maximal respiratory capacity, and non-mitochondrial respiration, indicating that HAA negatively impacts mitochondrial respiration. Followed by more specific studies on individual mitochondrial complexes, it was found that harmane, harmine, norharmane specifically inhibit complex I enzyme activity, whereas HONH-PhiP, a reactive metabolite of PhIP, inhibits Complex III enzyme activity. Our findings provide significant advancement with respect to underlying mechanisms of toxicity, though also validating HAA exposure as a potential risk factor for AD and PD.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Beneficial effects of prolonged 2-phenylethyl alcohol inhalation on chronic distress-induced anxio-depressive-like phenotype in female mice</a></h4>

              
                Chronic distress-induced hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis deregulations have been associated with the development of neuropsychiatric disorders such as anxiety and depression. Currently available drugs treating such pathological conditions have limited efficacy and diverse side effects, revealing the need of new safer strategies. Aromatic plant-based compounds are largely used in herbal medicine due to their therapeutic properties on mood, physiology, and general well-being. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of 2-phenylethyl alcohol (PEA), one of the pharmacologically active constituents of rose essential oil, on chronic corticosterone (CORT)-induced behavioral and neurobiological changes in female mice. Animals followed a prolonged PEA inhalation exposure (30 min per day) for 15 consecutive days prior to behavioral evaluation with open-field, forced swim and novelty-suppressed feeding tests. CORT treatment induced an anxio-depressive-like phenotype, evidenced by a reduced locomotor activity in the open-field, and an increased latency to feed in the novelty-suppressed feeding paradigms. To elucidate the neural correlates of our behavioral results, cerebral cFos expression analysis was further performed to provide a global map of neuronal activity. The altered feeding behavior was accompanied by a significant decrease in the number of cFos-positive cells in the olfactory bulb, and altered brain connectivity as shown by cross-correlation-based network analysis. CORT-induced behavioral and neurobiological alterations were reversed by prolonged PEA inhalation, suggesting a therapeutic action that allows regulating the activity of neural circuits involved in sensory, emotional and feeding behaviors. These findings might contribute to better understand the therapeutic potential of PEA on anxio-depressive symptoms.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A multi-scale fusion CNN model based on adaptive transfer learning for multi-class MI-classification in BCI system</a></h4>

              
                Deep learning-based brain-computer interface (BCI) in motor imagery (MI) has emerged as a powerful method for establishing direct communication between the brain and external electronic devices. However, due to inter-subject variability, inherent complex properties, and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in electroencephalogram (EEG) signal are major challenges that significantly hinder the accuracy of the MI classifier. To overcome this, the present work proposes an efficient transfer learning-based multi-scale feature fused CNN (MSFFCNN) which can capture the distinguishable features of various non-overlapping canonical frequency bands of EEG signals from different convolutional scales for multi-class MI classification. In order to account for inter-subject variability from different subjects, the current work presents 4 different model variants including subject-independent and subject-adaptive classification models considering different adaptation configurations to exploit the full learning capacity of the classifier. Each adaptation configuration has been fine-tuned in an extensively trained pre-trained model and the performance of the classifier has been studied for vast range of learning rates and degrees of adaptation which illustrates the advantages of using an adaptive transfer learning-based model. The model achieves an average classification accuracy of 94.06 % {+/-}2.29 % and kappa value of 0.88 outperforming several baseline and current state-of-the-art EEG-based MI classification models with fewer training samples. The present research provides an effective and efficient transfer learning-based end-to-end MI classification framework for designing a high-performance robust MI-BCI system.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Causal Inference on Neuroimaging Data with Mendelian Randomisation</a></h4>

              
                While population-scale neuroimaging studies offer the promise of discovery and characterisation of subtle risk factors, massive sample sizes increase the power for both meaningful associations and those attributable to confounds. This motivates the need for causal modelling of observational data that goes beyond statements of association and towards deeper understanding of complex relationships between individual traits and phenotypes, clinical biomarkers, genetic variation, and brain-related measures of health. Mendelian randomisation (MR) presents a way to obtain causal inference on the basis of genetic data and explicit assumptions about the relationship between genetic variables, exposure and outcome. In this work, we provide an introduction to and overview of causal inference methods based on Mendelian randomisation, with examples involving imaging-derived phenotypes from UK Biobank to make these methods accessible to neuroimaging researchers. We motivate the use of MR techniques, lay out the underlying assumptions, introduce common MR methods and focus on several scenarios in which modelling assumptions are potentially violated, resulting in biased effect estimates. Importantly, we give a detailed account of necessary steps to increase the reliability of MR results with rigorous sensitivity analyses.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">pTDP-43 aggregates accumulate in the gut and other non-central nervous system tissues prior to symptom onset in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis</a></h4>

              
                Objective: Neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are traditionally considered strictly neurological disorders. However, clinical presentation is not restricted to neurological systems, and non-central nervous system (CNS) manifestations, particularly gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, are common. Our objective was to understand the systemic distribution of pathology in archived non-CNS tissues, taken as part of routine clinical practice during life from people with ALS. Design: We requested all surgical specimens of non-CNS tissue taken during life from 48 people with ALS, for whom evidence of the characteristic proteinopathy associated with ALS had been identified in the CNS after death (i.e., the pathological cytoplasmic accumulation of phosphorylated TDP-43 (pTDP-43) aggregates). Of the 48 patients, 13 had sufficient tissue for evaluation: 12 patients with sporadic ALS and 1 patient with a C9orf72 hexanucleotide repeat expansion. The final cohort consisted of 68 formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue samples from 22 surgical cases (some patients having more than one case over their lifetimes), representing 8 organ systems, which we examined for evidence of pTDP-43 pathology. The median age of tissue removal was 62.4 years old and median tissue removal to death was 6.3 years. Results: We identified pTDP-43 aggregates in multiple cell types of the GI tract (i.e., colon and gallbladder), including macrophages and dendritic cells within the lamina propria, as well as neuronal and glial cells of the myenteric plexus. Aggregates were also noted within lymph node parenchyma, blood vessel endothelial cells, and chondrocytes. We note that in all cases with non-CNS pTDP 43 pathology, aggregates were present prior to ALS diagnosis (median=3years) and, in some instances, preceded neurological symptom onset by more than 10 years. Conclusion: These data imply that patients with non-CNS symptoms may have occult protein aggregation that could be detected many years prior to neurological involvement.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The Cocktail Party Effect in Post-Stroke Fatigue: an EEG study</a></h4>

              
                Objective: An inability to selectively attend away from task irrelevant stimuli is thought to drive post-stroke fatigue. In this study we investigated if neural processing of task relevant stimuli, in the presence of noise (task-irrelevant stimuli), is compromised in post-stroke fatigue. Methods: An auditory oddball task consisting of target, standard and novel tones was carried out with and without background noise while recording neural responses using electroencephalography. Participants responded to target tones with a button press. After each block, participants rated how effortful the block felt. Fatigue was measured using the fatigue severity scale. The effect of fatigue and noise on behaviour (response time, accuracy, and effort rating) and neural responses (amplitude and latency) was examined using mixed model ANOVAS. Results: Those with fatigue had slower responses both in noise and no noise conditions. The response amplitude to the novel tones in the noise condition was smaller, than no noise condition, which was modulated by fatigue. The latency of response was longer, in the noise when compared to no noise condition which was not modulated by fatigue. Likewise, perceived effort was also greater in the noise condition, but not modulated by fatigue. Interpretation: Processing of novel stimuli in the presence of background noise is significantly altered in post-stroke fatigue, indicating a problem with attentional switching processes, one that selectively contributes to the feeling of fatigue without affecting performance.

                To date, few advanced machine learning models have been developed for investigating the associations between features from brain imaging and individual Alzheimer's disease (AD) related cognitive functional changes. Additionally, how these associations differ among different imaging modalities is unclear. Here we investigated 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) models which were trained to predict sub-scores in 13-item Alzheimer's disease Assessment Scale - Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog13) based on MRI and FDG-PET brain imaging data obtained from the ADNI database. We found that each key ADAS-Cog13 sub-score was associated with a specific set of brain features within an imaging modality. Overall, sub-scores were strongly associated with structural changes of subcortical regions including amygdala, hippocampus, and putamen, and were associated with metabolic changes of cortical regions including the cingulated gyrus, occipital cortex, middle front gyrus, precuneus cortex, and the cerebellum. Our findings provided insights into complex AD etiology. Our analytical pipeline can also be utilized to study other brain diseases.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Fine oculomotor knowledge enhances high-acuity vision</a></h4>

              
                It has long been debated how humans resolve fine details and perceive a stable visual world despite the fixational motion of their eyes, the incessant ocular jitter that occurs in the intervals between voluntary gaze shifts. Current theories assume these processes to rely solely on the visual input to the retina, without contributions from motor and/or proprioceptive sources. Here we show that contrary to this widespread assumption, the visual system has access to high-resolution extra-retinal knowledge of fixational eye motion and uses it to deduce spatial relations. Building on recent advances in gaze-contingent display control, we created a spatial discrimination task in which the stimulus configuration was entirely determined by oculomotor activity. Our results show that humans correctly infer geometrical relations even when no spatial information is delivered to the retina and accurately combine high-resolution extraretinal monitoring of gaze displacement with retinal signals. These findings reveal a multimodal strategy for encoding spatial details, in which fine oculomotor knowledge is used to interpret the fixational input to the retina.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Hyper-adaptation in the Human Brain: Functional and structural changes in the foot section of the primary motor cortex in a top wheelchair racing Paralympian</a></h4>

              
                The human brain has the capacity to drastically alter its somatotopic representations in response to congenital or acquired limb deficiencies and dysfunctions. The main purpose of the present study was to elucidate such extreme adaptability in the brain of an active top wheelchair racing Paralympian (participant P1) who has congenital paraplegia (dysfunction of bilateral lower limbs). Participant P1 has undergone long-term wheelchair racing training using bilateral upper limbs and has won a total of 19 medals in six consecutive summer Paralympic games as of 2021. We examined the functional and structural changes in the foot section of the primary motor cortex (M1) in participant P1 as compared to able-bodied control participants. We also examined the functional and structural changes in three other individuals (participants P2, P3, and P4) with acquired paraplegia, who also had long-term non-use period of the lower limbs and had undergone long-term training for wheelchair sports (but not top athletes at the level of participant P1). We measured brain activity in all the participants using functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) when bimanual wrist extension-flexion movement was performed, and the structural MRI images were collected. Compared to 37 control participants, participant P1 showed significantly greater activity in the M1 foot section during the bimanual task, and significant local GM expansion in this section. Significantly greater activity in the M1 foot section was also observed in participant P4, but not in P2 and P3, and the significant local GM expansion was observed in participant P2, but not in P3 and P4. Thus, functional or structural change was observed in an acquired paraplegic participant, but was not observed in all the paraplegic participants. The functional and structural changes typically observed in participant P1 may represent extreme adaptability of the human brain. We discuss the results in terms of a new idea of hyper-adaptation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A murine model of hnRNPH2-related neurodevelopmental disorder recapitulates clinical features of human disease and reveals a mechanism for genetic compensation of HNRNPH2</a></h4>

              
                Mutations in HNRNPH2 cause an X-linked neurodevelopmental disorder with a phenotypic spectrum that includes developmental delay, intellectual disability, language impairment, motor function deficits, and seizures. More than 90% of patients with this disorder have a missense mutation within or adjacent to the nuclear localization signal (NLS) of hnRNPH2, although the specific pathogenic consequences of these mutations have not been examined. Here we found that hnRNPH2 NLS mutations result in reduced interaction with the nuclear transport receptor Kap{beta}2 in vitro and in cultured human cells. These mutations also cause modest accumulation of hnRNPH2 in the cytoplasm, suggesting that mislocalization of the protein might contribute to pathogenesis. We generated two knock-in mouse models with human-equivalent mutations in the endogenous mouse gene Hnrnph2, as well as Hnrnph2 knockout (KO) mice, and subjected them to extensive, deep phenotyping. Mutant knock-in mice displayed a spectrum of phenotypes that recapitulated aspects of the human disorder, including reduced survival in males, craniofacial abnormalities, impaired motor functions, and increased susceptibility to audiogenic seizures. Mutant knock-in male mice developed more severe phenotypes than female mice, likely due to differences in X-chromosome gene dosage. In contrast, two independent lines of Hnrnph2 KO mice showed no detectable phenotypes. Notably, KO mice had upregulated expression of Hnrnph1, a close paralog of Hnrnph2, whereas mutant Hnrnph2 knock-in mice failed to upregulate Hnrnph1. Thus, genetic compensation by Hnrnph1 might be sufficient to counteract the loss of hnRNPH2. These findings suggest that the pathogenesis of HNRNPH2-related disorder in humans may be driven by a toxic gain of function or a complex loss of -HNRNPH2 function with impaired compensation by HNRNPH1. The carefully phenotyped mutant knock-in mice described here are an important resource for preclinical studies to assess the potential benefit of either gene replacement or therapeutic knockdown of mutant hnRNPH2.

                Oxytocinergic actions within the hippocampal CA2 are important for neuromodulation, memory processing and social recognition. However, the source of the OTergic innervation, the cellular targets expressing the OT receptors (OTRs) and whether the PVN-to-CA2 OTergic system is altered during heart failure (HF), a condition recently associated with cognitive and mood decline, remains unknown. Using immunohistochemistry along with retrograde monosynaptic tracing, RNAscope and a novel OTR-Cre rat line, we show that the PVN (but not the supraoptic nucleus) is an important source of OTergic innervation to the CA2. These OTergic fibers were found in many instances in close apposition to OTR expressing cells within the CA2. Interestingly, while only a small proportion of neurons were found to express OTRs (~15%), this expression was much more abundant in CA2 astrocytes (~40%), an even higher proportion that was recently reported for astrocytes in the central amygdala. Using an established ischemic rat heart failure (HF) model, we found that HF resulted in robust changes in the PVN-to-CA2 OTergic system, both at the source and target levels. Within the PVN, we found an increased OT immunoreactivity, along with a diminished OTR expression in PVN neurons. Within the CA2 of HF rats, we observed a blunted OTergic innervation, along with a diminished OTR expression, which appeared to be restricted to CA2 astrocytes. Taken together, our studies highlight astrocytes as key cellular targets mediating OTergic PVN inputs to the CA2 hippocampal region. Moreover, provides the first evidence for an altered PVN-to-CA2 OTergic system in HF rats, which could potentially contribute to previously reported cognitive and mood impairments in this animal model.

                Diffusion MRI is a complex technique, where new discoveries and implementations occur at a fast pace. The expertise needed for data analyses and accurate and reproducible results is increasingly demanding and requires multidisciplinary collaborations. In the present work we introduce Reproducible Tract Profiles (RTP2): a set of flexible and automated methods to analyze anatomical MRI and diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) data for reproducible tractography. The tools read structural MRI data and process them through a succession of serialized containerized analyses. We describe the DWI algorithms used to identify white-matter tracts and their summary metrics, the flexible architecture of the platform, and the tools to programmatically access and control the computations. The combination of these three components provides an easy-to-use automatized tool developed and tested over 20 years, to obtain usable and reliable state-of-the-art diffusion metrics at the individual and group levels for basic research and clinical practice.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Sparse coding models predict a spectral bias in the development of primary visual cortex (V1) receptive fields</a></h4>

              
                It is well known that sparse coding models trained on natural images learn basis functions whose shapes resemble the receptive fields (RFs) of simple cells in the primary visual cortex (V1). However, few studies have considered how these basis functions develop during training. In particular, it is unclear whether certain types of basis functions emerge more quickly than others, or whether they develop simultaneously. In this work, we train an overcomplete sparse coding model (Sparsenet) on natural images and find that there is indeed order in the development of its basis functions, with basis functions tuned to lower spatial frequencies emerging earlier and higher spatial frequency basis functions emerging later. We observe the same trend in a biologically plausible sparse coding model (SAILnet) that uses leaky integrate-and-fire neurons and synaptically local learning rules, suggesting that this result is a general feature of sparse coding. Our results are consistent with recent experimental evidence that the distribution of optimal stimuli for driving neurons to fire shifts towards higher frequencies during normal development in mouse V1. Our analysis of sparse coding models during training yields an experimentally testable prediction for V1 development that this shift may be due in part to higher spatial frequency RFs emerging later, as opposed to a global shift towards higher frequencies across all RFs, which may also play a role. We also find that at least two explanations could account for the order of RF development: 1) high frequency RFs require more information to be specified accurately, and thus may require more visual experience in order to learn, and 2) early development of low frequency RFs improves the sparseness and fidelity of the visual representation more than early development of high frequency RFs.

                Discriminating distinct objects and concepts from sensory stimuli is essential for survival. Our brains accomplish this feat by forming meaningful internal representations in deep sensory networks with plastic synaptic connections. Experience-dependent plasticity presumably exploits temporal contingencies between sensory inputs to build these internal representations. However, the precise mechanisms underlying plasticity remain elusive. We derive a local synaptic plasticity model inspired by self-supervised machine learning techniques that shares a deep conceptual connection to Bienenstock-Cooper-Munro (BCM) theory and is consistent with experimentally observed plasticity rules. We show that our plasticity model yields disentangled object representations in deep neural networks without the need for supervision and implausible negative examples. In response to altered visual experience, our model qualitatively captures neuronal selectivity changes observed in the monkey inferotemporal cortex in-vivo. Our work suggests a plausible learning rule to drive learning in sensory networks while making concrete testable predictions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Diminished distractor filtering with increased perceptual load and sustained effort explains attention deficit in post-stroke fatigue</a></h4>

              
                Objectives: Post-stroke fatigue (PSF) is a prevalent symptom associated with attention deficits. However, it is currently unclear what drives these. Here we applied Load Theory of Attention to investigate the role of perceptual load in the relationship between attention, distraction, and fatigue levels in PSF. Methods: Thirty-two chronic stroke survivors performed a selective attention task under different perceptual load levels. Neural responses to targets and distractors were measured with frequency-tagged EEG responses. Results: We showed that Fatigue Severity Scale-7 (FSS-7) scores are predictive of slower responses, irrespective of the task level of perceptual load. Although average distractor frequency (10Hz) power was reduced with higher perceptual load, the reduction in 10Hz power with increasing task load, was smaller in those with higher FSS-7 scores. Higher FSS-7 scores were also associated with increased 10Hz distractor response as time progressed, both within task-trials and across the experiment duration. Conclusion: The results are consistent with previous reports of slower processing speed and sustained selective attention deficits. Importantly they demonstrate that higher fatigue severity is associated with a reduced ability to suppress neural response to irrelevant distractors stimuli when the task demands more attention due to its increased perceptual load. An account for attention deficit in PSF based on a distractor filtering deficit that emerges with increased perceptual load and sustained effort can explain a myriad of PSF symptoms (e.g. sensory perceptual overload, and difficulties to concentrate).

                The exon junction complex (EJC), nucleated by EIF4A3, is indispensable for mRNA fate and function throughout eukaryotes. Unexpectedly, we discover that EIF4A3 directly controls microtubules independent of RNA, and this is critical for neural wiring. While neuronal survival in the developing mouse cerebral cortex depends upon an intact EJC, axonal tract formation requires only Eif4a3. Using human cortical organoids, we demonstrate that EIF4A3 disease mutations also impair neuronal maturation, highlighting conserved functions relevant for neurodevelopmental pathology. Employing biochemistry and molecular modeling we discover that EIF4A3 directly binds to microtubules, mutually exclusive of the RNA-binding complex. In growing neurons, EIF4A3 is essential for microtubule dynamics, and sufficient to promote microtubule polymerization and stability in vitro. Together, our data show that tubulin-bound EIF4A3 orchestrates microtubule dynamics, underlying key events of neuronal development. This reveals a new mechanism by which neurons re-utilize core gene expression machinery to rapidly and directly control the cytoskeleton.

                Cell-cell interactions are critical to central nervous system (CNS) structure and function. Direct neuron-neuron interactions occur via synapses, but only one type of neuron-glia synapse is known to exist: those formed between neurons (pre-) and oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) (post-). These synapses are thought to bridge neuronal activity to OPCs, which are critical for developmental myelination and adult motor learning3. However, the composition and assembly of neuron-OPC synapses and their in vivo functions remain largely unclear. Here, using zebrafish to label postsynaptic organizers PSD-95 and Gephyrin in OPCs, we found that synapses in OPCs possess dynamic assembly properties and are developmentally regulated. We also found that synapses and voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (VGCCs) play important roles in driving intrinsic OPC Ca2+ activity that occurs mainly in microdomains, while evoked synaptic release has a limited role that diminishes through development. Finally, disrupting a key synaptic gene, neuroligin3b, specifically in OPCs impairs OPC differentiation and subsequent myelination. Our results establish an in vivo model of dynamic neuron-OPC synapses mediating intrinsic OPC Ca2+ activity and impacting OPC differentiation, pointing to plastic neuron-OPC interactions and synapse-dependent and -independent Ca2+ pathways in OPCs.

                Structural plasticity in the brain often necessitates dramatic remodeling of neuronal processes and attendant reorganization of both the cytoskeleton and plasma membrane. While cytoskeletal restructuring has been studied extensively, how changes in specific lipids might orchestrate structural plasticity remain incompletely understood. We show that specific glial cells in Drosophila produce Glucocerebrosidase (GBA) to locally catabolize sphingolipids, critical components of neuronal membranes. Defects in sphingolipid catabolism drive lysosomal dysfunction, causing Gba1b mutants to harbor protein aggregates that cycle across circadian time, are regulated by neural activity and the circadian clock, and plateau with age. Moreover, cell-specific perturbations reveal that sphingolipid catabolism is necessary for neurites in sleep circuits to extend and retract across the day, and for sleep behavior. Critically, reprogramming the temporal pattern of GBA expression in sleep-circuit neurons is sufficient to invert the membrane remodeling cycle. Thus, dynamic changes in sphingolipid levels instruct the diurnal pattern of neuronal plasticity.

Here we present a comprehensive single-cell transcriptomic, epigenetic, and spatial atlas of human cortical organoid development, comprising over 610,000 cells, spanning initial generation of neural progenitors through production of differentiated neuronal and glial subtypes. We define the lineage relationships and longitudinal molecular trajectories of cortical cell types during development in organoids, and show that developmental processes of cellular diversification in organoids correlate closely to endogenous ones, irrespective of metabolic state. Using this data, we identify genes with predicted human-specific roles in lineage establishment, and discover a developmental origin for the transcriptional diversity of human callosal projection neurons, a population that has undergone dramatic expansion and diversification during human evolution. Our work provides a comprehensive, single-cell molecular map of human corticogenesis in vitro, identifying developmental trajectories and molecular mechanisms associated with human cellular diversification.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Inka2, a novel Pak4 inhibitor, regulates actin dynamics in dendritic spine development</a></h4>

              
                The actin filament is a fundamental part of the cytoskeleton defining cell morphology and regulating various physiological processes, including filopodia formation and dendritic spinogenesis of neurons. Serine/threonine-protein kinase Pak4, an essential effector, links Rho GTPases to control actin polymerization. Previously, we identified the Inka2 gene, a novel mammalian protein exhibiting sequence similarity to Inka1, which serves as a possible inhibitor for Pak4. Although Inka2 is dominantly expressed in the nervous system and involved in focal-adhesion dynamics, its molecular role remains unclear. Here, we found that Inka2-iBox directly binds to Pak4 catalytic domain to suppress actin polymerization. Inka2 promoted actin depolymerization and inhibited the formation of cellular protrusion caused by Pak4 activation. We further generated the conditional knockout mice of the Inka2 gene. The beta-galactosidase reporter indicated the preferential Inka2 expression in the dorsal forebrain neurons. Cortical pyramidal neurons of Inka2-/- mice exhibited decreased density and aberrant morphology of dendritic spines with marked activation/phosphorylation of downstream molecules of Pak4 signal cascade, including LIMK and cofilin. These results uncovered the unexpected function of endogenous Pak4 inhibitor in neurons. Unlike Inka1, Inka2 is a critical mediator for actin reorganization required for dendritic spine development.

                Sleep alteration is a hallmark of ageing and emerges as a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). While the fine-tuned coalescence of sleep microstructure elements may influence age-related cognitive trajectories, its association with AD processes is not fully established. Here, we investigated whether the coupling of spindles and slow waves is associated with early amyloid-beta (A{beta}) brain burden, a hallmark of AD neuropathology, and cognitive change over 2 years in 100 healthy individuals in late midlife (50-70y; 68 women). We found that, in contrast to other sleep metrics, earlier occurrence of spindles on slow-depolarisation slow waves is associated with higher medial prefrontal cortex A{beta} burden (p=0.014, r2{beta}*=0.06), and is predictive of greater longitudinal memory decline (p=0.032, r2{beta}*=0.07). These findings unravel early links between sleep, AD-related processes and cognition and suggest that altered coupling of sleep microstructure elements, key to its mnesic function, contributes to poorer brain and cognitive trajectories in ageing.

	<p>Despite extensive research on COVID-19&amp;amp;rsquo;s impact on healthcare workers, few studies have targeted mental health workers (MHWs) and none have investigated previous traumatic events. We investigated psychological distress in MHWs after the first lockdown in Italy to understand which COVID-19, sociodemographic, and professional variables represented greater effects, and the role of previous trauma. The survey included sociodemographic and professional questions, COVID-19 variables, and the questionnaires Life Events Checklist for DSM-5 (LEC-5), Impact of Event Scale&amp;amp;mdash;Revised (IES-R), and Depression Anxiety Stress Scales 21 (DASS-21). On the 271 MHWs who completed the survey (73.1% female; mean age 45.37), we obtained significant effects for contagion fear, experience of patients&amp;amp;rsquo; death, increased workload, and worse team relationship during the first wave. Nurses were more affected and showed more post-traumatic stress symptoms, assessed by IES-R, and more depressive, anxiety, and stress symptoms, assessed by DASS-21. The strongest risk factors for distress were greater age, professional role, increased workload, worse team relationship, and separation from family members. Previous experience of severe human suffering and unwanted sexual experiences negatively impacted IES-R and DASS-21 scores. Being a psychiatrist or psychologist/psychotherapist and good team relationships were protective factors. Recent but also previous severe stressful events might represent relevant risk factors for distress, reducing resilience skills. Identifying vulnerable factors and professional categories may help in the development of dedicated measures to prevent emotional burden and support psychological health. Highlights: Psychological distress in mental health workers in the COVID-19 pandemic is more frequent in nurses, who experience more depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress symptoms. Previous and recent stressful events are risk factors for distress and should guide intervention strategies.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The thalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVT) is a structure highly interconnected with several nuclei ranging from forebrain to hypothalamus and brainstem. Numerous rodent studies have examined afferent and efferent connections of the PVT and their contribution to behavior, revealing its important role in the integration of arousal cues. However, the majority of these studies used a region-oriented approach, without considering the neuronal subtype diversity of the nucleus. In the present study, we provide the anatomical and transcriptomic characterization of a subpopulation of PVT neurons molecularly defined by the expression of glucokinase (Gck). Combining a genetically modified mouse model with viral tracing approaches, we mapped both the anterograde and the retrograde projections of Gck-positive neurons of the anterior PVT (Gck<sup>aPVT</sup>). Our results demonstrated that Gck<sup>aPVT</sup> neurons innervate several nuclei throughout the brain axis. The strongest connections are with forebrain areas associated with reward and stress and with hypothalamic structures involved in energy balance and feeding regulation. Furthermore, transcriptomic analysis of the Gck-expressing neurons revealed that they are enriched in receptors for hypothalamic-derived neuropeptides, adhesion molecules, and obesity and diabetes susceptibility transcription factors. Using retrograde labeling combined with immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization, we identify that Gck<sup>aPVT</sup> neurons receive direct inputs from well-defined hypothalamic populations, including arginine-vasopressin-, melanin-concentrating hormone-, orexin-, and proopiomelanocortin-expressing neurons. This detailed anatomical and transcriptomic characterization of Gck<sup>aPVT</sup> neurons provides a basis for functional studies of the integration of homeostatic and hedonic aspects of energy homeostasis, and for deciphering the potential role of these neurons in obesity and diabetes development.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Quantification of Neurite Degeneration with Enhanced Accuracy and Efficiency in an In Vitro Model of Parkinsons Disease</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Neurite degeneration is associated with early stages of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease, Parkinson&rsquo;s disease (PD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. One method that is commonly used to analyze neurite degeneration involves calculation of a Degeneration Index (DI) following utilization of the Analyze Particles tool of ImageJ to detect neurite fragments in micrographs of cultured cells. However, DI analyses are prone to several types of measurement error, can be time consuming to perform, and are limited in application. Here, we describe an improved method for performing DI analyses. Accuracy of measurements was enhanced through modification of selection criteria for detecting neurite fragments, removal of image artifacts and non-neurite materials from images, and optimization of image contrast. Such enhancements were implemented into an ImageJ macro that enables rapid and fully automated DI analysis of multiple images. The macro features operations for automated removal of cell bodies from micrographs, thus expanding the application of DI analyses to use in experiments involving dissociated cultures. We present experimental findings supporting that, compared with the conventional method, the enhanced analysis method yields measurements with increased accuracy and requires significantly less time to perform. Furthermore, we demonstrate the utility of the method to investigate neurite degeneration in a cell culture model of PD by conducting an experiment revealing the effects of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) on neurite degeneration induced by oxidative stress in human mesencephalic cells. This improved analysis method may be used to gain novel insight into factors underlying neurite degeneration and the progression of neurodegenerative disorders.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Transient Response of Basal Ganglia Network in Healthy and Low-Dopamine State</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>The basal ganglia (BG) are crucial for a variety of motor and cognitive functions. Changes induced by persistent low-dopamine (e.g., in Parkinson&rsquo;s disease; PD) result in aberrant changes in steady-state population activity (&beta; band oscillations) and the transient response of the BG. Typically, a brief cortical stimulation results in a triphasic response in the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr; an output of the BG). The properties of the triphasic responses are shaped by dopamine levels. While mechanisms underlying aberrant steady state activity are well studied, it is still unclear which BG interactions are crucial for the aberrant transient responses in the BG. Moreover, it is also unclear whether mechanisms underlying the aberrant changes in steady-state activity and transient response are the same. Here, we used numerical simulations of a network model of BG to identify the key factors that determine the shape of the transient responses. We show that an aberrant transient response of the SNr in the low-dopamine state involves changes in the direct pathway and the recurrent interactions within the globus pallidus externa (GPe) and between GPe and subthalamic nucleus (STN). However, the connections from D2-type spiny projection neurons (D2-SPN) to GPe are most crucial in shaping the transient response and by restoring them to their healthy level, we could restore the shape of transient response even in low-dopamine state. Finally, we show that the changes in BG that result in aberrant transient response are also sufficient to generate pathologic oscillatory activity in the steady state.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Avalanches during epithelial tissue growth; Uniform Growth and a drosophila eye disc model</a></h4>

              
                <p>by George Courcoubetis, Chi Xu, Sergey V. Nuzhdin, Stephan Haas</p>

Epithelial tissues constitute an exotic type of active matter with non-linear properties reminiscent of amorphous materials. In the context of a proliferating epithelium, modeled by the quasistatic vertex model, we identify novel discrete tissue scale rearrangements, i.e. cellular rearrangement avalanches, which are a form of collective cell movement. During the avalanches, the vast majority of cells retain their neighbors, and the resulting cellular trajectories are radial in the periphery, a vortex in the core. After the onset of these avalanches, the epithelial area grows discontinuously. The avalanches are found to be stochastic, and their strength is correlated with the density of cells in the tissue. Overall, avalanches redistribute accumulated local spatial pressure along the tissue. Furthermore, the distribution of avalanche magnitudes is found to obey a power law, with an exponent consistent with sheer induced avalanches in amorphous materials. To understand the role of avalanches in organ development, we simulate epithelial growth of the <i>Drosophila</i> eye disc during the third instar using a computational model, which includes both chemical and mechanistic signaling. During the third instar, the morphogenetic furrow (MF), a ~10 cell wide wave of apical area constriction propagates through the epithelium. These simulations are used to understand the details of the growth process, the effect of the MF on the growth dynamics on the tissue scale, and to make predictions for experimental observations. The avalanches are found to depend on the strength of the apical constriction of cells in the MF, with a stronger apical constriction leading to less frequent and more pronounced avalanches. The results herein highlight the dependence of simulated tissue growth dynamics on relaxation timescales, and serve as a guide for <i>in vitro</i> experiments.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Parameter inference for stochastic biochemical models from perturbation experiments parallelised at the single cell level</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Anđela Davidović, Remy Chait, Gregory Batt, Jakob Ruess</p>

Understanding and characterising biochemical processes inside single cells requires experimental platforms that allow one to perturb and observe the dynamics of such processes as well as computational methods to build and parameterise models from the collected data. Recent progress with experimental platforms and optogenetics has made it possible to expose each cell in an experiment to an individualised input and automatically record cellular responses over days with fine time resolution. However, methods to infer parameters of stochastic kinetic models from single-cell longitudinal data have generally been developed under the assumption that experimental data is sparse and that responses of cells to at most a few different input perturbations can be observed. Here, we investigate and compare different approaches for calculating parameter likelihoods of single-cell longitudinal data based on approximations of the chemical master equation (CME) with a particular focus on coupling the linear noise approximation (LNA) or moment closure methods to a Kalman filter. We show that, as long as cells are measured sufficiently frequently, coupling the LNA to a Kalman filter allows one to accurately approximate likelihoods and to infer model parameters from data even in cases where the LNA provides poor approximations of the CME. Furthermore, the computational cost of filtering-based iterative likelihood evaluation scales advantageously in the number of measurement times and different input perturbations and is thus ideally suited for data obtained from modern experimental platforms. To demonstrate the practical usefulness of these results, we perform an experiment in which single cells, equipped with an optogenetic gene expression system, are exposed to various different light-input sequences and measured at several hundred time points and use parameter inference based on iterative likelihood evaluation to parameterise a stochastic model of the system.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">In vitro machine learning-based CAR T immunological synapse quality measurements correlate with patient clinical outcomes</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Alireza Naghizadeh, Wei-chung Tsao, Jong Hyun Cho, Hongye Xu, Mohab Mohamed, Dali Li, Wei Xiong, Dimitri Metaxas, Carlos A. Ramos, Dongfang Liu</p>

The human immune system consists of a highly intelligent network of billions of independent, self-organized cells that interact with each other. Machine learning (ML) is an artificial intelligence (AI) tool that automatically processes huge amounts of image data. Immunotherapies have revolutionized the treatment of blood cancer. Specifically, one such therapy involves engineering immune cells to express chimeric antigen receptors (CAR), which combine tumor antigen specificity with immune cell activation in a single receptor. To improve their efficacy and expand their applicability to solid tumors, scientists optimize different CARs with different modifications. However, predicting and ranking the efficacy of different "off-the-shelf" immune products (e.g., CAR or Bispecific T-cell Engager [BiTE]) and selection of clinical responders are challenging in clinical practice. Meanwhile, identifying the optimal CAR construct for a researcher to further develop a potential clinical application is limited by the current, time-consuming, costly, and labor-intensive conventional tools used to evaluate efficacy. Particularly, more than 30 years of immunological synapse (IS) research data demonstrate that T cell efficacy is not only controlled by the specificity and avidity of the tumor antigen and T cell interaction, but also it depends on a collective process, involving multiple adhesion and regulatory molecules, as well as tumor microenvironment, spatially and temporally organized at the IS formed by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) and natural killer (NK) cells. The optimal function of cytotoxic lymphocytes (including CTL and NK) depends on IS quality. Recognizing the inadequacy of conventional tools and the importance of IS in immune cell functions, we investigate a new strategy for assessing CAR-T efficacy by quantifying CAR IS quality using the glass-support planar lipid bilayer system combined with ML-based data analysis. Previous studies in our group show that CAR-T IS quality correlates with antitumor activities <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. However, current manually quantified IS quality data analysis is time-consuming and labor-intensive with low accuracy, reproducibility, and repeatability. In this study, we develop a novel ML-based method to quantify thousands of CAR cell IS images with enhanced accuracy and speed. Specifically, we used artificial neural networks (ANN) to incorporate object detection into segmentation. The proposed ANN model extracts the most useful information to differentiate different IS datasets. The network output is flexible and produces bounding boxes, instance segmentation, contour outlines (borders), intensities of the borders, and segmentations without borders. Based on requirements, one or a combination of this information is used in statistical analysis. The ML-based automated algorithm quantified CAR-T IS data correlates with the clinical responder and non-responder treated with Kappa-CAR-T cells directly from patients. The results suggest that CAR cell IS quality can be used as a potential composite biomarker and correlates with antitumor activities in patients, which is sufficiently discriminative to further test the CAR IS quality as a clinical biomarker to predict response to CAR immunotherapy in cancer. For translational research, the method developed here can also provide guidelines for designing and optimizing numerous CAR constructs for potential clinical development.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Metaproteomics as a tool for studying the protein landscape of human-gut bacterial species</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Moses Stamboulian, Jamie Canderan, Yuzhen Ye</p>

Host-microbiome interactions and the microbial community have broad impact in human health and diseases. Most microbiome based studies are performed at the genome level based on next-generation sequencing techniques, but metaproteomics is emerging as a powerful technique to study microbiome functional activity by characterizing the complex and dynamic composition of microbial proteins. We conducted a large-scale survey of human gut microbiome metaproteomic data to identify generalist species that are ubiquitously expressed across all samples and specialists that are highly expressed in a small subset of samples associated with a certain phenotype. We were able to utilize the metaproteomic mass spectrometry data to reveal the protein landscapes of these species, which enables the characterization of the expression levels of proteins of different functions and underlying regulatory mechanisms, such as operons. Finally, we were able to recover a large number of open reading frames (ORFs) with spectral support, which were missed by <i>de novo</i> protein-coding gene predictors. We showed that a majority of the rescued ORFs overlapped with <i>de novo</i> predicted protein-coding genes, but on opposite strands or in different frames. Together, these demonstrate applications of metaproteomics for the characterization of important gut bacterial species.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Mathematical analysis of robustness of oscillations in models of the mammalian circadian clock</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Xiangyu Yao, Benjamin L. Heidebrecht, Jing Chen, John J. Tyson</p>

Circadian rhythms in a wide range of organisms are mediated by molecular mechanisms based on transcription-translation feedback. In this paper, we use bifurcation theory to explore mathematical models of genetic oscillators, based on Kim & Forger’s interpretation of the circadian clock in mammals. At the core of their models is a negative feedback loop whereby PER proteins (PER1 and PER2) bind to and inhibit their transcriptional activator, BMAL1. For oscillations to occur, the dissociation constant of the PER:BMAL1 complex, K^d, must be ≤ 0.04 nM, which is orders of magnitude smaller than a reasonable expectation of 1–10 nM for this protein complex. We relax this constraint by two modifications to Kim & Forger’s ‘single negative feedback’ (SNF) model: first, by introducing a multistep reaction chain for posttranscriptional modifications of <i>Per</i> mRNA and posttranslational phosphorylations of PER, and second, by replacing the first-order rate law for degradation of PER in the nucleus by a Michaelis-Menten rate law. These modifications increase the maximum allowable K^d to ~2 nM. In a third modification, we consider an alternative rate law for gene transcription to resolve an unrealistically large rate of <i>Per2</i> transcription at very low concentrations of BMAL1. Additionally, we studied extensions of the SNF model to include a second negative feedback loop (involving REV-ERB) and a supplementary positive feedback loop (involving ROR). Contrary to Kim & Forger’s observations of these extended models, we find that, with our modifications, the supplementary positive feedback loop makes the oscillations more robust than observed in the models with one or two negative feedback loops. However, all three models are similarly robust when accounting for circadian rhythms (~24 h period) with K^d ≥ 1 nM. Our results provide testable predictions for future experimental studies.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Quantitative input–output dynamics of a c-di-GMP signal transduction cascade in Vibrio cholerae</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Andrew A. Bridges, Jojo A. Prentice, Chenyi Fei, Ned S. Wingreen, Bonnie L. Bassler</p>

Bacterial biofilms are multicellular communities that collectively overcome environmental threats and clinical treatments. To regulate the biofilm lifecycle, bacteria commonly transduce sensory information via the second messenger molecule cyclic diguanylate (c-di-GMP). Using experimental and modeling approaches, we quantitatively capture c-di-GMP signal transmission via the bifunctional polyamine receptor NspS-MbaA, from ligand binding to output, in the pathogen <i>Vibrio cholerae</i>. Upon binding of norspermidine or spermidine, NspS-MbaA synthesizes or degrades c-di-GMP, respectively, which, in turn, drives alterations specifically to biofilm gene expression. A long-standing question is how output specificity is achieved via c-di-GMP, a diffusible molecule that regulates dozens of effectors. We show that NspS-MbaA signals locally to specific effectors, sensitizing <i>V</i>. <i>cholerae</i> to polyamines. However, local signaling is not required for specificity, as changes to global cytoplasmic c-di-GMP levels can selectively regulate biofilm genes. This work establishes the input–output dynamics underlying c-di-GMP signaling, which could be useful for developing bacterial manipulation strategies.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Periodic synchronisation of dengue epidemics in Thailand over the last 5 decades driven by temperature and immunity</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Bernardo García-Carreras, Bingyi Yang, Mary K. Grabowski, Lawrence W. Sheppard, Angkana T. Huang, Henrik Salje, Hannah Eleanor Clapham, Sopon Iamsirithaworn, Pawinee Doung-Ngern, Justin Lessler, Derek A. T. Cummings</p>

The spatial distribution of dengue and its vectors (spp. <i>Aedes</i>) may be the widest it has ever been, and projections suggest that climate change may allow the expansion to continue. However, less work has been done to understand how climate variability and change affects dengue in regions where the pathogen is already endemic. In these areas, the waxing and waning of immunity has a large impact on temporal dynamics of cases of dengue haemorrhagic fever. Here, we use 51 years of data across 72 provinces and characterise spatiotemporal patterns of dengue in Thailand, where dengue has caused almost 1.5 million cases over the last 30 years, and examine the roles played by temperature and dynamics of immunity in giving rise to those patterns. We find that timescales of multiannual oscillations in dengue vary in space and time and uncover an interesting spatial phenomenon: Thailand has experienced multiple, periodic synchronisation events. We show that although patterns in synchrony of dengue are similar to those observed in temperature, the relationship between the two is most consistent during synchronous periods, while during asynchronous periods, temperature plays a less prominent role. With simulations from temperature-driven models, we explore how dynamics of immunity interact with temperature to produce the observed patterns in synchrony. The simulations produced patterns in synchrony that were similar to observations, supporting an important role of immunity. We demonstrate that multiannual oscillations produced by immunity can lead to asynchronous dynamics and that synchrony in temperature can then synchronise these dengue dynamics. At higher mean temperatures, immune dynamics can be more predominant, and dengue dynamics more insensitive to multiannual fluctuations in temperature, suggesting that with rising mean temperatures, dengue dynamics may become increasingly asynchronous. These findings can help underpin predictions of disease patterns as global temperatures rise.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The objective of this study was to evaluate functional and safety outcomes of endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) versus medical management (MM) in patients with M2 occlusion and examine their association with perfusion imaging mismatch and stroke severity.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In a pooled, patient-level analysis of 3 randomized controlled trials (EXTEND-IA, EXTEND-and IA-TNK parts 1 and 2) and 2 prospective nonrandomized studies (INSPIRE and SELECT), we evaluated EVT association with 90-day functional independence (modified Rankin Scale [mRS] = 0–2) in isolated M2 occlusions as compared to medical management overall and in subgroups by mismatch profile status and stroke severity.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We included 517 patients (EVT = 195 and MM = 322), baseline median (interquartile range [IQR]) National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) was 13 (8–19) in EVT versus 10 (6–15) in MM, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001. Pretreatment ischemic core did not differ (EVT = 10 [0–24] ml vs MM = 9 [3–21] ml, <i>p</i> = 0.59). Compared to MM, EVT was more frequently associated with functional independence (68.3 vs 61.6%, adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 2.42, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.25–4.67, <i>p</i> = 0.008, inverse probability of treatment weights [IPTW]-OR = 1.75, 95% CI = 1.00–3.75, <i>p</i> = 0.05) with a shift toward better mRS outcomes (adjusted cOR = 2.02, 95% CI:1.23–3.29, <i>p</i> = 0.005), and lower mortality (5 vs 10%, aOR = 0.32, 95% CI = 0.12–0.87, <i>p</i> = 0.025). EVT was associated with higher functional independence in patients with a perfusion mismatch profile (EVT = 70.7% vs MM = 61.3%, aOR = 2.29, 95% CI = 1.09–4.79, <i>p</i> = 0.029, IPTW-OR = 2.02, 1.08–3.78, <i>p</i> = 0.029), whereas no difference was found in those without mismatch (EVT = 43.8% vs MM = 62.7%, <i>p</i> = 0.17, IPTW-OR: 0.71, 95% CI = 0.18–2.78, <i>p</i> = 0.62). Functional independence was more frequent with EVT in patients with moderate or severe strokes, as defined by baseline NIHSS above any thresholds from 6 to 10, whereas there was no difference between groups with milder strokes below these thresholds.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>In patients with M2 occlusion, EVT was associated with improved clinical outcomes when compared to MM. This association was primarily observed in patients with a mismatch profile and those with higher stroke severity. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Memory is supported by a network of brain regions, with the hippocampus serving a critical role in this cognitive process. Previous meta-analyses on the association between hippocampal structure and memory have largely focused on adults. Multiple studies have since suggested that hippocampal volume is related to memory performance in children and adolescents; however, the strength and direction of this relation varies across reports, and thus, remains unclear. To further understand this brain–behavior relation, we conducted a meta-analysis to investigate the association between hippocampal volume (assessed as total volume) and memory during typical development. Across 25 studies and 61 memory outcomes with 1357 participants, results showed a small, but significant, positive association between total hippocampal volume and memory performance. Estimates of the variability across studies in the relation between total volume and memory were not explained by differences in memory task type (delayed vs. immediate; relational vs. nonrelational), participant age range, or the method of normalization of hippocampal volumes. Overall, findings suggest that larger total hippocampal volume relates to better memory performance in children and adolescents and that this relation is similar across the memory types and age ranges assessed. To facilitate enhanced generalization across studies in the future, we discuss considerations for the field moving forward.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Activin A regulates the excitability of hippocampal mossy cells</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Mossy cells (MCs) in the hilus of the dentate gyrus (DG) receive increasing attention as a major player controlling information processing in the DG network. Furthermore, disturbed MC activity has been implicated in widespread neuropsychiatric disorders such as epilepsy and major depression. Using whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from MCs in acute hippocampal slices from wild type and transgenic mice, we demonstrate that activin, a member of the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) family, has a strong neuromodulatory effect on MC activity. Disruption of activin receptor signaling reduced MC firing, dampened their excitatory input and augmented their inhibitory input. By contrast, acute application of recombinant activin A strongly increased MC activity and promoted excitatory synaptic drive. Notably, similar changes of MC activity have been observed in a rodent model of depression and after antidepressant drug therapy, respectively. Given that a rise in activin signaling particularly in the DG has been proposed as a mechanism of antidepressant action, our data suggest that the effect of activin on MC excitability might make a considerable contribution in this regard.</p>
