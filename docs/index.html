              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">PLUS: Predicting cancer metastasis potential based on positive and unlabeled learning</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Junyi Zhou, Xiaoyu Lu, Wennan Chang, Changlin Wan, Xiongbin Lu, Chi Zhang, Sha Cao</p>

Metastatic cancer accounts for over 90% of all cancer deaths, and evaluations of metastasis potential are vital for minimizing the metastasis-associated mortality and achieving optimal clinical decision-making. Computational assessment of metastasis potential based on large-scale transcriptomic cancer data is challenging because metastasis events are not always clinically detectable. The under-diagnosis of metastasis events results in biased classification labels, and classification tools using biased labels may lead to inaccurate estimations of metastasis potential. This issue is further complicated by the unknown metastasis prevalence at the population level, the small number of confirmed metastasis cases, and the high dimensionality of the candidate molecular features. Our proposed algorithm, called Positive and unlabeled Learning from Unbalanced cases and Sparse structures (PLUS), is the first to use a positive and unlabeled learning framework to account for the under-detection of metastasis events in building a classifier. PLUS is specifically tailored for studying metastasis that deals with the unbalanced instance allocation as well as unknown metastasis prevalence, which are not considered by other methods. PLUS achieves superior performance on synthetic datasets compared with other state-of-the-art methods. Application of PLUS to The Cancer Genome Atlas Pan-Cancer gene expression data generated metastasis potential predictions that show good agreement with the clinical follow-up data, in addition to predictive genes that have been validated by independent single-cell RNA-sequencing datasets.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Regulation of sedimentation rate shapes the evolution of multicellularity in a close unicellular relative of animals</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Omaya Dudin, Sébastien Wielgoss, Aaron M. New, Iñaki Ruiz-Trillo</p>

Significant increases in sedimentation rate accompany the evolution of multicellularity. These increases should lead to rapid changes in ecological distribution, thereby affecting the costs and benefits of multicellularity and its likelihood to evolve. However, how genetic and cellular traits control this process, their likelihood of emergence over evolutionary timescales, and the variation in these traits as multicellularity evolves are still poorly understood. Here, using isolates of the ichthyosporean genus <i>Sphaeroforma</i>-close unicellular relatives of animals with brief transient multicellular life stages-we demonstrate that sedimentation rate is a highly variable and evolvable trait affected by at least 2 distinct physical mechanisms. First, we find extensive (>300×) variation in sedimentation rates for different <i>Sphaeroforma</i> species, mainly driven by size and density during the unicellular-to-multicellular life cycle transition. Second, using experimental evolution with sedimentation rate as a focal trait, we readily obtained, for the first time, fast settling and multicellular <i>Sphaeroforma arctica</i> isolates. Quantitative microscopy showed that increased sedimentation rates most often arose by incomplete cellular separation after cell division, leading to clonal “clumping” multicellular variants with increased size and density. Strikingly, density increases also arose by an acceleration of the nuclear doubling time relative to cell size. Similar size- and density-affecting phenotypes were observed in 4 additional species from the <i>Sphaeroforma</i> genus, suggesting that variation in these traits might be widespread in the marine habitat. By resequencing evolved isolates to high genomic coverage, we identified mutations in regulators of cytokinesis, plasma membrane remodeling, and chromatin condensation that may contribute to both clump formation and the increase in the nuclear number-to-volume ratio. Taken together, this study illustrates how extensive cellular control of density and size drive sedimentation rate variation, likely shaping the onset and further evolution of multicellularity.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Transient global ischemia is a leading cause of learning and memory dysfunction and induces a pattern of delayed neuronal death in the CA1 subfield of the hippocampus by down-regulating GluR2 mRNA AMPA receptors in this cerebral area. This study sought to investigate the neuroprotective effect of coumestrol against spatial memory impairment induced by global ischemia that leads to neural death by reducing the GluR2 receptors content in the hippocampal CA1 area. Our studies demonstrated that coumestrol administration prevented spatial memory deficits in mice. These findings suggest a cognitive enhancement role of coumestrol against cognitive impairment in ischemic events.</p>

                In January 2012, Cell Reports launched with an editorial by Dr. Boyana Konforti, its founding editor-in-chief (Konforti, 2012; see web resources). The piece was called “More than the Sum of Its Parts,” and it introduced the journal’s commitment to a set of goals and values: open access, collaborative work, broad scope, and a specific type of article called a report.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Principles of GABAergic signaling in developing cortical network dynamics</a></h4>

              
                Network functions of GABA-releasing interneurons undergo profound developmental changes. Kirmse and Zhang outline a conceptual framework describing how the strengthening of synaptic inhibition enables the cortex to progressively disengage from extra-cortical drive. They propose that the transition to interneuron-mediated inhibitory stabilization of recurrent glutamatergic subnetworks is a central principle of corticogenesis.

                Learning and producing skilled behavior requires an internal measure of performance. Duffy et al. examine dopamine neurons’ relationship to natural song in singing birds. Spontaneous dopamine activity correlates with song fluctuations in a manner consistent with evaluation of natural behavioral variations, independent of external perturbations, cues, or rewards.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">PRMT7 ablation stimulates anti-tumor immunity and sensitizes melanoma to immune checkpoint blockade</a></h4>

              
                Srour et al. report that PRMT7 loss in melanoma increases immune cell infiltration and the sensitivity to immunotherapy. Mechanistically, PRMT7 loss activates retinoic acid-inducible gene I-like receptors (RLR) pathway. Genome-wide analysis shows that PRMT7 regulates the IFN pathway, antigen presentation, and chemokine signaling. Thus, inhibiting PRMT7 improves treatment outcomes in melanoma. PRMT7 deficiency in melanoma enhances sensitivity to immune checkpoint therapy.

                Yi et al. perform a genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screening to identify host genes critical for H7N9 infection. They highlight 12 host genes that are involved in the H7N9 life cycle, and demonstrate that CYTH2 mediates viral transportation in endosomes. CYTH2 is an attractive target for developing host-directed therapeutics.

                Huettner et al. show that glycan-binding HIV-1 broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) and the unmutated common ancestor of an N332/V3 bnAb lineage cross-react with self- and non-self N-glycans and glycoprotein antigens from the different life stages of Schistosoma mansoni. This presents a potential strategy for elicitation of glycan-reactive bnAbs through vaccination.

                Liu et al. find that gut microbes impact intestinal stem cell differentiation, thus changing epithelial composition. All microbes stimulate the Imd/Relish pathway (NF-κB), but pathogens additionally generate stress and damage that stimulate the JAK-STAT pathway, leading to accumulation of enteroendocrine cells.

                Zhang et al. find that Rif1-null ESCs can contribute to trophectoderm (TE) lineages and functional placenta, mainly via upregulation of key 2-cell embryo (2C)-related genes including Hmgn3. Overexpression of Hmgn3 also promotes the conversion of trophoblast stem cells (TSCs). These findings identify two crucial modules for TE specification.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Actin-related protein 5 functions as a novel modulator of MyoD and MyoG in skeletal muscle and in rhabdomyosarcoma</a></h4>

              
                Myogenic regulatory factors (MRFs) are pivotal transcription factors in myogenic differentiation. MyoD commits cells to the skeletal muscle lineage by inducing myogenic genes through recruitment of chromatin remodelers to its target loci. This study showed that Actin-related protein 5 (Arp5) acts as an inhibitory regulator of MyoD and MyoG by binding to their cysteine-rich (CR) region, which overlaps with the region essential for their epigenetic functions. Arp5 expression was faint in skeletal muscle tissues. Excessive Arp5 in mouse hind limbs caused skeletal muscle fiber atrophy. Further, Arp5 overexpression in myoblasts inhibited myotube formation by diminishing myogenic gene expression, whereas Arp5 depletion augmented myogenic gene expression. Arp5 disturbed MyoD-mediated chromatin remodeling through competition with the three-amino-acid-loop-extension-class homeodomain transcription factors the Pbx1–Meis1 heterodimer for binding to the CR region. This antimyogenic function was independent of the INO80 chromatin remodeling complex, although Arp5 is an important component of that. In rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) cells, Arp5 expression was significantly higher than in normal myoblasts and skeletal muscle tissue, probably contributing to MyoD and MyoG activity dysregulation. Arp5 depletion in RMS partially restored myogenic properties while inhibiting tumorigenic properties. Thus, Arp5 is a novel modulator of MRFs in skeletal muscle differentiation.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Glypican-1 drives unconventional secretion of Fibroblast Growth Factor 2</a></h4>

              
                Fibroblast Growth Factor 2 (FGF2) is a tumor cell survival factor that is transported into the extracellular space by an unconventional secretory mechanism. Cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans are known to play an essential role in this process. Unexpectedly, we found that among the diverse sub-classes consisting of syndecans, perlecans, glypicans and others, Glypican-1 (GPC1) is the principle and rate-limiting factor that drives unconventional secretion of FGF2. By contrast, we demonstrate GPC1 to be dispensable for FGF2 signaling into cells. We provide first insights into the structural basis for GPC1-dependent FGF2 secretion, identifying disaccharides with N-linked sulfate groups to be enriched in the heparan sulfate chains of GPC1 to which FGF2 binds with high affinity. Our findings have broad implications for the role of GPC1 as a key molecule in tumor progression.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Inhibiting host protein deposition on urinary catheters reduces associated urinary tract infections</a></h4>

              
                Microbial adhesion to medical devices is common for hospital-acquired infections, particularly for urinary catheters. If not properly treated these infections cause complications and exacerbate antimicrobial resistance. Catheter use elicits bladder inflammation, releasing host serum-proteins, including fibrinogen, into the bladder, which deposit on the urinary catheter. Enterococcus faecalis uses fibrinogen as a scaffold to bind and persist in the bladder despite antibiotic treatments. Inhibition of fibrinogen-pathogen interaction significantly reduces infection. Here, we show deposited fibrinogen is advantageous for uropathogens E. faecalis, E. coli, P. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae, A. baumannii and C. albicans, suggesting that targeting catheter protein deposition may reduce colonization creating an effective intervention for catheter-associated urinary tract infections. In a mouse model of CAUTI, host-protein deposition was reduced, using liquid-infused silicone catheters, resulting in decreased colonization on catheters, in bladders, and dissemination in vivo. Furthermore, proteomics revealed a significant decrease in deposition of host-secreted proteins on liquid-infused catheter surfaces. Our findings suggest targeting microbial binding scaffolds may be an effective antibiotic-sparing intervention for use against catheter-associated urinary tract infections and other medical device infections.

                Performing several actions in swift succession is often necessary to exploit known contingencies in the environment. However, after a change in the contingency rules, the ability to appropriately adapt rapid action sequences must be procured for continued success. By combining analyses of behavioural microstructure with circuit-specific tracing in mice, we report on a relationship between action timing-variability and successful adaptation that relies on post-synaptic targets of primary motor cortical (M1) projections to dorsolateral striatum (DLS). We found that M1 hyperdirect pathway projections to the STN also send dense axonal collaterals to external globus pallidus and dorsal striatum, with the highest synaptic volumes found in the DLS. Specific interruption of the M1[-&gt;]DLS circuit reduced the proportion of successful sequences while speeding-up and reducing action timing-variability, revealing a role for M1[-&gt;]DLS circuitry in setting the exploration/exploitation balance that is required for adaptively guiding the timing and success of instrumental action.

                Tractography combined with regions of interest (ROIs) has been used to non-invasively study the structural connectivity of the cortex as well as to assess the reliability of these connections. However, the subcortical connectome (subcortex to subcortex) has not been comprehensively examined, in part due to the difficulty of performing tractography in this complex and compact region. In this study, we performed an in vivo investigation using tractography to assess the feasibility and reliability of mapping known connections between structures of the subcortex using the test-retest dataset from the Human Connectome Project (HCP). We further validated our observations using a separate unrelated subjects dataset from the HCP. Quantitative assessment was performed by computing tract densities and spatial overlap of identified connections between subcortical ROIs. Further, known connections between structures of the basal ganglia and thalamus were identified and visually inspected, comparing tractography reconstructed trajectories with descriptions from tract-tracing studies. Our observations demonstrate both the feasibility and reliability of using a data-driven tractography-based approach to map the subcortical connectome in vivo.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cortical integration of higher-order thalamic inputs is lineage-dependent</a></h4>

              
                Primary sensory cortex receives and integrates inputs from first-order and higher-order thalamic nuclei. First-order inputs convey sensory information from the periphery and exhibit simple response properties, whereas higher-order inputs exhibit more complex response properties, provide contextual feedback, and can modulate first-order inputs. Here we show that the way in which cortical neurons integrate these thalamic inputs, reflects the progenitor cell from which the cortical neurons derive. Within layer 4 of mouse primary somatosensory cortex, excitatory neurons that derive from apical intermediate progenitors exhibit multi-whisker response properties and receive higher-order thalamic input, in a manner consistent with their dendritic morphology. These properties depend upon the expression levels of the transcription factor Lhx2, which when increased, abolishes the higher-order properties of apical intermediate progenitor-derived neurons, and disrupts the induction of sensory-evoked plasticity. These data reveal a lineage-dependent mechanism that establishes the integration and functional contribution of higher-order thalamic inputs within cortex.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Serotonin Modulates an Inhibitory Input to the Central Amygdala from the Ventral Periaqueductal Gray</a></h4>

              
                Fear is an adaptive state that drives defensive behavioral responses to specific and imminent threats. The central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) is a critical site of adaptations that are required for the acquisition and expression of fear, in part due to alterations in the activity of inputs to the CeA. Here, we characterize a novel GABAergic input to the CeA from the ventral periaqueductal gray area (vPAG) using fiber photometry and ex vivo whole-cell slice electrophysiology combined with optogenetics and pharmacology. GABA transmission from this ascending vPAG-CeA input was enhanced by bath application of serotonin via activation of serotonin type 2C (5HT2C) receptors. Results indicate that these receptors are presynaptic. Interestingly, we found that GABA release from the vPAG-CeA input is enhanced following fear learning via activation of 5HT2C receptors and that this pathway is dynamically engaged during fear learning. Additionally, we characterized serotonin release in the CeA during fear learning and recall for the first time using fiber photometry coupled to a serotonin biosensor. Together, these findings describe a mechanism by which serotonin modulates GABA release from ascending vPAG GABA inputs to the CeA and characterize a role for this pathway in fear learning.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Rhythmic modulation of prediction errors: a possible role for the beta-range in speech processing</a></h4>

              
                Natural speech perception requires processing the current acoustic input while keeping in mind the preceding one and predicting the next. This complex computational problem could be handled by a multi timescale hierarchical inferential process that coordinates information flow up and down the language hierarchy. While theta and low-gamma neural frequency scales are convincingly involved in bottom-up syllable-tracking and phoneme-level speech encoding, the beta rhythm is more loosely associated with top-down processes without being assigned yet a specific computational function. Here we tested the hypothesis that the beta rhythm drives the precision of states during the speech recognition hierarchical inference process. We used a predictive coding model that recognizes syllables on-line in natural sentences, in which the precision of prediction errors is rhythmically modulated, resulting in alternating bottom-up vs. top-down processing regimes. We show that recognition performance increases with the rate of precision updates, with an optimal efficacy in the beta range (around 20 Hz). The model further performs when prediction errors pertaining respectively to syllable timing and syllable identity oscillate in antiphase. These results suggest that online syllable recognition globally benefits from the alternation of bottom-up and top-down dominant regime at beta rate, and that the gain is stronger when different features are also analyzed in alternation. These results speak to a discontinuous account of inferential operations in speech processing.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Repeated ethanol exposure and withdrawal alters ACE2 expression in discrete brain regions: Implications for SARS-CoV-2 infection</a></h4>

              
                Emerging evidence suggests that people with alcohol use disorders are at higher risk for SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 engages angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) receptors for cellular entry. While ACE2 and TMPRSS2 genes are upregulated in the cortex of alcohol-dependent individuals, information on expression in specific brain regions and neural populations implicated in SARS-CoV-2 neuroinvasion, particularly monoaminergic neurons, is limited. We sought to clarify how chronic alcohol exposure affects ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression in monoaminergic brainstem circuits and other putative SARS-CoV-2 entry points. C57BL/6J mice were exposed to chronic intermittent ethanol (CIE) vapor for 4 weeks and brains were examined using immunofluorescence. We observed increased ACE2 levels in the olfactory bulb and hypothalamus following CIE, which are known to mediate SARS-CoV-2 neuroinvasion. Total ACE2 immunoreactivity was also elevated in the raphe magnus (RMG), raphe obscurus (ROB), and locus coeruleus (LC), while in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN), ROB, and LC we observed increased colocalization of ACE2 with monoaminergic neurons. ACE2 also increased in the periaqueductal gray (PAG) and decreased in the amygdala. Whereas ACE2 was detected in most brain regions, TMPRSS2 was only detected in the olfactory bulb and DRN but was not significantly altered after CIE. Our results suggest that previous alcohol exposure may increase the risk of SARS-CoV-2 neuroinvasion and render brain circuits involved in cardiovascular and respiratory function as well as emotional processing more vulnerable to infection, making adverse outcomes more likely. Additional studies are needed to define a direct link between alcohol use and COVID-19 infection.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neuron-specific transcriptomic signatures indicate neuroinflammation and altered neuronal activity in ASD temporal cortex</a></h4>

              
                Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a highly heterogeneous disorder, yet transcriptomic profiling of bulk brain tissue has identified substantial convergence among dysregulated genes and pathways in ASD. However, this approach lacks cell-specific resolution. We performed comprehensive transcriptomic analyses on bulk tissue and laser-capture microdissected (LCM) neurons of 59 postmortem human brains (27 ASD and 32 matched controls) in the superior temporal gyrus (STG) ranging from 2-73 years of age. In bulk tissue, synaptic signaling, heat shock protein-related pathways and RNA splicing were significantly altered in ASD. There was age-dependent dysregulation of genes involved in GABA (GAD1 and GAD2) and glutamate (SLC38A1) signaling pathways. In LCM neurons, AP-1 mediated neuroinflammation and insulin/IGF-1 signaling pathways were upregulated in ASD, while mitochondrial function, ribosome and spliceosome components were downregulated. GABA synthesizing enzymes GAD1 and GAD2 were both downregulated in ASD neurons. Alterations in small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) associated with splicing events suggested interplay between snoRNA dysregulation and splicing disruption in neurons of individuals with ASD. Our findings supported the fundamental hypothesis of altered neuronal communication in ASD, demonstrated that inflammation was elevated at least in part in ASD neurons, and may reveal windows of opportunity for biotherapeutics to target the trajectory of gene expression and clinical manifestation of ASD throughout the human lifespan.

                Modification by sialylated glycans can affect protein functions, underlying mechanisms that control animal development and physiology. Sialylation relies on a dedicated pathway involving evolutionarily conserved enzymes, including CMP-sialic acid synthetase (CSAS) and sialyltransferase (SiaT) that mediate the activation of sialic acid and its transfer onto glycan termini, respectively. In Drosophila, CSAS and DSiaT genes function in the nervous system, affecting neural transmission and excitability. We found that these genes function in different cells: the function of CSAS is restricted to glia, while DSiaT functions in neurons. This partition of the sialylation pathway allows for regulation of neural functions via a glia-mediated control of neural sialylation. The sialylation genes were shown to be required for tolerance to heat and oxidative stress and for maintenance of the normal level of voltage-gated sodium channels. Our results uncovered a unique bipartite sialylation pathway that mediates glia-neuron coupling and regulates neural excitability and stress tolerance.

                Newly formed memories aren't quarantined one from another when first encoded; rather, they are interlinked with other memories that were encoded in temporal proximity or share semantic features. In this study, we selectively biased memory processing during sleep in humans to test the hypothesis that memories' contexts influence their consolidation. Participants formed 18 idiosyncratic narratives, each linking four objects together. They then memorized random on-screen spatial positions assigned to each of the 72 objects. During sleep, 12 object-specific sounds were unobtrusively presented, thereby cuing the associated memories and improving spatial recall for those objects. As predicted, memory for uncued objects that were contextually linked with cued objects benefited as well. The correlational structure of spectral power for electrophysiological responses revealed that sleep spindles supported context reinstatement and predicted context-related memory benefits. Moreover, context-specific electrophysiological activity patterns emerged during sleep. We conclude that when an individual memory is reactivated during sleep, the corresponding encoding context is also reinstated, impacting consolidation and enhancing subsequent retrieval of associated knowledge.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Molecular Control of Circuit Plasticity and the Permanence of Imprinted Odor Memory</a></h4>

              
                Behavioral imprinting is a distinct form of learning that has a lifelong impact on social interactions and affectional behaviors1-4. Unlike other forms of memory, imprinting does not require conspicuous association of stimuli; exposure per se appears sufficient to induce memories that neither undergo extinction nor are altered by experience later in life. The site of storage of imprinted memory and the mechanisms that control its formation and permanence are unknown. Here we uncover a molecular mechanism that controls olfactory imprinting, which underlies behaviors including kin and nest recognition, maternal attachment, and homing5-10. We show that odor exposure during the perinatal period converts an innately aversive odor into a homing signal. The behavioral change is associated with odor-induced changes in the projection patterns of olfactory sensory neuron (OSN) expressing the cognate receptors for the exposed odor. We show that the Wnt signaling receptor Frizzled1 (Fzd1) acts as a master regulator of the critical period of OSN development and is responsible for closing the critical period to prevent further changes in the neural circuit. In Fzd1 knockout mice axon projection patterns are continually modified by sensory experience. As Fzd1 knockout abolishes the developmental critical period, it also abolishes odor imprinting. Specific knockout of Fzd1 in the OSNs have the same effect. Mechanistically, Fzd1 controls the critical period through an autoregulated shutdown and by controlling an activity-driven regulon in the OSNs. The transient expression and the subsequent downregulation of Fzd1 leads to the irreversible closure of the critical period to lock in circuits established during the critical period. The evidence suggests that imprinted odor memory is stored in the patterns of connectivity at the first synapse in the olfactory bulb. Early odor experience induces changes in the OSN projection to alter connectivity with innate circuits to establish a life-long memory.

                Background: The shaker rat carries a naturally occurring mutation leading to progressive ataxia characterized by Purkinje cell (PC) loss. We previously reported on fine-mapping the shaker locus to the long arm of the rat X chromosome. In this work, we sought to identify the mutated gene underlying the shaker phenotype and confirm its identity by functional complementation. Methods: We fine-mapped the candidate region and analyzed cerebellar transcriptomes to identify deleterious variants. We generated an adeno-associated virus (AAV) targeting solute carrier family 9, member A6 (Slc9a6) expression to PCs using a mouse L7-6 (L7) promoter, as well as a control green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing virus. We administered AAVs prior to the onset of PC degeneration through intracerebroventricular injection and evaluated the molecular, cellular, and motor phenotypes. Results: We identified a XM_217630.9 (Slc9a6):c.[191_195delinsA] variant in the Slc9a6 gene that segregated with disease. This mutation is predicted to generate a truncated sodium-hydrogen exchanger 6 (NHE6) protein, p.(Ala64Glufs*23). Administration of AAV9-PHP.eB expressing rat Slc9a6 prior to symptom onset reduced the shaker motor, molecular, and cellular phenotypes. Interpretation: Slc9a6 is mutated in shaker and also in human Christianson syndrome, an epileptic encephalopathy. AAV-based gene therapy may be a viable therapeutic strategy for Christianson syndrome, and the shaker rat model may aid in therapeutic development.

                The evolution of advanced cognition in vertebrates is associated with two independent innovations in the forebrain: the six-layered neocortex in mammals and the dorsal ventricular ridge (DVR) in sauropsids (reptiles and birds). How these novelties arose in vertebrate ancestors remains unclear. To reconstruct forebrain evolution in tetrapods, we built a cell type atlas of the telencephalon of the salamander Pleurodeles waltl. Our molecular, developmental, and connectivity data indicate that parts of the sauropsid DVR trace back to tetrapod ancestors. In contrast, the salamander dorsal pallium is devoid of cellular and molecular characteristics of the mammalian neocortex, yet shares similarities with entorhinal cortex and subiculum. Our findings chart the series of innovations that resulted in the emergence of the sauropsid DVR, and the mammalian six-layered neocortex.

                It is well established that immune cells play crucial roles after spinal cord injury (SCI). However, our knowledge of the contributions of various immune cells to injury progression and repair is incomplete. These gaps in understanding hamper development of SCI therapeutics. In the current study, using single-cell RNA sequencing, and transcriptomic analysis, the populations of resident and circulating CD45+ immune cells present within the uninjured and injured mouse spinal cord were identified. In the uninjured and subacutely-injured (7 day) spinal cord, most CD45+ cells were microglia while in chronic SCI (60 day) B cells predominated. Examination of microglia and B cell clusters showed subtype-specific alterations after SCI, including the presence of both immature and mature B cells chronically. Analysis of the expression of signaling partners in B cells and microglia identified injury-related microglia-B-cell interactions. This sequencing resource establishes unidentified interactions revealing new mechanisms to target inflammatory responses for SCI repair.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Post-activation depression produces extensor H-reflex suppression following flexor afferent conditioning</a></h4>

              
                Suppression of the extensor H-reflex by flexor afferent conditioning is thought to be produced by a long-lasting inhibition of extensor Ia-afferent terminals via primary afferent depolarization (PAD) activated by GABAA receptors. Considering the recent finding that PAD does not produce presynaptic inhibition of Ia-afferent terminals, we examined if H-reflex suppression is instead mediated by post-activation depression of the test extensor Ia-afferents triggered by PAD-evoked spikes and/or by a long-lasting inhibition of the extensor motoneurons. A brief conditioning vibration of the flexor tendon suppressed both the extensor soleus H-reflex and the tonic discharge of soleus motor units for 300 ms, indicating that part of the H-reflex suppression was mediated by a long-lasting inhibition of the extensor motoneurons. When activating the flexor afferents electrically to produce conditioning, the soleus H-reflex was also suppressed for 300 ms, but only when a short-latency reflex was evoked in the soleus muscle by the conditioning input itself. In mice, a similar short-latency reflex was evoked when optogenetic or afferent activation of GABAergic (GAD2+) neurons produced PAD large enough to evoke orthodromic spikes in the test Ia-afferents, causing post-activation depression of subsequent monosynaptic excitatory-post-synaptic potentials. The time course of this post-activation depression and related H-reflex suppression (lasting 2 s) was like rate-dependent depression that is also due to post-activation depression. We conclude that extensor H-reflex inhibition by brief flexor afferent conditioning is produced by both post-activation depression of extensor Ia-afferents and long-lasting inhibition of extensor motoneurons, rather than from PAD directly inhibiting Ia afferent terminals.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The pre-Bötzinger complex is necessary for the expression of post-inspiration</a></h4>

              
                The mammalian three-phase respiratory motor pattern of inspiration, post-inspiration and expiration is expressed in spinal and cranial motor nerve activities. This pattern is generated by a hierarchical brainstem-wide pre-motor network. However, the local rhythmogenic circuit of the pre-Botzinger complex (pre-BotC) was established as the noeud vitale necessary and sufficient to initiate inspiration. In present study, we tested the effect of unilateral and bilateral inactivation of the pre-BotC (microinjection of the GABAA receptor agonist isoguvacine 10 mM, 50 nl) on respiratory motor activities in an in situ perfused brainstem preparation of rat. As expected, bilateral inactivation of the pre-BotC triggered cessation of phrenic (PNA), hypoglossal (HNA) and vagal (VNA) nerve activities for 15-20 min. Partial recovery from bilateral isoguvacine injection was characterized by erratic activity in all recorded motor nerves reminiscent to patterns observed after disturbed excitatory-inhibitory balance within the local pre-BotC circuit. Surprisingly, ipsilateral isoguvacine injections into the pre-BotC triggered transient (6-8 min) cessation of inspiratory and post-inspiratory VNA (p<0.001) and suppressed inspiratory HNA by -70 +/- 15% (p<0.01), while inspiratory PNA burst frequency increased by 46 +/- 30% (p<0.01). Taken together, these observations confirm the role of the pre-BotC as the noeud vitale of the mammalian respiratory network in situ and highlight a significant role for the pre-BotC in the expression of vagal post-inspiratory and inspiratory activity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Individual differences in late positive potential amplitude and theta power predict cue-induced eating</a></h4>

              
                Both the brain's reward and cognitive control systems are known to regulate cue-induced eating. Although it is established that individual differences in affective processing of food-related cues predict cue-induced eating, we have yet to investigate how both affective and cognitive mechanisms act in tandem to regulate cue-induced eating. In the present study, our goal was to characterize the mechanisms that make some individuals vulnerable to cue-induced eating while leaving others resilient. We recorded electroencephalogram (EEG) from 59 adults while they viewed emotional & food-related images that preceded the delivery of food rewards (candies) or nonfood objects (beads [control]). We measured the amplitude of the late positive potential (LPP; a measure of motivational salience) in response to the images and power in the theta (4-8 Hz) frequency band (a measure of cognitive control) after the candy or bead was dispensed to the participant. We found that individuals with larger LPP responses to food cues than to pleasant images (C>P group) ate significantly more during the experiment than did those with larger LPP responses to pleasant images than to food cues (P>C group, p < 0.001). Furthermore, we found that individuals with higher theta power after dispensation of the candy than of the bead (CA>BE) ate significantly more than did those with higher theta power after dispensation of the bead than of the candy (BE>CA, p < 0.001). Finally, we found that the crossed P>C and BE>CA group ate less (p < 0.001) than did the other three groups formed by crossing the LPP and theta group assignments, who exhibited similar eating behavior on average (p = 0.662). These findings demonstrate that motivational salience and cognitive control converge to independently confer vulnerability or resilience to cue-induced behaviors, underscoring the need for individualized treatments to mitigate maladaptive behaviors.

                Rapid simultaneous advances in machine vision and cognitive neuroimaging present an unparalleled opportunity to (re)assess the current state of artificial models of the human visual system. Here, we perform a large-scale benchmarking analysis of 85 modern deep neural network models (e.g. CLIP, BarlowTwins, Mask-RCNN) to characterize with robust statistical power how differences in architecture and training task contribute to the prediction of human fMRI activity across 16 distinct regions of the human visual system. We find: one, that even stark architectural differences (e.g. the absence of convolution in transformers and MLP-mixers) have very little consequence in emergent fits to brain data; two, that differences in task have clear effects--with categorization and self-supervised models showing relatively stronger brain predictivity across the board; three, that feature reweighting leads to substantial improvements in brain predictivity, without overfitting -- yielding model-to-brain regression weights that generalize at the same level of predictivity to brain responses over 1000s of new images. Broadly, this work presents a lay-of-the-land for the emergent correspondences between the feature spaces of modern deep neural network models and the representational structure inherent to the human visual system.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Sparcl1/Hevin drives inflammatory and neuropathic pain through astrocyte and NMDA receptor signaling</a></h4>

              
                Hevin or Sparcl1 is an astrocyte-secreted protein and regulates synapse formation in the brain. Here we show that astrocytic hevin signaling plays a critical role in maintaining chronic pain. Compared to wild-type mice, hevin-null mice exhibited normal mechanical and heat sensitivity but reduced inflammatory pain. Interestingly, hevin is required for the maintenance of nerve injury-induced neuropathic pain (mechanical allodynia), and hevin-null mice have faster recovery than wild-type mice from neuropathic pain after nerve injury. Intrathecal injection of wild-type hevin but not a hevin mutant that is no longer synaptogenic was sufficient to induce persistent mechanical allodynia in naive mice and further enhanced neuropathic pain in animals with nerve injury. In hevin-null mice with nerve injury, AAV-mediated re-expression of hevin, but not mutant hevin, in GFAP-expressing spinal cord astrocytes could reinstate neuropathic pain. Mechanistically, hevin is crucial for spinal cord NMDA receptor (NMDAR) signaling, as NMDA-induced mechanical allodynia and inward currents in spinal cord lamina II neurons is reduced in hevin-null mice. Hevin potentiated NMDA currents mediated by the GluN2B-containing NMDARs. Furthermore, intrathecal injection of a neutralizing antibody against hevin alleviated acute inflammatory pain and persistent neuropathic pain. Secreted hevin was detected in mouse cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and nerve injury significantly increased CSF hevin abundance. Finally, neurosurgery caused rapid (< 10 hours) and substantial increases (~20 fold) in HEVIN levels in human CSF. Collectively, our findings support a critical role of hevin and astrocytes in the maintenance of chronic pain. Neutralizing of secreted hevin with monoclonal antibody may provide a new therapeutic strategy for treating chronic pain and NMDAR-medicated neurodegeneration.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Activation of the CA2-vCA1 pathway reverses social discrimination dysfunction in Shank3B knockout mice</a></h4>

              
                Social memory dysfunction is a feature of several neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders. Mutation or deletion of the SHANK3 gene, which codes for a synaptic scaffolding protein, has been linked to autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and Phelan-McDermid syndrome, conditions associated with impairments in social memory. Shank3B knockout (KO) mice exhibit several behavioral abnormalities that may be analogous to symptoms of ASD, including social discrimination deficits. The CA2 region of the hippocampus integrates numerous afferents and sends a major output to the ventral CA1 (vCA1), circuitry that plays an important role in social memory. Despite finding few differences in excitatory afferents to the CA2 in Shank3B KO mice, chemogenetic activation of CA2 excitatory neurons restored social recognition function to wildtype (WT) levels. Specific activation of the CA2-vCA1 circuitry had a similar effect. Neuronal oscillations in the theta, gamma and, sharp wave ripple ranges have been linked to social memory, but we observed no differences in these measures between WT and Shank3B KO mice in the vCA1 in response to social stimuli. However, activation of CA2 excitatory neurons enhanced vCA1 theta power in Shank3B KO mice, concurrent with behavioral improvements. These findings suggest that stimulating adult circuitry in a mouse model with neurodevelopmental impairments can be sufficient to invoke latent function, particularly with respect to social memory dysfunction. The extent to which vCA1 network oscillations in the theta range are responsible for rescued behavioral function remains unknown.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Local translation provides the asymmetric distribution of CaMKII required for associative memory formation</a></h4>

              
                How compartment-specific local proteomes are generated and maintained is inadequately understood, particularly in neurons, which display extreme asymmetries. Here we show that local enrichment of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) in axons of Drosophila mushroom body neurons is necessary for cellular plasticity and associative memory formation. Enrichment is achieved via enhanced axoplasmic translation of CaMKII mRNA, through a mechanism requiring the RNA-binding protein Mub and a 23-base Mub-recognition element in the CaMKII 3'UTR. Perturbation of either dramatically reduces axonal, but not somatic, CaMKII protein without altering the distribution or amount of mRNA in vivo and both are necessary and sufficient to enhance axonal translation of reporter mRNA. Together, these data identify elevated levels of translation of an evenly distributed mRNA as a novel strategy for generating subcellular biochemical asymmetries. They further demonstrate the importance of distributional asymmetry in the computational and biological functions of neurons.

                The complex nature of the transcriptional networks underlying addictive behaviors suggests intricate cooperation between diverse gene regulation mechanisms that go beyond canonical activity-dependent pathways. Here we implicate in this process a novel nuclear receptor transcription factor, Retinoid X Receptor Alpha (RXR), which we identified bioinformatically as associated with addiction-like behaviors. In the nucleus accumbens (NAc) of male and female mice, we show that, while its own expression remains unaltered after cocaine exposure, RXR controls plasticity- and addiction-relevant transcriptional programs in both dopamine receptor D1- and D2-expressing medium spiny neurons, which in turn modulate intrinsic excitability and synaptic activity of these NAc cell types. Behaviorally, bidirectional viral and pharmacological manipulation of RXR regulates drug reward sensitivity in both non-operant and operant paradigms. Together, this study demonstrates a key role for NAc RXR in promoting drug addiction, and paves the way for future studies of rexinoid signaling in psychiatric disease states.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Classification of Movement-Related Oscillations in sEEG Recordings with Machine Learning</a></h4>

              
                Previous electrophysiological research has characterized canonical oscillatory patterns associated with movement mostly from recordings of primary sensorimotor cortex. Less work has attempted to decode movement based on electrophysiological recordings from a broader array of brain areas such as those sampled by stereoelectroencephalography (sEEG). Here we decoded movement using a linear support vector machine (SVM). We were able to accurately classify sEEG spectrograms during a keypress movement in a task versus those during the inter-trial interval. Furthermore, the important time-frequency patterns for this classification recapitulated findings from previous studies that used non-invasive electroencephalography (EEG) and electrocorticography (ECoG) and identified brain regions that were not associated with movement in previous studies. Specifically, we found these previously described patterns: beta (13 - 30 Hz) desynchronization, beta synchronization (rebound), pre-movement alpha (8 - 15 Hz) modulation, a post-movement broadband gamma (60 - 90 Hz) increase and an event-related potential. These oscillatory patterns were newly observed in a wide range of brain areas accessible with sEEG that are not accessible with other electrophysiology recording methods. For example, the presence of beta desynchronization in the frontal lobe was more widespread than previously described, extending outside primary and secondary motor cortices. We provide evidence for a system of putative motor networks that exhibit unique oscillatory patterns by describing the anatomical extent of the movement-related oscillations that were observed most frequently across all sEEG contacts.

                While large trinucleotide repeat expansions at the FMR1 locus cause Fragile X Syndrome (FXS), smaller "premutations" are associated with the late-onset condition Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS), which shows very different clinical and pathological features, with no clear molecular explanation for these marked differences. One prevailing theory posits that the premutation uniquely causes neurotoxic increases in FMR1 mRNA (i.e., 4-8-fold increases), but evidence to support this hypothesis is largely derived from analysis of peripheral blood. We applied single-nucleus RNA-sequencing to post-mortem frontal cortex and cerebellum from 9 individuals with Fragile X mutations as well as age and sex matched controls (n=6) to assess cell-type specific molecular neuropathology. We found robust reduction of FMR1 mRNA in FXS as expected, with modest but significant upregulation (~1.3 fold) of FMR1 in glial clusters associated with premutation expansions. In premutation cases we identified alterations in glia number in cortex and cerebellum. Differential expression analysis demonstrated altered cortical oligodendrocyte development, while gene ontology analysis revealed alterations in neuroregulatory roles of glia, such as glial modulation of neurotransmission and synaptic structure. We identified significant enrichment of known FMR1 protein target genes in differentially expressed gene lists in FXS as well as the premutation, suggesting FMR1 protein target pathways may represent a shared source of dysfunction in both conditions despite opposite FMR1 mRNA changes. These findings challenge existing dogma regarding FXTAS and implicate glial dysregulation as a critical facet of premutation pathophysiology, representing novel therapeutic targets directly derived from the human condition.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Primate dopamine neurons activated in rewarding environment by tonic disinhibition from amygdala</a></h4>

              
                Seeking out good and avoiding bad objects is critical for survival. In practice, objects are rarely good every time or everywhere, but only at the right time or place. Whereas the basal ganglia (BG) are known to mediate goal-directed behavior, for example, saccades to rewarding objects, it remains unclear how such simple behaviors are rendered contingent on higher-order factors, including environmental context. Here we show that amygdala neurons are sensitive to environments and regulate dopamine (DA) neurons via an inhibitory projection to substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) neurons. We combined optogenetics and multi-channel recording to demonstrate that rewarding environments induce tonic firing changes in DA neurons. These tonic responses are mediated by disinhibition via GABAergic projection onto DA neurons from SNr, which in turn are suppressed by inhibitory projection from the amygdala. Thus, the amygdala provides an additional source of learning to BG circuits, namely contingencies imposed by the environment.

                Previously, we developed a novel model for anxiety during motivated behavior by training rats to perform a task where actions executed to obtain a reward were probabilistically punished and observed that after learning, neuronal activity in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) encode the relationship between action and punishment risk (Park & Moghaddam, 2017). Here we used male and female rats to expand on the previous work by focusing on neural changes in the dmPFC and VTA that were associated with the learning of probabilistic punishment, and with anxiolytic treatment with diazepam after learning. We find that adaptive neural responses of dmPFC and VTA during the learning of anxiogenic contingencies are independent from the punishment experience and occur primarily during the peri-action period. Our results further identify peri-action ramping of VTA neural activity, and VTA-dmPFC correlated activity, as potential markers for the anxiolytic properties of diazepam.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Excitatory-Inhibitory Recurrent Dynamics Produce Robust Visual Grids and Stable Attractors</a></h4>

              
                Spatially modulated grid cells has been recently found in the rat secondary visual cortex (V2) during activation navigation. However, the computational mechanism and functional significance of V2 grid cells remain unknown, and a theory-driven conceptual model for experimentally observed visual grids is missing. To address the knowledge gap and make experimentally testable predictions, here we trained a biologically-inspired excitatory-inhibitory recurrent neural network (E/I-RNN) to perform a two-dimensional spatial navigation task with multisensory (e.g., velocity, acceleration, and visual) input. We found grid-like responses in both excitatory and inhibitory RNN units, and these grid responses were robust with respect to the choices of spatial cues, dimensionality of visual input, activation function, and network connectivity. Dimensionality reduction analysis of population responses revealed a low-dimensional torus-like manifold and attractor, showing the stability of grid patterns with respect to new visual input, new trajectory and relative speed. We found that functionally similar receptive fields with strong excitatory-to-excitatory connection appeared within fully connected as well as structurally connected networks, suggesting a link between functional grid clusters and structural network. Additionally, multistable torus-like attractors emerged with increasing sparsity in inter- and intra-subnetwork connectivity. Finally, irregular grid patterns were found in a convolutional neural network (CNN)-RNN architecture while performing a visual sequence recognition task. Together, our results suggest new computational mechanisms of V2 grid cells in both spatial and non-spatial tasks.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">NDR1/2 kinases regulate membrane trafficking, enable efficient autophagy and prevent neurodegeneration</a></h4>

              
                NDR1 and NDR2 are highly conserved kinases that regulate neuronal development, mitochondrial health and autophagy, but their roles in the mammalian brain in vivo are unexplored. Using constitutive Ndr1 and neuron-specific Ndr2 knockout mice we show that dual loss of Ndr1/2 in neurons causes neurodegeneration. Phosphoproteomic comparisons between Ndr1/2 knockout and control brains revealed novel kinase substrates and highlighted changes in endocytosis in the absence of NDR1/2. The endocytic protein Raph1/Lpd1 is a new NDR1/2 substrate and both NDR1/2 and Raph1 are critical for endocytosis and membrane recycling. NDR1/2 knockout brains exhibited a prominent accumulation of transferrin receptor, p62 and ubiquitinated proteins, indicative of a major impairment in protein homeostasis. Furthermore, autophagosome levels were reduced in knockout neurons, implying that reduced autophagy efficiency mediates p62 accumulation. Mechanistically, pronounced mislocalisation of the transmembrane autophagy protein ATG9A at the neuronal periphery, impaired axonal ATG9A trafficking and increased ATG9A surface levels further confirm defects in membrane trafficking and could underlie the impairment in autophagy. We provide novel insight into the roles of NDR1/2 kinases in maintaining neuronal health.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">STEPS 4.0: Fast and memory-efficient molecular simulations of neurons at the nanoscale</a></h4>

              
                Recent advances in computational neuroscience have demonstrated the usefulness and importance of stochastic, spatial reaction-diffusion simulations. However, ever increasing model complexity renders traditional serial solvers, as well as naive parallel implementations, inadequate. This paper introduces a new generation of the STochastic Engine for Pathway Simulation (STEPS) project, denominated STEPS 4.0, and its core components which have been designed for improved scalability, performance, and memory efficiency. STEPS 4.0 aims to enable novel scientific studies of macroscopic systems such as whole cells while capturing their nanoscale details. This class of models is out of reach for serial solvers due to the vast quantity of computation in such detailed models, and also out of reach for naive parallel solvers due to the large memory footprint. Based on a distributed mesh solution, we introduce a new parallel stochastic reaction-diffusion solver and a deterministic membrane potential solver in STEPS 4.0. The distributed mesh, together with improved data layout and algorithm designs, significantly reduces the memory footprint of parallel simulations in STEPS 4.0. This enables massively parallel simulations on modern HPC clusters and overcomes the limitations of the previous parallel STEPS implementation. Current and future improvements to the solver are not sustainable without proper software engineering practices. For this reason, we also give an overview of how the STEPS codebase and the development environment have been updated to follow modern software development practices. We benchmark performance improvement and memory footprint on three published models with different complexities, from a simple spatial stochastic reaction-diffusion model, to a more complex one that is coupled to a deterministic membrane potential solver to simulate the calcium burst activity of a Purkinje neuron. Simulation results of these models suggest that the new solution dramatically reduces the per-core memory consumption by more than a factor of 30, while maintaining similar or better performance and scalability.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Context-independent expression of spatial code in hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                Hippocampus plays a crucial role in formation and retrieval of spatial memory across mammals and episodic memory in humans. Episodic as well as spatial memories can be retrieved irrespectively of subject's awake behavioral state and independently of its actual spatial context. The nature of hippocampal network activity during such out-context retrieval has not been described so far, though. Theoretically, context-independent spatial memory retrieval suggests a shift from the hippocampal spatial representations coding the actual- to the remembered context. In this study we show in rats that CA3 neuronal population can switch spontaneously across representations and transiently activate another stored familiar spatial pattern without a direct external sensory cuing. This phenomenon qualitatively differs from the well described sharp wave-related pattern reactivations during immobility. Here it occurred under theta oscillatory state during an active exploration and reflected the preceding experience of sudden environment change. The respective out-context coding spikes appeared later in the theta cycle than the in-context ones. Finally, the experience induced as well an emergence of population vectors with a co-expression of both codes segregated into different phases of the theta cycle.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Age-related differences in functional network segregation in the context of sex and reproductive stage</a></h4>

              
                Age is accompanied by differences in the organization of functional brain networks, which impact behavior in adulthood. Functional networks tend to become less segregated and more integrated with age. However, sex differences in network segregation declines with age are not well-understood. Further, network segregation in the context of female reproductive stage is relatively understudied, though unmasking such relationships would be informative for elucidating biological mechanisms that contribute to sex-specific differences in aging. In the current work, we used data from the Cambridge Centre for Ageing and Neuroscience (Cam-CAN) repository to evaluate differences in resting-state network segregation as a product of sex and reproductive stage. Reproductive stage was categorized using the Stages of Reproductive Aging Workshop (STRAW+10) criteria. Replicating prior work, we investigated the following functional networks: auditory, cerebellar-basal ganglia, cingulo-opercular task control, default mode, dorsal attention, fronto-parietal task control, salience, sensory somatomotor mouth, sensory somatomotor hand, ventral attention, and visual. First, our results mirror findings from previous work indicating that network segregation is lower with increasing age. Second, when analyzing associations between network segregation and age within each sex separately, we find differences between females and males. Finally, we report significant effects of reproductive stage on network segregation, though these findings are likely driven by age. Broadly, our results suggest that impacts of sex are important to evaluate when investigating network segregation differences across adulthood, though further work is needed to determine the unique role of menopause and sex hormones on the organization of functional brain networks within aging females.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Deciphering the fibre-orientation independent component of R2* (R2,iso*) in the human brain with a single multi-echo gradient-recalled-echo measurement under varying microstructural conditions</a></h4>

              
                The effective transverse relaxation rate (R2*) is sensitive to the microstructure of the human brain, e.g. the g-ratio characterising the relative myelination of axons. However, R2* depends on the orientation of the fibres relative to the main magnetic field, degrading its reproducibility and that of any microstructural derivative measure. To decipher its orientation-independent part (R2,iso*), a second-order polynomial in time (M2) can be applied to single multi-echo gradient-recalled-echo (meGRE) measurements at arbitrary orientation. The linear-time dependent parameter, {beta}1, of M2 can be biophysically related to R2,iso* when neglecting the signal from the myelin water (MW) in the hollow cylinder fibre model (HCFM). Here, we examined the effectiveness of M2 using experimental and simulated data with variable g-ratio and fibre dispersion. We showed that the fitted {beta}1 effectively estimates R2,iso* when using meGRE with long maximum echo time (TEmax {approx} 54 ms) but its microscopic dependence on the g-ratio was not accurately captured. This error was reduced to less than 12% when accounting for the MW contribution in a newly introduced biophysical expression for {beta}1. We further used this new expression to estimate the MW fraction (0.14) and g-ratio (0.79) in a human optic chiasm. However, the proposed method failed to estimate R2,iso* for a typical in-vivo meGRE protocol (TEmax {approx} 18 ms). At this TEmax and around the magic angle, the HCFM-based simulations failed to explain the R2*-orientation-dependence. In conclusion, estimation of R2,iso* with M2 in vivo requires meGRE protocols with very long TEmax {approx} 54 ms.

                The progressive cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients correlates with the extent of tau pathology, in particular tau hyperphosphorylation, which is strongly age-associated. Although elevation of phosphorylated tau (p-Tau) on residues Thr181 (p-Tau181), Thr217 (p-Tau217), and Thr231 (p-Tau231) in cerebrospinal fluid or blood are recently proposed to be particularly sensitive markers of early AD, the generation of p-Tau during brain activity is poorly understood. A major form of synaptic plasticity, long-term depression (LTD), has recently been linked to the enhancement of tau phosphorylation. Here we show that low frequency stimulation (LFS), used to induce LTD, enhances p-Tau181 and p-Tau217 in an age-dependent manner in the hippocampus of live rats. In contrast, phosphorylation at residues Thr231, Ser202/Thr205, and Ser396 is less sensitive to LFS. Targeting ageing with a small molecule cognitive enhancer ISRIB (trans-isomer) prevents the enhancement of p-Tau by LFS in aged rats. Together, our data provide an in vivo means to uncover brain plasticity-related cellular and molecular processes of tau phosphorylation in health and ageing conditions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Stability and learning in excitatory synapses by nonlinear inhibitory plasticity</a></h4>

              
                Synaptic changes underlie learning and memory formation in the brain. But synaptic plasticity of excitatory synapses on its own is unstable, leading to unlimited growth of synaptic strengths without additional homeostatic mechanisms. To control excitatory synaptic strengths we propose a novel form of synaptic plasticity at inhibitory synapses. We identify two key features of inhibitory plasticity, dominance of inhibition over excitation and a nonlinear dependence on the firing rate of postsynaptic excitatory neurons whereby inhibitory synaptic strengths change in the same direction as excitatory synaptic strengths. We demonstrate that the stable synaptic strengths realized by this novel inhibitory plasticity achieve a fixed excitatory/inhibitory set-point in agreement with experimental results. Applying a disinhibitory signal can gate plasticity and lead to the generation of receptive fields and strong bidirectional connectivity in a recurrent network. Hence, a novel form of nonlinear inhibitory plasticity can simultaneously stabilize excitatory synaptic strengths and enable learning upon disinhibition.

	<p>This study examines the neural dynamics underlying the prosodic (duration) and the semantic dimensions in Spanish sentence perception. Specifically, we investigated whether adult listeners are aware of changes in the duration of a pretonic syllable of words that were either semantically predictable or unpredictable from the preceding sentential context. Participants listened to the sentences with instructions to make prosodic or semantic judgments, while their EEG was recorded. For both accuracy and RTs, the results revealed an interaction between duration and semantics. ERP analysis exposed an interactive effect between task, duration and semantic, showing that both processes share neural resources. There was an enhanced negativity on semantic process (N400) and an extended positivity associated with anomalous duration. Source estimation for the N400 component revealed activations in the frontal gyrus for the semantic contrast and in the parietal postcentral gyrus for duration contrast in the metric task, while activation in the sub-lobar insula was observed for the semantic task. The source of the late positive components was located on posterior cingulate. Hence, the ERP data support the idea that semantic and prosodic levels are processed by similar neural networks, and the two linguistic dimensions influence each other during the decision-making stage in the metric and semantic judgment tasks.</p>

	<p>Previous studies have shown that immunological factors are involved in the pathogenesis of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). The present study examined whether immunological abnormalities are associated with cognitive and behavioral deficits in children with ASD and whether children with ASD show different immunological biomarkers and brain-derived neurotrophic factor BDNF levels than typically developing (TD) children. Sixteen children with TD and 18 children with ASD, aged 6&amp;amp;ndash;18 years, voluntarily participated in the study. Participants&amp;amp;rsquo; executive functions were measured using neuropsychological tests, and behavioral measures were measured using parent ratings. Immunological measures were assessed by measuring the participants&amp;amp;rsquo; blood serum levels of chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2) and chemokine ligand 5 (CCL5). Children with ASD showed greater deficits in cognitive functions as well as altered levels of immunological measures when compared to TD children, and their cognitive functions and behavioral deficits were significantly associated with increased CCL5 levels and decreased BDNF levels. These results provide evidence to support the notion that altered immune functions and neurotrophin deficiency are involved in the pathogenesis of ASD.</p>

	<p>Autoimmune glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) astrocytopathy (GFAP-A) is a type of autoimmune corticosteroid-responsive meningoencephalitis that occurs with or without myelitis. Movement disorders have been reported in GFAP-A patients but have not been characterized. In this study, we examined the characteristics of movement disorders in GFAP-A patients. We retrospectively reviewed clinical data from 87 consecutive patients with GFAP-A attending Gifu University Hospital in Japan. We compared the demographics, clinical features, cerebrospinal fluid characteristics, and neuroimaging findings from patients with and without movement disorders. Seventy-four patients (85%) had movement disorders, including ataxia (49%), tremor (45%), myoclonus (37%), dyskinesia (2%), opsoclonus (2%), rigidity (2%), myokymia (1%), and choreoathetosis (1%). GFAP-A patients with movement disorders were significantly older than those without. Movement disorders are therefore common in GFAP-A patients, and the main types of movement disorders observed in this population were ataxia, tremor, and myoclonus. These abnormal movements can serve as clinical features that facilitate the early diagnosis of GFAP-A. Elderly GFAP-A patients are more likely to have movement disorder complications than younger patients.</p>

	<p>It is a well-demonstrated phenomenon that listeners can discriminate native phonetic contrasts better than nonnative ones. Recent neuroimaging studies have started to reveal the underlying neural mechanisms. By focusing on the mismatch negativity/response (MMN/R), a widely studied index of neural sensitivity to sound change, researchers have observed larger MMNs for native contrasts than for nonnative ones in EEG, but also a more focused and efficient neural activation pattern for native contrasts in MEG. However, direct relations between behavioral discrimination and MMN/R are rarely reported. In the current study, 15 native English speakers and 15 native Spanish speakers completed both a behavioral discrimination task and a separate MEG recording to measure MMR to a VOT-based speech contrast (i.e., pre-voiced vs. voiced stop consonant), which represents a phonetic contrast native to Spanish speakers but is nonnative to English speakers. At the group level, English speakers exhibited significantly lower behavioral sensitivity (d&amp;amp;rsquo;) to the contrast but a more expansive MMR, replicating previous studies. Across individuals, a significant relation between behavioral sensitivity and the MMR was only observed in the Spanish group. Potential differences in the mechanisms underlying behavioral discrimination for the two groups are discussed.</p>

	<p>Background: It can be easily inferred that dementia caregivers were severely affected by the general home confinement, or &amp;amp;lsquo;lockdown&amp;amp;rsquo;, due to their caregiving roles. Aim: The aim of the current study is to investigate how the quarantine measures applied during the COVID-19 pandemic affected the emotional function (specifically the emotional management, emotional experience, and stress symptoms) and the negative thoughts, as well as the adaptability skills, of Greek dementia caregivers. Materials andMethods: In total, 303 participants (138 in the non-caregiving adults-control group; 165 in the dementia caregivers-experimental group) were recruited from the day centers of the Greek Association of Alzheimer Disease and Related Disorders (GAADRD) from June 2020 to January 2021 in Thessaloniki, Greece. The caregiving population was split into group 1 (those who participated in support groups) and group 2 (those who did not participate in support groups). A self-reported questionnaire was created for research purposes and was digitally administered to participants via Google forms. Results: During the quarantine period, dementia caregivers had more difficulties in emotional management, especially in regards to stress symptoms, which was measured via the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), in comparison to the control group. In regards to the caregiving populations, caregivers from group 1 were more able to manage their emotions according to their self-reports, but had increased agony and loneliness. Moreover, statistical significance was found between emotional management, negative feelings, and stress symptoms in those from group 2 who self-reported that the PwD deteriorated. This evidence was not found in group 1. Finally, there were no differences in the means of negative thoughts about the pandemic, as well as in the adaptation skills, both in dementia caregivers and in the control group, according to their self-reports. Discussion: It seems that different emotional aspects were affected in the dementia caregivers&amp;amp;rsquo; population, and, therefore, future psychotherapeutic interventions should focus on those most severely affected by the restrictive measures imposed.</p>

<p>The expression of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (ChrnA1–10, B2–4, D, and G) in the zebra finch brain showing unique differential expressions in subdivisions of the forebrain and the song nuclei. The white color represents mRNA signal.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are ligand-gated ion channels that mediate fast synaptic transmission and cell signaling, which contribute to learning, memory, and the execution of motor skills. Birdsong is a complex learned motor skill in songbirds. Although the existence of 15 nAChR subunits has been predicted in the avian genome, their expression patterns and potential contributions to song learning and production have not been comprehensively investigated. Here, we cloned all the 15 nAChR subunits (ChrnA1–10, B2–4, D, and G) from the zebra finch brain and investigated the mRNA expression patterns in the neural pathways responsible for the learning and production of birdsong during a critical period of song learning. Although there were no detectable hybridization signals for ChrnA1, A6, A9, and A10, the other 11 nAChR subunits were uniquely expressed in one or more major subdivisions in the song nuclei of the songbird brain. Of these 11 subunits, ChrnA3–5, A7, and B2 were differentially regulated in the song nuclei compared with the surrounding anatomically related regions. ChrnA5 was upregulated during the critical period of song learning in the lateral magnocellular nucleus of the anterior nidopallium. Furthermore, single-cell RNA sequencing revealed ChrnA7 and B2 to be the major subunits expressed in neurons of the vocal motor nuclei HVC and robust nucleus of the arcopallium, indicating the potential existence of ChrnA7-homomeric and ChrnB2-heteromeric nAChRs in limited cell populations. These results suggest that relatively limited types of nAChR subunits provide functional contributions to song learning and production in songbirds.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Differential Electrographic Signatures Generated by Mechanistically-Diverse Seizurogenic Compounds in the Larval Zebrafish Brain</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>We assessed similarities and differences in the electrographic signatures of local field potentials (LFPs) evoked by different pharmacological agents in zebrafish larvae. We then compared and contrasted these characteristics with what is known from electrophysiological studies of seizures and epilepsy in mammals, including humans. Ultimately, our aim was to phenotype neurophysiological features of drug-induced seizures in larval zebrafish for expanding knowledge on the translational potential of this valuable alternative to mammalian models. LFPs were recorded from the midbrain of 4-d-old zebrafish larvae exposed to a pharmacologically diverse panel of seizurogenic compounds, and the outputs of these recordings were assessed using frequency domain analysis. This included analysis of changes occurring within various spectral frequency bands of relevance to mammalian CNS circuit pathophysiology. From these analyses, there were clear differences in the frequency spectra of drug-exposed LFPs, relative to controls, many of which shared notable similarities with the signatures exhibited by mammalian CNS circuits. These similarities included the presence of specific frequency components comparable to those observed in mammalian studies of seizures and epilepsy. Collectively, the data presented provide important information to support the value of larval zebrafish as an alternative model for the study of seizures and epilepsy. These data also provide further insight into the electrophysiological characteristics of seizures generated in nonmammalian species by the action of neuroactive drugs.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Minimizing the Ex Vivo Confounds of Cell-Isolation Techniques on Transcriptomic and Translatomic Profiles of Purified Microglia</a></h4>

              
                <p>Modern molecular and biochemical neuroscience studies require analysis of specific cellular populations derived from brain tissue samples to disambiguate cell type-specific events. This is particularly true in the analysis of minority glial populations in the brain, such as microglia, which may be obscured in whole tissue analyses. Microglia have central functions in development, aging, and neurodegeneration and are a current focus of neuroscience research. A long-standing concern for glial biologists using <I>in vivo</I> models is whether cell isolation from CNS tissue could introduce <I>ex vivo</I> artifacts in microglia, which respond quickly to changes in the environment. Mouse microglia were purified by magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS), as well as cytometer-based and cartridge-based fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) approaches to compare and contrast performance. The Cx3cr1-NuTRAP mouse model was used to provide an endogenous fluorescent microglial marker and a microglial-specific translatome profile as a baseline comparison lacking cell isolation artifacts. All sorting methods performed similarly for microglial purity with main differences being in cell yield and time of isolation. <I>Ex vivo</I> activation signatures occurred principally during the initial tissue dissociation and cell preparation and not the cell sorting. The cell preparation-induced activational phenotype could be minimized by inclusion of transcriptional and translational inhibitors or non-enzymatic dissociation conducted entirely at low temperatures. These data demonstrate that a variety of microglial isolation approaches can be used, depending on experimental needs, and that inhibitor cocktails are effective at reducing cell preparation artifacts.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Reward-Dependent Selection of Feedback Gains Impacts Rapid Motor Decisions</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Target reward influences motor planning strategies through modulation of movement vigor. Considering current theories of sensorimotor control suggesting that movement planning consists in selecting a goal-directed control strategy, we sought to investigate the influence of reward on feedback control. Here, we explored this question in three human reaching experiments. First, we altered the explicit reward associated with the goal target and found an overall increase in feedback gains for higher target rewards, highlighted by larger velocities, feedback responses to external loads, and background muscle activity. Then, we investigated whether the differences in target rewards across multiple goals impacted rapid motor decisions during movement. We observed idiosyncratic switching strategies dependent on both target rewards and, surprisingly, the feedback gains at perturbation onset: the more vigorous movements were less likely to switch to a new goal following perturbations. To gain further insight into a causal influence of the feedback gains on rapid motor decisions, we demonstrated that biasing the baseline activity and reflex gains by means of a background load evoked a larger proportion of target switches in the direction opposite to the background load associated with lower muscle activity. Together, our results demonstrate an impact of target reward on feedback control and highlight the competition between movement vigor and flexibility.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">V3 Interneurons Are Active and Recruit Spinal Motor Neurons during In Vivo Fictive Swimming in Larval Zebrafish</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Survival for vertebrate animals is dependent on the ability to successfully find food, locate a mate, and avoid predation. Each of these behaviors requires motor control, which is set by a combination of kinematic properties. For example, the frequency and amplitude of motor output combine in a multiplicative manner to determine features of locomotion such as distance traveled, speed, force (thrust), and vigor. Although there is a good understanding of how different populations of excitatory spinal interneurons establish locomotor frequency, there is a less thorough mechanistic understanding for how locomotor amplitude is established. Recent evidence indicates that locomotor amplitude is regulated in part by a subset of functionally and morphologically distinct V2a excitatory spinal interneurons (Type II, nonbursting) in larval and adult zebrafish. Here, we provide direct evidence that most V3 interneurons (V3-INs), which are a developmentally and genetically defined population of ventromedial glutamatergic spinal neurons, are active during fictive swimming. We also show that elimination of the spinal V3-IN population reduces the proportion of active motor neurons (MNs) during fictive swimming but does not alter the range of locomotor frequencies produced. These data are consistent with V3-INs providing excitatory drive to spinal MNs during swimming in larval zebrafish and may contribute to the production of locomotor amplitude independently of locomotor frequency.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Survival analysis of pathway activity as a prognostic determinant in breast cancer</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Gustavo S. Jeuken, Nicholas P. Tobin, Lukas Käll</p>

High throughput biology enables the measurements of relative concentrations of thousands of biomolecules from e.g. tissue samples. The process leaves the investigator with the problem of how to best interpret the potentially large numbers of differences between samples. Many activities in a cell depend on ordered reactions involving multiple biomolecules, often referred to as pathways. It hence makes sense to study differences between samples in terms of altered pathway activity, using so-called pathway analysis. Traditional pathway analysis gives significance to differences in the pathway components’ concentrations between sample groups, however, less frequently used methods for estimating individual samples’ pathway activities have been suggested. Here we demonstrate that such a method can be used for pathway-based survival analysis. Specifically, we investigate the pathway activities’ association with patients’ survival time based on the transcription profiles of the METABRIC dataset. Our implementation shows that pathway activities are better prognostic markers for survival time in METABRIC than the individual transcripts. We also demonstrate that we can regress out the effect of individual pathways on other pathways, which allows us to estimate the other pathways’ residual pathway activity on survival. Furthermore, we illustrate how one can visualize the often interdependent measures over hierarchical pathway databases using sunburst plots.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Pooled testing of traced contacts under superspreading dynamics</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Stratis Tsirtsis, Abir De, Lars Lorch, Manuel Gomez-Rodriguez</p>

Testing is recommended for all close contacts of confirmed COVID-19 patients. However, existing pooled testing methods are oblivious to the circumstances of contagion provided by contact tracing. Here, we build upon a well-known semi-adaptive pooled testing method, Dorfman’s method with imperfect tests, and derive a simple pooled testing method based on dynamic programming that is specifically designed to use information provided by contact tracing. Experiments using a variety of reproduction numbers and dispersion levels, including those estimated in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, show that the pools found using our method result in a significantly lower number of tests than those found using Dorfman’s method. Our method provides the greatest competitive advantage when the number of contacts of an infected individual is small, or the distribution of secondary infections is highly overdispersed. Moreover, it maintains this competitive advantage under imperfect contact tracing and significant levels of dilution.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">How the storage effect and the number of temporal niches affect biodiversity in stochastic and seasonal environments</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Immanuel Meyer, Bnaya Steinmetz, Nadav M. Shnerb</p>

Temporal environmental variations affect diversity in communities of competing populations. In particular, the covariance between competition and environment is known to facilitate invasions of rare species via the storage effect. Here we present a quantitative study of the effects of temporal variations in two-species and in diverse communities. Four scenarios are compared: environmental variations may be either periodic (seasonal) or stochastic, and the dynamics may support the storage effect (global competition) or not (local competition). In two-species communities, coexistence is quantified via the mean time to absorption, and we show that stochastic variations yield shorter persistence time because they allow for rare sequences of bad years. In diverse communities, where the steady-state reflects a colonization-extinction equilibrium, the actual number of temporal niches is shown to play a crucial role. When this number is large, the same trends hold: storage effect and periodic variations increase both species richness and the evenness of the community. Surprisingly, when the number of temporal niches is small global competition acts to decrease species richness and evenness, as it focuses the competition to specific periods, thus increasing the effective fitness differences.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Biological action at a distance: Correlated pattern formation in adjacent tessellation domains without communication</a></h4>

              
                <p>by John M. Brooke, Sebastian S. James, Alejandro Jimenez-Rodriguez, Stuart P. Wilson</p>

Tessellations emerge in many natural systems, and the constituent domains often contain regular patterns, raising the intriguing possibility that pattern formation within adjacent domains might be correlated by the geometry, without the direct exchange of information between parts comprising either domain. We confirm this paradoxical effect, by simulating pattern formation via reaction-diffusion in domains whose boundary shapes tessellate, and showing that correlations between adjacent patterns are strong compared to controls that self-organise in domains with equivalent sizes but unrelated shapes. The effect holds in systems with linear and non-linear diffusive terms, and for boundary shapes derived from regular and irregular tessellations. Based on the prediction that correlations between adjacent patterns should be bimodally distributed, we develop methods for testing whether a given set of domain boundaries constrained pattern formation within those domains. We then confirm such a prediction by analysing the development of ‘subbarrel’ patterns, which are thought to emerge via reaction-diffusion, and whose enclosing borders form a Voronoi tessellation on the surface of the rodent somatosensory cortex. In more general terms, this result demonstrates how causal links can be established between the dynamical processes through which biological patterns emerge and the constraints that shape them.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Transcriptomic analysis of dorsal and ventral subiculum after induction of acute seizures by electric stimulation of the perforant pathway in rats</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Preconditioning is a mechanism in which injuries induced by non-lethal hypoxia or seizures trigger cellular resistance to subsequent events. Norwood et al., in a 2010 study, showed that an 8-h-long period of electrical stimulation of the perforant pathway in rats is required for the induction of hippocampal sclerosis. However, in order to avoid generalized seizures, <i>status epilepticus</i> (SE), and death, a state of resistance to seizures must be induced in the hippocampus by a preconditioning paradigm consisting of two daily 30-min stimulation periods. Due to the importance of the subiculum in the hippocampal formation, this study aims to investigate differential gene expression patterns in the dorsal and ventral subiculum using RNA-sequencing, after induction of a preconditioning protocol by electrical stimulation of the perforant pathway. The dorsal (dSub) and ventral (vSub) subiculum regions were collected by laser-microdissection 24 h after preconditioning protocol induction in rats. RNA sequencing was performed in a Hiseq 4000 platform, reads were aligned using the STAR and DESEq2 statistics package was used to estimate gene expression. We identified 1176 differentially expressed genes comparing control to preconditioned subiculum regions, 204 genes were differentially expressed in dSub and 972 in vSub. The gene ontology enrichment analysis showed that the most significant common enrichment pathway considering up-regulated genes in dSub and vSub was <i>steroid metabolism</i>. In contrast, the most significant enrichment pathway considering down-regulated genes in vSub was <i>axon guidance</i>. Our results indicate that preconditioning induces changes in the expression of genes related to synaptic reorganization, increased cholesterol metabolism, and astrogliosis in both dSub and vSub. Both regions also presented a decrease in the expression of genes related to glutamatergic transmission and an increase in expression of genes related to complement system activation and GABAergic transmission. The down-regulation of proapoptotic and axon guidance genes in the ventral subiculum suggests that preconditioning may induce a neuroprotective environment in this region.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/inpress.rss">Insulin action in the brain: cell types, circuits, and diseases</a></h4>

              
                Since its discovery over 100 years ago, insulin has been recognized as a key hormone in control of glucose homeostasis. Deficiencies of insulin signaling are central to diabetes and many other disorders. The brain is among the targets of insulin action, and insulin resistance is a major contributor to many diseases, including brain disorders. Here, we summarize key roles of insulin action in the brain and how this involves different brain cell types. Disordered brain insulin signaling can also contribute to neuropsychiatric diseases, affecting brain circuits involved in mood and cognition.

                Many neurological disorders have complex etiologies that include noninheritable factors, collectively called the neural exposome. The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke is developing a new office with goals to advance our understanding of the multiple causes of neurological illness and to enable the development of more effective interventions.

                Trigeminal ganglion neurons are activated in migraine and related headache disorders. Yang et al. developed a cell atlas in which human and mouse trigeminal ganglia are transcriptionally and epigenomically profiled at single-cell resolution. These data provide a rich resource for understanding the cell types and genetic mechanisms underlying migraine susceptibility and for developing novel analgesics.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Macrophage network dynamics depend on haptokinesis for optimal local surveillance</a></h4>

              
                Macrophages are key immune cells with important roles for tissue surveillance in almost all mammalian organs. Cellular networks made up of many individual macrophages allow for optimal removal of dead cell material and pathogens in tissues. However, the critical determinants that underlie these population responses have not been systematically studied. Here, we investigated how cell shape and the motility of individual cells influences macrophage network responses in 3D culture settings and in mouse tissues. We show that surveying macrophage populations can tolerate lowered actomyosin contractility, but cannot easily compensate for a lack of integrin-mediated adhesion. Although integrins were dispensable for macrophage chemotactic responses, they were crucial to control cell movement and protrusiveness for optimal surveillance by a macrophage population. Our study reveals that β1 integrins are important for maintaining macrophage shape and network sampling efficiency in mammalian tissues, and sets macrophage motility strategies apart from the integrin-independent 3D migration modes of many other immune cell subsets.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Coordination of two opposite flagella allows high-speed swimming and active turning of individual zoospores</a></h4>

              
                Phytophthora species cause diseases in a large variety of plants and represent a serious agricultural threat, leading, every year, to multibillion dollar losses. Infection occurs when these biflagellated zoospores move across the soil at their characteristic high speed and reach the roots of a host plant. Despite the relevance of zoospore spreading in the epidemics of plant diseases, characteristics of individual swimming of zoospores have not been fully investigated. It remains unknown about the characteristics of two opposite beating flagella during translation and turning, and the roles of each flagellum on zoospore swimming. Here, combining experiments and modeling, we show how these two flagella contribute to generate thrust when beating together, and identify the mastigonemes-attached anterior flagellum as the main source of thrust. Furthermore, we find that turning involves a complex active process, in which the posterior flagellum temporarily stops, while the anterior flagellum keeps on beating and changes its gait from sinusoidal waves to power and recovery strokes, similar to Chlamydomonas's breaststroke, to reorient its body to a new direction. Our study is a fundamental step towards a better understanding of the spreading of plant pathogens' motile forms, and shows that the motility pattern of these biflagellated zoospores represents a distinct eukaryotic version of the celebrated 'run-and-tumble' motility class exhibited by peritrichous bacteria.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Impact of a human gut microbe on Vibrio cholerae host colonization through biofilm enhancement</a></h4>

              
                Recent studies indicate that the human intestinal microbiota could impact the outcome of infection by <i>Vibrio cholerae</i>, the etiological agent of the diarrheal disease cholera. A commensal bacterium, <i>Paracoccus aminovorans</i>, was previously identified in high abundance in stool collected from individuals infected with <i>V. cholerae</i> when compared to stool from uninfected persons. However, if and how <i>P. aminovorans</i> interacts with <i>V. cholerae</i> has not been experimentally determined; moreover, whether any association between this bacterium alters the behaviors of <i>V. cholerae</i> to affect the disease outcome is unclear. Here we show that <i>P. aminovorans</i> and <i>V. cholerae</i> together form dual-species biofilm structure at the air-liquid interface, with previously uncharacterized novel features. Importantly, the presence of <i>P. aminovorans</i> within the murine small intestine enhances <i>V. cholerae</i> colonization in the same niche that is dependent on the <i>Vibrio</i> exopolysaccharide (VPS) and other major components of mature <i>V. cholerae</i> biofilm. These studies illustrate that multi-species biofilm formation is a plausible mechanism used by a gut microbe to increase the virulence of the pathogen, and this interaction may alter outcomes in enteric infections.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Pervasive translation in Mycobacterium tuberculosis</a></h4>

              
                Most bacterial ORFs are identified by automated prediction algorithms. However, these algorithms often fail to identify ORFs lacking canonical features such as a length of &gt;50 codons or the presence of an upstream Shine-Dalgarno sequence. Here, we use ribosome profiling approaches to identify actively translated ORFs in <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i>. Most of the ORFs we identify have not been previously described, indicating that the <i>M. tuberculosis</i> transcriptome is pervasively translated. The newly described ORFs are predominantly short, with many encoding proteins of ≤50 amino acids. Codon usage of the newly discovered ORFs suggests that most have not been subject to purifying selection, and hence are unlikely to contribute to cell fitness. Nevertheless, we identify 90 new ORFs (median length of 52 codons) that bear the hallmarks of purifying selection. Thus, our data suggest that pervasive translation of short ORFs in <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> serves as a rich source for the evolution of new functional proteins.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Intracellular Energy Controls Dynamics of Stress-induced Ribonucleoprotein Granules</a></h4>

              
                Energy metabolism and membraneless organelles have been implicated in human diseases including neurodegeneration. How energy stress regulates ribonucleoprotein particles such as stress granules (SGs) is still unclear. Here we identified a unique type of granules formed under energy stress and uncovered the mechanisms by which the dynamics of diverse stress-induced granules are regulated. Severe energy stress induced the rapid formation of energy-associated stress granules (eSGs), whereas moderate energy stress delayed the clearance of conventional SGs. The formation of eSGs or the clearance of conventional SGs was regulated by the mTOR-4EBP1-eIF4E pathway or eIF4A1, involving eIF4F complex assembly or RNA condensation, respectively. In ALS patients' neurons or cortical organoids, the eSG formation was enhanced, and conventional SG clearance was impaired. These results reveal a critical role for intracellular energy in the regulation of diverse granules and suggest that an imbalance in these dynamics may contribute to the pathogenesis of relevant diseases.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Localized and Distributed Representations of Person Knowledge for Faces</a></h4>

              
                Modular neural models of face processing posit that face-associated person-knowledge is localized in, or accessed through, the ventral anterior temporal lobe (vATL). However, some studies have suggested that person-knowledge is more widely distributed within a larger face-processing network that includes the mid-fusiform gyrus ("fusiform face area"). Here, we conducted an fMRI study to distinguish whether person-knowledge is localized or distributed by comparing brain responses evoked by synthetic faces, for which participants had learned person-knowledge (biographical facts) and faces for which the subjects had learned only physical facts. After extensive training, participants were cued to recall a particular biographical or physical fact about the upcoming face. In an alternate passive-viewing task, participants were shown the same faces but were not cued to recall biographical or physical facts. Classification analyses (MVPA) were performed on several a priori chosen face-selective regions (ROIs) in the ventral temporal cortex. Within each ROI tested in isolation, MVPA discriminated faces associated with person-knowledge from faces only associated with physical facts. This result is consistent with a distributed model for person-knowledge. However, when tested in a single model to separate shared and unique information, unique information was limited to the left mid-fusiform and vATL posterior (vATL-p) ROIs. Moreover, the feature weights from these two areas showed that only left vATL-p was specialized for processing biographical facts. This latter result was obtained only when these biographical facts were explicitly retrieved in the cueing task. Thus, our results indicate that the left vATL-p represents explicit recall of face-associated person-knowledge.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Changes in both top-down and bottom-up effective connectivity drive visual hallucinations in Parkinson's disease</a></h4>

              
                Visual hallucinations are common in Parkinson's disease and are associated with poorer quality of life and higher risk of dementia. An important and influential model that is widely accepted as an explanation for the mechanism of visual hallucinations in Parkinson's disease and other Lewy-body diseases is that these arise due to aberrant hierarchical processing, with impaired bottom-up integration of sensory information and overweighting of top-down perceptual priors within the visual system. This hypothesis has been driven by behavioural data and supported indirectly by observations derived from regional activation and correlational measures using neuroimaging. However, until now, there was no evidence from neuroimaging for differences in causal influences between brain regions measured in patients with Parkinson's hallucinations. This is in part because previous resting-state studies focus on functional connectivity, which is inherently undirected in nature and cannot test hypotheses about directionality of connectivity. Spectral dynamic causal modelling is a Bayesian framework that allows the inference of effective connectivity - defined as the directed (causal) influence that one region exerts on another region - from resting-state functional MRI data. In the current study, we utilise spectral dynamic causal modelling to estimate effective connectivity within the resting-state visual network in our cohort of 15 Parkinson's disease visual hallucinators, and 75 Parkinson's disease non-hallucinators. We find that visual hallucinators display decreased bottom-up effective connectivity from the lateral geniculate nucleus to primary visual cortex and increased top-down effective connectivity from left prefrontal cortex to primary visual cortex and medial thalamus, as compared to non-hallucinators. Importantly, we find that the pattern of effective connectivity is predictive of the presence of visual hallucinations and associated with their severity within the hallucinating group. This is the first study to provide evidence, using resting state effective connectivity, to support a model of aberrant hierarchical predictive processing as the mechanism for visual hallucinations in Parkinson's disease.

                The parahippocampal cingulum bundle (PHCB) connects regions known to be vulnerable to early Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology, such as posteromedial cortex and medial temporal lobe. While AD-related pathology has been robustly associated with alterations in PHCB microstructure, specifically lower fractional anisotropy (FA) and higher mean diffusivity (MD), emerging evidence indicates that the reverse pattern is evident in younger adults at-risk of AD. In one such study, Hodgetts et al. (2019) reported that healthy young adult carriers of the apolipoprotein-E (APOE) {varepsilon}4 allele - the strongest common genetic risk factor for AD - showed higher FA and lower MD in the PHCB but not the inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF). These results are consistent with proposals claiming that heightened neural activity and connectivity have a significant role in posteromedial cortex vulnerability to amyloid-{beta} and tau spread beyond the medial temporal lobe. Given the implications for understanding AD risk, here we sought to replicate Hodgetts et al.'s finding in a larger sample (N = 128; 40 APOE {varepsilon}4 carriers, 88 APOE {varepsilon}4 non-carriers) of young adults (age range: 19-33). Extending this work further, we also conducted exploratory analyses using a more advanced measure of microstructure: hindrance modulated orientational anisotropy (HMOA). These analyses included an investigation of hemispheric asymmetry in PHCB and ILF HMOA. Contrary to the original study, we observed no difference in PHCB microstructure between APOE {varepsilon}4 carriers and non-carriers. Bayes factors (BFs) further revealed moderate-to-strong evidence in support of these null findings. APOE {varepsilon}4-related differences in ILF HMOA asymmetry were evident, however, with carriers demonstrating lower leftward asymmetry. Our findings indicate that young adult APOE {varepsilon}4 carriers do not show alterations in PHCB microstructure, as observed by Hodgetts et al., but may show altered asymmetry in ILF microstructure.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Quantifying cerebral blood arrival times using hypoxia-mediated arterial BOLD contrast</a></h4>

              
                Cerebral blood arrival and tissue transit times are sensitive measures of the efficiency of tissue perfusion and can provide clinically meaningful information on collateral blood flow status. We exploit the arterial blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal contrast established by precisely modulating arterial hemoglobin saturation using hypoxic respiratory challenges (dOHb-BOLD) to quantify arterial blood arrival times throughout the brain. A combination of hemodynamic lag with a modified carpet plot analysis yielded lag, onset (blood arrival), mean transit time (MTT) and hypoxic response information, which is indicative of relative total blood volume. Onset times averaged across 12 healthy subjects were 1.1 {+/-} 0.4 and 1.9 {+/-} 0.6 for cortical gray and deep white matter, respectively. The average whole brain MTT was 4.5 {+/-} 0.9 seconds. The dOHb-BOLD response was 1.7 fold higher in grey versus white; in line with known differences in regional blood volume fraction. Our method was also applied in unilateral carotid artery occlusion patient, which revealed prolonged signal onset with normal perfusion in the affected hemisphere. In cases with exhausted reserve capacity or confounding flow effects such as vascular steal, dOHb-BOLD can potentially inform on collateral flow pathways to provide a valuable compliment to clinical vascular reactivity measures.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A toolkit of highly selective and sensitive genetically encoded neuropeptide sensors</a></h4>

              
                Neuropeptides are key signaling molecules in the endocrine and nervous systems that regulate many critical physiological processes, including energy balance, sleep and circadian rhythms, stress, and social behaviors. Understanding the functions of neuropeptides in vivo requires the ability to monitor their dynamics with high specificity, sensitivity, and spatiotemporal resolution; however, this has been hindered by the lack of direct, sensitive and non-invasive tools. Here, we developed a series of GRAB (G protein-coupled receptor activation-based) sensors for detecting somatostatin (SST), cholecystokinin (CCK), corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF), neuropeptide Y (NPY), neurotensin (NTS), and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP). These fluorescent sensors utilize the corresponding GPCRs as the neuropeptide-sensing module with the insertion of a circular-permutated GFP as the optical reporter. This design detects the binding of specific neuropeptides at nanomolar concentration with a robust increase in fluorescence. We used these GRAB neuropeptide sensors to measure the spatiotemporal dynamics of endogenous SST release in isolated pancreatic islets and to detect the release of both CCK and CRF in acute brain slices. Moreover, we detect endogenous CRF release induced by stressful experiences in vivo using fiber photometry and 2-photon imaging in mice. Together, these new sensors establish a robust toolkit for studying the release, function, and regulation of neuropeptides under both physiological and pathophysiological conditions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy is prevented by blocking postictal hypoxia</a></h4>

              
                Epilepsy is at times a fatal disease. Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is the leading cause of mortality in people with intractable epilepsy and is defined by exclusion; non-accidental, non-toxicologic, and non-anatomic causes of death. While SUDEP often follows a bilateral tonic-clonic seizure, the mechanisms that ultimately lead to terminal apnea and then asystole remain elusive and there is a lack preventative treatments. Based on the observation that discrete seizures lead to local vasoconstriction, resulting in hypoperfusion, hypoxia and behavioural disturbances in the forebrain (Farrell et al., 2016 eLife), we reasoned that similar mechanisms may play a role in SUDEP when seizures invade the brainstem. Here we tested this neurovascular-based hypothesis of SUDEP in awake non-anesthetized mice by pharmacologically preventing seizure-induced vasoconstriction, with cyclooxygenase-2 or L-type calcium channel antagonists. In both acute and chronic mouse models of SUDEP, ibuprofen and nicardipine extended life. We also examined the potential role of spreading depolarization in the acute model of SUDEP. These data provide a proof of principle for the neurovascular hypothesis of SUDEP and the use of currently available treatments to prevent it.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Altered M2 Cortex - Superior Colliculus visual perception circuit in Huntington's Disease</a></h4>

              
                The premotor cortical area -M2 cortex in rodents- connection to the striatum is involved in movement and prominently affected in Huntington's Disease (HD). M2 cortex also projects to the superior colliculus (SC), implicated in oculomotor functions (i.e. saccades) and visual perception. Here, we investigated the contribution of M2 cortex - SC circuit to HD physiopathology in male mice. Using fMRI, we observed that M2 cortex functional connectivity with the SC was the most prominently affected circuit in the symptomatic R6/1 HD mouse model. Structural alterations were also detected by tractography and viral tracing. HD mice showed decreased defensive behavioral responses towards an unexpected visual stimuli, such as a moving robo-beetle, and decreased locomotion upon unexpected flash of light. Additionally, optogenetic M2 cortex - SC stimulation promoted avoidance responses towards the robo-beetle in WT, but not HD mice. Though, DWI measurements in vivo and ex vivo electrophysiological responses to optogenetic and electrical stimuli in the SC suggested preserved brain structure. Finally, GCamp6f fluorescence recordings with fiber photometry indicated that aberrant M2 cortex engagement might be the underlying mechanism of visual perception alterations in HD. Collectively, our findings point to a key role of M2 cortex - SC circuit alterations in HD pathophysiology.

                In neurodegenerative diseases of the human spinal cord, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), motoneurons are particularly vulnerable to degeneration. It is hypothesized that their large size contributes to disease susceptibility, but the link between genetic variants associated with disease and cell-type specific degeneration is not clear. We characterized human spinal cord cells using single-nucleus RNA-sequencing and protein profiling. We found that human motoneurons displayed a unique expression profile characterized by factors involved in cytoskeletal structure, cell size, and degenerative disease (including ALS-associated genes SOD1, NEFH, OPTN, TUBA4A, PRPH, and STMN2) and that protein expression of these genes correlated with larger cell size in tissue. This work suggests a motoneuron-specific signature underlies their selective vulnerability to neurodegeneration.

	<p>The eight-and-a-half syndrome is a rare neuro-ophthalmological condition caused by a structural lesion in the dorsal portion of the pons, involving critical areas of the brainstem, i.e., medial longitudinal fasciculus (MLF), abducens nucleus, facial genu, and colliculus. It is characterized by internuclear ophthalmoplegia with horizontal gaze palsy and peripheral facial palsy. Although the syndrome is most frequently caused by vascular or demyelinating diseases, several different underlying causes might occur. Herein, we describe a case of the eight-and-a-half syndrome caused by a lung adenocarcinoma metastasis localized in the lower pontine tegmentum. Then, we review the current literature on the underlying causes of the eight-and-a-half syndrome.</p>

	<p>In neuro-rehabilitation, the assessment of post-stroke patients&amp;amp;rsquo; motor function of damaged upper extremities (UEs) is essential. Clinicians need clear and concise assessment instruments to monitor progress recorded in intensive rehabilitation sessions. One such instrument is Manual Muscle Testing (MMT), which, in our view, requires a modified scoring model aimed at improving the assessment process of patients&amp;amp;rsquo; motor and functional UE status, and recording their step-by-step-progress, especially if patients undergo a short length of hospitalization (of about 10 therapy days). Hence, this paper presents a new scoring system developed by the authors. This systemresults in a more precise MMT grading scale, which has more grades and can provide a more specific muscular assessment, while offering more clarity in quantifying patients&amp;amp;rsquo; progress after physical therapy. A prospective study was made of 41 post-stroke patients with upper extremity (UE) impairments. To determine the validity of the assessment tool for hypothesizing, and the unidimensionality and internal consistency of the customized model, exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) with a structural equation model (SEM), Cronbach&amp;amp;rsquo;s Alpha, and Pearson correlation coefficients were used with Fugl&amp;amp;ndash;Meyer (FM) assessments, the Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS), AROM, and the Modified Rankin Scale (MRS). Considering the unidimensionality of the instrument used, we performed a linear regression to identify whether certain movements performed segmentally by the manually evaluated muscles influence the measured manual score of the whole UE. All indices suggested a good model fit, and a Cronbach&amp;amp;rsquo;s Alpha of 0.920 suggested strong internal consistency. The Pearson correlation coefficient of the MMT-customized score with AROM was 0.857, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001; that with FMUE was 0.905, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001; that with MRS was &amp;amp;minus;0.608, p = 0.010; and that with MAS was &amp;amp;minus;0.677, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001. The linear regression results suggest that wrist extensors, shoulder abductors, and finger flexors can influence the manual assessment of the muscle strength of the whole UE, thereby improving post-stroke patient management. The results of our research suggest that, using the proposed scoring, MMT may be a useful tool for UE assessment in post-stroke patients.</p>

	<p>The rapid increase in population aging and associated age-related cognitive decline requires identifying innovative and effective methods to prevent it. To manage this socio-economic challenge, physical, cognitive, and combined stimulations are proposed. The superiority of simultaneous training compared to passive control and physical training alone seems to be an efficient method, but very few studies assess the acute effect on executive function. This study aimed to investigate the acute effect of simultaneous physical and cognitive exercise on executive functions in healthy older adults, in comparison with either training alone. Seventeen healthy older adults performed three experimental conditions in randomized order: physical exercise, cognitive exercise, and simultaneous physical and cognitive exercise. The protocol involved a 30 min exercise duration at 60% of theoretical maximal heart rate or 30 min of cognitive exercise or both. Executive functions measured by the Stroop task and pre-frontal cortex oxygenation were assessed before and after the intervention. We found a main effect of time on executive function and all experimental condition seems to improve inhibition and flexibility scores (&amp;amp;lt;0.05). We also found a decrease in cerebral oxygenation (&amp;amp;Delta;[HbO2]) in both hemispheres after each intervention in all cognitive performance assessed (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). Simultaneous physical and cognitive exercise is as effective a method as either physical or cognitive exercise alone for improving executive function. The results of this study may have important clinical repercussions by allowing to optimize the interventions designed to maintain the cognitive health of older adults since simultaneous provide a time-efficient strategy to improve cognitive performance in older adults.</p>

	<p>Neurological manifestations during the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic are of interest, regarding acute treatment and the so-called post-COVID-19 syndrome. Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative movement disorders worldwide. Hence, the influence of SARS-CoV-2 and the COVID-19 syndrome on PD patients has raised many questions and produced various publications with conflicting results. We reviewed the literature, with respect to symptoms, treatment, and whether the virus itself might cause PD during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in SARS-CoV-2-affected symptomatic PD patients (COVID-19 syndrome). In addition, we comment on the consequences in non-symptomatic and non-affected PD patients, as well as post-COVID syndrome and its potential linkage to PD, presenting our own data from our out-patient clinic.</p>

	<p>High-definition transcranial direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS) has recently been proposed as a tDCS approach that can be used on a specific cortical region without causing undesirable stimulation effects. In this uncontrolled pilot study, the cortical hemodynamic changes caused by HD-tDCS applied over the ipsilesional motor cortical area were investigated in 26 stroke patients. HD-tDCS using one anodal and four cathodal electrodes at 1 mA was administered for 20 min to C3 or C4 in four daily sessions. Cortical activation was measured as changes in oxyhemoglobin (oxyHb) concentration, as found using a functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) system during the finger tapping task (FTT) with the affected hand before and after HD-tDCS. Motor-evoked potential and upper extremity functions were also measured before (T0) and after the intervention (T1). A group statistical parametric mapping analysis showed that the oxyHb concentration increased during the FTT in both the affected and unaffected hemispheres before HD-tDCS. After HD-tDCS, the oxyHb concentration increased only in the affected hemisphere. In a time series analysis, the mean and integral oxyHb concentration during the FTT showed a noticeable decrease in the channel closest to the hand motor hotspot (hMHS) in the affected hemisphere after HD-tDCS compared with before HD-tDCS, in accordance with an improvement in the function of the affected upper extremity. These results suggest that HD-tDCS might be helpful to rebalance interhemispheric cortical activity and to reduce the hemodynamic burden on the affected hemisphere during hand motor tasks. Noticeable changes in the area adjacent to the affected hMHS may imply that personalized HD-tDCS electrode placement is needed to match each patient&amp;amp;rsquo;s individual hMHS location.</p>

	<p>Background and Objectives: Ankle foot orthoses (AFOs) are commonly used by stroke patients to walk safely and efficiently. Both posterior AFOs (PAFOs) and anterior AFOs (AAFOs) are available. The objective of this study was to compare the efficacy of AAFOs and PAFOs in the treatment of ankle spasticity. Materials and Methods: A crossover design with randomization for the interventions and blinded assessors was used. Twenty patients with chronic stroke, a Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS) score of the ankle joint of 2, and a Tardieu angle &amp;amp;ge;20 degrees were recruited. The patients were assigned to wear either an AAFO or PAFO at random and subsequently crossover to the other AFO. Results: Twenty stroke patients with ankle spasticity were recruited. The mean age was 46.60 (38&amp;amp;ndash;60) years. The mean time since stroke onset was 9.35 (6&amp;amp;ndash;15) months. It was discovered that the AAFO improved walking speed as well as the stretch reflex dynamic electromyography (dEMG) and walking dEMG amplitudes of the medial gastrocnemius muscles more significantly than the PAFO (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). Conclusions: The AAFO had greater efficacy in reducing both static and dynamic ankle spasticity, and allowed for faster walking than the PAFO. The stretch reflex and walking dEMG amplitudes could be used for quantitative spasticity assessment.</p>

	<p>In patients with severe motor paralysis, increasing the excitability of the supplementary motor area (SMA) in the non-injured hemisphere contributes to the recovery of lower limb motor function. However, the contribution of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) over the SMA of the non-injured hemisphere in the recovery of lower limb motor function is unclear. This study aimed to examine the effects of tDCS on bilateral hemispheric SMA combined with assisted gait training. A post-stroke patient with severe motor paralysis participated in a retrospective AB design. Assisted gait training was performed only in period A and tDCS to the SMA of the bilateral hemisphere combined with assisted gait training (bi-tDCS) was performed in period B. Additionally, three conditions were performed for 20 min each in the intervals between the two periods: (1) assisted gait training only, (2) assisted gait training combined with tDCS to the SMA of the injured hemisphere, and (3) bi-tDCS. Measurements were muscle activity and beta-band intermuscular coherence (reflecting corticospinal tract excitability) of the vastus medialis muscle. The bi-tDCS immediately and longitudinally increased muscle activity and intermuscular coherence. We consider that bi-tDCS may be effective in recovering lower limb motor function in a patient with severe motor paralysis.</p>

                <p>This exploratory case-control study investigates the synaptic marker Beta-Synuclein in serum and plasma pTau181 in adults with Down syndrome (DS) with (sDS, n=14) and without (aDS, n=47) clinical symptoms of Alzheimer´s disease (AD) as well as euploid controls (HC, n=23). Beta-Synuclein was higher in aDS and more pronounced in sDS (p&lt;0.0001) whereas pTau181 was only higher in sDS (p&lt;0.0001). Both markers showed good discriminatory power (AUC&gt;0.90) to distinguish symptomatic from asymptomatic AD. The data indicate that synaptic alterations belong to the earliest AD-associated events in DS and highlight the value of serum Beta-Synuclein as a potential early marker of AD.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Collier/Olf/EBF (COE) transcription factors have distinct expression patterns in the developing and mature nervous system. To date, a neurological disease association has been conclusively established for only the <i>Early B-cell Factor-3</i> (<i>EBF3</i>) COE family member through the identification of heterozygous loss-of-function variants in individuals with autism spectrum/neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD). Here, we identify a symptom severity risk association with missense variants primarily disrupting the zinc finger domain (ZNF) in <i>EBF3</i>-related NDD.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>A phenotypic assessment of 41 individuals was combined with a literature meta-analysis for a total of 83 individuals diagnosed with <i>EBF3</i>-related NDD. Quantitative diagnostic phenotypic and symptom severity scales were developed to compare <i>EBF3</i> variant type and location to identify genotype-phenotype correlations. To stratify the effects of <i>EBF3</i> variants disrupting either the DNA-binding domain (DBD) or the ZNF, we utilized <i>in vivo</i> fruit fly UAS-GAL4 expression and <i>in vitro</i> luciferase assays.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We show that patient symptom severity correlates with <i>EBF3</i> missense variants perturbing the ZNF, which is a key protein domain required for stabilizing the interaction between EBF3 and the target DNA sequence. We found that ZNF-associated variants failed to restore viability in the fruit fly and impaired transcriptional activation. However, the recurrent variant EBF3 p.Arg209Trp in the DBD is capable of partially rescuing viability in the fly and preserved transcriptional activation.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>We describe a symptom severity risk association with ZNF perturbations and EBF3 loss-of-function in the largest reported cohort to date of <i>EBF3</i>-related NDD patients. This analysis should have potential predictive clinical value for newly identified patients with <i>EBF3</i> gene variants.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Nr2f1-dependent shaping of mitochondrial architecture in newborn mouse hippocampal neurons unravels novel insights into the neurodevelopmental disorder BBSOAS</a></h4>

              
                The nuclear receptor Nr2f1, also known as COUP-TFI, plays a key role during cortical development by acting as a strong transcriptional regulator in embryonic and adult neural cells. In humans, NR2F1 mutations cause the Bosch-Boonstra-Schaaf optic atrophy-intellectual syndrome (BBSOAS), a rare neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by multiple clinical features including optic nerve atrophy, cerebral visual impairment, seizures, intellectual disability, and autistic traits. Moreover, alterations in mitochondrial energy supply have been recently reported in some BBSOAS patients. Although mitochondrial dysfunction is increasingly implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders, whether and how Nr2f1 can regulate mitochondria function in neural cells is still completely unknown. To address these questions, we have combined genome-wide and in silico analyses with mouse genetics, neuroanatomical and imaging approaches. First, we found that key factors for mitochondrial function and dynamics represent potential genomic targets under direct Nr2f1 transcriptional control in neurons. To genetically manipulate Nr2f1 function in a restricted neuronal population, we focused on the adult mouse hippocampal dentate gyrus, a site of persistent neurogenesis in rodents and where Nr2f1 is highly expressed. We showed that both loss- and gain-of-function of Nr2f1 within the hippocampal neurogenic niche led to altered mitochondrial architecture in newborn neurons likely reflecting alteration in mitochondrial dynamics. Lastly, we identified the fusion factor Mfn2 as a putative Nr2f1 target and demonstrated its downregulation following both Nr2f1 adult depletion and embryonic haploinsufficiency in mice. Overall, our study provides the first evidence of a significant role of Nr2f1 in shaping mitochondrial architecture in neurons and opens a promising avenue for the identification of new mechanisms implicated in BBSOAS pathogenesis involving mitochondrial dysfunction.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Fast-synaptic axo-axonal transmission from striatal cholinergic interneurons onto dopamine fibers.</a></h4>

              
                Transmission from striatal cholinergic interneurons (CINs) controls dopamine release through nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) on dopaminergic axons. Anatomical studies suggest that cholinergic terminals signal predominantly through non-synaptic volume transmission. However, the influence of cholinergic transmission on electrical signaling in axons remains unclear. We examined axo-axonal transmission from CINs onto dopaminergic axons using perforated-patch recordings which revealed rapid spontaneous EPSPs with properties characteristic of fast synapses. Pharmacology showed that axonal EPSPs (axEPSPs) were mediated primarily by high-affinity 6-containing receptors. Remarkably, axEPSPs triggered spontaneous action potentials locally in dopaminergic axons, suggesting these axons perform integration to convert synaptic input into spiking, a function associated with somatodendritic compartments. We investigated cross-species validity of cholinergic axo-axonal transmission by recording dopaminergic axons in macaque putamen and found similar axEPSPs. Thus, we reveal that fast synaptic-like neurotransmission underlies cholinergic signaling onto dopaminergic axons, providing insight into how nicotinic receptors shape electrical signaling directly in axon terminals.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Nonlinear EEG signatures of mind wandering during breath focus meditation</a></h4>

              
                In meditation practices that involve focused attention to a specific object, novice practitioners often experience moments of distraction (i.e., mind wandering). Previous studies have investigated the neural correlates of mind wandering during meditation practice through Electroencephalography (EEG) using linear metrics (e.g., oscillatory power). However, their results are not fully consistent. Since the brain is known to be a chaotic/nonlinear system, it is possible that linear metrics cannot fully capture complex dynamics present in the EEG signal. In this study, we assess whether nonlinear EEG signatures can be used to characterize mind wandering during breath focus meditation in novice practitioners. For that purpose, we adopted an experience sampling paradigm in which 25 participants were iteratively interrupted during meditation practice to report whether they were focusing on the breath or thinking about something else. We compared the complexity of EEG signals during mind wandering and breath focus states using three different algorithms: Higuchi fractal dimension (HFD), Lempel-Ziv complexity (LZC), and Sample entropy (SampEn). Our results showed that EEG complexity was generally reduced during mind wandering relative to breath focus states. We conclude that EEG complexity metrics are appropriate to disentangle mind wandering from breath focus states in novice meditation practitioners, and therefore, they could be used in future EEG neurofeedback and/or neurostimulation protocols to facilitate meditation practice.

                Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a promising neuromodulation therapy that alters neural activity via intracranial electrical stimulation. However, the neurophysiological mechanisms of DBS remain largely unknown, because of the difficulty of obtaining cellular resolution recordings without electrical interference. Here, we performed high-speed membrane voltage fluorescence imaging of individual hippocampal CA1 neurons during DBS in awake mice. We discovered that DBS, delivered at either 40Hz or 140Hz, reliably depolarizes somatic membrane potentials. Further, DBS enhanced spike rates and paced membrane voltage and spike timing at the stimulation frequency, though more prominent at 40Hz than 140Hz. To determine how DBS induced membrane voltage change impacts neuron's ability to process inputs, we optogenetically evoked membrane depolarization. We found that neurons become unreliable in responding to optogenetic inputs during DBS, particularly during 140Hz DBS. These results demonstrate that DBS produces powerful membrane depolarization that interferes with neuron's ability to process inputs, creating information lesion

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Variation in TAF1 expression in female carrier induced pluripotent stem cells and human brain ontogeny has implications for adult neostriatum vulnerability in X-linked Dystonia Parkinsonism</a></h4>

              
                X-linked Dystonia-Parkinsonism (XDP) is an inherited, X-linked, adult-onset movement disorder characterized by degeneration in the neostriatum. No therapeutics alter disease progression. The mechanisms underlying regional differences in degeneration and age of onset are unknown. Developing therapeutics that target XDP-related mechanisms requires a deeper understanding of how XDP-relevant features vary in health and disease. XDP is due, in part, to either a partial loss of TAF1 function and/or a SVA-driven pathological gain of function. A disease-specific SINE-VNTR-Alu (SVA) retrotransposon insertion occurs within intron 32 of TAF1, a subunit of TFIID involved in transcription initiation. While all XDP males are usually clinically affected, females are heterozygous carriers generally not manifesting the full syndrome. As a resource for disease modeling, we characterized eight iPSC lines from XDP female carrier individuals, and identified isogenic lines where one clonal iPSC line expressed the wild-type X, and the two other clonal iPSC lines expressed the XDP haplotype. Furthermore, we characterized XDP-relevant transcript expression variation in humans, and found that SVA-F expression decreases slightly after 30 years of age in the neurotypical human brain and that TAF1 is modestly decreased in the majority of female samples. Uniquely in the caudate nucleus, TAF1 expression is not sexually dymorphic and decreased after 15 years of age. These findings indicate that regional-, age- and sex-specific mechanisms regulate TAF1, highlighting the importance of disease-relevant models and postmortem tissue analysis. We propose that the decreased TAF1 expression in the adult caudate may synergize with the XDP-specific partial loss of TAF1 function in patients, thereby passing a minimum threshold of TAF1 function, and triggering degeneration in the neostriatum.

Significance StatementXDP is an inherited, X-linked, adult-onset movement disorder characterized by degeneration in the neostriatum. No therapeutics alter disease progression. Developing therapeutics requires a deeper understanding of how XDP-relevant features vary in health and disease. XDP is possibly due to a partial loss of TAF1 function. While all XDP males are usually affected, females are heterozygous carriers generally not manifesting the full syndrome. As a resource for disease modeling, we characterized eight stem cell lines from XDP female carrier individuals. Furthermore, we found that, uniquely in the caudate nucleus, TAF1 expression decreases after adolescence in healthy humans. We hypothesize that the decrease of TAF1 after adolescence in human caudate, in general, may underlie the vulnerability of the adult neostriatum in XDP.

                A hallmark of nervous system aging is a decline of white matter volume and function, but the underlying mechanisms leading to white matter pathology are unknown. Here, we found age-related alterations of oligodendrocytes with a reduction of total oligodendrocyte density in the aging murine white matter. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we identify interferon-responsive oligodendrocytes, which localize in proximity of CD8+ T cells in the aging white matter. Absence of functional lymphocytes decreased oligodendrocyte reactivity and rescued oligodendrocyte loss, while T-cell checkpoint inhibition worsened the aging affect. In summary, we provide evidence that T cells induced interferon-responsive oligodendrocytes are important modifiers of white matter aging.

                Huntington's Disease (HD) is caused by an expanded CAG repeat in the huntingtin gene, yielding a Huntingtin protein with an expanded polyglutamine tract. Patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) can help understand disease; however, defining pathological biomarkers is challenging. Here, we used cryogenic electron tomography to visualize neurites in HD patient iPSC-derived neurons with varying CAG repeats, and primary cortical neurons from BACHD, deltaN17-BACHD, and wild-type mice. In HD models, we discovered mitochondria with enlarged granules and distorted cristae, and thin sheet aggregates in double membrane-bound organelles. We used artificial intelligence to quantify mitochondrial granules, and proteomics to show differential protein content in HD mitochondria. Knockdown of Protein Inhibitor of Activated STAT1 ameliorated aberrant phenotypes in iPSC-neurons and reduced phenotypes in BACHD neurons. We show that integrated ultrastructural and proteomic approaches may uncover early HD phenotypes to accelerate diagnostics and the development of targeted therapeutics for HD.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Petascale pipeline for precise alignment of images from serial section electron microscopy</a></h4>

              
                The reconstruction of neural circuits from serial section electron microscopy (ssEM) images is being accelerated by automatic image segmentation methods. Segmentation accuracy is often limited by the preceding step of aligning 2D section images to create a 3D image stack. Precise and robust alignment in the presence of image artifacts is challenging, especially as datasets are attaining the petascale. We present a computational pipeline for aligning ssEM images with several key elements. Self-supervised convolutional nets are trained via metric learning to encode and align image pairs, and they are used to initialize iterative fine-tuning of alignment. A procedure called vector voting increases robustness to image artifacts or missing image data. For speedup the series is divided into blocks that are distributed to computational workers for alignment. The blocks are aligned to each other by composing transformations with decay, which achieves a global alignment without resorting to a time-consuming global optimization. We apply our pipeline to a whole fly brain dataset, and show improved accuracy relative to prior state of the art. We also demonstrate that our pipeline scales to a cubic millimeter of mouse visual cortex. Our pipeline is publicly available through two open source Python packages.

                Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease and is the sixth leading cause of death in the US. AD is more prevalent in females than males. While estrogen provides neuroprotection in females, sex mediated differences in the development of AD pathology are not fully elucidated. Therefore, a comparison of the events that develop between sexes in the early-stage of AD pathology may reveal new potential targets for more effective therapeutic intervention. To address sex differences, we analyzed early stage 9-month male and female TgF344-AD (Tg-AD) rats, an AD model carrying the APPswe and Presenilin 1 (PS1{Delta}E9) mutations that develops progressive age-dependent AD pathology similar to humans. Using active place avoidance (aPAT) tests that assess hippocampal-dependent spatial learning and memory, we found significant deficits in Tg-AD females compared to wild type females, but no significant difference between the two male genotypes. Moreover, significant sex differences were observed in that Tg-AD females outperformed Tg-AD males in several measures of the aPAT test. Unexpectedly, Tg-AD females displayed higher levels of hippocampal amyloid plaques and amoeboid microglia than their Tg-AD male littermates. Furthermore, Tg-AD females experienced less hippocampal neuronal loss and had higher GluA2 subunit levels than Tg-AD males. Based on our findings, we propose that estrogen may protect females against cognitive impairment at early stages of AD by regulating GluA2 levels independently of amyloid plaque deposition and gliosis. Elucidating this potential protective mechanism of action of estrogen in AD could lead to new targets for early intervention.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Effects of variability in manually contoured spinal cord masks on fMRI co-registration and interpretation</a></h4>

              
                Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of the human spinal cord (SC) is an emerging method for understanding neurovascular responses to stimuli. Group-analysis of SC fMRI data involves co-registration of subject-level data to standard space, which requires manual masking of the cord and may result in bias of group-level SC fMRI results. To test this, we examined variability in SC masks drawn in fMRI data from 21 healthy participants from a completed study mapping responses to sensory stimuli of the C7 dermatome. Masks were drawn on temporal mean functional image by eight raters with varying levels of neuroimaging experience, and the rater from the original study acted as an expert reference. Spatial agreement between rater and expert masks was measured using the Dice Similarity Coefficient, and the influence of rater and dataset was examined using ANOVA. Each rater's masks were used to register functional data to the PAM50 template. Gray matter-white matter signal contrast of registered functional data was used to evaluate the spatial normalization accuracy across raters. Subject- and group-level analyses of activation during left- and right-sided sensory stimuli were performed for each rater's co-registered data. Agreement with the expert's SC mask was associated with both rater experience level (F(7,140) = 32.12, P < 2x10-16, {eta}2 = 0.29) and dataset (F(20,140) = 20.58, P < 2x10-16, {eta}2 = 0.53). Dataset variations may reflect image quality metrics: the ratio between the signal intensity of spinal cord voxels and surrounding cerebrospinal fluid was correlated with DSC results (p<0.001). As predicted, variability in the manually-drawn masks influenced spatial normalization, and GM:WM contrast in the registered data showed significant effects of rater and dataset (rater: F(8,160) = 23.57, P < 2x10-16, {eta}2 = 0.24; dataset: F(20,160) = 22.00, P < 2x10-16, {eta}2 = 0.56). Registration differences propagated into subject-level activation maps which showed rater-dependent agreement with the expert. Although group-level activation maps differed between raters, no systematic bias was identified. Increasing consistency in manual contouring of spinal cord fMRI data improved co-registration and inter-rater agreement in activation mapping, however our results suggest that improvements in image acquisition and post-processing are also critical to address.

                High-density multi-electrode array (HD-MEA) has enabled neuronal measurements at high spatial resolution to record local field potentials (LFP), extracellular spikes, and network activity with ease. Whilst we have advanced recording systems with over 4000 electrodes, capable of recording data at over 20 kHz, it still presents computational challenges to handle, process, extract, and view information from these large recordings. It can be challenging for researchers to extract and view even a single channel that has more than a billion data points, let alone process a group of channels. We have created a computational method, and an open-source toolkit built on Python, rendered on a web browser using Plotly Dash for extracting and viewing the data, and creating interactive visualization. In addition to extracting and viewing entire or small chunks of data sampled at lower or higher frequencies, respectively, it provides a framework to collect user inputs, analyze channel groups, generate raster plots, view quick summary measures for LFP activity, detect and isolate noise channels, and generate plots and visualization in both time and frequency domain. Incorporated into our Graphical User Interface (GUI), we also have created a novel seizure detection method, which can be used to detect the onset of seizures in all or a selected group of channels and provide the following measures of seizures: distance, duration, and propagation across the region of interest. We demonstrate the utility of this toolkit, using datasets collected from the 3Brain BioCAM duplex system. For the current analysis, we demonstrate the toolkit and methods with a low sampling frequency dataset (300 Hz) and a group of approximately 400 channels. Using this toolkit, we present novel data demonstrating increased seizure propagation speed from slices of Scn1aHet mice compared to littermate controls. With advances in HD-MEA recording systems with high spatial and temporal resolution, limited tools are available for researchers to view and process these big datasets. We now provide a user-friendly toolkit to analyze LFP activity obtained from large-scale MEA recordings with translatable applications to EEG recordings, and demonstrate the utility of this new graphic user interface with novel biological findings.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Retinotopic tiling of retinal ganglion cell axons at single-cell precision in the mouse superior colliculus</a></h4>

              
                Retinotopy is generally preserved across the visual system, but its precise cellular-level organization remains elusive. Using two-photon axonal imaging, we performed functional mapping of the retinocollicular projection at a single-cell resolution in awake mice. We found a near-perfect match between the tiling patterns of retinal ganglion cell axon terminals in the superior colliculus and their corresponding receptive fields, indicating that retinotopy arises from topographic projection of axons at single-cell precision.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">ALS sensitive spinal motor neurons enter a degenerative downward spiral of impaired splicing and proteostasis</a></h4>

              
                Despite clear therapeutic potential, the mechanisms that confer differential neuronal sensitivity are not well understood. During Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), sensitive spinal motor neurons (SpMN) die while a subset of rostral cranial motor neurons (CrMN) survive. In this work, we optimized a protocol to differentiate CrMNs and SpMNs from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) by direct programming and positional patterning. Human iCrMNs are more resistant than iSpMNs to proteotoxic stress and rely on the proteasome to maintain proteostasis. iCrMNs better prevent mislocalization of TDP43 from the nucleus, a hallmark of ALS progression. iSpMNs contain more splicing defects than iCrMNs in response to ALS-related stress with genes involved in splicing and proteostasis maintenance. Therefore, iCrMNs resist ALS at two levels, preventing protein accumulation and reducing splicing defects in response to TDP43 nuclear depletion. Thus, ALS-sensitive iSpMNs appear to enter a downward spiral compromising their ability to maintain proteostasis and splicing.
