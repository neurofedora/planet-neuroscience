              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Contrasting parental roles shape sex differences in poison frog space use but not navigational performance</a></h4>

              
                Sex differences in vertebrate spatial abilities are typically interpreted under the adaptive specialization hypothesis, which posits that male reproductive success is linked to larger home ranges and better navigational skills. The androgen spillover hypothesis counters that enhanced male spatial performance may be a byproduct of higher androgen levels. Animal groups that include species where females are expected to outperform males based on life-history traits are key for disentangling these hypotheses. We investigated the association between sex differences in reproductive strategies, spatial behavior, and androgen levels in three species of poison frogs. We tracked individuals in natural environments to show that contrasting parental sex roles shape sex differences in space use, where the sex performing parental duties shows wider-ranging movements. We then translocated frogs from their home areas to test their navigational performance and found that the caring sex outperformed the non-caring sex only in one out of three species. In addition, males across species displayed more explorative behavior than females and androgen levels correlated with explorative behavior and homing accuracy. Overall, we reveal that poison frog reproductive strategies shape movement patterns but not necessarily navigational performance. Together this work suggests that prevailing adaptive hypotheses provide an incomplete explanation of sex differences in spatial abilities.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Taxonium, a web-based tool for exploring large phylogenetic trees</a></h4>

              
                The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a step change in the scale of sequencing data, with more genomes of SARS-CoV-2 having been sequenced than any other organism on earth. These sequences reveal key insights when represented as a phylogenetic tree, which captures the evolutionary history of the virus, and allows the identification of transmission events and the emergence of new variants. However, existing web-based tools for exploring phylogenies do not scale to the size of datasets now available for SARS-CoV-2. We have developed Taxonium, a new tool that uses WebGL to allow the exploration of trees with tens of millions of nodes in the browser for the first time. Taxonium links each node to associated metadata and supports mutation-annotated trees, which are able to capture all known genetic variation in a dataset. It can either be run entirely locally in the browser, from a serverbased backend, or as a desktop application. We describe insights that analysing a tree of five million sequences can provide into SARS-CoV-2 evolution, and provide a tool at cov2tree.org for exploring a public tree of more than five million SARS-CoV-2 sequences. Taxonium can be applied to any tree, and is available at taxonium.org, with source code at github.com/theosanderson/taxonium.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A novel cis-regulatory element drives early expression of Nkx3.2 in the gnathostome primary jaw joint</a></h4>

              
                The acquisition of movable jaws was a major event during vertebrate evolution. The role of NK3 homeobox 2 (Nkx3.2) transcription factor in patterning the primary jaw joint of gnathostomes (jawed vertebrates) is well known, however knowledge about its regulatory mechanism is lacking. In this study, we report a proximal enhancer element of <i>Nkx3.2</i> that is deeply conserved in most gnathostomes but undetectable in the jawless hagfish and lamprey. This enhancer is active in the developing jaw joint region of the zebrafish <i>Danio rerio</i>, and was thus designated as <i>jaw joint regulatory sequence 1</i> (JRS1). We further show that JRS1 enhancer sequences from a range of gnathostome species, including a chondrichthyan and mammals, have the same activity in the jaw joint as the native zebrafish enhancer, indicating a high degree of functional conservation despite the divergence of cartilaginous and bony fish lineages or the transition of the primary jaw joint into the middle ear of mammals. Finally, we show that deletion of JRS1 from the zebrafish genome using CRISPR/Cas9 results in a significant reduction of early gene expression of <i>nkx3.2</i> and leads to a transient jaw joint deformation and partial fusion. Emergence of this <i>Nkx3.2</i> enhancer in early gnathostomes may have contributed to the origin and shaping of the articulating surfaces of vertebrate jaws.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Mandrill mothers associate with infants who look like their own offspring using phenotype matching</a></h4>

              
                Behavioral discrimination of kin is a key process structuring social relationships in animals. In this study, we provide evidence for discrimination towards non-kin by third-parties through a mechanism of phenotype matching. In mandrills, we recently demonstrated increased facial resemblance among paternally related juvenile and adult females indicating adaptive opportunities for paternal kin recognition. Here, we hypothesize that mandrill mothers use offspring’s facial resemblance with other infants to guide offspring’s social opportunities towards similar-looking ones. Using deep learning for face recognition in 80 wild mandrill infants, we first show that infants sired by the same father resemble each other the most, independently of their age, sex or maternal origin, extending previous results to the youngest age class. Using long-term behavioral observations on association patterns, and controlling for matrilineal origin, maternal relatedness and infant age and sex, we then show, as predicted, that mothers are spatially closer to infants that resemble their own offspring more, and that this maternal behavior leads to similar-looking infants being spatially associated. We then discuss the different scenarios explaining this result, arguing that an adaptive maternal behavior is a likely explanation. In support of this mechanism and using theoretical modeling, we finally describe a plausible evolutionary process whereby mothers gain fitness benefits by promoting nepotism among paternally related infants. This mechanism, that we call ‘second-order kin selection’, may extend beyond mother-infant interactions and has the potential to explain cooperative behaviors among non-kin in other social species, including humans.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Cellular mechanisms underlying central sensitization in a mouse model of chronic muscle pain</a></h4>

              
                Chronic pain disorders are often associated with negative emotions, including anxiety and depression. The central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) has emerged as an integrative hub for nociceptive and affective components during central pain development. Prior adverse injuries are precipitating factors thought to transform nociceptors into a primed state for chronic pain. However, the cellular basis underlying the primed state and the subsequent development of chronic pain remains unknown. Here, we investigated the cellular and synaptic alterations of the CeA in a mouse model of chronic muscle pain. In these mice, local infusion of pregabalin, a clinically approved drug for fibromyalgia and other chronic pain disorders, into the CeA or chemogenetic inactivation of the somatostatin-expressing CeA (CeA-SST) neurons during the priming phase prevented the chronification of pain. Further, electrophysiological recording revealed that the CeA-SST neurons had increased excitatory synaptic drive and enhanced neuronal excitability in the chronic pain states. Finally, either chemogenetic inactivation of the CeA-SST neurons or pharmacological suppression of the nociceptive afferents from the brainstem to the CeA-SST neurons alleviated chronic pain and anxio-depressive symptoms. These data raise the possibility of targeting treatments to CeA-SST neurons to prevent central pain sensitization.

	<p>The premutation expansion of the Fragile X Messenger Ribonucleoprotein 1 (FMR1) gene on the X chromosome has been linked to a range of clinical and subclinical features. Nearly half of men with FMR1 premutation develop a neurodegenerative disorder; Fragile X-Associated Tremor/Ataxia Syndrome (FXTAS). In this syndrome, cognitive executive decline and psychiatric changes may co-occur with major motor features, and in this study, we explored the interrelationships between these three domains in a sample of adult males affected with FXTAS. A sample of 23 adult males aged between 48 and 80 years (mean = 62.3; SD = 8.8), carrying premutation expansions between 45 and 118 CGG repeats, and affected with FXTAS, were included in this study. We employed a battery of cognitive assessments, two standard motor rating scales, and two self-reported measures of psychiatric symptoms. When controlling for age and/or educational level, where appropriate, there were highly significant correlations between motor rating score for ICARS gait domain, and the scores representing global cognitive decline (ACE-III), processing speed (SDMT), immediate memory (Digit Span), and depression and anxiety scores derived from both SCL90 and DASS instruments. Remarkably, close relationships of UPDRS scores, representing the contribution of Parkinsonism to FXTAS phenotypes, were exclusive to psychiatric scores. Highly significant relationships between CGG repeat size and most scores for three phenotypic domains suggest a close tracking with genetic liability. These findings of relationships between a constellation of phenotypic domains in male PM carriers with FXTAS are reminiscent of other conditions associated with disruption to cerebro-cerebellar circuits.</p>

	<p>Repetitive peripheral magnetic stimulation is a novel non-invasive technique for applying repetitive magnetic stimulation to the peripheral nerves and muscles. Contrarily, a person imagines that he/she is exercising during motor imagery. Resting-state electroencephalography can evaluate the ability of motor imagery; however, the effects of motor imagery and repetitive peripheral magnetic stimulation on resting-state electroencephalography are unknown. We examined the effects of motor imagery and repetitive peripheral magnetic stimulation on the vividness of motor imagery and resting-state electroencephalography. The participants were divided into a motor imagery group and motor imagery and repetitive peripheral magnetic stimulation group. They performed 60 motor imagery tasks involving wrist dorsiflexion movement. In the motor imagery and repetitive peripheral magnetic stimulation group, we applied repetitive peripheral magnetic stimulation to the extensor carpi radialis longus muscle during motor imagery. We measured the vividness of motor imagery and resting-state electroencephalography before and after the task. Both groups displayed a significant increase in the vividness of motor imagery. The motor imagery and repetitive peripheral magnetic stimulation group exhibited increased &amp;amp;beta; activity in the anterior cingulate cortex by source localization for electroencephalography. Hence, combined motor imagery and repetitive peripheral magnetic stimulation changes the resting-state electroencephalography activity and may promote motor imagery.</p>

	<p>Cue reactivity (CR) among smokers exposed to smoking-related stimuli, both proximal (e.g., cigarettes, lighter) and distal (environments, people), has been well-demonstrated. Furthermore, past work has shown that combining proximal smoking cues with smoking environment cues increases cue-provoked craving and smoking behavior above that elicited by either cue type alone. In this pilot study, we examined the impact of combining three personal cues, proximal + environment + people, on subjective and behavioral cue reactivity among smokers. To further understand the impact of this method, we also tested reactivity under the conditions of both smoking satiety and deprivation. In addition, we examined the extent to which cue-induced craving predicted immediate subsequent smoking. Fifteen smokers completed six sessions, of which two focused on the intake and development of personal cues and four involved personal cue reactivity sessions: (1) deprived, smoking cue combination, (2) deprived, nonsmoking cue combination, (3) sated, smoking combination, and (4) sated, nonsmoking cue combination. Cue-provoked craving was greater and smokers were quicker to light a cigarette and smoked more during their exposure to smoking rather than nonsmoking cues and in deprived compared to sated conditions, with no interaction between these variables. While deprived, greater cue-provoked craving in response to smoking cues was correlated with a quicker latency to light a cigarette. This work supports the feasibility of presenting three personal smoking-related combinations of cues within a cue reactivity paradigm and highlights the robust reactivity that this methodology can evoke in smokers.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">A Prospective Study of the Impact of Severe Childhood Deprivation on Brain White Matter in Adult Adoptees: Widespread Localized Reductions in Volume But Unaffected Microstructural Organization</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Early childhood neglect can impact brain development across the lifespan. Using voxel-based approaches we recently reported that severe and time-limited institutional deprivation in early childhood was linked to substantial reductions in total brain volume in adulthood, &gt;20 years later. Here, we extend this analysis to explore deprivation-related regional white matter volume and microstructural organization using diffusion-based techniques. A combination of tensor-based morphometry (TBM) analysis and tractography was conducted on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) data from 59 young adults who spent between 3 and 41 months in the severely depriving Romanian institutions of the 1980s before being adopted into United Kingdom families, and 20 nondeprived age-matched United Kingdom controls. Independent of total volume, institutional deprivation was associated with smaller volumes in localized regions across a range of white matter tracts including (1) long-ranging association fibers such as bilateral inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF), bilateral inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (IFOF), left superior longitudinal fasciculi (SLFs), and left arcuate fasciculus; (2) tracts of the limbic circuitry including fornix and cingulum; and (3) projection fibers with the corticospinal tract particularly affected. Tractographic analysis found no evidence of altered microstructural organization of any tract in terms of hindrance modulated orientational anisotropy (HMOA), fractional anisotropy (FA), or mean diffusivity (MD). We provide further evidence for the effects of early neglect on brain development and their persistence in adulthood despite many years of environmental enrichment associated with successful adoption. Localized white matter effects appear limited to volumetric changes with microstructural organization unaffected.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Structural and Functional MRI Data Differentially Predict Chronological Age and Behavioral Memory Performance</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Human cognitive abilities decline with increasing chronological age, with decreased explicit memory performance being most strongly affected. However, some older adults show "successful aging," that is, relatively preserved cognitive ability in old age. One explanation for this could be higher brain-structural integrity in these individuals. Alternatively, the brain might recruit existing resources more efficiently or employ compensatory cognitive strategies. Here, we approached this question by testing multiple candidate variables from structural and functional neuroimaging for their ability to predict chronological age and memory performance, respectively. Prediction was performed using support vector machine (SVM) classification and regression across and within two samples of young (<I>N</I> = 106) and older (<I>N</I> = 153) adults. The candidate variables were (1) behavioral response frequencies in an episodic memory test; (2) recently described functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scores reflecting preservation of functional memory networks; (3) whole-brain fMRI contrasts for novelty processing and subsequent memory; (4) resting-state fMRI maps quantifying voxel-wise signal fluctuation; and (5) gray matter volume estimated from structural MRIs. While age group could be reliably decoded from all variables, chronological age within young and older subjects was best predicted from gray matter volume. In contrast, memory performance was best predicted from task-based fMRI contrasts and particularly single-value fMRI scores, whereas gray matter volume has no predictive power with respect to memory performance in healthy adults. Our results suggest that superior memory performance in healthy older adults is better explained by efficient recruitment of memory networks rather than by preserved brain structure.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">P2X7 Receptor and Purinergic Signaling: Orchestrating Mitochondrial Dysfunction in Neurodegenerative Diseases</a></h4>

              
                <p>Mitochondrial dysfunction is one of the basic hallmarks of cellular pathology in neurodegenerative diseases. Since the metabolic activity of neurons is highly dependent on energy supply, nerve cells are especially vulnerable to impaired mitochondrial function. Besides providing oxidative phosphorylation, mitochondria are also involved in controlling levels of second messengers such as Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions and reactive oxygen species (ROS). Interestingly, the critical role of mitochondria as producers of ROS is closely related to P2XR purinergic receptors, the activity of which is modulated by free radicals. Here, we review the relationships between the purinergic signaling system and affected mitochondrial function. Purinergic signaling regulates numerous vital biological processes in the CNS. The two main purines, ATP and adenosine, act as excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters, respectively. Current evidence suggests that purinergic signaling best explains how neuronal activity is related to neuronal electrical activity and energy homeostasis, especially in the development of Alzheimer&rsquo;s and Parkinson&rsquo;s diseases. In this review, we focus on the mechanisms underlying the involvement of the P2RX7 purinoreceptor in triggering mitochondrial dysfunction during the development of neurodegenerative disorders. We also summarize various avenues by which the purine signaling pathway may trigger metabolic dysfunction contributing to neuronal death and the inflammatory activation of glial cells. Finally, we discuss the potential role of the purinergic system in the search for new therapeutic approaches to treat neurodegenerative diseases.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Columnar Lesions in Barrel Cortex Persistently Degrade Object Location Discrimination Performance</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Primary sensory cortices display functional topography, suggesting that even small cortical volumes may underpin perception of specific stimuli. Traditional loss-of-function approaches have a relatively large radius of effect (&gt;1 mm), and few studies track recovery following loss-of-function perturbations. Consequently, the behavioral necessity of smaller cortical volumes remains unclear. In the mouse primary vibrissal somatosensory cortex (vS1), "barrels" with a radius of ~150 &mu;m receive input predominantly from a single whisker, partitioning vS1 into a topographic map of well defined columns. Here, we train animals implanted with a cranial window over vS1 to perform single-whisker perceptual tasks. We then use high-power laser exposure centered on the barrel representing the spared whisker to produce lesions with a typical volume of one to two barrels. These columnar-scale lesions impair performance in an object location discrimination task for multiple days without disrupting vibrissal kinematics. Animals with degraded location discrimination performance can immediately perform a whisker touch detection task with high accuracy. Animals trained <I>de novo</I> on both simple and complex whisker touch detection tasks showed no permanent behavioral deficits following columnar-scale lesions. Thus, columnar-scale lesions permanently degrade performance in object location discrimination tasks.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The COVID-19 third wave in Myanmar following the military coup [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: COVID-19 seriously hit Myanmar between June and August 2021, a few months after the military coup, though the first and second waves in 2020 were managed effectively by the government. People in Myanmar experienced serious consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic precipitated by the disorganized health system under the military junta. This study aimed to analyse the situation of COVID-19 occurrence and death proportions during its third wave in Myanmar. Methods: An online survey was conducted using a Google form. People with the symptoms of COVID-19 and those who died from COVID-19 between June and August 2021 were eligible to participate. The Google form was extracted into an Excel datasheet and analysed using Stata v16.1. Results: Among the 29,171 participants, 76.7% were over 30 years old and 56.4% were female. A majority of participants were from highly populated regions: Yangon (17,220; 59%) (Business capital), Mandalay (3,740; 12.8%) and Sagaing (1,546; 5.3%). Participants sought health care from telegram/other online services (34%), home care by health care providers (22%), private clinics (13%) and public hospitals run under the military junta (5%). Overall, 15% of participants died, of which, 72% occurred at home and 17% at public hospitals. Significantly higher proportions of deaths were seen among participants over 60 years than other age groups and males (p<0.001). Death proportions at different weeks from June to August 2021 ranged from 12.4% to 17.3%, much higher than the military junta’s reports. Overall, 25% of participants received oxygen therapy. Conclusions: Death proportions in different weeks were consistently over 12%. The majority of participants received tele/online and home treatment services. Most deaths occurred at home. Findings indicated the high COVID-19 case fatality rates with limited access to public hospital care during the third wave. The data suggests that the outcomes were adversely impacted by the military coup.

                Background: Unmarried women who experience unintended pregnancy tend to hide their pregnancy and not perform pregnancy care. The study analyzed the effect of unintended pregnancy on antenatal care (ANC) visits among unmarried women in Indonesia. Methods: The study employed secondary data from the 2017 IDHS. This cross-sectional study involved unmarried women aged 15-49 who gave birth in the last five years. The 2017 IDHS used stratification and multistage random sampling, and the task got 508 as weighted samples. The variables analyzed included ANC, unintended pregnancy, residence, age, marital, education, employment, wealth, and health insurance. The study used the binary logistic regression test at the final stage. Results: The results show that the proportion of unmarried women who have experienced an unintended pregnancy in the last five years in Indonesia is 26.0%. Unmarried women who had an unintended pregnancy were 0.588 times less likely than those who did not have an unintended pregnancy to have ANC visits ≥ four times (AOR 0.588; 95% CI 0.587-0.588). The analysis indicates that unmarried women who have unintended pregnancies in Indonesia are less likely to complete ANC visits. Conclusion: The study concluded that unmarried women who experienced unintended pregnancies in Indonesia were less likely to complete ANC visits.

                Background: Takotsubo syndrome (TS) is characterized by a clinical presentation that mimics acute coronary syndrome but is reversible. Alterations of Takotsubo in patients without previous heart disease remain a challenge for diagnosis. Case report: We present a case of an 80-year-old patient from Peru. The patient underwent surgery, with the diagnosis of Chilaiditi’s syndrome. One day after surgery, she presented with dyspnea, tachycardia, and electrocardiographic changes (paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and infrequent ventricular extrasystoles without abnormalities in the ST-segment). The diagnosis of Takotsubo syndrome with cardiogenic shock was made. She was hospitalized in the Intensive Care Unit and was managed with vasopressors and nitroglycerin. There was no cardiac lesion in the cineangiogram or occlusion of arteries. The patient was extubated and received daily dialysis until discharge. Conclusions: Takotsubo is an emotional, non-cardiac, or post-traumatic stressful event that triggers myocardial injury with segmental anomalous, the possible etiology of which is the release of an endothelial neurotransmitter caused by stress. Emergency physicians should be aware of this as even patients without previous cardiac pathologies when exposed to stressors (such as surgeries) develop emergency symptomatology similar to myocardial infarction. Thus, emergency physicians should identify any cardiac abnormalities after a stressor, as well as be prepared for the diagnosis of TS.

                Introduction: CausalPath compares experimentally measured changes in molecular profiles against curated biological pathways and infers causality between changes in measured features from profiling experiments (e.g., RNA-seq or proteomics from total or phospho-protein levels). Methods: We developed the CausalPath Cytoscape App, an app (i.e., plugin) for visualizing results from the CausalPath method within the Cytoscape Java-based desktop network analysis and visualization platform. Use Cases:  Users are given instruction that represents use cases in multiple cancer research areas through the visualization of CausalPath analysis results generated from data by the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium. Discussion: The CausalPath Cytoscape App visualizes the set of known interactions that are supported by molecular profiling data via the CausalPath method. This integration of CausalPath and Cytoscape benefits users interested in performing secondary analyses (e.g., module detection) on the sub-networks that result from CausalPath analysis by utilizing the many analytical features available in the Cytoscape software ecosystem.

                Background: This study focused on evaluating the diversity and richness of the edaphic macrofauna in eight banana farms in the western zone of Nicaragua. Methods: The sampling design was random and descriptive, it was divided into two phases, the first was the collection of the sample, and the second was the classification, coding, and storage of the extracted macrofauna populations. Subsequently, the indices of diversity and species richness, relative abundance, by functional groups were estimated. Results: The results showed that the relative abundance of biodiversity was higher in the 0–20 cm soil depth stratum than in the branch and leaf biomass strata. The values ​​of the diversity indices of Dominion, Simpson, Shanon, Margalef, and Equity were in the normal range, with a tendency towards low diversity. Likewise, in the richness of species, the Dominant or most abundant genus were earthworms (Oligochaeta) and Hymenoptera (Solenopsis, Leptothorax, Camponotus, Pheidole), indicating the directly proportional relationship, that is to say, that the greater the number of earthworms the production increases and the greater the number of Hymenoptera it decreases, confirmed with the Pearson correlation coefficient with a reliability of 95%. Conclusions: It was concluded that based on the estimates of the diversity indicators, two detritivore genus (earthworms and Hymenoptera) were the ones with the greatest presence, being important in the production of the banana agrosystem due to the decomposition of organic matter and its nutritional contribution to the plant. We observed a direct correlation with earthworms and an indirect relationship with Hymenoptera.

                Background: Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) is one of the leading health challenges worldwide that influences the provision of quality patient care. Stigma and discrimination around this condition and the health care needs affect the health care provision. This study aimed to gain an in-depth understanding of theatre nurses’ experiences in providing perioperative to patients living with HIV at a tertiary hospital in South Africa. Methods: This study was conducted at a tertiary hospital in Tshwane district, South Africa. The study was underpinned by an interpretative phenomenological analysis design. Data were collected from 10 criterion purposively selected theatre nurses using in-depth individual interviews. Data were thematically analyzed and guided by an interpretive phenomenological analysis framework for data analysis. Results: The study revealed that theatre nurses work in an under-resourced environment. The resources highlighted are human, materials, including personal protective equipment and life support. The situation negatively affects the perioperative care of HIV-positive patients, who are always prone to perioperative complications, such as profuse bleeding, and even death. The situation increases the occupational risk to the nurses. Conclusions: The researchers proposed several recommendations targeted at improving the resources needed by theatre nurses when caring for people living with HIV perioperatively at South African tertiary hospitals. Findings will add to the body of knowledge of the Nursing profession about offering perioperative care to persons living with HIV.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The Frontline War: A Case-control study of risk factors for COVID-19 among health care workers [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Purpose: The global pandemic of COVID-19 has infected several people worldwide. World Health Organization(WHO) has reported that an alarming number of health care workers (HCWs) have been affected and have also succumbed to this disease. Though health infrastructure can be boosted in a short period, the number of HCWs cannot. Hence understanding the risk factors that the HCWs are exposed to and strategically protecting them is of paramount importance. Methods: A case-control retrospective study was carried out on 116 HCWs at a tertiary care hospital treating COVID-19 patients in South India. We attempted to investigate and stratify the specific risk factors for COVID-19 transmission among HCWs. Data was collected regarding their exposure to COVID-19 patients, infection control precautions used, possible breaches in the protocol, and details of Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) prophylaxis. Results: The demographics were equally distributed among the cases and controls. Exposure to surgical procedures on suspected/positive COVID patients was also found to affect contracting the COVID-19 illness. HCWs who wore face shields instead of eye goggles along with the use of scrubs and hospital gowns were found to have a lesser incidence of COVID-19 illness. Conclusion: This study helped us understand the varied risk factors that health care workers are exposed to while treating COVID-19 patients. It helped us contextualize and strategize our infection control practices to prevent further morbidity and mortality due to COVID-19.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Dosing time optimization of antihypertensive medications by including the circadian rhythm in pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic models</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Javiera Cortés-Ríos, Ramón C. Hermida, Maria Rodriguez-Fernandez</p>

Blood pressure (BP) follows a circadian variation, increasing during active hours, showing a small postprandial valley and a deeper decrease during sleep. Nighttime reduction of 10–20% relative to daytime BP is defined as a dipper pattern, and a reduction of less than 10%, as a non-dipper pattern. Despite this BP variability, hypertension’s diagnostic criteria and therapeutic objectives are usually based on BP average values. Indeed, studies have shown that chrono-pharmacological optimization significantly reduces long-term cardiovascular risk if a BP dipper pattern is maintained. Changes in the effect of antihypertensive medications can be explained by circadian variations in their pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD). Nevertheless, BP circadian variation has been scarcely included in PK-PD models of antihypertensive medications to date. In this work, we developed PK-PD models that include circadian rhythm to find the optimal dosing time (<i>Ta</i>) of first-line antihypertensive medications for dipper and non-dipper patterns. The parameters of the PK-PD models were estimated using global optimization, and models were selected according to the lowest corrected Akaike information criterion value. Simultaneously, sensitivity and identifiability analysis were performed to determine the relevance of the parameters and establish those that can be estimated. Subsequently, <i>Ta</i> parameters were optimized to maximize the effect on BP average, BP peaks, and sleep-time dip. As a result, all selected models included at least one circadian PK component, and circadian parameters had the highest sensitivity. Furthermore, <i>Ta</i> with which BP>130/80 mmHg and a dip of 10–20% are achieved were proposed when possible. We show that the optimal <i>Ta</i> depends on the therapeutic objective, the medication, and the BP profile. Therefore, our results suggest making chrono-pharmacological recommendations in a personalized way.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Statistical perspective on functional and causal neural connectomics: The Time-Aware PC algorithm</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Rahul Biswas, Eli Shlizerman</p>

The representation of the flow of information between neurons in the brain based on their activity is termed the <i>causal functional connectome</i>. Such representation incorporates the dynamic nature of neuronal activity and causal interactions between them. In contrast to connectome, the causal functional connectome is not directly observed and needs to be inferred from neural time series. A popular statistical framework for inferring causal connectivity from observations is the <i>directed probabilistic graphical modeling</i>. Its common formulation is not suitable for neural time series since it was developed for variables with independent and identically distributed static samples. In this work, we propose to model and estimate the causal functional connectivity from neural time series using a novel approach that adapts directed probabilistic graphical modeling to the time series scenario. In particular, we develop the <i>Time-Aware PC</i> (TPC) algorithm for estimating the causal functional connectivity, which adapts the PC algorithm—a state-of-the-art method for statistical causal inference. We show that the model outcome of TPC has the properties of reflecting causality of neural interactions such as being non-parametric, exhibits the <i>directed Markov</i> property in a time-series setting, and is predictive of the consequence of counterfactual interventions on the time series. We demonstrate the utility of the methodology to obtain the causal functional connectome for several datasets including simulations, benchmark datasets, and recent multi-array electro-physiological recordings from the mouse visual cortex.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">SyBLaRS: A web service for laying out, rendering and mining biological maps in SBGN, SBML and more</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Hasan Balci, Ugur Dogrusoz, Yusuf Ziya Ozgul, Perman Atayev</p>

Visualization is a key recurring requirement for effective analysis of relational data. Biology is no exception. It is imperative to annotate and render biological models in standard, widely accepted formats. Finding graph-theoretical properties of pathways as well as identifying certain paths or subgraphs of interest in a pathway are also essential for effective analysis of pathway data. Given the size of available biological pathway data nowadays, automatic layout is crucial in understanding the graphical representations of such data. Even though there are many available software tools that support graphical display of biological pathways in various formats, there is none available as a service for on-demand or batch processing of biological pathways for automatic layout, customized rendering and mining paths or subgraphs of interest. In addition, there are many tools with fine rendering capabilities lacking decent automatic layout support.
To fill this void, we developed a web service named SyBLaRS (Systems Biology Layout and Rendering Service) for automatic layout of biological data in various standard formats as well as construction of customized images in both raster image and scalable vector formats of these maps. Some of the supported standards are more generic such as GraphML and JSON, whereas others are specialized to biology such as SBGNML (The Systems Biology Graphical Notation Markup Language) and SBML (The Systems Biology Markup Language). In addition, SyBLaRS supports calculation and highlighting of a number of well-known graph-theoretical properties as well as some novel graph algorithms turning a specified set of objects of interest to a minimal pathway of interest.
We demonstrate that SyBLaRS can be used both as an offline layout and rendering service to construct customized and annotated pictures of pathway models and as an online service to provide layout and rendering capabilities for systems biology software tools.
SyBLaRS is open source and publicly available on GitHub and freely distributed under the MIT license. In addition, a sample deployment is available here for public consumption.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Adaptive multi-objective control explains how humans make lateral maneuvers while walking</a></h4>

              
                <p>by David M. Desmet, Joseph P. Cusumano, Jonathan B. Dingwell</p>

To successfully traverse their environment, humans often perform maneuvers to achieve desired task goals while simultaneously maintaining balance. Humans accomplish these tasks primarily by modulating their foot placements. As humans are more unstable laterally, we must better understand how humans modulate lateral foot placement. We previously developed a theoretical framework and corresponding computational models to describe how humans regulate lateral stepping during straight-ahead continuous walking. We identified goal functions for step width and lateral body position that define the walking task and determine the set of all possible task solutions as Goal Equivalent Manifolds (GEMs). Here, we used this framework to determine if humans can regulate lateral stepping during <i>non</i>-steady-state lateral maneuvers by minimizing errors consistent with these goal functions. Twenty young healthy adults each performed four lateral lane-change maneuvers in a virtual reality environment. Extending our general lateral stepping regulation framework, we first re-examined the requirements of such transient walking tasks. Doing so yielded new theoretical predictions regarding how steps during any such maneuver should be regulated to minimize error costs, consistent with the goals required at each step and with how these costs are adapted at each step during the maneuver. Humans performed the experimental lateral maneuvers in a manner consistent with our theoretical predictions. Furthermore, their stepping behavior was well modeled by allowing the parameters of our previous lateral stepping models to adapt from step to step. To our knowledge, our results are the first to demonstrate humans might use evolving cost landscapes in real time to perform such an adaptive motor task and, furthermore, that such adaptation can occur quickly–over only one step. Thus, the predictive capabilities of our general stepping regulation framework extend to a much greater range of walking tasks beyond just normal, straight-ahead walking.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Low power, less occupying area, and improved speed of a 4-bit router/rerouter circuit for low-density parity-check (LDPC) decoders [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes are more error-resistant than other forward error-correcting codes. Existing circuits give high power dissipation, less speed, and more occupying area. This work aimed to propose a better design and performance circuit, even in the presence of noise in the channel. Methods: In this research, the design of the multiplexer and demultiplexer were achieved using pass transistor logic. The target parameters were low power dissipation, improved throughput, and more negligible delay with a minimum area. One of the essential connecting circuits in a decoShder architecture is a multiplexer (MUX) and a demultiplexer (DEMUX) circuit. The design of the MUX and DEMUX contributes significantly to the performance of the decoder. The aim of this paper was the design of a 4 × 1 MUX to route the data bits received from the bit update blocks to the parallel adder circuits and a 1 × 4 DEMUX to receive the input bits from the parallel adder and distribute the output to the bit update blocks in a layered architecture LDPC decoder. The design uses pass transistor logic and achieves the reduction of the number of transistors used. The proposed circuit was designed using the Mentor Graphics CAD tool for 180 nm technology. Results: The parameters of power dissipation, area, and delay were considered crucial parameters for a low power decoder. The circuits were simulated using computer-aided design (CAD) tools, and the results depicted a significantly low power dissipation of 7.06 nW and 5.16 nW for the multiplexer and demultiplexer, respectively. The delay was found to be 100.5 ns (MUX) and 80 ns (DEMUX). Conclusion: This decoder’s potential use may be in low-power communication circuits such as handheld devices and Internet of Things (IoT) circuits.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">A subpopulation of spikes predicts successful epilepsy surgery outcome</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Epileptic spikes are the traditional interictal electroencephalographic (EEG) biomarker for epilepsy. Given their low specificity for identifying the epileptogenic zone (EZ), they are attributed only moderate attention in presurgical evaluation. This study aims to demonstrate that it is possible to identify specific spike features in intracranial EEG that optimally define the EZ and predict surgical outcome.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We analyzed spike features on stereo-EEG segments from 83 operated patients from two epilepsy centers (37 Engel IA) in wakefulness, non-rapid eye movement sleep, and rapid eye movement sleep. After automated spike detection, we investigated 135 spike features based on rate, morphology, propagation, and energy to determine the best feature or feature combination to discriminate the EZ in seizure-free and non-seizure-free patients by applying 4-fold cross-validation.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The rate of spikes with preceding gamma activity in wakefulness performed better for surgical outcome classification (4-fold area under receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC): 0.755±0.07) than the seizure-onset zone, the current gold standard (AUC:0.563±0.05, <i>p</i>=0.015) and the ripple rate, an emerging seizure-independent biomarker (AUC:0.537±0.07, <i>p</i>=0.006). Channels with a spike-gamma rate exceeding 1.9/minute had an 80% probability of being in the EZ. Combining features did not improve the results.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Resection of brain regions with high spike-gamma rates in wakefulness is associated with a high probability of achieving seizure freedom. This rate could be applied to determine the minimal number of spiking channels requiring resection. In addition to quantitative analysis, this feature is easily accessible to visual analysis, which could aid clinicians during presurgical evaluation.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Atrial Fibrillation Risk Assessment after Embolic Stroke of Undetermined Source</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Around 20% of strokes are embolic strokes of undetermined source (ESUS). Undetected atrial fibrillation (AF) remains an important cause. Yet, oral anticoagulation in unselected ESUS patients failed in secondary stroke prevention. Guidance on effective AF-detection is lacking. Here, we introduce a novel, non-invasive AF-risk assessment after ESUS.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Catch-Up ESUS is an investigator-initiated, observational cohort study conducted between 2018-2019 at the Munich University Hospital. Besides clinical characteristics, patients received ≥72h digital electrocardiogram recordings to generate the rhythm irregularity burden. Uni- and multivariable regression models predicted the primary endpoint of incident AF, ascertained by standardized follow-up including implantable cardiac monitors. Predictors included the novel rhythm irregularity burden constructed from digital electrocardiogram recordings. We independently validated our model in ESUS patients from the University Hospital Tübingen, Germany.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>297 ESUS patients were followed for 15.6±7.6 months. Incident AF (46 patients, 15.4%) occurred after a median of 105 [25<sup>th</sup>; 75<sup>th</sup> percentile 31;338] days. Secondary outcomes were recurrent stroke in 7.7% and death in 6.1%. Multivariable-adjusted analyses identified the rhythm irregularity burden as the strongest AF-predictor (hazard ratio 3.12; 95% confidence interval 1.62-5.80; p&lt;0001) while accounting for the known risk factors age, CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc-Score, and NT-proBNP. Independent validation confirmed the rhythm irregularity burden as the most significant AF-predictor (hazard ratio 2.20; 95% confidence interval 1.45-3.33; p&lt;0001).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The novel, non-invasive, ECG-based rhythm irregularity burden may help adjudicating AF-risk after ESUS and subsequently guide AF-detection after ESUS. Clinical trials need to clarify if high AF-risk patients benefit from tailored secondary stroke prevention.</p>

                <p>Cerebral cortical encephalitis (CCE) is a recently described myelin-oligodendrocyte-glycoprotein-antibody-associated-disease (MOGAD) phenotype. In this observational retrospective study, we characterized 19 CCE patients (6.7% of our MOGAD cohort). Headache (n=15[79%]), seizures (n=13[68%]) and encephalopathy (n=12[63%]) were frequent. MRI revealed unilateral (n=12[63%]) or bilateral (n=7[37%]) cortical T2-hyperintensity and leptomeningeal-enhancement (n=17[89%]). NMDA-receptor autoantibodies coexisted in 2 of 15 tested (13%). CCE pathology (n=2) showed extensive subpial cortical demyelination (n=2), microglial reactivity (n=2) and inflammatory infiltrates (perivascular, 1; meningeal, 1). Most received high-dose steroids (n=17[90%]) and all improved but 3 had CCE relapses. This study highlights the CCE spectrum and provides insight into its pathogenesis.</p>

                Schizophrenia and bipolar disorder share genetic risks as well as clinical manifestations. Nevertheless, it remains unknown whether, and how, common neurobiological pathways translate their shared polygenic risks into shared clinical manifestations. We present the miR-124-AMPAR pathway as a key neurobiological pathway that connects their shared polygenic risks with behavioral changes.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The Nse5/6-like SIMC1-SLF2 complex localizes SMC5/6 to viral replication centers</a></h4>

              
                The human SMC5/6 complex is a conserved guardian of genome stability and an emerging component of antiviral responses. These disparate functions likely require distinct mechanisms of SMC5/6 regulation. In yeast, Smc5/6 is regulated by its Nse5/6 subunits, but such regulatory subunits for human SMC5/6 are poorly defined. Here, we identify a novel SMC5/6 subunit called SIMC1 that contains SUMO interacting motifs (SIMs) and an Nse5-like domain. We isolated SIMC1 from the proteomic environment of SMC5/6 within polyomavirus large T antigen (LT)-induced subnuclear compartments. SIMC1 uses its SIMs and Nse5-like domain to localize SMC5/6 to polyomavirus replication centers (PyVRCs) at SUMO-rich PML nuclear bodies. SIMC1's Nse5-like domain binds to the putative Nse6 orthologue SLF2 to form an anti-parallel helical dimer resembling the yeast Nse5/6 structure. SIMC1-SLF2 structure-based mutagenesis defines a conserved surface region containing the N-terminus of SIMC1's helical domain that regulates SMC5/6 localization to PyVRCs. Furthermore, SLF1, which recruits SMC5/6 to DNA lesions via its BRCT and ARD motifs, binds SLF2 analogously to SIMC1 and forms a separate Nse5/6-like complex. Thus, two Nse5/6-like complexes with distinct recruitment domains control human SMC5/6 localization.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Fast rule switching and slow rule updating in a perceptual categorization task</a></h4>

              
                To adapt to a changing world, we must be able to switch between rules already learned and, at other times, learn rules anew. Often we must do both at the same time, switching between known rules while also constantly re-estimating them. Here, we show these two processes, rule switching and rule learning, rely on distinct but intertwined computations, namely fast inference and slower incremental learning. To this end, we studied how monkeys switched between three rules. Each rule was compositional, requiring the animal to discriminate one of two features of a stimulus and then respond with an associated eye movement along one of two different response axes. By modeling behavior we found the animals learned the axis of response using fast inference (<i>rule switching</i>) while continuously re-estimating the stimulus-response associations within an axis (<i>rule learning</i>). Our results shed light on the computational interactions between rule switching and rule learning, and make testable neural predictions for these interactions.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Acetylation of a fungal effector that translocates host PR1 facilitates virulence</a></h4>

              
                Pathogens utilize a panoply of effectors to manipulate plant defense. However, despite their importance, relatively little is actually known about regulation of these virulence factors. Here, we show that the effector FolSvp1, secreted from fungal pathogen <i>Fusarium oxysporum</i> f. sp. <i>lycopersici</i> (<i>Fol</i>) directly binds and translocates the tomato pathogenesis-related protein1, SlPR1, from the apoplast outside the plasma membrane to the host nucleus via its nuclear localization signal. Relocation of SlPR1 abolishes generation of the defense signaling peptide, CAPE1, from its C-terminus, and as a consequence, facilitates pathogen invasion of plants. The action of FolSvp1 requires covalent modification by acetylation for full virulence in host tomato tissues. The modification is catalyzed by the <i>Fol</i> FolArd1 lysine acetyltransferase prior to secretion. Addition of an acetyl group to one residue, K167, prevents ubiquitination-dependent degradation of FolSvp1 in both <i>Fol</i> and plant cells with different mechanisms, allowing it to function normally in fungal invasion. Either inactivation of FolSvp1 or removal of the acetyl group on K167 leads to impaired pathogenicity of <i>Fol</i>. These findings indicate that acetylation can regulate the stability of effectors of fungal plant pathogens with impact on virulence.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Molecular basis of the PIP2-dependent regulation of CaV2.2 channel and its modulation by CaV β subunits</a></h4>

              
                High-voltage-activated Ca<sup>2+</sup> (Ca<sub>V</sub>) channels that adjust Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx upon membrane depolarization are differentially regulated by phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP<sub>2</sub>) in an auxiliary Ca<sub>V</sub> β subunit-dependent manner. However, the molecular mechanism by which the β subunits control the PIP<sub>2</sub> sensitivity of Ca<sub>V</sub> channels remains unclear. By engineering various α1B and β constructs in tsA-201 cells, we reported that at least two PIP<sub>2</sub>-binding sites, including the polybasic residues at the C-terminal end of I–II loop and the binding pocket in S4<sub>II</sub> domain, exist in the Ca<sub>V</sub>2.2 channels. Moreover, they were distinctly engaged in the regulation of channel gating depending on the coupled Ca<sub>V</sub> β2 subunits. The membrane-anchored β subunit abolished the PIP<sub>2</sub> interaction of the phospholipid-binding site in the I–II loop, leading to lower PIP<sub>2</sub> sensitivity of Ca<sub>V</sub>2.2 channels. By contrast, PIP<sub>2</sub> interacted with the basic residues in the S4<sub>II</sub> domain of Ca<sub>V</sub>2.2 channels regardless of β2 isotype. Our data demonstrated that the anchoring properties of Ca<sub>V</sub> β2 subunits to the plasma membrane determine the biophysical states of Ca<sub>V</sub>2.2 channels by regulating PIP<sub>2</sub> coupling to the nonspecific phospholipid-binding site in the I–II loop.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Self-configuring feedback loops for sensorimotor control</a></h4>

              
                How dynamic interactions between nervous system regions in mammals performs online motor control remains an unsolved problem. In this paper we show that feedback control is a simple, yet powerful way to understand the neural dynamics of sensorimotor control. We make our case using a minimal model comprising spinal cord, sensory and motor cortex, coupled by long connections that are plastic. It succeeds in learning how to perform reaching movements of a planar arm with 6 muscles in several directions from scratch. The model satisfies biological plausibility constraints, like neural implementation, transmission delays, local synaptic learning and continuous online learning. Using differential Hebbian plasticity the model can go from motor babbling to reaching arbitrary targets in less than 10 minutes of in silico time. Moreover, independently of the learning mechanism, properly configured feedback control has many emergent properties: neural populations in motor cortex show directional tuning and oscillatory dynamics, the spinal cord creates convergent force fields that add linearly, and movements are ataxic (as in a motor system without a cerebellum).

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Structural and functional insights of the human peroxisomal ABC transporter ALDP</a></h4>

              
                Adrenoleukodystrophy protein (ALDP) is responsible for the transport of very-long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) and corresponding CoA-esters across the peroxisomal membrane. Dysfunction of ALDP leads to peroxisomal metabolic disorder exemplified by X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD). Hundreds of ALD-causing mutations have been identified on ALDP. However, the pathogenic mechanisms of these mutations are restricted to clinical description due to limited structural and biochemical characterization. Here we report the cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of human ALDP with nominal resolution at 3.4 Å. ALDP exhibits a cytosolic-facing conformation. Compared to other lipid ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, ALDP has two substrate binding cavities formed by the transmembrane domains (TMD). Such structural organization may be suitable for the coordination of VLCFAs. Based on the structure, we performed integrative analysis of the cellular trafficking, protein thermostability, ATP hydrolysis and the transport activity of representative mutations. These results provide a framework for understanding the working mechanism of ALDP and pathogenic roles of disease-associated mutations.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Structure of the GOLD-domain seven-transmembrane helix protein family member TMEM87A</a></h4>

              
                TMEM87s are eukaryotic transmembrane proteins with two members (TMEM87A and TMEM87B) in humans. TMEM87s have proposed roles in protein transport to and from the Golgi, as mechanosensitive ion channels, and in developmental signaling. TMEM87 disruption has been implicated in cancers and developmental disorders. To better understand TMEM87 structure and function, we determined a cryo-EM structure of human TMEM87A in lipid nanodiscs. TMEM87A consists of a Golgi-dynamics (GOLD) domain atop a membrane spanning seven-transmembrane helix domain with a large cavity open to solution and the membrane outer leaflet. Structural and functional analyses suggest TMEM87A may not function as an ion channel or G-protein coupled receptor. We find TMEM87A shares its characteristic domain arrangement with seven other proteins in humans; three that had been identified as evolutionary related (TMEM87B, GPR107, and GPR108) and four previously unrecognized homologs (GPR180, TMEM145, TMEM181, and WLS)). Among these structurally related GOLD domain seven-transmembrane helix (GOST) proteins, WLS is best characterized as a membrane trafficking and secretion chaperone for lipidated Wnt signaling proteins. We find key structural determinants for WLS function are conserved in TMEM87A. We propose TMEM87A and structurally homologous GOST proteins could serve a common role in trafficking membrane-associated cargo.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Sublytic gasdermin-D pores captured in atomistic molecular simulations</a></h4>

              
                Gasdermin-D (GSDMD) is the ultimate effector of pyroptosis, a form of programmed cell death associated with pathogen invasion and inflammation. After proteolytic cleavage by caspases, the GSDMD N-terminal domain (GSDMD<sup>NT</sup>) assembles on the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane and induces the formation of membrane pores. We use atomistic molecular dynamics simulations to study GSDMD<sup>NT</sup> monomers, oligomers, and rings in an asymmetric plasma membrane mimetic. We identify distinct interaction motifs of GSDMD<sup>NT</sup> with phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>) and phosphatidylserine (PS) headgroups and describe their conformational dependence. Oligomers are stabilized by shared lipid binding sites between neighboring monomers acting akin to double-sided tape. We show that already small GSDMD<sup>NT</sup> oligomers support stable, water-filled and ion-conducting membrane pores bounded by curled beta-sheets. In large-scale simulations, we resolve the process of pore formation from GSDMD<sup>NT</sup> arcs and lipid efflux from partial rings. We find that high-order GSDMD<sup>NT</sup> oligomers can crack under the line tension of 86 pN created by an open membrane edge to form the slit pores or closed GSDMD<sup>NT</sup> rings seen in experiment. Our simulations provide a detailed view of key steps in GSDMD<sup>NT</sup>-induced plasma membrane pore formation, including sublytic pores that explain nonselective ion flux during early pyroptosis.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Brown adipocytes local response to thyroid hormone is required for adaptive thermogenesis in adult male mice</a></h4>

              
                Thyroid hormone (T3) and its nuclear receptors (TR) are important regulators of energy expenditure and adaptive thermogenesis, notably through their action in the brown adipose tissue (BAT). However, T3 acts in many other peripheral and central tissues which are also involved in energy expenditure. The general picture of how T3 regulates BAT thermogenesis is currently not fully established, notably due to the absence of extensive omics analyses and the lack of specific mice model. Here, we first used transcriptome and cistrome analyses to establish the list of T3/TR direct target genes in brown adipocytes. We then developed a novel model of transgenic mice, in which T3 signaling is specifically suppressed in brown adipocytes at adult stage. We addressed the capacity of these mice to mount a thermogenic response when challenged by either a cold exposure or a high-fat diet, and analyzed the associated changes in BAT transcriptome. We conclude that T3 plays a crucial role in the thermogenic response of the BAT, controlling the expression of genes involved in lipid and glucose metabolism and regulating BAT proliferation. The resulting picture provides an unprecedented view on the pathways by which T3 activates energy expenditure through an efficient adaptive thermogenesis in the BAT.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">High-throughput imaging and quantitative analysis uncovers the nature of plasmid positioning by ParABS</a></h4>

              
                The faithful segregation and inheritance of bacterial chromosomes and low-copy number plasmids requires dedicated partitioning systems. The most common of these, ParABS, consists of ParA, a DNA-binding ATPase and ParB, a protein that binds to centromeric-like <i>parS</i> sequences on the DNA cargo. The resulting nucleoprotein complexes are believed to move up a self-generated gradient of nucleoid-associated ParA. However, it remains unclear how this leads to the observed cargo positioning and dynamics. In particular, the evaluation of models of plasmid positioning has been hindered by the lack of quantitative measurements of plasmid dynamics. Here, we use high-throughput imaging, analysis and modelling to determine the dynamical nature of these systems. We find that F plasmid is actively brought to specific subcellular home positions within the cell with dynamics akin to an over-damped spring. We develop a unified stochastic model that quantitatively explains this behaviour and predicts that cells with the lowest plasmid concentration transition to oscillatory dynamics. We confirm this prediction for F plasmid as well as a distantly-related ParABS system. Our results indicate that ParABS regularly positions plasmids across the nucleoid but operates just below the threshold of an oscillatory instability, which according to our model, minimises ATP consumption. Our work also clarifies how various plasmid dynamics are achievable in a single unified stochastic model. Overall, this work uncovers the dynamical nature of plasmid positioning by ParABS and provides insights relevant for chromosome-based systems.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Regulatory imbalance between LRRK2 kinase, PPM1H phosphatase, and ARF6 GTPase disrupts the axonal transport of autophagosomes</a></h4>

              
                Gain-of-function mutations in the LRRK2 gene cause Parkinson's disease (PD), increasing phosphorylation of RAB GTPases through hyperactive kinase activity. We found that LRRK2-hyperphosphorylated RABs disrupt the axonal transport of autophagosomes by perturbing the coordinated regulation of cytoplasmic dynein and kinesin motors. In iPSC-derived human neurons, knock-in of the strongly-hyperactive LRRK2-p.R1441H mutation caused striking impairments in autophagosome transport, inducing frequent directional reversals and pauses. Knock-out of the opposing Protein Phosphatase 1H (PPM1H) phenocopied the effect of hyperactive LRRK2. Overexpression of ADP-ribosylation factor 6 (ARF6), a GTPase that acts as a switch for selective activation of dynein or kinesin, attenuated transport defects in both p.R1441H knock-in and PPM1H knock-out neurons. Together, these findings support a model where a regulatory imbalance between LRRK2-hyperphosphorylated RABs and ARF6 induces an unproductive "tug-of-war" between dynein and kinesin, disrupting processive autophagosome transport. This disruption may contribute to PD pathogenesis by impairing the essential homeostatic functions of axonal autophagy.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Epigenetic age acceleration predicts subject-specific white matter degeneration in the human brain.</a></h4>

              
                Epigenetic clocks provide powerful tools for estimating health and lifespan but their ability to predict brain degeneration and neuronal damage during the aging process is unknown. In this study, we use GrimAge, an epigenetic clock correlated to several blood plasma proteins, to longitudinally investigate brain cellular microstructure in axonal white matter from a cohort of healthy aging individuals. Given the blood plasma correlations used to develop GrimAge, a specific focus was made on white matter hyperintensities, a visible neurological manifestation of small vessel disease, and the axonal pathways throughout each individual's brain affected by their unique white matter hyperintensity location and volume. 98 subjects over 55 years of age were scanned at baseline with 41 returning for a follow-up scan 2 years later. Using diffusion MRI lesionometry, we reconstructed subject-specific networks of affected axonal tracts and examined the diffusion cellular microstructure composition of these areas, both at baseline and longitudinally, for evidence of cellular degeneration. A chronological age adjusted version of GrimAge was significantly correlated with baseline WMH volume and markers of neuronal decline, indicated by increased extracellular free water, increased intracellular signal, and decreased axonal signal within WMH. By isolating subject-specific axonal regions 'lesioned' by crossing through a WMH, age-adjusted GrimAge was also able to predict longitudinal development of similar patterns of neuronal decline throughout the brain. This study is the first to establish a relationship between accelerated epigenetic GrimAge and brain cellular microstructure in humans.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Rate of neuronal turnover in the healthy adult murine myenteric ganglia varies with ganglia size</a></h4>

              
                Major gastrointestinal and systemic functions are regulated by the Enteric Nervous System (ENS), whose cells are organized in interconnected clusters or ganglia to form plexuses in the gut wall. Previously, we showed that neuronal turnover, driven by overall equal rates of neurogenesis and neuronal loss, is an important homeostatic mechanism that maintains the larger myenteric plexus of the healthy adult ENS. While this process maintains neuronal numbers, whether it occurs at the same rate across the two sexes, in different regions and within ganglia that contain a diversity of neuronal numbers remains unknown. Here, by using antibodies against the DNA replication marker phospho-Histone H3 and against the pan-neuronal marker Hu to detect new-born neurons, we observe that while the proportions of new-born myenteric neurons are conserved irrespective of the region or sex in the healthy small intestine, they are inversely correlated with ganglia size. In contrast, by using antibodies against the apoptosis marker Cleaved Caspase 3 and Hu, we found that proportions of apoptotic neurons were directly correlated with ganglia size. Our observations on the unequal rate of neuronal turnover across ganglia, where smaller ganglia are more neurogenic and larger ganglia are more apoptotic, suggests that the myenteric ganglia are plastic in nature. These results provide further insight into the dynamic nature of the adult ENS.

                Hippocampal network activity at theta frequencies (5-10Hz) is important for behavior. However, it remains unclear how behaviorally-relevant network theta rhythms arise and interact with cellular dynamics to dictate spike timing. We performed membrane voltage (Vm) imaging of individual CA1 pyramidal cells and parvalbumin interneurons with simultaneous local field potential (LFP) recordings in mice during locomotion. We found that Vm theta rhythms organize spike timing in both cell types regardless of behavioral conditions, but the Vm of parvalbumin interneurons is better synchronized with LFP. The temporal relationships between spikes and LFP theta reliably reflect the Vm-LFP relationships in parvalbumin cells, but not in pyramidal cells. Thus, cellular theta rhythms broadly organize spike timing in CA1 neurons, and parvalbumin interneurons are critical in coordinating network theta rhythms.

                Transcranial focused ultrasound has the potential to noninvasively and systematically modulate deep brain circuits and impart sustained, neuroplastic effects in awake subjects. The intersection of these key properties is critical for effective treatments of brain disorders, yet remains to be shown. Harnessing the full potential of transcranial ultrasound, we delivered 30-second stimuli to deep brain targets (left/right lateral geniculate nucleus) in non-human primates while they performed a visual discrimination task. This brief sonication induced a sustained bias in choice behavior that persisted up to 15 minutes following the ultrasound offset. This behavioral effect was accompanied by an increase in gamma activity with dynamics that matched the effects on behavior. Moreover, the ultrasound was delivered into the targets daily for a period of more than 6 months. There were no detrimental effects on the animals' discrimination accuracy over the course of this stimulation regimen, even though the stimuli exceeded the FDA 510(k) Track 3 intensity values. This study highlights ultrasound's capacity to modify deep brain activity in a safe and therapeutically relevant way in awake subjects, thus bringing the approach closer to therapeutic options for patients suffering from treatment-resistant disease.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Online decoding of covert speech based on the passive perception of speech</a></h4>

              
                Background: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) can offer solutions to communicative impairments induced by conditions such as locked-in syndrome. While covert speech-based BCIs have garnered interest, a major issue facing their clinical translation is the collection of sufficient volumes of high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) examples of covert speech signals which can typically induce fatigue in users. Fortuitously, investigations into the linkage between covert speech and speech perception have revealed spatiotemporal similarities suggestive of shared encoding mechanisms. Here, we sought to demonstrate that an electroencephalographic cross-condition machine learning model of speech perception and covert speech can successfully decode neural speech patterns during online BCI scenarios. Methods: In the current study, ten participants underwent a dyadic protocol whereby participants perceived the audio of a randomly chosen word and then subsequently mentally rehearsed it. Eight words were used during the offline sessions and subsequently narrowed down to three classes for the online session (two words, rest). The modelling was achieved by estimating a functional mapping derived from speech perception and covert speech signals of the same speech token (features were extracted via a Riemannian approach). Results: While most covert speech BCIs deal with binary and offline classifications, we report an average ternary and online BCI accuracy of 75.3% (60% chance-level), reaching up to 93% in select participants. Moreover, we found that perception-covert modelling effectively enhanced the SNR of covert speech signals correlatively to their high-frequency correspondences. Conclusions: These findings may pave the way to efficient and more user-friendly data collection for passively training such BCIs. Future iterations of this BCI can lead to a combination of audiobooks and unsupervised learning to train a non-trivial vocabulary that can support proto-naturalistic communication.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Experience drives the development of novel, reliable cortical sensory representations from endogenously structured networks</a></h4>

              
                Cortical circuits embody remarkably reliable neural representations of sensory stimuli that are critical for perception and action. The fundamental structure of these network representations is thought to arise early in development prior to the onset of sensory experience. However, how these endogenously generated networks respond to the onset of sensory experience, and the extent to which they reorganize with experience remains unclear. Here we examine this 'nature-nurture transform' using chronic in vivo calcium imaging to probe the developmental emergence of the representation of orientation in visual cortex of the ferret, a species with a well-defined modular network of orientation-selective responses. At eye opening, visual stimulation of endogenous networks evokes robust modular patterns of cortical activity. However, these initial evoked activity patterns are strikingly different from those in experienced animals, exhibiting a high degree of variability both within and across trials that severely limits stimulus discriminability. In addition, visual experience is accompanied by a number of changes in the structure of the early evoked modular patterns including a reduction in dimensionality and a shift in the leading pattern dimensions indicating significant network reorganization. Moreover, these early evoked patterns and their changes are only loosely constrained by the endogenous network structure of spontaneous activity, and spontaneous activity itself reorganizes considerably to align with the novel evoked patterns. Based on a computational network model, we propose that the initial evoked activity patterns reflect novel visual input that is only poorly aligned with the endogenous networks and that highly reliable visual representations emerge from a realignment of feedforward and recurrent networks that is optimal for these novel patterns of visually driven activity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Dendritic degeneration and altered synaptic innervation of a central auditory neuron during age-related hearing loss</a></h4>

              
                Cellular morphology and synaptic configuration are key determinants of neuronal function and are often modified under pathological conditions. In the first nucleus of the central auditory system, the cochlear nucleus (CN), principal bushy neurons specialize in processing temporal information of sound critical for hearing. These neurons alter their physiological properties during aging that contribute to age-related hearing loss (ARHL). The structural basis of such changes remains unclear, especially age-related modifications in their dendritic morphology and the innervating auditory nerve (AN) synapses. Using young (2-5 months) and aged (28-33 months) CBA/CaJ mice of either sex, we filled individual bushy neurons with fluorescent dye in acute brain slices to characterize their dendritic morphology, followed by immunostaining against vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (VGluT1) and calretinin (CR) to identify innervating AN synapses. We found that the dendritic morphology of aged bushy neurons had significantly reduced complexity, suggesting age-dependent dendritic degeneration, especially in neurons with predominantly non-CR-expressing synapses on the soma. These dendrites were innervated by AN bouton synapses, which were predominantly non-CR-expressing in young mice but had an increased proportion of CR-expressing synapses in old mice. While somatic AN synapses degenerated substantially with age, as quantified by VGluT1-labeled puncta volume, no significant difference was observed in the total volume of dendritic synapses between young and old mice. Consequently, synaptic density on dendrites was significantly higher in old mice. The findings suggest that dendritic degeneration and altered synaptic innervation in bushy neurons during aging may underlie their changed physiological activity and contribute to the development of ARHL.

                Alcohol use disorders are complex conditions characterized in part by excessive ethanol (EtOH) drinking and withdrawal-induced malaise. The corticotropin releasing factor-1 receptor (CRF1) has been implicated in EtOH drinking, affective states, and pain sensitivity; often in a sex-dependent manner. The studies presented here investigate the associations between baseline behavior, chronic intermittent EtOH intake, and withdrawal-induced affective behavior in male and female CRF1:cre: tdTomato rats. There were no sex differences in basal affective state or thermal sensitivity, as measured by the splash test, novelty suppressed feeding test, and Hargreaves, respectively. However, female rats displayed increased mechanical sensitivity, measured by the Von Frey test. Following baseline testing, rats underwent voluntary EtOH or water drinking under intermittent access conditions. Female rats consumed significantly more EtOH, but only during the first week. There were no group effects of EtOH on behavioral tests, but all of the rats demonstrated increased malaise upon repeated testing. There were significant individual differences where affective behavior positively correlated with negative affect in both sexes. There were also significant correlations between EtOH intake and CRF1-cFos co-expression in the infralimbic cortex and basolateral amygdala. EtOH decreased CRF1+ expression in the lateral amygdala, but there were no significant group effects of EtOH on cFos or CRF1-cFos co-expression in the medial prefrontal cortex or amygdala. Together, these results illustrate the complex interplay between affect, pain sensitivity, EtOH drinking, and the role of CRF1 containing neurons in mediating these behaviors.

                How the dynamic evolution of forgetting changes for different materials is unexplored. By using a common experimental paradigm with stimuli of different types, we were able to directly cross-examine the emerging dynamics and we found that even though the presentation sets differ minimally by design, the obtained curves appear to fall on a discrete spectrum. Furthermore, we have previously proposed a model of forgetting based on the notion of retrograde interference with a single integer parameter. All measured curves were compatible with the model with different values of the parameter, hinting to a potential common underlying mechanism of forgetting.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cortical reactivations predict future sensory responses</a></h4>

              
                Prevailing theories of offline memory consolidation posit that the pattern of neurons activated during a salient sensory experience will be faithfully reactivated, thereby stabilizing the entire pattern. However, sensory-evoked patterns are not stable, but instead drift across repeated experiences. To investigate potential roles of reactivations in the stabilization and/or drift of sensory representations, we imaged calcium activity of thousands of excitatory neurons in mouse lateral visual cortex. Presentation of a stimulus resulted in transient, stimulus-specific reactivations during the following minute. These reactivations depended on local circuit activity, as they were abolished by local silencing during the preceding stimulus. Contrary to prevailing theories, reactivations systemically differed from previous patterns evoked by the stimulus. Instead, they were more similar to future patterns evoked by the stimulus, thereby predicting representational drift. In particular, neurons that participated more or less in early reactivations than in stimulus response patterns subsequently increased or decreased their future stimulus responses, respectively. The rate and content of these reactivations was sufficient to accurately predict future changes in stimulus responses and, surprisingly, the decreasing similarity of responses to distinct stimuli. Thus, activity patterns during sensory cortical reactivations may guide the drift in sensory responses to improve sensory discrimination.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Scene perception and visuospatial memory converge at the anterior edge of visually-responsive cortex</a></h4>

              
                To fluidly engage with the world, our brains must simultaneously represent both the scene in front of us and our memory of the immediate surrounding environment (i.e., local visuospatial context). How does the brain's functional architecture enable sensory and mnemonic representations to closely interface, while also avoiding sensory-mnemonic interference? Here, we asked this question using first-person, head-mounted virtual reality (VR) and fMRI. Using VR, human participants of both sexes learned a set of immersive, real-world visuospatial environments in which we systematically manipulated the extent of visuospatial context associated with a scene image in memory across three learning conditions, spanning from a single field-of-view to a city street. We used fine-grained individual subject fMRI to determine which brain areas support memory of the visuospatial context associated with a scene during recall (Exp. 1) and recognition (Exp. 2). Across the whole brain, activity in three patches of cortex scaled with the amount of known visuospatial context, each located immediately anterior to one of the three scene perception areas of high-level visual cortex. Individual subject analyses revealed that these anterior patches corresponded to three functionally-defined place memory areas, which selectively respond when visually recalling personally familiar places. In addition to showing activity levels that scaled with the amount of visuospatial context, multivariate analyses showed that these anterior areas represented the identity of the specific environment being recalled. Together, these results suggest a convergence zone for scene perception and memory of the local visuospatial context at the anterior edge of high-level visual cortex.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">An MR-based brain template and atlas for optical projection tomography and light sheet fluorescence microscopy</a></h4>

              
                Optical projection tomography (OPT) and light sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) are high resolution optical imaging techniques operating in the mm-cm range, ideally suited for ex vivo 3D whole mouse brain imaging. Although these techniques exhibit high sensitivity and specificity for antibody labeled targets, the provided anatomical information remains limited. To allow anatomical mapping of fluorescent signal in whole brain, we developed a novel magnetic resonance (MR) based template with its associated tissue priors and atlas labels, specifically designed for brains subjected to tissue processing protocols required for 3D optical imaging. We investigated the effect of tissue preprocessing and clearing on brain size and morphology and developed optimized templates for BABB/Murrays clear (OCUM) and DBE/iDISCO (iOCUM) cleared brains. By creating optical (i)OCUM fusion images using our mapping procedure, we localized dopamine transporter and translocator protein expression and tracer innervation from the eye to the lateral geniculate nucleus of thalamus and superior colliculus. These fusion images allowed for precise anatomical identification of fluorescent signal in discrete brain areas. As such, these templates enable applications in a broad range of research areas integrating optical 3D brain imaging by providing an MR template for cleared brains.

                Background: Parkinson's disease is a progressive, neurodegenerative disease characterized by motor dysfunction and dopamine deficits. The MitoPark mouse recapitulates several facets of Parkinson's disease, including gradual development of motor deficits, which enables the study of potential therapeutic interventions. One therapeutic strategy involves decreasing the mitochondrial metabolic load by inducing ketosis and providing an alternative energy source for neurons, leading to decreased neuronal oxidative stress. Objective: We assessed whether administration of a ketone ester-enriched diet would improve motor and dopamine release deficits in MitoPark mice. Methods: Motor function (rotarod and open field tests), dopamine release (fast-scan cyclic voltammetry), tissue dopamine levels (GC-MS), and dopamine neurons and axons (immunofluorescence) were assessed in MitoPark and control mice fed either the standard or ketone ester-enriched diets. Results: When started on the ketone diet before motor dysfunction onset, MitoPark mice had preserved motor function relative to standard diet MitoPark mice. While the ketone ester enriched diet did not preserve dopamine neurons or striatal dopamine axons, dopamine release in ketone diet MitoPark mice was greater than standard diet MitoPark mice but less than control mice. In a follow up experiment, we began the ketone diet after motor dysfunction onset and observed a modest preservation of motor function in ketone diet MitoPark mice relative to standard diet MitoPark mice. Conclusion: The improvement in motor dysfunction indicates that a ketone ester enriched diet or ketone supplement may represent a promising adjunct treatment for Parkinson's disease.

                Migraine Disease (MD) is one of the primary headaches in which the pathophysiological mechanism is yet unknown. It is still unclear how the ictal phases' periods are determined? Why can any small trigger sometimes initiate the ictal phase, and sometimes, even bigger triggers cannot? Considering the brain as a dynamic system and proposing a complex system model for that as a migraineur or a healthy subject is a viable method. Here, the interaction between whole neurons is analyzed rather than individual neurons. This model is a complex system with a chaotic attractor. With parameter alternations, this attractor changes from one scroll to double scroll, representing a healthy or a migraineur brain. In the proposed system, the attractor's borders are the regions where every small trigger can start the ictal phase, while the outer areas are the non-sensitive brain situations. We believe that MD and Chua's systems have certain behavioral similarities. This study aimed to explain the function of MD and offer a theory that adequately describes its behavior. Finally, it has been tried to discuss some physiological evidences such as Migraine Generator Network (MGN), Cortical Spreading Depression (CSD), and the role of Serotonin and other substances in relation to the expressed hypotheses. This insight may propose newer methods for preventing or curing MD. Knowing the functioning of dynamic systems and finding similar behaviors with MD on the one hand, as well as linking physiological and pathophysiological evidence with a quantitative model can be very useful in better understanding, managing, and controlling the MD.

                Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex and heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorder linked to numerous rare, inherited and arising de novo genetic variants. ASD often co-occurs with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and epilepsy, which are associated with hyperexcitability of neurons. However, the physiological and molecular mechanisms underlying hyperexcitability in ASD remain poorly understood. Transient receptor potential canonical-6 (TRPC6) is a Ca2+-permeable cation channel that regulates store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) and is a candidate risk gene for ASD. Using human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived cortical neurons, single cell calcium imaging, and electrophysiological recording, we show that TRPC6 knockout (KO) reduces SOCE signaling and leads to hyperexcitability of neurons by increasing action potential frequency and network burst frequency. Our data provide evidence that reduction of SOCE by TRPC6 KO results in neuronal hyperexcitability, which we hypothesize is an important contributor to the cellular pathophysiology underlying hyperactivity in some ASD.

                Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a primary dose-limiting side effect caused by antineoplastic agents, such as paclitaxel. This causes damage to peripheral nerves and the dorsal root ganglia (DRG). Currently, there are no effective treatments for CIPN, which can lead to long-term morbidity in cancer patients and survivors. Neuro-immune interactions occur in CIPN and have been implicated both in the development and progression of the disease and disease resolution. We investigated the potential role of Inducible co-stimulatory molecule (ICOS) in the resolution of CIPN pain-like behaviors in mice. ICOS is an immune checkpoint molecule that is expressed on the surface of activated T cells and promotes proliferation and differentiation of T cells. We found that intrathecal administration of ICOS agonist antibody (ICOSaa) alleviates mechanical hypersensitivity caused by paclitaxel and facilitates the resolution of mechanical sensitivity in female mice. Administration of ICOSaa reduced astrocyte-gliosis in the spinal cord and satellite cell gliosis in the DRG of mice previously treated with paclitaxel. Mechanistically, ICOSaa intrathecal treatment promoted pain resolution by increasing interleukin 10 (IL-10) expression in the dorsal root ganglion. In line with these observations, blocking IL-10 receptor (IL-10R) activity occluded the effects of ICOSaa treatment on CIPN behavior in female mice. Suggesting a broader activity in neuropathic pain, ICOSaa also partially resolved mechanical hypersensitivity in the spared nerve injury (SNI) model. Our findings support a model wherein ICOSaa administration induces IL-10 expression to facilitate neuropathic pain relief in female mice. ICOSaa treatment is in clinical development for solid tumors and given our observation of T cells in the human DRG, ICOSaa therapy could be developed for combination chemotherapy - CIPN clinical trials.

                Despite the enormous harms of alcohol use disorders (AUDs), many mechanisms, as well as effective prevention or treatment strategies remain elusive. Genetic factors dictate a majority of AUD risk. These risk factors can manifest as reduced naive sensitivity to alcohol's intoxicating effects and increased functional tolerance, i.e., brain-mediated decreases in sensitivity upon repeat exposure. The underlying neurobiology of how AUD-associated genes alter these endophenotypes remains poorly understood. Genes implicated in AUDs include epigenetic modifiers, such as histone demethylases, including Kdm3. We previously showed that whole-body and neuronal Kdm3 strongly affect ethanol sensitivity and tolerance in Drosophila. Here, we investigate the mechanisms of these effects, and, by extension, mechanisms of sensitivity and tolerance. RNA-seq and pathway analysis on Kdm3KO flies revealed disproportionate upregulation of genes involved in amino acid metabolism, including 1-carbon pathways. We show that acute amino acid feeding modulates sensitivity and tolerance in a Kdm3-dependent manner. Global manipulation of 1-carbon genes, especially glycine N-methyltransferase (Gnmt), glycine decarboxylase (Gldc), and sarcosine dehydrogenase (Sardh), alters alcohol sensitivity and tolerance. These changes in alcohol responses are likely mediated by global glycine levels (a substrate of these enzymes) rather than by 1-carbon input. Conversely, neuronal manipulations of 1-carbon pathways change alcohol sensitivity and tolerance in a pattern that suggests a mechanism through S-adenosyl methionine (SAM), a 1-carbon metabolite that is the universal methyl donor required for epigenetic methylation. Increasing SAM production specifically in glutamatergic neurons increases sensitivity and tolerance. Together, these findings reveal distinct mechanisms affecting alcohol sensitivity and tolerance globally (via glycine) and neuronally (via SAM), thus revealing an important and complex role of 1-carbon metabolism in mediating AUD phenotypes.

                Even after successful extinction, conditioned fear can return. Strengthening the consolidation of the fear-inhibitory safety memory formed during extinction is one way to counteract return of fear. In this preregistered direct replication study, we confirm that spontaneous post-extinction reactivations of a neural activation pattern evoked in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) during extinction predict extinction memory retrieval 24 h later. We do not confirm that L-DOPA administration after extinction enhances retrieval and that this is mediated by enhancement of the number of vmPFC reactivations. However, additional preregistered analyses reveal a beneficial effect of L-DOPA on extinction retrieval when controlling for salivary alpha-amylase (sAA) levels, an indicator of arousal, at extinction onset. Further, pre-extinction sAA negatively predicts retrieval and (at trend) vmPFC reactivations, and these impeding effects are abolished by L-DOPA treatment. Our results suggest that L-DOPA may enhance extinction consolidation under high-arousal conditions, as typically present during exposure therapy sessions.

                Current research tools for pre-clinical drug development such as rodent models and 2D immortalised monocultures have failed to serve as effective translational models for human CNS disorders. Recent advancements in the development of iPSCs and 3D culturing can improve the in vivo-relevance of pre-clinical models, while generating 3D cultures though novel bioprinting technologies can offer increased scalability and replicability. As such, there is a need to develop platforms that combine iPSC-derived cells with 3D bioprinting to produce scalable, tunable and biomimetic cultures for preclinical drug discovery applications. We report a biocompatible PEG-based matrix which incorporates RGD and YIGSR peptide motifs and full length collagen IV at a stiffness similar to the human brain (1.5 kPa). Using a high-throughput commercial bioprinter we report the viable culture and morphological development of iPSC-derived astrocytes, brain microvascular endothelial cells, neural progenitors and neurons in our novel matrix. We also show that this system supports endothelial vasculogenesis and enhances neural differentiation and spontaneous activity. This platform forms a foundation for more complex, multicellular models to facilitate high-throughput translational drug discovery for CNS disorders.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Tracking lexical and semantic prediction error underlying the N400 using artificial neural network models of sentence processing</a></h4>

              
                Recent research has shown that the internal dynamics of an artificial neural network model of sentence comprehension displayed a similar pattern to the amplitude of the N400 in several conditions known to modulate this event-related potential. These results led Rabovsky, Hansen, and McClelland (2018) to suggest that the N400 might reflect change in an implicit predictive representation of meaning corresponding to semantic prediction error. This explanation stands as an alternative to the hypothesis that the N400 reflects lexical-prediction error as estimated by word Surprisal (Frank, Otten, Galli, & Vigliocco, 2015). In the present study, we directly model the amplitude of the N400 elicited during naturalistic sentence processing by using as predictor the update of the distributed representation of sentence meaning generated by a Sentence Gestalt model (McClelland, St. John, & Taraban, 1989) trained on a large-scale text corpus. This enables a quantitative prediction of N400 amplitudes based on a cognitively motivated model, as well as quantitative comparison of this model to alternative models of the N400. Specifically, we compare the update measure from the SG model to Surprisal estimated by a comparable language model trained on next-word prediction. The results reported in this paper corroborate the hypothesis that N400 amplitudes correspond to the change in an implicit predictive representation of meaning after every word presentation. Furthermore, we argue that a comparison of the Sentence Gestalt update and Surprisal might also uncover two distinct but probably closely related sub-processes that contribute to the processing of a sentence.

                During task execution cortical dynamics must bridge sensory cues with future behavioural outcomes. However, how cortical networks acquire such task-specific dynamics remains unclear. Here we propose that the cerebellum drives cortical dynamics to enable rapid and flexible task acquisition. We model cerebellar networks that are tuned through timing rules to provide cortical networks with task-outcome predictions. First, using sensorimotor tasks we show that cerebellar feedback with fixed cortical connectivity is sufficient for rapid task acquisition and one-shot task switching. Next, we demonstrate that, when trained in working memory tasks, the cerebellum can also underlie the maintenance of cognitive-specific dynamics, explaining a range of optogenetic and behavioural observations. Finally, we use our model to introduce a systems consolidation theory in which task information is gradually transferred from the cerebellum to the cortex. In summary, our results suggest that cortico-cerebellar loops are critical for task acquisition, switching and consolidation in the brain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Hand preference and the corpus callosum: Is there really no association?</a></h4>

              
                Originating from a series of morphometric studies conducted in the 1980s, it appears a widely held belief in cognitive neuroscience that the corpus callosum is larger in non-right handers than in right handers (RH). However, a recent meta-analysis challenges this belief by not finding significant differences in corpus callosum size between handedness groups. Yet, relying on the available published data, the meta-analysis was not able to account for a series of factors potential influencing its outcome, such as confounding effects of brain size differences and a restricted spatial resolution of previous callosal segmentation strategies. To address these remaining questions, we here analysed the midsagittal corpus callosum of N = 1057 participants from the Human Connectome Project (HCP 1200 Young Adults) to compare handedness groups based on consistency (e.g., consistent RH vs. mixed handers, MH) and direction of hand preference (e.g., RH vs. left handers). A possible relevance of brain-size differences was addressed by analysing callosal variability by both using forebrain volume (FBV) as covariate and utilising relative area (callosal area/thickness divided by FBV) as dependent variable. Callosal thickness was analysed at 100 measuring points along the structure to achieve high spatial resolution to detect subregional effects. However, neither of the conducted analyses was able to find significant handedness-related differences in callosal and the respective effect-sizes estimates were small. For example, comparing MH and consistent RH, the effect sizes for difference in callosal area were below a Cohen's d = 0.1 (irrespective of how FBV was included), and narrow confidence intervals allowed to exclude effects above |d| = 0.2. Analysing thickness, effect sizes were below d = 0.2 with confidence intervals not extending above |d| = 0.3. In this, the possible range of population effect sizes of hand preference on callosal morphology appears well below the effects commonly reported for factors like age, sex, or brain size. Effects on cognition or behaviour accordingly can be considered small, questioning the common practice to attribute performance differences between handedness groups to differences in callosal architecture.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Firing rate adaptation in continuous attractor neural networks accounts for theta phase shift of hippocampal place cells</a></h4>

              
                Hippocampal place cells of freely moving animals display 'theta phase precession', whereby spikes are fired at successively earlier phases of the 6-10 Hz local field potential (LFP) theta rhythm. In some cases, this phase precession is interleaved with periods of 'phase procession', in which spikes are fired at successively later phases of the theta rhythm. Here we propose a continuous attractor neural network (CANN) with firing rate adaptation to understand both kinds of phase shift in place cell firing. We show that firing rate adaptation induces intrinsic mobility of the location represented by the 'bump' of population activity, which competes with the extrinsic mobility arising from external sensory inputs. The interplay between these two factors causes the activity bump to oscillate around the external input, resembling the forward and backward sweeps of decoded position during locomotion. Analysis of single cell dynamics reveals that these forward and backward sweeps naturally account for theta phase precession and procession of individual neurons, respectively. Furthermore, by tuning the adaptation strength, we explain the difference between bimodal and unimodal cells, with the former having interleaved phase precession and procession, and the latter having only the predominant phase precession. Our model reproduces other experimental findings, including the constant cycling of theta sweeps along different arms in a T-maze environment, the speed modulation of place cells' firing frequency, and the continued phase shift after transient silencing of the hippocampus. Our results show how the intrinsic dynamics of a population of place cells affords both types of theta phase shift. We hope that they will aid an understanding of the neural mechanisms supporting theta phase coding in the brain.

                Flexible decision making in complex environments is a hallmark of intelligent behavior but the underlying learning mechanisms and neural computations remain elusive. Through a combination of behavioral, computational and electrophysiological analysis of a novel multidimensional rule-learning paradigm, we show that both rats and humans sequentially probe different behavioral strategies to infer the task rule, rather than learning all possible mappings between environmental cues and actions as current theoretical formulations suppose. This species-conserved process reduces task dimensionality and explains both observed sudden behavioral transitions and positive transfer effects. Behavioral strategies are represented by rat prefrontal activity and strategy-related variables can be decoded from magnetoencephalography signals in human prefrontal cortex. These mechanistic findings provide a foundation for the translational investigation of impaired cognitive flexibility.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Circuit-specific selective vulnerability in the DMN persists in the face of widespread amyloid burden.</a></h4>

              
                The relationship between brainwide functional decline and accumulation of pathological protein aggregates in Alzheimer disease (AD) is complex and not well understood. A set of highly interconnected cortical regions known as the default mode network (DMN) exhibits selective vulnerability to both functional decline and amyloid beta (A{beta}) plaques in early AD. One possibility is that early A{beta} accumulation in the DMN drives vulnerability. However, it is unknown whether there is something intrinsic to neuronal projections within the DMN that biases these circuits towards dysfunction. Here we directly test this hypothesis using long-term recordings of the spiking activity of ensembles of single units in freely behaving mice characterized by global cortical and hippocampal A{beta} burden (APP/PS1). Specifically, we track the interactions of a population of neurons within a DMN region and two additional populations that comprise monosynaptic targets, one within and the other outside the DMN. In addition, we record single neurons in hippocampus and examine interactions between in-DMN and out-DMN cortical circuits triggered on hippocampal sharp-wave ripples, stereotyped hippocampal events that contribute to memory consolidation in the cortex. We examine the statistics of local activity as well as inter-regional communication in a region, genotype, and brain-state dependent manner. Our data reveal dysfunction restricted to in-DMN projecting circuits. In contrast, communication along neuronal projections that originate in the DMN but target out-DMN populations are equivalent in APP/PS1 and WT mice. Circuit dysfunction is most evident throughout sleep as well as within sharp-wave ripples. Our results indicate that cells in the DMN exhibit differential intrinsic vulnerability to amyloid injury dependent on their projection targets.

                Spectrum estimators that make use of averaging across time segments are ubiquitous across neuroscience. The core of this approach has not changed substantially since the 1960s, though many advances in the field of regression modelling and statistics have been made during this time. Here, we propose a new approach, the General Linear Model (GLM) Spectrum, which reframes time averaged spectral estimation as multiple regression. This brings several benefits, including the ability to do confound modelling, hierarchical modelling and significance testing via non-parametric statistics. We apply the approach to a first-level EEG resting-state dataset alternating between eyes open and eyes closed resting-state. The GLM-Spectrum can model both conditions, quantify their differences, and perform denoising through confound regression in a single step. This application is scaled up from a single channel to a whole-head recording and, finally, applied to quantify age differences across a large group-level dataset. We show that the GLM-Spectrum lends itself to rigorous modelling of within- and between-subject contrasts as well as their interactions, and that the use of model-projected spectra provides an intuitive visualisation. The GLM-Spectrum is a flexible framework for robust multi-level analysis of power spectra, with adaptive covariance and confound modelling.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Selective brain cooling monitored by CT perfusion as adjuvant therapy in a porcine model of severe ischemic stroke</a></h4>

              
                Despite the advances in ischemic stroke treatment, not all patients are eligible for or fully recovered after recanalization therapies. Therapeutic hypothermia could be adjuvant therapy that optimizes the beneficial effect of reperfusion. While conventional whole-body cooling has severe adverse effects, selective brain cooling has emerged as an attractive alternative. However, clinical application is limited by the lack of optimal delivery methods and unknown treatment parameters. Optimal parameters may depend on injury levels and monitoring cerebral perfusion may provide valuable information. Here, we show that selective brain cooling via our in-house developed Vortex tube IntraNasal Cooling Instrument (VINCI), even with a clinically relevant delay in treatment, can attenuate subacute injuries in animals with severe ischemic stroke. The treatment responses of selective brain cooling were characterized by CT Perfusion (CTP). The predicted lesion volume by CTP matched the true infarct volume by histology when the brain temperature was decreased by 5 oC from normothermia. More importantly, we found that global hyperemia (high cerebral blood flow) before rewarming could be an early manifestation of poor treatment outcomes. Altogether, our study shows that VINCI-enabled brain cooling could be guided by CTP imaging as adjuvant therapy for severe ischemic stroke. This work lays the groundwork toward individualized selective brain cooling.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Structural Reorganization Following a Brain Tumor: A Machine Learning Study Considering Desynchronized Functional Oscillations</a></h4>

              
                Neuroimaging studies have allowed for non-invasive mapping of brain networks in brain tumors. Although tumor core and oedema are easily identifiable using standard MRI acquisitions, imaging studies often neglect signals and structures and functions within their presence. Therefore, both functional and diffusion signals, as well as their relationship with global patterns of connectivity reorganization, are poorly understood. Here, we explore functional activity and the structure of white matter fibers considering the contribution of the whole tumor in a surgical context. First, we find that intra-tumor signals do exist and are correlated with alterations present both in healthy tissue and resting-state networks. Second, we propose a fiber tracking pipeline capable of using anatomical information while still reconstructing bundles in tumoral and peritumoral tissue. Finally, using machine learning and healthy anatomical information, we predict structural rearrangement after surgery given the preoperative brain network. The generative model also disentangles complex patters of connectivity reorganization for different types of tumors. Overall, we show the importance of carefully designing studies including MR signals within damaged brain tissues, as they exhibit and relate to non-trivial patterns of both structural and functional (dis-)connections or activity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Single-cell sequencing of Entorhinal Cortex Reveals Wide-Spread Disruption of Neuropeptide Networks in Alzheimer's Disease</a></h4>

              
                Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease that involves early and significant neuropathological changes within the entorhinal cortex (EC). Many have reported on neuronal loss and synaptic dysfunction in the brains of AD patients and AD models. In parallel, abnormalities of neuropeptides (NPs) that play important roles in modulating neuronal activities are commonly observed in AD and other neurodegenerative diseases. However, the involvement of NPs has mostly been studied in the context of neurons; a cell type-specific examination of NP expression in AD brains is needed. Here, we aim to examine the NP networks in the EC of AD brains using single-nuclei and bulk transcriptomic data from other regions in the temporal cortex, focusing on the gene expression of NP and their cognate G-protein coupled receptors. We find that NP genes were expressed by all major cell types in the brain and there was a significant decrease in the quantity and the proportion of cells that express NPs in AD EC cells. On the contrary, the overall expression of GPCR genes showed an increase in AD cells, likely reflecting ongoing compensatory mechanisms in AD brains. In addition, we report that there was a disproportionate absence of cells expressing higher levels and greater diversity of NPs in AD brains. Finally, we established a negative correlation between age and the abundance of AD-associated NPs in the hippocampus, supporting that the disruption of the NP signaling network in the EC may contribute to the early pathogenesis of AD. In short, we report widespread disruption of the NP networks in AD brains at the single-cell level. In light of our results, we hypothesize that brain cells, especially neurons, that express high levels of NPs may exhibit selective vulnerability to AD. Moreover, it is likely AD brains undergo specific adaptive changes to fluctuating NP signaling, a process that can likely be targeted with therapeutic approaches aimed at stabilizing NP expression landscapes. Given that GPCRs are one of the most druggable targets for neurological diseases and disorders, we believe NP signaling pathways can be harnessed for future biomarkers and treatment strategies for AD.

	<p>We report two patients, one with and one without long-term persistent tiling inside an arcuate macular scotoma. In both cases, the scotoma was caused by a cilioretinal artery occlusion. Both patients were almost identical regarding the location and extent of the scotoma. In both cases, there was a comparable degree of atrophy on optical coherence tomography for the retinal nerve fibre, ganglion cell, and inner plexiform layers. The main difference was the preservation of the inner nuclear layer in the patient with persistent tiling. In this patient, optical coherence angiography demonstrates preserved perfusion of the superior vascular plexus, which was not the case in the patient with the negative scotoma who also had atrophy of the inner nuclear layer. Recreational use of cannabinoid enhanced the intensity of perceived tiling in the relative scotoma of the first patient. A review of the literature suggests that the persistent tiling described in our case is different to teichopsias of retinal or cerebral origin. These data suggest that persistent monocular tiling in a scotoma arises from retinal circuit activity that requires the preservation of the inner nuclear layer. Future research should investigate this functional&amp;amp;ndash;structural relationship in other diseases, including glaucoma.</p>

	<p>Background: Both the global COVID-19 pandemic situation, as well as the current political situation in Eastern Europe may exacerbate anxiety and contribute to stress-related disorders such as panic disorder. Electroencephalography (EEG)-based neurofeedback provides both assessment of the subject&amp;amp;rsquo;s brainwave activity as well as the possibility of its therapeutic correction. It is possible that it can be implemented as an auxiliary treatment in panic disorders of different origin. The aim of this feasibility study was to demonstrate (both short- and long-term) effectiveness of neurofeedback therapy in a patient with previously diagnosed panic attacks, related to fear of COVID-19 infection. Methods: We report the case study of a 47-year-old man affected by panic attacks, related to his profound, constant fear of COVID-19 infection and its sequelae. For the initial diagnostic workup, several clinical and research tools were used: 1. Baseline psychological exam; 2. Anxiety&amp;amp;mdash;targeted interview performed by miniQEEG therapist; 3. Analysis of previous clinical test results (EEG record/lab blood test); and 4. The miniQEEG exam (central strip recording Cz-C3-C4), The patient was subjected to regular EEG Neurofeedback sessions for two consecutive months. After completing the treatment, follow-up tests, as listed above were repeated immediately after completing the whole treatment program, as well as 1 and 2 years later. MiniQEEG results were compared with healthy control (age-matched male subject not affected with panic attacks) and evaluated over the time that the subject was involved in the study. Results: Initially, the patient was suffering from severe panic attacks accompanied by vegetative symptoms and from destructive and negative thoughts. After 8 consecutive weeks of treatment encompassing sixteen QEEG neurofeedback training sessions (each lasting 30 min), a subjective improvement of his complaints was reported. More importantly, QEEG records of the patient also improved, approximating the pattern of QEEG recorded in the healthy control. Conclusion: In this single case-based feasibility analysis, we demonstrate that systematic application of QEEG-Neurofeedback may result in manifest and durable therapeutic effect. Of note, use of this treatment may be a valuable option for patients with panic attack/panic disorder, especially if related to the psychological burden of the COVID-19/war era. Future studies on a larger patient population, especially with a longitudinal/prospective design, are warranted.</p>

	<p>Thyroid hormone (TH) augmentation, although commonly used for major depression, is sparingly used for bipolar disorder (BD) after the failure of mood-stabilizing agents. While the exact mechanisms of thyroid hormone action in BD remains unclear, central thyroid hormone deficit has been postulated as a mechanism for rapid cycling. This systematic review&amp;amp;mdash;conducted in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines&amp;amp;mdash;of eight studies synthesizes the evidence for TH augmentation in BD. A systematic search of the Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, and Cochrane databases was conducted for randomized controlled trials (RCT), open-label trials, and observational studies of levothyroxine (LT4) and triiodothyronine (T3) for BD. Open-label studies of high dose LT4 augmentation for bipolar depression and rapid cycling showed improvement in depression outcomes and reduction in recurrence, respectively. However, an RCT of high-dose LT4 did not show benefit in contrast to placebo. An RCT comparing LT4, T3, and placebo showed benefit only in rapid-cycling bipolar women. A meta-analysis could not be completed due to significant differences in study designs, interventions, and outcomes. Our systematic review shows mixed evidence and a lack of high-quality studies. The initial promise of supratherapeutic LT4 augmentation from open-label trials has not been consistently replicated in RCTs. Limited data are available for T3. The studies did not report thyrotoxicosis, and TH augmentation were well tolerated. Therefore, TH augmentation, especially with supratherapeutic doses, should be reserved for highly treatment-resistant bipolar depression and rapid-cycling BD.</p>

	<p>Background: cocaine craving is a core feature of cocaine use disorder and remains a critical challenge for abstinence and relapse prevention. This review summarizes the anti-craving efficacy of pharmacotherapies tested for cocaine use disorder, in the context of randomized-controlled clinical trials. Objectives: we assessed the databases of the U.S. National Library of Medicine, Google Scholar, and PsycINFO, without date restrictions up to August 2022, to identify relevant studies. Study eligibility criteria, participants, and interventions: we included double-blinded randomized-controlled trials investigating pharmacotherapies for cocaine craving and/or cocaine use disorder whose outcomes included cocaine craving. Study appraisal and synthesis methods: Two authors screened studies&amp;amp;rsquo; titles and abstracts for inclusion, and both read all the included studies. We systematically gathered information on the following aspects of each study: title; author(s); year of publication; sample size; mean age; sample characteristics; study set-ting; whether participants were treatment-seeking; study design; craving measures; study interventions; drop-out rates; and other relevant outcomes. Results: Overall, we appraised 130 clinical trials, including 8137 participants. We further considered the drugs from the studies that scored equal to or greater than six points in the quality assessment. There was a correlation between craving and cocaine use outcomes (self-reports, timeline follow-back or urinary benzoylecgonine) in the vast majority of studies. In the short-term treatment, acute phenylalanine-tyrosine depletion, clonidine, fenfluramine, meta-chlorophenylpiperazine (m-CPP) and mecamylamine presented promising effects. In the long term, amphetamine, biperiden, carbamazepine, lisdexamfetamine, lorcaserin, methamphetamine, mirtazapine, pioglitazone, progesterone, guanfacine, levodopa, nefazodone presented promising anti-craving effects. Unfortunately, the highly tested medications were not successful in most of the trials, as follows: propranolol in the short term; amantadine, aripiprazole, bromocriptine, citicoline, ketamine, modafinil, olanzapine, topiramate in the long term. The remaining 52 medications had no positive anti-craving outcomes. Limitations: Our review was limited by high heterogeneity of craving assessments across the studies and by a great range of pharmacotherapies. Further, the majority of the studies considered abstinence and retention in treatment as the main outcomes, whereas craving was a secondary outcome and some of the studies evaluated patients with cocaine use disorder with comorbidities such as opioid or alcohol use disorder, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder or attention deficit hyperactivity. Lastly, most of the studies also included non-pharmacological treatments, such as counseling or psychotherapy Conclusions: There is a direct association between craving and cocaine use, underscoring craving as an important treatment target for promoting abstinence among persons with cocaine use disorder. Clonidine, fenfluramine and m-CPP showed to be promising medications for cocaine craving in the short-term treatment, and amphetamine, biperiden, carbamazepine, lisdexamfetamine, lorcaserin, methamphetamine, mirtazapine, pioglitazone, progesterone, guanfacine, levodopa, nefazodone in the long-term treatment.</p>

	<p>Background: Intelligence scores in males with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) and Becker Muscular Dystrophy (BMD) remain a major issue in clinical practice. We performed a literature review and meta-analysis to further delineate the intellectual functioning of dystrophinopathies. Method: Published, peer-reviewed articles assessing intelligence, using Wechsler Scales, of males with DMD or BMD were searched from 1960 to 2022. Meta-analysis with random-effects models was conducted, assessing weighted, mean effect sizes of full-scale IQ (FSIQ) scores relative to normative data (Mean = 100, Standard Deviation = 15). Post hoc we analysed differences between performance and verbal intelligence scores. Results: 43 studies were included, reporting data on 1472 males with dystrophinopathies; with FSIQ scores available for 1234 DMD (k = 32) and 101 BMD (k = 7). DMD males score, on average, one standard deviation below average (FSIQ = 84.76) and significantly lower than BMD (FSIQ = 92.11). Compared to a previous meta-analysis published in 2001, we find, on average, significantly higher FSIQ scores in DMD. Conclusion: Males with Duchenne have, on average, significantly lower FSIQ scores than BMD males and the general population. Clinicians must consider lower intelligence in dystrophinopathies to ensure good clinical practice.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neuronal contact predicts connectivity in the C. elegans brain</a></h4>

              
                Axons must project to particular brain regions, contact adjacent neurons, and choose appropriate synaptic targets to form a nervous system. Multiple mechanisms have been proposed to explain synaptic partnership choice. In a 'lock-and-key' mechanism, first proposed by Sperry's chemoaffinity model, a neuron selectively chooses a synaptic partner among several different, adjacent target cells, based on a specific molecular recognition code. Alternatively, Peters' rule posits that neurons indiscriminately form connections with other neuron types in their proximity; hence, neighborhood choice, dictated by initial neuronal process outgrowth and position, is the sole predictor of connectivity. However, whether Peters' rule plays an important role in synaptic wiring remains unresolved. To assess the nanoscale relationship between neuronal adjacency and connectivity, we evaluate the expansive set of C. elegans connectomes. We find that synaptic connectivity can be accurately modeled as a path-length-dependent process of neuronal adjacency and brain strata, offering strong support for Peters' rule as an organizational principle of C. elegans brain wiring.

                Humans spontaneously structure spatial environments into a hierarchy of regions. Besides connectivity and boundaries, sensory or functional similarities of landmarks have been shown to influence construction of regions. In natural spaces, regions and places are usually named and these names provide additional cues for the cognitive construction of regions. In this study we investigate the role of semantic similarities of place names in the formation of regions in a virtual environment with homogeneous connectivity. Place names were selected and distributed in a way that two alternative semantic categorizations were possible which corresponded to two equally valid regionalisations of the same environment. Region perception was assessed by having subjects choose between two equidistant routes crossing different numbers of region boundaries (classification consistent route choice). In a priming phase, subjects were biased to sort the landmark names in one or the other categorization scheme. In the test phase, subjects preferably selected routes with a lower number of region crossings according to the categorization previously discovered. The results show that perceived semantic similarity of place names does affect route choice and the formation of spatial regions.

                The entorhinal cortex (EC) is central to the brain's navigation system. Its subregions are conventionally thought to compute dichotomous representations for spatial processing: medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) provides a global spatial map, while lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) encodes specific sensory details of experience. While local recordings of EC circuits have amassed a vast catalogue of specialized cell types that could support navigation computations in the brain, we have little direct evidence for how these signals are actually transmitted outside of the EC to its primary downstream reader, the hippocampus, which itself is critical for the formation of spatial and episodic memories. Here we exploit in vivo sub-cellular imaging to directly record from EC axon terminals as they locally innervate hippocampal area CA1, while mice performed navigational and spatial learning tasks in virtual reality. We find both distinct and overlapping representations of task, location, and context in both MEC and LEC axons. While MEC transmitted a highly location- and context-specific code, LEC inputs were strongly biased by ongoing navigational goals and reward. Surprisingly, the position of the animal could be accurately decoded from either entorhinal subregion. Our results challenge prevailing dogma on the routing of spatial and non-spatial information from the cortex to the hippocampus, indicating that cortical interactions upstream of the hippocampus are critical for combining these processing streams to support navigation and memory.

                Diverse gene dosage disorders (GDDs) increase risk for psychiatric impairment, but characterization of GDD effects on the human brain has so far been piecemeal and lacked simultaneous analysis of multiple brain features across different GDDs. Here, through multimodal neuroimaging of 3 aneuploidy syndromes (XXY, XYY, trisomy 21), we reveal considerable diversity in cortical changes across GDDs and imaging-derived phenotypes (IDPs). This variegation of IDP change underlines the limitations of studying GDD effects unimodally. Integration across all IDP maps reveals highly distinct architectures of cortical change in each GDD, along with partial coalescence onto a common spatial axis of cortical vulnerability. This common axis shows strong alignment with shared cortical changes in behaviorally defined psychiatric disorders, and is enriched for specific molecular and cellular signatures - offering a high-priority target for future translational research.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Recombinant protein delivery enables modulation of the phototransduction cascade in mouse retina</a></h4>

              
                Retinal dystrophies of genetic origin are often associated with mutations in the genes involved in the phototransduction cascade in photoreceptors, a paradigmatic signaling pathway mediated by G protein-coupled receptors. Photoreceptor viability is strictly dependent on the levels of the second messengers cGMP and Ca2+. Here we explored the possibility of modulating the phototransduction cascade in mouse rods using direct or liposome-mediated administration of a recombinant protein crucial for regulating the interplay of the second messengers in photoreceptor outer segments. The effects of administration of the free and liposome-encapsulated human guanylate cyclase-activating protein (GCAP1) were compared in biological systems of increasing complexity (in cyto, ex vivo, and in vivo). Analysis of protein biodistribution and direct measurement of functional alteration in rod photoresponses show that the exogenous GCAP1 protein is fully incorporated into the mouse retina and photoreceptor outer segments. Furthermore, only in the presence of a point mutation associated with cone-rod dystrophy in humans p.(E111V), protein delivery induces a disease-like electrophysiological phenotype, consistent with constitutive activation of the retinal guanylate cyclase. Our study demonstrates that both direct and liposome-mediated protein delivery are powerful tools for targeting signaling cascades in neuronal cells, which could be particularly important for the treatment of autosomal dominant genetic diseases.

                Brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) can be transformative for people living with chronic paralysis. BMIs translate brain signals into computer commands, bypassing neurological impairments and enabling people with neurological injury or disease to control computers, robots, and more with nothing but thought. State-of-the-art BMIs have already made this future a reality in limited clinical trials. However, high performance BMIs currently require highly invasive electrodes in the brain. Device degradation limits longevity to about 5 years. Their field of view is small, restricting the number, and type, of applications possible. The next generation of BMI technology should include being longer lasting, less invasive, and scalable to sense activity from large regions of the brain. Functional ultrasound neuroimaging is a recently developed technique that meets these criteria. In this present study, we demonstrate the first online, closed-loop ultrasonic brain-machine interface. We used 2 Hz real-time functional ultrasound to measure the neurovascular activity of the posterior parietal cortex in two nonhuman primates (NHPs) as they performed memory-guided movements. We streamed neural signals into a classifier to predict the intended movement direction. These predictions controlled a behavioral task in real-time while the NHP did not produce overt movements. Both NHPs quickly succeeded in controlling up to eight independent directions using the BMI. Furthermore, we present a simple method to "pretrain" the BMI using data from previous sessions. This enables the BMI to work immediately from the start of a session without acquiring extensive additional training data. This work establishes, for the first time, the feasibility of an ultrasonic BMI and prepares for future work on a next generation of minimally invasive BMIs that can restore function to patients with neurological, physical, or even psychiatric impairments.

                The patch-clamp technique has revolutionized neurophysiology by allowing to study single neuronal excitability, synaptic connectivity, morphology, and the transcriptomic profile. However, the throughput in recordings is limited because of the manual replacement of patch-pipettes after each attempt often also being unsuccessful. This has been overcome by automated cleaning the tips in detergent solutions, allowing to reuse the pipette for further recordings. Here, we developed a novel method of automated cleaning by sonicating the tips within the bath solution wherein the cells are placed, reducing the risk of contaminating the bath solution or internal solution of the recording pipette by any detergent and avoiding the necessity of a separate chamber for cleaning. We showed that the patch-pipettes can be used consecutively at least 10 times and that the cleaning process does not negatively impact neither the brain slices nor other patched neurons. This method, combined with automated patch-clamp, highly improves the throughput for single and especially multiple recordings.

                We utilized positron emission tomography (PET) imaging in vivo to map the spatiotemporal biodistribution/expression (protein density) of class-IIa histone deacetylases (class-IIa HDACs) in the brain. Herein, we report an improved radiosynthesis of [18F]-NT160 using 4-hydroxy-TEMPO which led to a significant improvement in radiochemical yield and molar activity. PET imaging with [18F]-NT160, a highly potent class-IIa HDAC inhibitor with sub-nM affinity for HDAC4 and 5 isoforms, led to high-quality and high-contrast images among various brain regions. [18F]-NT160 displayed excellent pharmacokinetic and imaging characteristics: brain uptake is high in gray matter regions, leading to high-quality PET images; tissue kinetics are appropriate for an 18F tracer and specific binding for class-IIa HDACs is demonstrated by self-blockade. Higher uptake with [18F]-NT160 was observed in the hippocampus, thalamus, and cortex while there was relatively lower uptake in the cerebellum and striatum. Overall, our current studies with [18F]-NT160 will likely facilitate the development and clinical translation of class-IIa HDACs of the next generation of PET tracers for imaging and targeted therapy of cancer and the diseases of the central nervous system (CNS).

                With the recent surge of single cell RNA sequencing datasets (scRNAseq) the extent of cellular heterogeneity has become apparent, yet it remains poorly characterized on a protein level in brain tissue and induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) derived brain models. With this in mind, we developed a high-throughput, standardized approach for the reproducible characterization of cell types in complex neuronal tissues. We designed a flow cytometry (FC) antibody panel coupled with a computational pipeline to quantify cellular subtypes in human iPSC derived midbrain organoids. Our pipeline, termed CelltypeR, contains scripts to transform and align multiple datasets, optimize unsupervised clustering, annotate cell types, quantify cell types, and compare cells across conditions. We identified the expected brain cell types, then sorted neurons, astrocytes, and radial glia, confirming these cell types with scRNAseq. We present an adaptable analysis framework providing a generalizable method to reproducibly identify cell types across FC datasets.

                Abnormal intracellular accumulation of Tau aggregates is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other Tauopathies, such as Frontotemporal dementia (FTD), which can be caused by mutations of Tau. Mutated and pathological Tau can undergo a range of post-translational modifications (PTMs) that might trigger or modulate disease pathology. Recent studies indicate that modification of wild type Tau by Small ubiquitin-like modifier SUMO isoform 1 (SUMO1) controls Tau hyperphosphorylation and aggregation, suggesting that SUMOylation acts as a central regulator of Tau's biochemical properties. Besides SUMO1, Tau is modified by SUMO2/3, however the consequences of this modification have not been investigated. Here, using viral approaches on primary hippocampal neurons, transgenic mice expressing mutant Tau and SUMO2, and iPSC-derived neurons from FTD patients, we evaluated whether SUMO2/3 conjugation modifies the neurodegenerative disease pathology associated with the aggregation-prone mutant Tau P301L, P301S, and R406W variants. We found that mutant forms of Tau are targets of SUMO2/3, and SUMO2/3 conjugation is neuroprotective. Importantly, expression of mutant Tau is accompanied by a significant reduction of SUMO2/3 conjugation levels, and restoring levels of SUMO2 reduces mutant Tau aggregation and phosphorylation in all model systems Furthermore, overexpression of SUMO2 restores levels of pre- and post-synaptic markers, associated with a complete rescue of the LTP and memory deficits in transgenic mice expressing mutant Tau. These findings bring to light the potential therapeutic implication of manipulating SUMO conjugation to detoxify Tau through PTM-based approaches.

In this study, we were interested in the benefits of aerobic exercise in MP, given its positive effects on the acquisition and consolidation of motor skills induced by physical practice (PP). Four experimental groups were tested: i) physical practice without exercise (PP-Rest), ii) mental practice without exercise (MP-Rest), iii) mental practice preceded by Exercise (Exe-MP), and iv) mental practice followed by Exercise (MP-Exe). We hypothesized that exercise before MP would potentiate motor acquisition, whereas exercise after MP would further promote motor consolidation. Motor performance (movement speed and accuracy) was measured during a sequential finger tapping task before (Pre-Test), immediately after (Post-Test 0h, acquisition), and one day after practice (Post-Test 24h, consolidation). Results suggest that exercise before MP did not additionally improve motor acquisition in comparison to the MP-Rest group. Interestingly, aerobic exercise after MP further increased performance during motor consolidation, at the level of the PP-Rest group. This novel finding represents a promising advance in the optimization of mental practice protocols in sport-related and rehabilitation settings.

                Understanding how motor cortex encodes and decodes behaviors is a fundamental goal of neuroscience, which faces significant challenges because task-relevant neural responses are entangled with considerable task-irrelevant nuisance signals. Due to the entanglement, it is difficult to determine to extract which part and how much neural activity to study neural mechanisms. To cope with this puzzle, current studies usually extract a subset of neural responses that satisfy empirical hypotheses from noisy signals for analysis, which may lead to a one-sided understanding of neural mechanisms. Here we proposed a new perspective --- extracting complete task-relevant signals --- to explore neural mechanisms and offered a distillation framework to distill signals. Analyzing data in three monkeys performing different reaching tasks, distilled task-relevant signals reveal unexpected complex encoding but simple decoding mechanisms in motor cortex.

                Adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) are used in a wide array of experimental situations for driving expression of biosensors, recombinases and opto/chemo-genetic actuators in the brain. However, conventional approaches for minimally invasive, spatially precise and ultra-sparse AAV mediated transduction of cells during imaging experiments, has remained a significant challenge. Here we show that intravenous injection of commercially available AAVs at different doses, combined with laser based perforation of single cortical capillaries through a cranial widow, allows for ultra-sparse, titrate-able, and micron level precision for delivery of viral vectors with relatively little inflammation or tissue damage. Further, we show the utility of this approach for eliciting sparse expression of GCaMP6, channel-rhodopsin or fluorescent reporters in neurons and astrocytes within specific functional domains in normal and stroke damaged cortex. This technique represents a facile approach for targeted delivery of viral vectors that should assist in the study of cell types and circuits in the cerebral cortex.

                Parkinson's disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) are progressive neurodegenerative diseases characterized by the accumulation of misfolded -synuclein in the form of Lewy pathology. While most cases are sporadic, there are rare genetic mutations that cause disease and more common variants that increase incidence of disease. The most prominent genetic mutations for PD and DLB are in the GBA1 and LRRK2 genes. GBA1 mutations are associated with decreased glucocerebrosidase activity and lysosomal accumulation of its lipid substrates, glucosylceramide and glucosylsphingosine. Previous studies have shown a link between this enzyme and lipids even in sporadic PD. However, it is unclear how the protein pathologies of disease are related to enzyme activity and glycosphingolipid levels. To address this gap in knowledge, we examined quantitative protein pathology, glucocerebrosidase activity and lipid substrates in parallel from 4 regions of 91 brains with no neurological disease, idiopathic, GBA1-linked, or LRRK2-linked PD and DLB. We find that several biomarkers are altered with respect to mutation and disease severity. We found mild association of glucocerebrosidase activity with disease, but a strong association of glucosylsphingosine with 8-synuclein pathology, irrespective of genetic mutation. This association suggests that Lewy pathology precipitates changes in lipid levels related to disease severity.

                Background: Intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) is being researched to treat neurological disease or injury. Biomimetic microstimulation, or stimulus trains that mimic neural activity in the brain, made sensations more focal and natural in a human participant, but it is not understood how biomimetic microstimulation affects neural activation. Adaptation (decreases in evoked intensity over time) is also a potential barrier to clinical implementation of sensory feedback, and biomimetic microstimulation may reduce this effect. Objective: We evaluated how biomimetic trains change the calcium response, spatial distribution, and adaptation of neurons in the somatosensory and visual cortices. Methods: Calcium responses of neurons were measured in Layer 2/3 of visual and somatosensory cortices of anesthetized GCaMP6s mice in response to ICMS trains with fixed amplitude and frequency (Fixed) and three biomimetic ICMS trains that increased the stimulation intensity during the onset and offset of stimulation by modulating the amplitude (BioAmp), frequency (BioFreq), or amplitude and frequency (BioBoth). ICMS was provided for either 1-s with 4-s breaks (Short) or for 30-s with 15-s breaks (Long). Results: BioAmp and BioBoth trains evoked distinct onset and offset transients in recruited neurons, while BioFreq trains evoked activity similar to Fixed trains. Biomimetic amplitude reduced adaptation (decreases in evoked calcium intensity) by 14.6 +/- 0.3% for Short and 36.1 +/- 0.6% for Long trains. Ideal observers were 0.031 +/- 0.009s faster for onset detection and 1.33 +/- 0.21s faster for offset detection with biomimetic amplitude. Conclusions: Biomimetic amplitude modulation evokes distinct onset and offset transients, reduces adaptation, and decreases total charge injection for sensory feedback in brain-computer interfaces.

                Intracortical brain-computer interfaces (iBCIs) enable paralyzed persons to generate movement, but current methods require large amounts of both neural and movement-related data to be collected from the iBCI user for supervised decoder training. We hypothesized that the low-dimensional latent neural representations of motor behavior, known to be preserved across time, might also be preserved across individuals, and allow us to circumvent this problem. We trained a decoder to predict the electromyographic (EMG) activity for a 'source' monkey from the latent signals of motor cortex. We then used Canonical Correlation Analysis to align the latent signals of a 'target' monkey to those of the source. These decoders were as accurate across monkeys as they were across sessions for a given monkey. Remarkably, the same process with latent signals from a human participant with tetraplegia was within 90% of the with-monkey decoding across session accuracy. Our findings suggest that consistent representations of motor activity exist across animals and even species. Discovering this common representation is a crucial first step in designing iBCI decoders that perform well without large amounts of data and supervised subject-specific tuning.

                During development, retinal axons create broad and imprecise connections in the thalamus. This topology, very different from adults, supplies developing thalamic neurons with locally homogeneous synaptic currents and should cause spike correlation between thalamocortical neurons on a millisecond timescale. Such correlations have not been observed in vivo, at these ages, and would likely be maladaptive. Here, we use a biophysical model of the visual thalamus with the membrane and synaptic properties of 7-10 day-old mice to show that the developmentally appropriate dominance of NMDA-receptor currents and absence of strong recurrent inhibitory and excitatory connections prevents precise correlation and preserves topographic information in thalamic spikes. We illustrate possible reasons for this desynchronization using a phenomenological cortical model, which shows impaired network diversity when driven with precisely correlated inputs. Our results suggest that developing synapses and circuits evolved mechanisms to compensate for detrimental, "parasitic" correlation arising from the unrefined and immature circuit.

                Psychotic disorders are conceptualized as brain-network diseases and both the cerebellum (CB) and basal ganglia (BG) are implicated in widely used conceptual models. Previous research has focused on these structures and their respective circuits as distinct, however, both are functionally and anatomically connected to each other and to cortical networks via domain-specific, topographically organized thalamo-cortical loops. Currently, it is unclear how CB-BG network dysfunction may play a mechanistic role in the course of psychosis; however, network global efficiency (GE), a measure of functional integration, is a novel approach that aims to represent cognitive and motor CB-BG network (CCBN, MCBN, respectively) connectivity in cross-sectional groups of healthy control (HC), clinical high-risk (CHR), early course psychosis (ECP), and chronic psychosis (CP) participants. We compared network GE between groups and inspected individual differences in CCBN- and MCBN-GE as it relates to group membership and to psychosis symptoms. We also associated CB-BG network GE with cortical network GE. Results indicated that CCBN-GE was associated with cognitive dysfunction and lower in CHR individuals, compared to HC and CP; while MCBN was associated with negative psychosis symptoms. Last, we detailed CB-BG associations with sensory, motor, default mode, and salience networks across groups, with group effects demonstrating complex differences within the ECP group. Findings indicating that CB-BG network dysfunction may play an important role in early pathogenesis and authors argue for CB-BG dysfunction to be analyzed from a network perspective. Future work is needed however to incorporate this approach into our understanding of psychosis.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Encoding of spatial location by frontal orienting field neurons</a></h4>

              
                The neural mechanisms of motor planning have been extensively studied in rodents. Frontal cortical areas seem to encode upcoming choice, but limitations of typical tasks make it challenging to determine whether activity represents a planned movement direction in a self-centered reference frame or a goal position in a world-centered reference frame. Here, we trained rats to make delayed visually-guided orienting movements to six different directions, with four different target positions for each direction, which allowed us to disentangle position versus direction tuning in neural activity. We recorded single unit activity from the rat frontal orienting field (FOF) in secondary motor cortex, a region involved in planning orienting movements. We found neurons in the FOF that were tuned for specific directions of movement and also neurons that fired while animals were at specific port positions. Interestingly, after the visual cue onset, movement direction tuning emerged earlier than target position tuning. At the level of individual neurons, the current head position modulated the planned movement direction as a gain field. These results suggest the FOF participates not only in the motoric processes of sensorimotor behavior, which could happen strictly in egocentric coordinates, but in more complex aspects like reference frame transformation or maintaining a stable model of the world during movements.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Different control strategies drive interlimb differences in performance and adaptation during reaching movements in novel dynamics</a></h4>

              
                Humans exhibit lateralization such that most individuals typically show a preference for using one arm over the other for a range of movement tasks. The computational aspects of movement control leading to these differences in skill are not yet understood. It has been hypothesized that the dominant and non-dominant arms differ in terms of the use of predictive or impedance control mechanisms. However, previous studies present confounding factors that prevented clear conclusions: either the performances were compared across two different groups, or in a design in which asymmetrical transfer between limbs could take place. To address these concerns, we studied a reach adaptation task during which healthy volunteers performed movements with their right and left arms in random order. We performed two experiments. Experiment 1 (18 participants) focused on adaptation to the presence of a perturbing force field and Experiment 2 (12 participants) focused on rapid adaptations in feedback responses. The randomization of the left and right arm led to simultaneous adaptation, allowing us to study lateralization in single individuals with symmetrical and minimal transfer between limbs. This design revealed that participants were able to adapt control of both arms, and that adaptation was greater in the dominant arm than in the non-dominant. We also observed that the non-dominant arm showed a different control strategy compatible with robust control when adapting to the force field perturbation. EMG data showed that these differences in control were not caused by differences in co-contraction across the arms. Thus, instead of assuming differences in predictive or reactive control schemes, our data show that in the context of optimal control, both arms can adapt, and that the non-dominant arm uses a more robust, model-free strategy likely to compensate for less accurate internal representations of movement dynamics.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Hemodynamic timing in resting-state and breathing-task BOLD fMRI</a></h4>

              
                The blood flow response to a vasoactive stimulus demonstrates regional heterogeneity across both the healthy brain and in cerebrovascular pathology. The timing of a regional hemodynamic response is emerging as an important biomarker of cerebrovascular dysfunction, as well as a methodological confound within fMRI analyses. Previous research demonstrated that hemodynamic timing is more robustly characterized when a larger systemic vascular response is evoked by a breathing challenge, compared to when only spontaneous fluctuations in vascular physiology are present (i.e., in resting-state data). However, it is not clear whether hemodynamic delays in these two conditions are physiologically interchangeable, and how methodological signal-to-noise factors may limit their agreement. To address this, we generated whole-brain maps of hemodynamic delays in nine healthy adults. We assessed the agreement of voxelwise gray matter (GM) hemodynamic delays between two conditions: resting-state and breath-holding. We found that delay values demonstrated poor agreement when considering all GM voxels, but increasingly greater agreement when limiting analyses to voxels showing strong correlation with the GM mean time-series. Voxels showing the strongest agreement with the GM mean time-series were primarily located near large venous vessels, however these voxels explain some, but not all, of the observed agreement in timing. Increasing the degree of spatial smoothing of the fMRI data enhanced the correlation between individual voxel time-series and the GM mean time-series and did not substantially change the agreement in hemodynamic timing as a function of this relationship strength. These results suggest that signal-to-noise factors may be limiting the accuracy of voxelwise timing estimates and hence their agreement between the two data segments. In conclusion, caution must be taken when using voxelwise delay estimates from resting-state and breathing-task data interchangeably, and additional work is needed to evaluate their relative sensitivity and specificity to aspects of vascular physiology and pathology.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Central extended amygdala neurons in the development of activity-based anorexia</a></h4>

              
                Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a serious psychiatric disease characterized by restricted eating, fear of gaining weight, as well as excessive exercise, and also is often comorbid with emotional disorders such as anxiety and depression. However, the etiology of AN is unknown and the neural mechanism that leads to AN remains to be determined. Here, we show that a specific subpopulation of neurons, marked by the expression of protein kinase C-delta (PKC-{delta}), in two nuclei of the central extended amygdala (EAc)-central nucleus (CeA) and oval region of bed nucleus of stria terminalis (ovBNST)-regulates development of activity-based anorexia (ABA), the current best animal model of AN. Specifically, simultaneous dual ablation of CeAPKC-{delta} and ovBNSTPKC-{delta} neurons prevents the key phenotypes of ABA: increases in wheel activity, decreases in food intake, and life-threatening body weight loss. However, ablating PKC-{delta} neurons in CeA or ovBNST alone is not sufficient to prevent ABA. Correspondingly, activation of PKC-{delta} neurons in one type of nuclei continues to suppress food intake even when PKC-{delta} neurons in the other nuclei are silenced. Consistent with their role in suppressing food intake when activated, these PKC-{delta} neurons show increased activity with ABA development. Together, our study illuminates how neurons in the amygdala regulate ABA development and supports the complex and heterogenous etiology of AN.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Pilot MRI study of carbon monoxide (CO) against ischemic stroke in mice: blood brain barrier integrity and metabolic pattern</a></h4>

              
                Although stroke is the main cause of brain damage worldwide, stroke therapies are based on blood reperfusion and do not target cerebral parenchyma. Ischemic stroke (representing 87% of all strokes) causes cerebral damage due to oxygen and tissue energy depletion, which lead to acidosis, inflammation, excitotoxicity and oxidative stress. Carbon monoxide (CO) is an endogenous gasotransmitter produced by heme oxygenase cleavage of the heme group. CO promotes cytoprotection by limiting inflammation and preventing cell death in several tissues including the brain. Previous studies have demonstrated the protective role of CO in the mouse ischemic stroke model, middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) by histological analysis when CO is when applied before ischemia. Herein, there are two main novelties. First CO is administrated following stroke, which better mimics its potential future use as therapeutic drug. Secondly, imaging techniques were used to elucidate the effect of this gasotransmitter at the metabolic, vascular and anatomic levels. The putative neuroprotective effects of CO following MCAo were assessed by 3 i.p. injections of the CO-releasing molecule CORM-A1 (3 mg/kg), administered 6, 24 and 48h after reperfusion. Magnetic Resonance Imaging was performed 1 day and 7 days after reperfusion using T2-weighted, diffusion weighted images, proton spectroscopy (1H-MRS) and perfusion (dynamic contrast enhanced images). 1H-MRS also allowed the comparison between metabolite signatures at day 1 versus 7 day following MCAo. Furthermore, CORM-A1 limited the loss of blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity as it reduced the edema formation. Furthermore, the CO donor minimized the metabolite load loss at an early stage after MCAo, both in striatum and cortex. In conclusion and based on MRI analysis, CO has a protective role in the recovery from stroke injury, mainly by acting on BBB integrity and brain metabolism.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Can the brain strategically go on automatic pilot? An fMRI study investigating the effect of if-then planning on behavioral flexibility</a></h4>

              
                People often have good intentions but fail to adhere to them. Implementation intentions, a form of strategic planning, can help people to close this intention-behavior gap. Their effectiveness has been proposed to depend on the mental formation of a stimulus-response association between a trigger and target behavior, thereby creating an instant habit. If implementation intentions do indeed lead to reliance on habitual control, then this may come at the cost of reduced behavioral flexibility. Furthermore, we would expect a shift from recruitment of corticostriatal brain regions implicated in goal-directed control towards habit regions. To test these ideas, we performed a functional MRI study in which participants received instrumental training supported by either implementation or goal intentions, followed by an outcome-revaluation to test reliance on habitual versus goal-directed control. We found that implementation intentions led to increased efficiency during training, as reflected in higher accuracy, faster reaction times, and decreased engagement of the anterior caudate. However, implementation intentions did not reduce behavioral flexibility when goals changed during the test phase, nor did it affect the underlying corticostriatal pathways. Additionally, this study showed that slips of action towards devalued outcomes are associated with reduced activity in brain regions implicated in goal-directed control. In conclusion, our behavioral and neuroimaging findings suggest that strategic if-then planning does not lead to a shift from goal-directed towards habitual control.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Off-Vertical Body Orientation Delays the Perceived Onset of Visual Motion</a></h4>

              
                The integration of vestibular, visual and body cues is a fundamental process in the perception of self-motion and is commonly experienced in an upright posture. However, when the body is tilted in an off-vertical orientation these signals are no longer aligned relative to the influence of gravity. In this study, sensory conflict with the vestibular signal was introduced by manipulating the orientation of the body, generating a mismatch between body and vestibular cues due to gravity in the perception of upright and creating an ambiguous vestibular signal of either head tilt or translation. In a series of temporal-order judgment tasks, participants reported the perceived onset of a visual scene simulating rotation around the yaw axis presented in virtual reality with a paired auditory tone while in an upright, supine and side recumbent body positions. The results revealed that the perceived onset of visual motion was further delayed from zero (i.e., true simultaneity between visual onset and a reference auditory tone) by approximately an additional 30ms when viewed in a supine or side recumbent orientation compared to an upright posture. There were also no significant differences in the timing estimates of the visual motion between all the non-upright orientations. This indicates that the perceived timing of visual motion is negatively impacted by the presence of conflict in the vestibular and body signals due to the direction of gravity and body orientation, even when the mismatch is not in the direct plane of the axis of rotation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Brain-wide representations of behavior spanning multiple timescales and states in C. elegans</a></h4>

              
                Changes in an animal's behavior and internal state are accompanied by widespread changes in activity across its brain. However, how neurons across the brain encode behavior and how this is impacted by state is poorly understood. We recorded brain-wide activity and the diverse motor programs of freely-moving C. elegans and built probabilistic models that explain how each neuron encodes quantitative features of the animal's behavior. By determining the identities of the recorded neurons, we created, for the first time, an atlas of how the defined neuron classes in the C. elegans connectome encode behavior. Many neuron classes have conjunctive representations of multiple behaviors. Moreover, while many neurons encode current motor actions, others encode recent actions. Changes in behavioral state are accompanied by widespread changes in how neurons encode behavior, and we identify these flexible nodes in the connectome. Our results provide a global map of how the cell types across an animal's brain encode its behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Motion-Induced Blindness as a Noisy Excitable System</a></h4>

              
                Perceptual disappearance of a salient target induced by a moving texture mask (MIB: Motion Induced Blindness) is a striking effect that is currently poorly understood. Here we investigated whether the mechanisms underlying MIB qualify as an excitable system. Excitable systems exhibit fast switches from one state to another (e.g., visible/invisible) induced by an above threshold perturbation and stimulus-independent dynamics, followed by a refractory period. In the experiments, disappearance was induced by masks consisting of slowly rotating radial bars with a gap at the target location, leading to periodic perturbation of the visual field around the target (a bright parafoveal spot). Only when the bars passed around the target location did they induce an abrupt target disappearance, independent of the rotation speed (up to 90%, depending on the condition, ~0% without bars), pointing to locality. The distribution of invisible periods is well described as the sum of two random variables: Gamma and Gaussian distributed. As expected from excitable systems, the disappearance time was not affected by additional bars crossing the target during invisibility. After the target reappeared, it stayed for at least 0.5-2 sec (the refractory period). Overall, slowly moving bars are very good inducers of perceptual disappearance when the targets are visible, whereas they hardly affect an invisible target. The periods of invisibility lasted a few seconds, showing little dependence on the mask configuration. Therefore, the mechanisms governing MIB represent an example of an excitable system where the transition to the invisible state is induced by the mask, with the dynamics that follow determined mostly by the internal network properties. The implementation of such systems usually requires two components with substantially different time scales, such as adaptation and inhibition.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Consequences of blindness for neural dynamics in mouse visual cortex</a></h4>

              
                Early-life blindness causes lasting visual impairment, for which the circuit basis is only partially understood. Degradation of visual connections as well as the network dynamics supporting neural oscillations and arousal states are likely contributors. To define how blindness affects dynamics, we examined the effects of two forms of blindness, bilateral loss of retinal input (enucleation) and degradation of visual input (eyelid-suture), on emergent network properties and their state-dependence in the visual cortex of awake head-fixed mice. Neither form of early visual deprivation fundamentally altered the state-dependent regulation of firing-rates or local field potential oscillations. However, each form of deprivation did cause a unique set of changes in network behavior. Enucleation caused a loss of low-frequency synchronization specifically during movement, suggesting a mouse model for human alpha oscillations. Neurons were also less correlated and fired more regularly, with no change in mean firing rates. Chronic lid-suture decreased firing rates during quiet-wakefulness, but not during movement, and had no effect on neural correlations or firing regularity. Sutured animals also had a broadband increase in LFP power and increased occurrence, but reduced central frequency, of narrowband gamma oscillations. The complementary, rather than additive, effects of lid-suture vs.enucleation suggest that the development of these emergent network properties does not require vision but is plastic to modified input. Our results suggest that the etiology of human blindness will be a crucial determinant of circuit pathology and its capacity to respond to clinical interventions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Comparing models of information transfer in the structural brain network and their relationship to functional connectivity: Diffusion versus shortest path routing</a></h4>

              
                In the field of neuroscience, researchers are tasked with the enormous question of how and why this critical organ containing vast numbers of neurons and synapses is able to produce the complex range of functional outputs that make up the human experience. In particular, the relationship between structural and functional connectivity in the human brain is a core question in network neuroscience, and a topic of paramount importance to our ability to meaningfully describe and predict individual functional outcomes. Graph theory has been used in past research to successfully produce measures based on the structural connectivity network that are related to the functional connectivity. These measures are commonly based on either the shortest path routing model or the diffusion model, which both carry distinct assumptions about how information transfers through the network. Namely, shortest path routing assumes that when information is sent from one node to another, the shortest and most efficient path is always known. Conversely, the diffusion model makes no such assumption, and lets information travel in parallel based on the number of connections to other regions. Past research has also developed hybrid measures that use concepts from both models, which have been shown to better predict the functional connectivity from structural connectivity than shortest path length alone. Here, we take the next step in this line of research by examining to what extent each of these models can account for the structure-function relationship of interest using measures that are exclusively diffusion based and exclusively shortest path routing based, in order to elucidate whether one set of assumptions is better suited to describing the structure-function relationship in the human brain.

                Being the most sophisticated information processing apparatus known to us, understanding the brain offers great possibilities. A viable candidate to advance the understanding of this cortical information processing machine is information theory. With its universal applicability, it enables the modeling of complex systems, is free of any requirements about the data structure and can infer the present underlying brain mechanisms. Algorithmic information theory seems particularly suitable since it can estimate the information contained in individual brain responses. Here, we propose a measure grounded in algorithmic information theory termed Encoded Information as a novel approach to analyze neurophysiological recordings. Specifically, it enables an assessment of the encoded information mean responses share with one another by compressing the respective signals. By applying the approach to five cortical activity types originating from intracranial electroencephalography recordings of humans and marmoset monkeys, we demonstrate that the information-based encoding can compete with conventional approaches such as the t-test or mutual information. Information-based encoding is attractive whenever one is interested in detecting where in the brain the neural responses differ across experimental conditions.

	<p>Fatigue is a debilitating and prevalent symptom of multiple sclerosis (MS). The thalamus is atrophied at an earlier stage of MS and although the role of the thalamus in the pathophysiology of MS-related fatigue has been reported, there have been few studies on intra-thalamic changes. We investigated the alterations of thalamic nuclei volumes and the intrinsic thalamic network in people with MS presenting fatigue (F-MS). The network metrics comprised the clustering coefficient (Cp), characteristic path length (Lp), small-world index (&amp;amp;sigma;), local efficiency (Eloc), global efficiency (Eglob), and nodal metrics. Volumetric analysis revealed that the right anteroventral, right central lateral, right lateral geniculate, right pulvinar anterior, left pulvinar medial, and left pulvinar inferior nuclei were atrophied only in the F-MS group. Furthermore, the F-MS group had significantly increased Lp compared to people with MS not presenting fatigue (NF-MS) (2.9674 vs. 2.4411, PAUC = 0.038). The F-MS group had significantly decreased nodal efficiency and betweenness centrality of the right mediodorsal medial magnocellular nucleus than the NF-MS group (false discovery rate corrected p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). The F-MS patients exhibited more atrophied thalamic nuclei, poorer network global functional integration, and disrupted right mediodorsal medial magnocellular nuclei interconnectivity with other nuclei. These findings might aid the elucidation of the underlying pathogenesis of MS-related fatigue.</p>

	<p>Activities of daily living consist of accurate, coordinated movements, which require the upper limbs to constantly interact with environmental loads. The magnitude of the load was shown to affect kinematic outcomes in healthy subjects. Moreover, the increase in load facilitates the recovery of motor function in patients with neurological disorders. Although Brodmann Areas 4 and 6 were found to be active during loaded movements, it remains unclear whether stronger activation can be triggered simply by increasing the load magnitude. If such a linear relationship exists, it may provide a basis for the closed-loop adjustment of treatment plans in neurorehabilitation. Fourteen healthy participants were instructed to lift their hands to their armpits. The movements were grouped in blocks of 25 s. Each block was assigned a magnitude of inertial loads, either 0 pounds (bare hand), 3 pounds, or 15 pounds. Hemodynamic fNIRS signals were recorded throughout the experiment. Both channel-wise and ROI-wise analyses found significant activations against all three magnitudes of inertia. The generalized linear model revealed significant increases in the beta coefficient of 0.001673/pound in BA4 and 0.001338/pound in BA6. The linear trend was stronger in BA6 (conditional r2 = 0.9218) than in BA4 (conditional r2 = 0.8323).</p>

	<p>The neurophysiological processes underlying the priming effects of motor imagery (MI) on force performance remain poorly understood. Here, we tested whether the priming effects of embedded MI practice involved short-term changes in corticomotor connectivity. In a within-subjects counterbalanced experimental design, participants (n = 20) underwent a series of experimental sessions consisting of successive maximal isometric contractions of elbow flexor muscles. During inter-trial rest periods, we administered MI, action observation (AO), and a control passive recovery condition. We collected electromyograms (EMG) from both agonists and antagonists of the force task, in addition to electroencephalographic (EEG) brain potentials during force trials. Force output was higher during MI compared to AO and control conditions (both p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01), although fatigability was similar across experimental conditions. We also found a weaker relationship between triceps brachii activation and force output during MI and AO compared to the control condition. Imaginary coherence topographies of alpha (8&amp;amp;ndash;12 Hz) oscillations revealed increased connectivity between EEG sensors from central scalp regions and EMG signals from agonists during MI, compared to AO and control. Present results suggest that the priming effects of MI on force performance are mediated by a more efficient cortical drive to motor units yielding reduced agonist/antagonist coactivation.</p>

	<p>Childhood maltreatment may alter fear neurocircuitry, which results in pathological anxiety and depression. One alteration of fear-related behaviors that has been observed in several psychiatric populations is an overgeneralization of fear. Thus, we examined the association between childhood maltreatment and fear generalization in a non-clinical sample of young adults. Two hundred and ninety-one participants underwent differential fear conditioning in a fear-potentiated startle paradigm. One visual stimulus (CS+), but not another (CS&amp;amp;minus;), was associated with an aversive airblast to the throat (US) during acquisition. The next day, participants were tested for their fear responses to the CS+, CS&amp;amp;minus;, and several generalization stimuli (GS) without the presence of the US. Participants also completed questionnaires that assessed symptoms of childhood maltreatment, anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Participants reporting high childhood maltreatment (n = 71; 23 males, 48 females) exhibited significantly greater anxiety, depression, and symptoms of PTSD than participants reporting low childhood maltreatment (n = 220; 133 males, 87 females). Females reporting high childhood maltreatment demonstrated significantly enhanced fear learning and greater fear generalization, based on their fear-potentiated startle responses. Our findings suggest that childhood maltreatment may sex-dependently influence the development of fear neurocircuitry and result in greater fear generalization in maltreated females.</p>

	<p>In the present investigation we adopted the Rapid Parallel Visual Presentation Paradigm with the aim of studying the timing of parafoveal semantic processing. The paradigm consisted in the simultaneous presentation of couple of words, one in fovea (W1) and one in parafovea (W2). In three experiments, we manipulated word frequency, semantic relatedness between the two words and the effect of stimulus duration (150, 100, 50 ms). Accuracy on W2 was higher when W1 and W2 were both of high-frequency and when they were semantically related. W1 reading times were faster when both words were highly-frequent but only when the two words were semantically related (150 ms); when W2 was highly frequent and semantically related to the foveal word (100 ms). When the stimuli were presented for 50 ms, the reading times were reduced when W1 was highly frequent and, crucially, in case of a semantic relation between the two words. Our results suggest that it is possible to extract semantic information from the parafovea very fast (within 100 ms) and in parallel to the processing of the foveal word, especially when the cognitive load required for the latter is reduced, as is the case for high-frequency words. We discuss the resulting data in terms of word recognition and eye movements&amp;amp;rsquo; models.</p>

	<p>It is commonly believed that alertness and attention decrease after sleep deprivation (SD). However, there are not enough studies on the changes in psychomotor vigilance testing (PVT) during SD and the corresponding changes in brain function and brain structure after SD. Therefore, we recruited 30 healthy adult men to perform a 36 h acute SD experiment, including the measurement of five indicators of PVT every 2 h, and analysis of cerebral blood flow (CBF) and grey matter volume (GMV) changes, before and after SD by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The PVT measurement found that the mean reaction time (RT), fastest 10% RT, minor lapses, and false starts all increased progressively within 20 h of SD, except for major lapses. Subsequently, all indexes showed a significant lengthening or increasing trend, and the peak value was in the range of 24 h-32 h and decreased at 36 h, in which the number of major lapses returned to normal. MRI showed that CBF decreased in the left orbital part of the superior frontal gyrus, the left of the rolandic operculum, the left triangular part, and the right opercular part of the inferior frontal gyrus, and CBF increased in the left lingual gyrus and the right superior gyrus after 36 h SD. The left lingual gyrus was negatively correlated with the major lapses, and both the inferior frontal gyrus and the superior frontal gyrus were positively correlated with the false starts. Still, there was no significant change in GMV. Therefore, we believe that 36 h of acute SD causes alterations in brain function and reduces alert attention, whereas short-term acute SD does not cause changes in brain structure.</p>

	<p>Background: The phenotypic expression of 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2DS) is variable and may include cognitive, psychiatric, and neurological manifestations, e.g., parkinsonism. We investigated brain structural alterations in patients with 22q11.2DS with and without parkinsonism (Park+ and Park&amp;amp;minus;) in comparison with healthy controls (HCs). Methods: Voxel-based morphometry was performed on 3D T1-weighted MR images to explore gray matter volume (GMV) differences between 29 patients (15 Park+, 14 Park&amp;amp;minus;), selected from a consecutive series of 56 adults diagnosed with 22q11.2DS, and 24 HCs. One-way ANOVA and multiple linear regression analyses were performed to explore group differences in GMV and correlations between clinical scores (MDS-UPDR-III and MoCA scores) and structural alterations. Results: Significant between-group differences in GMV were found in the cerebellum, specifically in bilateral lobes VIII and left Crus II, as well as in the left superior occipital gyrus. Although both Park+ and Park&amp;amp;minus; patients showed GMV decrements in these regions with respect to HCs, GMV loss in the right lobe VIII and left Crus II was greater in Park+ than in Park&amp;amp;minus; patients. GMV loss did not correlate with clinical scores. Conclusions: Patients with 22q11.2DS and parkinsonism manifest specific cerebellar volume alterations, supporting the hypothesis of neurodegenerative processes in specific cerebellar regions as a putative pathophysiological mechanism responsible for parkinsonism in patients with 22q11.2DS.</p>

	<p>Upper limb control depends on accurate internal models of limb position relative to the head and neck, accurate sensory inputs, and accurate cortical processing. Transient alterations in neck afferent feedback induced by muscle vibration may impact upper limb proprioception. This research aimed to determine the effects of neck muscle vibration on upper limb proprioception using a novel elbow repositioning task (ERT). 26 right-handed participants aged 22.21 &amp;amp;plusmn; 2.64 performed the ERT consisting of three target angles between 80&amp;amp;ndash;90&amp;amp;deg; (T1), 90&amp;amp;ndash;100&amp;amp;deg; (T2) and 100&amp;amp;ndash;110&amp;amp;deg; (T3). Controls (CONT) (n = 13, 6F) received 10 min of rest and the vibration group (VIB) (n = 13, 6F) received 10 min of 60 Hz vibration over the right sternocleidomastoid and left cervical extensor muscles. Task performance was reassessed following experimental manipulation. Significant time by group interactions occurred for T1: (F1,24 = 25.330, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001, &amp;amp;eta;p2 = 0.513) where CONT improved by 26.08% and VIB worsened by 134.27%, T2: (F1,24 = 16.157, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001, &amp;amp;eta;p2 = 0.402) where CONT improved by 20.39% and VIB worsened by 109.54%, and T3: (F1,24 = 21.923, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001, &amp;amp;eta;p2 = 0.447) where CONT improved by 37.11% and VIB worsened by 54.39%. Improvements in repositioning accuracy indicates improved proprioceptive ability with practice in controls. Decreased accuracy following vibration suggests that vibration altered proprioceptive inputs used to construct body schema, leading to inaccurate joint position sense and the observed changes in elbow repositioning accuracy.</p>

	<p>The COVID-19 virus frequently causes neurological complications. These have been described in various forms in adults and children. Headache, seizures, coma, and encephalitis are some of the manifestations of SARS-CoV-2-induced neurological impairment. Recent publications have revealed important aspects of viral pathophysiology and its involvement in nervous-system impairment in humans. We evaluated the latest literature describing the relationship between COVID-19 infection and the central nervous system. We searched three databases for observational and interventional studies in adults published between December 2019 and September 2022. We discussed in narrative form the neurological impairment associated with COVID-19, including clinical signs and symptoms, imaging abnormalities, and the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV2-induced neurological damage.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Coordinated Regulation of CB1 Cannabinoid Receptors and Anandamide Metabolism Stabilizes Network Activity during Homeostatic Downscaling</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Neurons express overlapping homeostatic mechanisms to regulate synaptic function and network properties in response to perturbations of neuronal activity. Endocannabinoids (eCBs) are bioactive lipids synthesized in the postsynaptic compartments to regulate synaptic transmission, plasticity, and neuronal excitability primarily through retrograde activation of presynaptic cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1). The eCB system is well situated to regulate neuronal network properties and coordinate presynaptic and postsynaptic activity. However, the role of the eCB system in homeostatic adaptations to neuronal hyperactivity is unknown. To address this issue, we used Western blotting and targeted lipidomics to measure adaptations in eCB system to bicuculline (BCC)-induced chronic hyperexcitation in mature cultured rat cortical neurons, and used multielectrode array (MEA) recording and live-cell imaging of glutamate dynamics to test the effects of pharmacological manipulations of eCB on network activities. We show that BCC-induced chronic hyperexcitation triggers homeostatic downscaling and a coordinated adaptation to enhance tonic eCB signaling. Hyperexcitation triggers first the downregulation of fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), the lipase that degrades the eCB anandamide, then an accumulation of anandamide and related metabolites, and finally a delayed upregulation of surface and total CB1. Additionally, we show that BCC-induced downregulation of surface AMPA-type glutamate receptors (AMPARs) and upregulation of CB1 occur through independent mechanisms. Finally, we show that endocannabinoids support baseline network activities before and after downscaling and is engaged to suppress network activity during adaptation to hyperexcitation. We discuss the implications of our findings in the context of downscaling and homeostatic regulation of <I>in vitro</I> oscillatory network activities.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Cortico-Subthalamic Field Potentials Support Classification of the Natural Gait Cycle in Parkinsons Disease and Reveal Individualized Spectral Signatures</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>The ability of humans to coordinate stereotyped, alternating movements between the two legs during bipedal walking is a complex motor behavior that requires precisely timed activities across multiple nodes of the supraspinal network. Understanding of the neural network dynamics that underlie natural walking in humans is limited. We investigated cortical and subthalamic neural activities during overground walking and evaluated spectral biomarkers to decode the gait cycle in three patients with Parkinson&rsquo;s disease without gait disturbances. Patients were implanted with chronic bilateral deep brain stimulation (DBS) leads in the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and electrocorticography paddles overlaying the primary motor and somatosensory cortices. Local field potentials were recorded from these areas while the participants performed overground walking and synchronized to external gait kinematic sensors. We found that the STN displays increased low-frequency (4&ndash;12 Hz) spectral power during the period before contralateral leg swing. Furthermore, STN shows increased theta frequency (4&ndash;8 Hz) coherence with the primary motor through the initiation and early phase of contralateral leg swing. Additional analysis revealed that each patient had specific frequency bands that could detect a significant difference between left and right initial leg swing. Our findings indicate that there are alternating spectral changes between the two hemispheres in accordance with the gait cycle. In addition, we identified patient-specific, gait-related biomarkers in both the STN and cortical areas at discrete frequency bands that may be used to drive adaptive DBS to improve gait dysfunction in patients with Parkinson&rsquo;s disease.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Case Report: Two-year consequences of barium sulfate aspiration [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Aspiration of barium contrast is a rare, but well-known, event occurring during examinations of the upper gastrointestinal system using contrast media. We present a case of large-volume high-concentration barium sulfate aspiration in an 88-year-old male diagnosed with dysphagia, during the swallowing study. He rapidly developed difficulty in breathing, hypoxemia and chemical pneumonitis. The chest radiograph showed the infiltration of barium contrast at both sides with left lower lung predominance. His lowest oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry was 91%. His condition improved with supportive care including oxygen therapy. The patient was finally discharged a few days later with normal oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry. The follow-up chest radiograph at 2 years after the aspiration showed considerable interval clearing of the aspirated contrast material. The plasma and urine barium concentrations at 2 years after the aspiration were <0.5 μg/L and 13.6 μg/L, respectively. Currently, there is no reference urine barium level in the Thai population. These finding may be partially explained by our patient’s exposure of barium from food or water or might be gradually absorbed systemically from the residual barium in lungs.

                Introduction: Health literacy on the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) affects people’s capability to ascertain their health and health care quality during the pandemic. The objective of this study was to determine the levels of health literacy about COVID-19 vaccines and vaccinations (Vaccines and Vaccinations literacy-VL) in the Indonesian adult general population, assessing the perceptions of the respondents about current adult immunization and beliefs about vaccinations in general, and analyzing correlations of these variables with the VL levels. Methods: A cross-sectional study using a rapid survey was administered via the Internet. Data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics; the internal consistency of the VL scales was evaluated using Cronbach’s alpha coefficient; the inter-correlation between the functional and interactive-critical VL questions, the underlying components (factors) and each question’s load on the components were identified using a Principal Component Analysis (PCA). An alpha level lesser than 0.05 was considered significant. Results: Responses to functional- and interactive/ critical- VL questions were acceptable and showed internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.817 and 0.699, respectively), lowest values observed were 0.806 for functional scale and 0.640 for the interactive-critical scale. The PCA demonstrated that there were two components accounting for 52.45% of the total variability. Approximately 60% of respondents were females (n=686). Almost all respondents used the internet to seek information regarding COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccinations. Many used at least one social media actively with 74.4% of respondents sometimes believing the validity of this information. Conclusions: High scores were observed in both functional- and interactive/ critical-VL, and were quite in a balance between sexes in the prior VL and higher in females for the latter; these were also closely related to the educational level and age group. It is crucial to increase public health literacy in managing the pandemic.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Development of phase change materials for low-temperature thermal energy storage application [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Energy storage is very critical for reducing the mismatch between demand and supply thus offering better management capabilities. It reduces the peak energy demand and increases efficiency, security, and reliability. There is unavailability of low-cost phase change materials (PCMs) in the lower temperature range. Methods: This study discusses the creation of eutectic from capric acid and paraffin wax. A series of blending of capric acid/paraffin wax (CA/PW) were prepared, having variable weight-composition. The thermophysical properties were obtained using differential scanning calorimetry, Further, thermal cycle testing was done to understand the thermal stability and reliability of the prepared eutectics. Results: The area underneath the peak is used to calculate the latent heat of fusion, and the tangent of the steepest slope at the peak of the crest is used to calculate the melting temperature (Tm). Differential scanning calorimetry results showed the developed eutectic had an appropriate melting temperature and adequate latent heat of fusion of 29.86 °C - 30.60 °C and 154.15–198.62 kJ/kg respectively, and can be used for various thermal energy storage applications in buildings, solar absorption chillers, surgical dress/clinical bed, and photovoltaic systems. Conclusions: The accelerated thermal cycle of the same confirmed its thermal stability up to 500 heating and cooling cycles. It was discovered that variable heating and cooling speeds had no significant influence on the melting temperature and latent heat of fusion of PW/CA eutectics. Further, the economic study revealed that the created PCM is inexpensive and readily available in the Indian market.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Assessing the potential relevance of CEACAM6 as a blood transcriptional biomarker [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Changes in blood transcript abundance levels have been associated with pathogenesis in a wide range of diseases. While next generation sequencing technology can measure transcript abundance on a genome-wide scale, downstream clinical applications often require small sets of genes to be selected for inclusion in targeted panels. Here we set out to gather information from the literature and transcriptome datasets that would help researchers determine whether to include the gene CEACAM6 in such panels. Methods We employed a workflow to systematically retrieve, structure, and aggregate information derived from both the literature and public transcriptome datasets. It consisted of profiling the CEACAM6 literature to identify major diseases associated with this candidate gene and establish its relevance as a biomarker. Accessing blood transcriptome datasets identified additional instances where CEACAM6 transcript levels differ in cases vs controls. Finally, the information retrieved throughout this process was captured in a structured format and aggregated in interactive circle packing plots. Results Although it is not routinely used clinically, the relevance of CEACAM6 as a biomarker has already been well-established in the cancer field, where it has invariably been found to be associated with poor prognosis. Focusing on the blood transcriptome literature, we found studies reporting elevated levels of CEACAM6 abundance across a wide range of pathologies, especially diseases where inflammation plays a dominant role, such as asthma, psoriasis, or Parkinson’s disease. The screening of public blood transcriptome datasets completed this picture, showing higher abundance levels in patients with infectious diseases caused by viral and bacterial pathogens. Conclusions Targeted assays measuring CEACAM6 transcript abundance in blood may be of potential utility for the management of patients with diseases presenting with systemic inflammation and for the management of patients with cancer, where the assay could potentially be run both on blood and tumor tissues.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Clinical spectrum and short-term outcome of post-COVID multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children after the 2019 pandemic: a longitudinal cohort study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background As a post-COVID complication in children, multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is important because of its varied and life-threatening manifestations. With this background, this study attempts to focus on MIS-C cases in an underprivileged rural setting in north-eastern India, with most patients being treated with methylprednisolone rather than intravenous immunoglobulin due to financial constraints. Methods In this prospective longitudinal cohort study at MGM Medical College, 27 MIS-C cases diagnosed following WHO criteria were included. Laboratory and radiological investigations, including echocardiography, were performed as required for diagnosis and to assess prognosis. Most patients were treated with methylprednisolone. A follow-up assessment was done six weeks after discharge for any residual impairment. Results The most frequently affected age group was 5–10 years (59.28%), while respiratory (48.14%) and cardiac (40.74%) were the most commonly involved systems. Logistic regression studies established a significant association between serum ferritin level and prolonged hospital stay (coefficient 0.0674, p=0.0041), possibly due to greater complications in cases with high ferritin levels. Organ impairment was found to increase the need for inotrope use (coefficient 3.8797, p=0.00584). Most cases were treated with methylprednisolone alone (85.18%) with a favourable response and no death occurred. Conclusion The favourable response in cases treated with methylprednisolone only affirms the effectiveness of the drug as a cheaper alternative in a resource-poor setting. The study highlights that higher ferritin levels in complicated cases leads to prolonged hospitalisation and the increased need for inotropes in cases with organ impairment.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Analysis of energy storage materials for developments in solar cookers [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Solar energy is accessible freely and can be utilized for many household and industrial applications. The consumption of solar energy for cooking applications has found significant success. Various innovations have been employed in facilitating cooking during off-sunshine hours. Thermal energy storage helps in overcoming the fluctuations in the supply of energy required for cooking during different time periods of the day. This study focuses on the different types of thermal energy storage mediums that are currently utilized in solar cooking. Primarily, oils and pebbles are most commonly used as sensible heat storage (SHS) while organic phase change materials (PCMs) are used as latent heat thermal energy storage materials (LHTES). The properties and performances of various SHS and latent heat storage (LHS) mediums have been compared for their suitable utilization. SHS materials are cost-effective but have lower thermal gradient compared to LHTES materials. The energy storage capability of LHTES is high while degradation with the increasing number of charging and discharging cycles is also considerable. The melting point should be close to the utilization temperature for being used as LHTES as thermal diffusivity of the materials greatly influences the performance of solar cookers. The cooking time is lower for solar cooking systems equipped with energy storage compared to non-equipped cooking systems. It is recognized that the use of energy storage has been proved as a huge advantage to solar cooking systems, however, the design, and heat transfer characteristics of the cooking vessel along with the storage material type and volume must be optimized in order to make this technology more influential.

                There is active debate on the role of dopamine in processing aversive stimuli, where inferred roles range from no involvement at all, to signaling an aversive prediction error (APE). Here, we systematically investigate dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens core (NAC), which is closely linked to reward prediction errors, in rats exposed to white noise (WN, a versatile, underutilized, aversive stimulus) and its predictive cues. Both induced a negative dopamine ramp, followed by slow signal recovery upon stimulus cessation. In contrast to reward conditioning, this dopamine signal was unaffected by WN value, context valence, or probabilistic contingencies, and the WN dopamine response shifted only partially toward its predictive cue. However, unpredicted WN provoked slower post-stimulus signal recovery than predicted WN. Despite differing signal qualities, dopamine responses to simultaneous presentation of rewarding and aversive stimuli were additive. Together, our findings demonstrate that instead of an APE, NAC dopamine primarily tracks prediction and duration of aversive events.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Nucleus accumbens dopamine release reflects the selective nature of pair bonds</a></h4>

              
                In monogamous species, prosocial behaviors directed towards partners are dramatically different from those directed towards unknown individuals and potential threats. Dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens plays an important role in guiding social behavior, however, its role in real time social decision making in a monogamous species remains largely unknown. We used monogamous prairie voles to investigate how dopamine release differs in voles when seeking and interacting with a pair bonded partner or a novel vole. Employing the sub-second temporal resolution of the fluorescent biosensor, GRABDA, during a social operant task, we found that partner seeking, anticipation, and interaction resulted in more dopamine release than the same events directed towards a novel vole. Furthermore, partner-elicited dopamine release decreases after prolonged partner separation. Thus, differences in partner- and novel-elicited dopamine release reflect the selective nature of pair bonds and may drive the social behaviors that reinforce and cement bonds over time, eroding after partner loss to facilitate new bond formation.

                Emotional responses arise from limbic circuits including the hippocampus and amygdala. In the human brain, beta-frequency communication between these structures correlates with self-reported mood and anxiety. However, both the mechanism and significance of this biomarker as a readout vs. driver of emotional state remain unknown. Here we show that beta-frequency communication between the ventral hippocampus and basolateral amygdala also predicts anxiety-related behavior in mice on both long timescales (~30 min) and immediately preceding behavioral choices. Genetically encoded voltage indicators reveal that this biomarker reflects synchronization between somatostatin interneurons across both structures. Indeed, synchrony between these neurons dynamically predicts approach vs. avoidance, and optogenetically shifting this synchronization by just 25 msec is sufficient to bidirectionally modulate anxiety-related behaviors. Thus, back-translation establishes a human biomarker as a causal determinant (not just predictor) of emotional state, revealing a novel mechanism whereby interregional synchronization that is frequency-, phase- and cell type-specific controls anxiety processing.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Auditory cortex encodes lipreading information through spatially distributed activity</a></h4>

              
                Face-to-face communication improves the quality and accuracy of heard speech, particularly in noisy environments. Silent lipreading modulates activity in auditory regions, which has been hypothesized to reflect the transformation and encoding of multiple forms of visual speech information used to support hearing processes. Evidence suggests visual timing information as one such signal encoded in auditory areas: seeing when a speaker's lips come together between words can help listeners parse word-level boundaries. However, it remains unclear how lipreading alters activity in the auditory system to improve speech perception at the single word-level. Using fMRI and intracranial electrodes in patients, here we show that silently lipread words can be classified from neural activity in auditory areas based on distributed spatial information. Lipread words evoked similar representations to the corresponding heard words, consistent with the prediction that automatic lipreading refines the tuning of auditory representations. Similar to heard words, lipread words varied in the distinctiveness of their neural representations in auditory cortex: e.g., the lipread words DIG and GIG evoked more similar neural activity in auditory cortex relative to the more perceptually distinct word FIG, suggesting that lipreading activity reflects probabilistic distributions as opposed to the unique identity of the lipread word. Notably, while visual speech has both excitatory and suppressive effects on auditory firing rates, classification was observed in both neural populations, consistent with the prediction that lipreading contributes to phoneme population tuning by both activating the corresponding representation and suppressing incorrect phonemic representations. These results support a model in which the auditory system combines the joint neural distributions evoked by heard and lipread words to generate a more precise estimate of what was said, particularly during noisy speech.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Dopamine facilitates the response to glutamatergic inputs in a computational model of astrocytes</a></h4>

              
                Astrocytes are active cells that respond to neurotransmitters with elevations in their intracellular calcium concentration (calcium signals). In a tripartite synapse involving two neurons coupled by a glutamatergic synapse and one astrocyte, glutamate released by the presynaptic neuron can generate calcium signals in the astrocyte, which in turn trigger the release of neuroactive molecules (gliotransmitters) by the astrocyte that bind to receptors in the pre- and postsynaptic neuron membranes and modulate synaptic transmission. Astrocytic calcium signals can also be evoked by dopamine released in distant sites. Little is known about how dopamine modulates glutamatergic-evoked astrocyte activity. To investigate this question, we constructed compartmental astrocyte models with three different morphologies: linear (soma plus a single branch); branched (soma plus two branches); and bifurcated (soma plus a single branch that bifurcates into two branchlets). Compartments were modeled by conductance-based equations for membrane voltage and transport of ions, glutamate and dopamine between extra- and intracellular spaces. Glutamatergic and dopaminergic stimuli were modeled as Poisson processes with variable frequencies, and astrocyte responses were measured by number and location of evoked calcium signals. For cells with linear morphology, whole-cell dopaminergic stimulation reduced the glutamatergic stimulation frequency of distal compartments needed to generate calcium signals. For both the branched and bifurcated morphologies, whole-cell dopaminergic stimulation together with glutamatergic stimulation of one of the processes reduced the glutamatergic stimulation frequency necessary to trigger a calcium signal in the other process. The same glutamatergic stimulation protocols without dopamine stimulation required higher glutamatergic input frequencies to evoke calcium signals. Our results suggest that dopamine facilitates the occurrence of glutamatergic-evoked calcium signals, and that dopamine-glutamate interaction can control the distribution of calcium signals along the astrocyte extension.

	<p>Proactive inhibition is divided into two components: action postponing (AP), which refers to slowing the onset of response, and action restraint (AR), which refers to preventing the response. To date, several studies have reported alterations in proactive inhibition and its associated neural processing among sensory modalities; however, this remains inconclusive owing to several methodological issues. This study aimed to clarify the differences in AP and AR and their neural processing among visual, auditory, and somatosensory modalities using an appropriate experimental paradigm that can assess AP and AR separately. The postponing time calculated by subtracting simple reaction time from Go signal reaction time was shorter in the visual modality than in the other modalities. This was explained by faster neural processing for conflict monitoring induced by anticipating the presence of the No-go signal, supported by the shorter latency of AP-related N2. Furthermore, the percentage of false alarms, which is the reaction to No-go signals, was lower in the visual modality than in the auditory modality. This was attributed to higher neural resources for conflict monitoring induced by the presence of No-go signals, supported by the larger amplitudes of AR-related N2. Our findings revealed the differences in AP and AR and their neural processing among sensory modalities.</p>

	<p>Myelin-oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) antibody-associated disease (MOGAD) is an autoimmune-mediated demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS). Patients with MOGAD may develop any combination of optic neuritis (ON), myelitis, brainstem syndrome and encephalitis. Reports of MOGAD with cranial nerve involvement are rare. Herein, we report a MOGAD patient with cranial neuropathies. In addition, we summarized the clinical features of the previously reported six MOG-IgG-positive cases with cranial nerve involvement and discussed the underlying mechanisms of MOGAD involving cranial nerves. Cranial neuropathy is an emerging phenotype in MOGAD, which has characteristics of both central and peripheral nervous system (PNS) involvement, with the trigeminal nerve being the most commonly affected nerve. MOG antibody testing in patients with cranial neuropathies is warranted, and immunotherapy is advocated when the risk of relapse is high. Although higher antibody titers and persistently positive serological test results are predictive of disease recurrence, the long-term outcomes of MOG-IgG-positive patients with cranial neuropathies remain largely unknown.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Management of evidence and conflict of interest in guidelines on early childhood allergy prevention and child nutrition: study protocol of a systematic synthesis of guidelines and explorative network analysis [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: With the rising prevalence of allergic diseases in children, prevention of childhood allergies becomes an important public health issue. Recently, a paradigm shift is taking place in the approach to preventing allergies, and clinical practice guidelines (CPG) and food-based dietary guidelines (FBDG) play an important role in providing practitioners with the latest evidence and reliable guidance. However, concern about the methodological quality of the development of FBDGs and CPGs, including limitations in the systematic reviews, lack of transparency and unmanaged conflicts of interest (COI), reduce the trust in these guidelines. Methods: We aim to synthesize the available guidance on early childhood allergy prevention (ECAP) through a systematic search for national and international CPGs and FBDGs concerning ECAP and child nutrition (CN) and to assess the quality of the guidelines and management of COI. Additionally, we will analyse the content and the evidence base of the recommendation statements. We aim to quantify the COI in guideline panellists and explore possible associations between COI and recommendations. Through a social network analysis, we expect to elucidate ties between panellists, researchers, institutions, industry and other sponsors. Guidelines are an important tool to inform healthcare practitioners with the newest evidence, but quality and reliability have to be high. This study will help identify potential for further improvement in the development of guidelines and the management of COI. If the social network analysis proves feasible and reveals more information on COI in comparison to disclosed COI from the previous analyses, the methodology can be developed further to identify undisclosed COIs in panellists. Ethics and dissemination: This research does not require ethical approval because no human subjects are involved. Results will be published in international peer-reviewed open access journals and via presentations at scientific conferences.

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Effects of Visual Deprivation on Remodeling of Nodes of Ranvier in Optic Nerve</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Oligodendrocytes, the myelinating cells of the CNS, promote rapid action potential conduction along axons. Changes in the geometry of gaps between myelin segments, known as nodes of Ranvier, affect the conduction speed of neuronal impulses and can ultimately alter neural synchronization and circuit function. In contrast to synaptic plasticity, much less is known about how neural activity may affect node of Ranvier structure. Recently, perinodal astrocytes have been shown to remodel nodes of Ranvier by regulating thrombin proteolysis, but it is not known whether neural activity influences this process. To test this hypothesis, we used transgenic mice with astrocytic expression of a dominant-negative vesicle-associated membrane protein 2 ([gfap]dnVAMP2) to reduce exocytosis of thrombin inhibitors, modulating astrocytic regulation of paranodal loop attachment to induce nodal remodeling, under normal conditions and in adult mice maintained in darkness from postnatal day 40 (P40) to P70. This mechanism of nodal lengthening proceeded normally following binocular visual deprivation (BVD). The effect of BVD on nodal plasticity in animals with unimpaired astrocyte function has not been previously investigated. We find that when exocytosis from astrocytes was unimpaired, nodal gap length was not altered by BVD in adult mice. We conclude that if perinodal astrocytes participate in activity-dependent myelin remodeling through exocytosis, then, as with synaptic plasticity in the visual system, the process must be driven by alterations in neuronal firing other than those produced by BVD.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Allocation of Visuospatial Attention Indexes Evidence Accumulation for Reach Decisions</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Visuospatial attention is a prerequisite for the performance of visually guided movements: perceptual discrimination is regularly enhanced at target locations before movement initiation. It is known that this attentional prioritization evolves over the time of movement preparation; however, it is not clear whether this build-up simply reflects a time requirement of attention formation or whether, instead, attention build-up reflects the emergence of the movement decision. To address this question, we combined behavioral experiments, psychophysics, and computational decision-making models to characterize the time course of attention build-up during motor preparation. Participants (<I>n</I> = 46, 29 female) executed center-out reaches to one of two potential target locations and reported the identity of a visual discrimination target (DT) that occurred concurrently at one of various time-points during movement preparation and execution. Visual discrimination increased simultaneously at the two potential target locations but was modulated by the experiment-wide probability that a given location would become the final goal. Attention increased further for the location that was then designated as the final goal location, with a time course closely related to movement initiation. A sequential sampling model of decision-making faithfully predicted key temporal characteristics of attentional allocation. Together, these findings provide evidence that visuospatial attentional prioritization during motor preparation does not simply reflect that a spatial location has been selected as movement goal, but rather indexes the time-extended, cumulative decision that leads to the selection, hence constituting a link between perceptual and motor aspects of sensorimotor decisions.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Risk factors common to leading eye health conditions and major non-communicable diseases: a rapid review and commentary [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: To gain an understanding of the intersection of risk factors between the most prevalent eye health conditions that are associated with vision impairment and non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Methods: A series of rapid reviews of reviews reporting on non-modifiable risk factors, age and sex, and modifiable risk factors, including social determinants, were conducted for five common eye health conditions that are the leading causes of vision impairment globally (refractive error including uncorrected refractive error, cataract, age-related macular degeneration (AMD), glaucoma, and diabetic retinopathy) and five prevalent NCDs (cancer, cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease, dementia, and depressive disorders). Articles published within approximately 5 years to the end of 2019 were identified through expert recommendation, PubMED, Ovid Medline, the Lancet Global Burden of Disease series, the International Agency for Research on Cancer and World Cancer Research Fund.    Results: Of 9,213 records identified, 320 records were eligible. Eye health conditions and NCDs share many risk factors. Increased age was found to be the most common shared risk factor, associated with increased risks of AMD, cataract, diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, refractive error, cancer, cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and dementia. Other shared risk factors included smoking, obesity, alcohol consumption (mixed results), and physical activity was protective, though limited evidence was found for eye conditions. Social determinants are well documented as risk factors for NCDs. Conclusion: There is substantial overlap in common established risk factors for the most frequent vision impairing eye conditions and leading NCDs. Increasing efforts should be made to integrate preventative and risk reduction interventions to improve health, with greatest shared benefits for initiatives which aim to reduce smoking, improve diet, and promote physical activity.

<p>Golgi-impregnated human neurons and dendritic spines were 3D reconstructed using opensource software. A pyramidal-like neuron from the human cortical amygdaloid complex with various spiny dendritic segments can be observed at different angles of rotation. Spines in a <i>continuum</i> of shapes and sizes were reconstructed using a supervised machine learning-based algorithm for image segmentation. They were classified as stubby (s), wide (w), thin (t), mushroom-like (m), ramified (r), or “atypical”/transitional ones (a).

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Visualizing nerve cells has been fundamental for the systematic description of brain structure and function in humans and other species. Different approaches aimed to unravel the morphological features of neuron types and diversity. The inherent complexity of the human nervous tissue and the need for proper histological processing have made studying human dendrites and spines challenging in postmortem samples. In this study, we used Golgi data and open-source software for 3D image reconstruction of human neurons from the cortical amygdaloid nucleus to show different dendrites and pleomorphic spines at different angles. Procedures required minimal equipment and generated high-quality images for differently shaped cells. We used the “single-section” Golgi method adapted for the human brain to engender 3D reconstructed images of the neuronal cell body and the dendritic ramification by adopting a neuronal tracing procedure. In addition, we elaborated 3D reconstructions to visualize heterogeneous dendritic spines using a supervised machine learning-based algorithm for image segmentation. These tools provided an additional upgrade and enhanced visual display of information related to the spatial orientation of dendritic branches and for dendritic spines of varied sizes and shapes in these human subcortical neurons. This same approach can be adapted for other techniques, areas of the central or peripheral nervous system, and comparative analysis between species.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Effectiveness of nifedipine, labetalol, and hydralazine as emergency antihypertension in severe preeclampsia [version 1; peer review: 1 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Preeclampsia is a highly prevalent disease among pregnant women. In the event of hypertensive emergency, nifedipine, labetalol, and hydralazine are assigned as first-line therapies in preeclampsia. Further studies are needed to compare the effectiveness of these drugs to find the most cost-effective drug with minimal side effects. This study aimed to compare the effectiveness of these drugs in lowering blood pressure during hypertensive emergencies in severe preeclampsia. Methods: 60 pregnant women with severe preeclampsia were recruited in this multiple centre double-blind randomized clinical trial from May 2021 to April 2022 in Indonesia. The patients were divided equally into three groups and treated with three doses of nifedipine, labetalol, and hydralazine, respectively within one hour with 20 minutes interval. The effectiveness was measured based on systolic and diastolic blood pressures, and mean arterial pressure (MAP). The observation was carried out until five hours post-third dose administration.   Results: The blood pressure was reduced significantly after the administration of the first to the third dose of each antihypertensive (p<0.05). A single dose administration, four, one, and three patients had 20% MAP reduction in nifedipine, labetalol, and hydralazine group. Three, seven, and one patient had a failure of reaching 20% MAP reduction even after receiving the third dose. The effectiveness of the drugs to achieve 20% reduction of MAP could be ranked as follows: nifedipine>labetalol>hydralazine (57.49%, 42.13%, and 40.87%, respectively) for single dose and hydralazine>nifedipine>labetalol (111.3%, 85.12%, and 90.04%, respectively) for triple dose. Conclusions: Nifedipine is the most effective drug to reduce the blood pressure when single dose administration is used, but requires more doses to further reduce the blood pressure. Hydralazine is the most effective when the drug administration is maxed up to three doses within 60 minutes with 20 minutes interval.

In South Africa, the National Department of Health (NDoH) and its partner, the National Health Laboratory Services (NHLS) collaborated to introduce Electronic Gate Keeping (EGK) systems across the country. This study estimated the cost-effectiveness of EGK on laboratory tests requested at a rural academic hospital in the Eastern Cape province of South Africa. Methods: The methodological approach involved the use of a cross-sectional study design. For 24 months (June 2015 to May 2017), data on the number and types of laboratory tests initially requested along with those rejected because there were unnecessary was obtained. Data management and cost effectiveness analysis to estimate cost savings due to EGK on laboratory test demands were carried out using MS Excel and Stata software. There were 28 types of tests requested, of which 22 were chemical tests, two were haematological tests, and four were serological tests. Results: Out of 448 028 tests requested, 17,480 (3.9%) were rejected after being identified as unnecessary through the EGK system. This rejection rate of 3.9% generated cost savings of USD 51,967.07. The top three tests that generated the most savings were the c-reactive protein (USD 6,077.68), free thyroxine (USD 5,199.92) and hepatitis A IgM (USD 3,813.61). Conclusions: The study demonstrates that the introduction of EGK has positive spinoffs; it reduced costs, strengthened the dialogue between clinicians and pathologists allowing a platform for continuous education, teaching and learning.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The role of IL-6, ferritin, and coagulopathy in COVID-19 clinical progression [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background In COVID-19, the release of pro-inflammatory mediators in the cytokine storm, primarily interleukin-6 (IL-6), has been hypothesized to induce pulmonary intravascular coagulation. However, the relationship between IL-6 and coagulopathy remains unclear in COVID-19 progression. We aimed to investigate the correlation of IL-6 with D-dimer, fibrinogen, prothrombin time (PT), and ferritin. Furthermore, we also analyzed the effect of those parameters on the worsening of COVID-19 patients. Methods A prospective cohort study was conducted in moderate and severe COVID-19 patients from June 2020 to January 2021. A serial evaluation of IL-6, D-dimer, fibrinogen, ferritin, and PT was performed and correlated with the patient's condition at admission and on the 14th day. The outcomes (improvement, worsening, or discharged patients) were recorded during the study. Results Of 374 patients, 73 study subjects (61 severe and 12 moderate COVID-19) were included in this study. A total of 35 out of 61 severe and one out of 12 moderate illness subjects had experienced worsening. Spearman-rank correlation of IL-6 with with ferritin, D-dimer, fibrinogen, and PT was 0.08 (p=0.5), −0.13 (p=0.27), 0.01 (p=0.91), and 0.03 (p=0.77), respectively. In ROC analysis, D-dimer (74,77%) and IL-6 (71,32%) were the highest among other variables (>60%). Conclusions In COVID-19 patients, there was a correlation between elevated IL-6 and D-dimer levels with disease deterioration. There was no correlation between elevated IL-6 levels with ferritin, D-dimer, fibrinogen, and PT levels. Therefore, changes in IL-6 and D-dimer can predict worsening in moderate and severe COVID-19 patients.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Evidence of mitochondria origin of SARS-CoV-2 double-membrane vesicles: a review. [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Coronavirus Disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic is caused by SARS-CoV-2 that has infected more than 600 million people and killed more than 6 million people worldwide. This infection affects mainly certain groups of people that have high susceptibility to present severe COVID-19 due to comorbidities. Moreover, the long-COVID-19 comprises a series of symptoms that may remain in some patients for months after infection that further compromises their health. Thus, since this pandemic is profoundly affecting health, economy, and social life of societies, a deeper understanding of viral replication cycle could help to envisage novel therapeutic alternatives that limit or stop COVID-19. Several findings have unexpectedly discovered that mitochondria play a critical role in SARS-CoV-2 cell infection. Indeed, it has been suggested that this organelle could be the origin of its replication niches, the double membrane vesicles (DMV). In this regard, mitochondria derived vesicles (MDV), involved in mitochondria quality control, discovered almost 15 years ago, comprise a subpopulation characterized by a double membrane. MDV shedding is induced by mitochondrial stress, and it has a fast assembly dynamic, reason that perhaps has precluded their identification in electron microscopy or tomography studies. These and other features of MDV together with recent SARS-CoV-2 protein interactome and other findings link SARS-CoV-2 to mitochondria and support that these vesicles are the precursors of SARS-CoV-2 induced DMV. In this work, the morphological, biochemical, molecular, and cellular evidence that supports this hypothesis is reviewed and integrated into the current model of SARS-CoV-2 cell infection. In this scheme, some relevant questions are raised as pending topics for research that would help in the near future to test this hypothesis. The intention of this work is to provide a novel framework that could open new possibilities to tackle SARS-CoV-2 pandemic through mitochondria and DMV targeted therapies.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Are adverse effects of cannabidiol (CBD) products caused by tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) contamination? [version 5; peer review: 2 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Cannabidiol (CBD)-containing products are widely marketed as over the counter products, mostly as food supplements. Adverse effects reported in anecdotal consumer reports or during clinical studies were first assumed to be due to hydrolytic conversion of CBD to psychotropic Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC) in the stomach after oral consumption. However, research of pure CBD solutions stored in simulated gastric juice or subjected to various storage conditions such as heat and light with specific liquid chromatographic/tandem mass spectrometric (LC/MS/MS) and ultra-high pressure liquid chromatographic/quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometric (UPLC-QTOF) analyses was unable to confirm THC formation. Another hypothesis for the adverse effects of CBD products may be residual Δ9-THC concentrations in the products as contamination, because most of them are based on hemp extracts containing the full spectrum of cannabinoids besides CBD. Analyses of 293 food products of the German market (mostly CBD oils) confirmed this hypothesis: 28 products (10%) contained Δ9-THC above the lowest observed adverse effect level (2.5 mg/day). Hence, it may be assumed that the adverse effects of some commercial CBD products are based on a low-dose effect of Δ9-THC, with the safety of CBD itself currently being unclear with significant uncertainties regarding possible liver and reproductive toxicity. The safety, efficacy and purity of commercial CBD products is highly questionable, and all of the products in our sample collection showed various non-conformities to European food law such as unsafe Δ9-THC levels, hemp extracts or CBD isolates as non-approved novel food ingredients, non-approved health claims, and deficits in mandatory food labelling requirements. In view of the growing market for such lifestyle products, the effectiveness of the instrument of food business operators' own responsibility for product safety and regulatory compliance must obviously be challenged, and a strong regulatory framework for hemp products needs to be devised.

                Background   The postural abnormality, forward shoulder posture (FSP), is the most common cause of respiratory impairment in older individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). A recent study found that performing pectoral stretching and scapular strengthening exercises for eight weeks could reduce FSP in healthy participants. We aimed to determine the effects of pectoral stretching and scapular stabilizer strengthening exercises on FSP, chest wall mobility, respiratory muscle strength, and pulmonary function in male patients with COPD.  Methods   This study was randomized clinical trial. Forty male COPD patients with FSP aged 60–90 years were included and randomly allocated to control (n=20) and exercise (n=20) groups. Following completion of the scapulothoracic exercises (three days/week, for eight weeks), respiratory functions were assessed by measuring the magnitude of FSP, chest mobility, respiratory muscle strength, and pulmonary functions.  Results   FSP and thoracic kyphosis angle significantly decreased compared to controls (p<0.001, p<0.001). Middle and lower chest mobility markedly increased (p<0.001, p<0.001) and the pectoralis minor index significantly improved (p<0.001). The strength of the lower trapezius and serratus anterior muscles significantly increased at week eight of the exercise training (p<0.003, p<0.001). There was a marked increase in maximum inspiratory pressure and maximum expiratory pressure (p<0.001, p<0.001).  Conclusions   The eight-week combined pectoral muscles self-stretching and serratus anterior and lower trapezius strengthening exercises could be an effective treatment and/or prevention strategy for FSP reduction, leading to improved respiratory function in male COPD patients.

<p>Photomicrograph of orexinergic neurons forming the main orexinergic neuronal cluster in the hypothalamus of a Southeast African cheetah. While showing the standard features of the orexinergic system, the Southeast African cheetah, along with an Asiatic and an African lion, also exhibits specializations in the organization of this system. This has implications for sleep and arousal in these large carnivores.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Employing orexin-A immunohistochemistry, we describe the distribution, morphology, and nuclear parcellation of orexinergic neurons within the hypothalami of an Asiatic lion (<i>Panthera leo</i> subsp. <i>persica</i>), an African lion (<i>Panthera leo</i> subsp. <i>melanochaita</i>), and a Southeast African cheetah (<i>Acinonyx jubatus</i> subsp. <i>jubatus</i>). In all three felids, the clustering of large, bipolar, and multipolar hypothalamic orexinergic neurons primarily follows the pattern observed in other mammals. The orexinergic neurons were found, primarily, to form three distinct clusters—the main, zona incerta, and optic tract clusters. In addition, large orexinergic neurons were observed in the ventromedial supraoptic region of the hypothalamus, where they are not typically observed in other species. As has been observed in cetartiodactyls and the African elephant, a cluster of small, multipolar orexinergic neurons, the parvocellular cluster, was observed in the medial zone of the hypothalamus in all three felids, although this parvocellular cluster has not been reported in other carnivores. In both subspecies of lions, but not the cheetah, potential orexin-immunopositive neurons were observed in the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus, supraoptic nucleus, the lateral part of the retrochiasmatic area, and the inner layer of the median eminence. The distribution and parcellation of orexinergic neurons in the hypothalami of the three felids studied appear to be more complex than observed in many other mammals and for the two subspecies of lion may be even more complex. These findings are discussed in terms of potential technical concerns, phylogenetic variations of this system, and potentially associated functional aspects of the orexinergic system.</p>

                Background: Dengue fever is still a public health issue in Indonesia, and during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, integrated digital technology will be required for its control. This study aimed to identify the factors that influence attitudes toward dengue control concerning the potential application of digital technology. Methods: This was a cross-sectional survey, with 515 people willing to fill out an online questionnaire. The analysis was conducted using Partial Least Square-Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM). There were 46 indicators used to assess attitudes toward dengue control, which are organized into six variables: the need for digital information systems, perceptions of being threatened with dengue, the benefits of dengue control programs, program constraints, environmental factors and attitudes in dengue control. Results:  The source of information needed for dengue control was mainly through social media. There was a positive relationship between perception of environmental factors to perception of dengue threat, perception of program constraints, perception of program benefits, and perception of digital technology needs. Perception of program benefits and threatened perception of dengue have a positive relationship with perception of digital technology needs. Conclusions: This model showed the variables perception of digital technology and perception of benefits had a positive association with attitude towards dengue control.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Protein prediction models support widespread post-transcriptional regulation of protein abundance by interacting partners</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Himangi Srivastava, Michael J. Lippincott, Jordan Currie, Robert Canfield, Maggie P. Y. Lam, Edward Lau</p>

Protein and mRNA levels correlate only moderately. The availability of proteogenomics data sets with protein and transcript measurements from matching samples is providing new opportunities to assess the degree to which protein levels in a system can be predicted from mRNA information. Here we examined the contributions of input features in protein abundance prediction models. Using large proteogenomics data from 8 cancer types within the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC) data set, we trained models to predict the abundance of over 13,000 proteins using matching transcriptome data from up to 958 tumor or normal adjacent tissue samples each, and compared predictive performances across algorithms, data set sizes, and input features. Over one-third of proteins (4,648) showed relatively poor predictability (elastic net r ≤ 0.3) from their cognate transcripts. Moreover, we found widespread occurrences where the abundance of a protein is considerably less well explained by its own cognate transcript level than that of one or more trans locus transcripts. The incorporation of additional trans-locus transcript abundance data as input features increasingly improved the ability to predict sample protein abundance. Transcripts that contribute to non-cognate protein abundance primarily involve those encoding known or predicted interaction partners of the protein of interest, including not only large multi-protein complexes as previously shown, but also small stable complexes in the proteome with only one or few stable interacting partners. Network analysis further shows a complex proteome-wide interdependency of protein abundance on the transcript levels of multiple interacting partners. The predictive model analysis here therefore supports that protein-protein interaction including in small protein complexes exert post-transcriptional influence on proteome compositions more broadly than previously recognized. Moreover, the results suggest mRNA and protein co-expression analysis may have utility for finding gene interactions and predicting expression changes in biological systems.

BIPS (Build Phage ImmunoPrecipitation Sequencing library) is a software that converts a list of proteins into a custom DNA oligonucleotide library for the PhIP-Seq system. The tool creates constant-length oligonucleotides with internal barcodes, while maintaining the original length of the peptide. This allows using large libraries, of hundreds of thousands of oligonucleotides, while saving on the costs of sequencing and maintaining the accuracy of oligonucleotide reads identification. BIPS is available under GNU public license from: https://github.com/kalkairis/BuildPhIPSeqLibrary.

The “replication crisis” is a methodological problem in which many scientific research findings have been difficult or impossible to replicate. Because the reproducibility of empirical results is an essential aspect of the scientific method, such failures endanger the credibility of theories based on them and possibly significant portions of scientific knowledge. An instance of the replication crisis, analytic replication, pertains to reproducing published results through computational reanalysis of the authors’ original data. However, direct replications are costly, time-consuming, and unrewarded in today’s publishing standards. We propose that bioinformatics and computational biology students replicate recent discoveries as part of their curriculum. Considering the above, we performed a pilot study in one of the graduate-level courses we developed and taught at our University. The course is entitled Intro to R Programming and is meant for students in our Master’s and PhD programs who have little to no programming skills. As the course emphasized real-world data analysis, we thought it would be an appropriate setting to carry out this study. The primary objective was to expose the students to real biological data analysis problems. These include locating and downloading the needed datasets, understanding any underlying conventions and annotations, understanding the analytical methods, and regenerating multiple graphs from their assigned article. The secondary goal was to determine whether the assigned articles contained sufficient information for a graduate-level student to replicate its figures. Overall, the students successfully reproduced 39% of the figures. The main obstacles were the need for more advanced programming skills and the incomplete documentation of the applied methods. Students were engaged, enthusiastic, and focused throughout the semester. We believe that this teaching approach will allow students to make fundamental scientific contributions under appropriate supervision. It will teach them about the scientific process, the importance of reporting standards, and the importance of openness.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">A novel statistical method for long-term coronavirus modelling [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Novel coronavirus disease has been recently a concern for worldwide public health. To determine epidemic rate probability at any time in any region of interest, one needs efficient bio-system reliability approach, particularly suitable for multi-regional environmental and health systems, observed over a sufficient period of time, resulting in a reliable long-term forecast of novel coronavirus infection rate. Traditional statistical methods dealing with temporal observations of multi-regional processes do not have the multi-dimensionality advantage, that suggested methodology offers, namely dealing efficiently with multiple regions at the same time and accounting for cross-correlations between different regional observations. Methods: Modern multi-dimensional novel statistical method was directly applied to raw clinical data, able to deal with territorial mapping. Novel reliability method based on statistical extreme value theory has been suggested to deal with challenging epidemic forecast. Authors used MATLAB optimization software. Results: This paper described a novel bio-system reliability approach, particularly suitable for multi-country environmental and health systems, observed over a sufficient period of time, resulting in a reliable long-term forecast of extreme novel coronavirus death rate probability.  Namely, accurate maximum recorded patient numbers are predicted for the years to come for the analyzed provinces. Conclusions:  The suggested method performed well by supplying not only an estimate but 95% confidence interval as well.  Note that suggested methodology is not limited to any specific epidemics or any specific terrain, namely its truly general. The only assumption and limitation is bio-system stationarity, alternatively trend analysis should be performed first.  The suggested methodology can be used in various public health applications, based on their clinical survey data.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Recent research has shown that sex/gender (s/g) influences on cognitive functions and related brain anatomy, functional responses, and connectivity are less clear than previously assumed, and most studies investigated adult population. In this mini-review, we summarize research progress in the study of s/g differences in the human brain function as investigated by neuroimaging methods adopting a developmental perspective. In particular, we review original studies published from 2000 to 2021 investigating s/g differences in task-related brain functional activation and connectivity in healthy children and adolescents. We summarize results about studies in the domains of language, visuospatial ability, social cognition, and executive functions. Overall, a clear relation between cognition and brain activation or connectivity pattern is far from being established and the few coherent results should be considered exploratory, despite in some cases, brain function seems to present specific patterns in comparison with what reported in adults. Moreover, future studies should address methodological limitations, such as fragmentation of tasks, lack of control for confounding variables, and lack of longitudinal designs to study developmental trajectories.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Substantia nigra (SN) hyperechogenicity, viewed with transcranial ultrasound, is a risk marker for Parkinson's disease. We hypothesized that SN hyperechogenicity in healthy adults aged 50–70 years is associated with reduced short-interval intracortical inhibition in primary motor cortex, and that the reduced intracortical inhibition is associated with neurochemical markers of activity in the pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA). Short-interval intracortical inhibition and intracortical facilitation in primary motor cortex was assessed with paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation in 23 healthy adults with normal (<i>n</i> = 14; 61 ± 7 yrs) or abnormally enlarged (hyperechogenic; <i>n</i> = 9; 60 ± 6 yrs) area of SN echogenicity. Thirteen of these participants (7 SN− and 6 SN+) also underwent brain magnetic resonance spectroscopy to investigate pre-SMA neurochemistry. There was no relationship between area of SN echogenicity and short-interval intracortical inhibition in the ipsilateral primary motor cortex. There was a significant positive relationship, however, between area of echogenicity in the right SN and the magnitude of intracortical facilitation in the right (ipsilateral) primary motor cortex (<i>p</i> = .005; multivariate regression), evidenced by the amplitude of the conditioned motor evoked potential (MEP) at the 10–12 ms interstimulus interval. This relationship was not present on the left side. Pre-SMA glutamate did not predict primary motor cortex inhibition or facilitation. The results suggest that SN hyperechogenicity in healthy older adults may be associated with changes in excitability of motor cortical circuitry. The results advance understanding of brain changes in healthy older adults at risk of Parkinson's disease.</p>
