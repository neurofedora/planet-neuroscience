              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10969861/most-recent">Development of astrocyte morphology and function in mouse visual thalamus</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The rodent visual thalamus has served as a powerful model to elucidate the cellular and molecular mechanisms that underlie sensory circuit formation and function. Despite significant advances in our understanding of the role of axon-target interactions and neural activity in orchestrating circuit formation in visual thalamus, the role of non-neuronal cells, such as astrocytes, is less clear. In fact, we know little about the transcriptional identity and development of astrocytes in mouse visual thalamus. To address this gap in knowledge, we studied the expression of canonical astrocyte molecules in visual thalamus using immunostaining, in situ hybridization, and reporter lines. While our data suggests some level of heterogeneity of astrocytes in different nuclei of the visual thalamus, the majority of thalamic astrocytes appeared to be labelled in <i>Aldh1l1-EGFP</i> mice. This led us to use this transgenic line to characterize the neonatal and postnatal development of these cells in visual thalamus. Our data show that not only have the entire cohort of astrocytes migrated into visual thalamus by eye-opening but they also have acquired their adult-like morphology, even while retinogeniculate synapses are still maturing. Furthermore, ultrastructural, immunohistochemical, and functional approaches revealed that by eye-opening, thalamic astrocytes ensheath retinogeniculate synapses and are capable of efficient uptake of glutamate. Taken together, our results reveal that the morphological, anatomical, and functional development of astrocytes in visual thalamus occurs prior to eye-opening and the emergence of experience-dependent visual activity.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Secondary metabolites of Hülle cells mediate protection of fungal reproductive and overwintering structures against fungivorous animals</a></h4>

              
                Fungal Hülle cells with nuclear storage and developmental backup functions are reminiscent of multipotent stem cells. In the soil, Hülle cells nurse the overwintering fruiting bodies of <i>Aspergillus nidulans</i>. The genome of <i>A. nidulans</i> harbors genes for the biosynthesis of xanthones. We show that enzymes and metabolites of this biosynthetic pathway accumulate in Hülle cells under the control of the regulatory velvet complex, which coordinates development and secondary metabolism. Deletion strains blocked in the conversion of anthraquinones to xanthones accumulate emodins and are delayed in maturation and growth of fruiting bodies. Emodin represses fruiting body and resting structure formation in other fungi. Xanthones are not required for sexual development but exert antifeedant effects on fungivorous animals such as springtails and woodlice. Our findings reveal a novel role of Hülle cells in establishing secure niches for <i>A. nidulans</i> by accumulating metabolites with antifeedant activity that protect reproductive structures from animal predators.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Utility of polygenic embryo screening for disease depends on the selection strategy</a></h4>

              
                Polygenic risk scores (PRSs) have been offered since 2019 to screen in vitro fertilization embryos for genetic liability to adult diseases, despite a lack of comprehensive modeling of expected outcomes. Here we predict, based on the liability threshold model, the expected reduction in complex disease risk following <i>polygenic embryo screening</i> for a single disease. A strong determinant of the potential utility of such screening is the <i>selection strategy</i>, a factor that has not been previously studied. When only embryos with a very high PRS are excluded, the achieved risk reduction is minimal. In contrast, selecting the embryo with the lowest PRS can lead to substantial relative risk reductions, given a sufficient number of viable embryos. We systematically examine the impact of several factors on the utility of screening, including: variance explained by the PRS, number of embryos, disease prevalence, parental PRSs, and parental disease status. We consider both relative and absolute risk reductions, as well as population-averaged and per-couple risk reductions, and also examine the risk of pleiotropic effects. Finally, we confirm our theoretical predictions by simulating ‘virtual’ couples and offspring based on real genomes from schizophrenia and Crohn’s disease case-control studies. We discuss the assumptions and limitations of our model, as well as the potential emerging ethical concerns.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>While cortical injuries such as traumatic brain injury and neocortical stroke acutely disrupt the neocortex, most of their consequent disabilities reflect secondary injuries that develop over time. Thalamic neuroinflammation has been proposed to be a biomarker of cortical injury and of the long-term cognitive and neurological deficits that follow. However, the extent to which thalamic neuroinflammation depends on the type of cortical injury or its location remains unknown. Using two mouse models of focal neocortical injury that do not directly damage subcortical structures ‒ controlled cortical impact and photothrombotic ischemic stroke ‒ we found that chronic neuroinflammation in the thalamic region mirrors the functional connections with the injured cortex, and that sensory corticothalamic regions may be more likely to sustain long-term damage than non-sensory circuits. Currently, heterogeneous clinical outcomes complicate treatment. Understanding how thalamic inflammation depends on the injury site can aid in predicting features of subsequent deficits and lead to more effective, customized therapies.</p>
<p>Focal cortical TBI or stroke in various cortical areas leads to gliosis in the functionally connected thalamocortical nuclei and of the <i>nucleus reticularis thalami</i> (nRT). The dotted line in the prefrontal cortex-injured section indicates that the top and bottom halves of the brain are sourced from different bregma positions in order to display cortical injury and relevant thalamic nuclei together.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Cortical feedback and gating in odor discrimination and generalization</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Gaia Tavoni, David E. Chen Kersen, Vijay Balasubramanian</p>

A central question in neuroscience is how context changes perception. In the olfactory system, for example, experiments show that task demands can drive divergence and convergence of cortical odor responses, likely underpinning olfactory discrimination and generalization. Here, we propose a simple statistical mechanism for this effect based on unstructured feedback from the central brain to the olfactory bulb, which represents the context associated with an odor, and sufficiently selective cortical gating of sensory inputs. Strikingly, the model predicts that both convergence and divergence of cortical odor patterns should increase when odors are initially more similar, an effect reported in recent experiments. The theory in turn predicts reversals of these trends following experimental manipulations and in neurological conditions that increase cortical excitability.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Frank-Starling mechanism, fluid responsiveness, and length-dependent activation: Unravelling the multiscale behaviors with an in silico analysis</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Sarah Kosta, Pierre C. Dauby</p>

The Frank-Starling mechanism is a fundamental regulatory property which underlies the cardiac output adaptation to venous filling. Length-dependent activation is generally assumed to be the cellular origin of this mechanism. At the heart scale, it is commonly admitted that an increase in preload (ventricular filling) leads to an increased cellular force and an increased volume of ejected blood. This explanation also forms the basis for vascular filling therapy. It is actually difficult to unravel the exact nature of the relationship between length-dependent activation and the Frank-Starling mechanism, as three different scales (cellular, ventricular and cardiovascular) are involved. Mathematical models are powerful tools to overcome these limitations. In this study, we use a multiscale model of the cardiovascular system to untangle the three concepts (length-dependent activation, Frank-Starling, and vascular filling). We first show that length-dependent activation is required to observe both the Frank-Starling mechanism and a positive response to high vascular fillings. Our results reveal a dynamical length dependent activation-driven response to changes in preload, which involves interactions between the cellular, ventricular and cardiovascular levels and thus highlights fundamentally multiscale behaviors. We show however that the cellular force increase is not enough to explain the cardiac response to rapid changes in preload. We also show that the absence of fluid responsiveness is not related to a saturating Frank-Starling effect. As it is challenging to study those multiscale phenomena experimentally, this computational approach contributes to a more comprehensive knowledge of the sophisticated length-dependent properties of cardiac muscle.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">The information theory of developmental pruning: Optimizing global network architectures using local synaptic rules</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Carolin Scholl, Michael E. Rule, Matthias H. Hennig</p>

During development, biological neural networks produce more synapses and neurons than needed. Many of these synapses and neurons are later removed in a process known as neural pruning. Why networks should initially be over-populated, and the processes that determine which synapses and neurons are ultimately pruned, remains unclear. We study the mechanisms and significance of neural pruning in model neural networks. In a deep Boltzmann machine model of sensory encoding, we find that (1) synaptic pruning is necessary to learn efficient network architectures that retain computationally-relevant connections, (2) pruning by synaptic weight alone does not optimize network size and (3) pruning based on a locally-available measure of importance based on Fisher information allows the network to identify structurally important vs. unimportant connections and neurons. This locally-available measure of importance has a biological interpretation in terms of the correlations between presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons, and implies an efficient activity-driven pruning rule. Overall, we show how local activity-dependent synaptic pruning can solve the global problem of optimizing a network architecture. We relate these findings to biology as follows: (I) Synaptic over-production is necessary for activity-dependent connectivity optimization. (II) In networks that have more neurons than needed, cells compete for activity, and only the most important and selective neurons are retained. (III) Cells may also be pruned due to a loss of synapses on their axons. This occurs when the information they convey is not relevant to the target population.

Most predictive models based on gene expression data do not leverage information related to gene splicing, despite the fact that splicing is a fundamental feature of eukaryotic gene expression. Cigarette smoking is an important environmental risk factor for many diseases, and it has profound effects on gene expression. Using smoking status as a prediction target, we developed deep neural network predictive models using gene, exon, and isoform level quantifications from RNA sequencing data in 2,557 subjects in the COPDGene Study. We observed that models using exon and isoform quantifications clearly outperformed gene-level models when using data from 5 genes from a previously published prediction model. Whereas the test set performance of the previously published model was 0.82 in the original publication, our exon-based models including an exon-to-isoform mapping layer achieved a test set AUC (area under the receiver operating characteristic) of 0.88, which improved to an AUC of 0.94 using exon quantifications from a larger set of genes. Isoform variability is an important source of latent information in RNA-seq data that can be used to improve clinical prediction models.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Enhancing breakpoint resolution with deep segmentation model: A general refinement method for read-depth based structural variant callers</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Yao-zhong Zhang, Seiya Imoto, Satoru Miyano, Rui Yamaguchi</p>

Read-depths (RDs) are frequently used in identifying structural variants (SVs) from sequencing data. For existing RD-based SV callers, it is difficult for them to determine breakpoints in single-nucleotide resolution due to the noisiness of RD data and the bin-based calculation. In this paper, we propose to use the deep segmentation model UNet to learn base-wise RD patterns surrounding breakpoints of known SVs. We integrate model predictions with an RD-based SV caller to enhance breakpoints in single-nucleotide resolution. We show that UNet can be trained with a small amount of data and can be applied both in-sample and cross-sample. An enhancement pipeline named RDBKE significantly increases the number of SVs with more precise breakpoints on simulated and real data. The source code of RDBKE is freely available at https://github.com/yaozhong/deepIntraSV.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">qc3C: Reference-free quality control for Hi-C sequencing data</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Matthew Z. DeMaere, Aaron E. Darling</p>

Hi-C is a sample preparation method that enables high-throughput sequencing to capture genome-wide spatial interactions between DNA molecules. The technique has been successfully applied to solve challenging problems such as 3D structural analysis of chromatin, scaffolding of large genome assemblies and more recently the accurate resolution of metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs). Despite continued refinements, however, preparing a Hi-C library remains a complex laboratory protocol. To avoid costly failures and maximise the odds of successful outcomes, diligent quality management is recommended. Current wet-lab methods provide only a crude assay of Hi-C library quality, while key post-sequencing quality indicators used have—thus far—relied upon reference-based read-mapping. When a reference is accessible, this reliance introduces a concern for quality, where an incomplete or inexact reference skews the resulting quality indicators. We propose a new, reference-free approach that infers the total fraction of read-pairs that are a product of proximity ligation. This quantification of Hi-C library quality requires only a modest amount of sequencing data and is independent of other application-specific criteria. The algorithm builds upon the observation that proximity ligation events are likely to create <i>k</i>-mers that would not naturally occur in the sample. Our software tool (qc3C) is to our knowledge the first to implement a reference-free Hi-C QC tool, and also provides reference-based QC, enabling Hi-C to be more easily applied to non-model organisms and environmental samples. We characterise the accuracy of the new algorithm on simulated and real datasets and compare it to reference-based methods.

The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection causes Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), a pandemic that seriously threatens global health. SARS-CoV-2 propagates by packaging its RNA genome into membrane enclosures in host cells. The packaging of the viral genome into the nascent virion is mediated by the nucleocapsid (N) protein, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Here, we show that the N protein forms biomolecular condensates with viral genomic RNA both in vitro and in mammalian cells. While the N protein forms spherical assemblies with homopolymeric RNA substrates that do not form base pairing interactions, it forms asymmetric condensates with viral RNA strands. Cross-linking mass spectrometry (CLMS) identified a region that forms interactions between N proteins in condensates, and truncation of this region disrupts phase separation. We also identified small molecules that alter the formation of N protein condensates and inhibit the proliferation of SARS-CoV-2 in infected cells. These results suggest that the N protein may utilize biomolecular condensation to package the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome into a viral particle.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Corollary discharge enables proprioception from lateral line sensory feedback</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Dimitri A. Skandalis, Elias T. Lunsford, James C. Liao</p>

Animals modulate sensory processing in concert with motor actions. Parallel copies of motor signals, called corollary discharge (CD), prepare the nervous system to process the mixture of externally and self-generated (reafferent) feedback that arises during locomotion. Commonly, CD in the peripheral nervous system cancels reafference to protect sensors and the central nervous system from being fatigued and overwhelmed by self-generated feedback. However, cancellation also limits the feedback that contributes to an animal’s awareness of its body position and motion within the environment, the sense of proprioception. We propose that, rather than cancellation, CD to the fish lateral line organ restructures reafference to maximize proprioceptive information content. Fishes’ undulatory body motions induce reafferent feedback that can encode the body’s instantaneous configuration with respect to fluid flows. We combined experimental and computational analyses of swimming biomechanics and hair cell physiology to develop a neuromechanical model of how fish can track peak body curvature, a key signature of axial undulatory locomotion. Without CD, this computation would be challenged by sensory adaptation, typified by decaying sensitivity and phase distortions with respect to an input stimulus. We find that CD interacts synergistically with sensor polarization to sharpen sensitivity along sensors’ preferred axes. The sharpening of sensitivity regulates spiking to a narrow interval coinciding with peak reafferent stimulation, which prevents adaptation and homogenizes the otherwise variable sensor output. Our integrative model reveals a vital role of CD for ensuring precise proprioceptive feedback during undulatory locomotion, which we term external proprioception.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Dynamic large-scale connectivity of intrinsic cortical oscillations supports adaptive listening in challenging conditions</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Mohsen Alavash, Sarah Tune, Jonas Obleser</p>

In multi-talker situations, individuals adapt behaviorally to the listening challenge mostly with ease, but how do brain neural networks shape this adaptation? We here establish a long-sought link between large-scale neural communications in electrophysiology and behavioral success in the control of attention in difficult listening situations. In an age-varying sample of <i>N =</i> 154 individuals, we find that connectivity between intrinsic neural oscillations extracted from source-reconstructed electroencephalography is regulated according to the listener’s goal during a challenging dual-talker task. These dynamics occur as spatially organized modulations in power-envelope correlations of alpha and low-beta neural oscillations during approximately 2-s intervals most critical for listening behavior relative to resting-state baseline. First, left frontoparietal low-beta connectivity (16 to 24 Hz) increased during anticipation and processing of spatial-attention cue before speech presentation. Second, posterior alpha connectivity (7 to 11 Hz) decreased during comprehension of competing speech, particularly around target-word presentation. Connectivity dynamics of these networks were predictive of individual differences in the speed and accuracy of target-word identification, respectively, but proved unconfounded by changes in neural oscillatory activity strength. Successful adaptation to a listening challenge thus latches onto 2 distinct yet complementary neural systems: a beta-tuned frontoparietal network enabling the flexible adaptation to attentive listening state and an alpha-tuned posterior network supporting attention to speech.

The intestine is lined with isolated lymphoid follicles (ILFs) that facilitate sampling of luminal antigens to elicit immune responses. Technical challenges related to the scarcity and small sizes of ILFs and their follicle-associated epithelium (FAE) impeded the characterization of their spatial gene expression programs. Here, we combined RNA sequencing of laser capture microdissected tissues with single-molecule transcript imaging to obtain a spatial gene expression map of the ILF and its associated FAE in the mouse small intestine. We identified zonated expression programs in both follicles and FAEs, with a decrease in enterocyte antimicrobial and absorption programs and a partial induction of expression programs normally observed at the villus tip. We further identified Lepr+ subepithelial telocytes at the FAE top, which are distinct from villus tip Lgr5+ telocytes. Our analysis exposes the epithelial and mesenchymal cell states associated with ILFs.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>This study was undertaken to investigate whether high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT) is associated with major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in patients with minor stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA), and whether this association differs after risk stratification based on the Age, Blood Pressure, Clinical Features, Duration of Symptoms, Diabetes (ABCD<sup>2</sup>) score.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>INSPiRE-TMS was a randomized controlled trial allocating patients with minor stroke or TIA to an intensified support program or conventional care. In this post hoc analysis, participants were categorized using hs-cTnT levels (5th generation; Roche Diagnostics, Manheim, Germany; 99th percentile upper reference limit [URL] = 14ng/l). Vascular risk was stratified using the ABCD<sup>2</sup> score (lower risk = 0–5 vs higher risk = 6–7). Cox proportional hazard regression was performed using covariate adjustment and propensity score matching (PSM) for the association between hs-cTnT and MACE (stroke/nonfatal coronary event/vascular death).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Among 889 patients (mean age = 70 years, 37% female), MACE occurred in 153 patients (17.2%) during a mean follow-up of 3.2 years. hs-cTnT was associated with MACE (9.3%/yr, &gt;URL vs 4.4%/yr, ≤URL, adjusted hazard ratio [HR] = 1.63 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.13–2.35], adjusted HR [Q<sub>4</sub> vs Q<sub>1</sub>] = 2.57 [95% CI = 1.35–4.97], adjusted HR [log-transformed] = 2.31 [95% CI = 1.37–3.89]). This association remained after PSM (adjusted HR = 1.76 [95% CI = 1.14–2.72]). There was a significant interaction between hs-cTnT and ABCD<sup>2</sup> category for MACE occurrence (<i>p</i>
<sub>interaction</sub> = 0.04). In the lower risk category, MACE rate was 9.5%/yr in patients with hs-cTnT &gt; URL, which was higher than in those ≤URL (3.8%/yr) and similar to the overall rate in the higher risk category.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>hs-cTnT levels are associated with incident MACE within 3 years after minor stroke or TIA and may help to identify high-risk individuals otherwise deemed at lower risk based on the ABCD<sup>2</sup> score. If confirmed in independent validation studies, this might warrant intensified secondary prevention measures and cardiac diagnostics in stroke patients with elevated hs-cTnT.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Do Maya women have the chance to improve their quality of life? [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Maya families suffered greatly during the henequen industry in the Yucatan, but the lives of the Maya women at the time were perhaps worse than anywhere in the world. Changes in Maya body height over the 20th century were assessed in order to show secular changes. The use of the sexual dimorphism index (SDI) allowed for the evaluation of the living conditions prevailing during the existence of the henequen haciendas to the Mexican revolution and a gradual improvement of these conditions by the end of the 20th century. Methods: In 1994, 364 men and 320 women aged 20-98 years were studied in Merida, Yucatan, Mexico. They were divided into six age groups and by gender: 20-29, 30-39, 40-49, 50-59, 60-69 and 70+ years. Stature for both genders, and age at menarche for women were considered. SDI in stature was calculated to assess living conditions. Results: There were smaller (0.25 cm/10 years) changes in height in men than in women (0.9 cm/10 years) and no significant changes in acceleration of maturation. SDI results showed changes from 9.9 to 7.6, and this may indicate a constant, but very small improvement of living conditions. The age at menarche of women did not show statistically significant acceleration with age. Conclusions: In the colonial period of the late 19th century until the Mexican Revolution, women were worse off than men. Previous research has shown that when living conditions change, men always react faster than women, e.g. by lowering or increasing body height. Our study of the Maya population in the 20th century showed otherwise; female height increased more than male height. This may reflect that the living conditions of Maya men have not changed over the 20th century, but have improved for women.

                Background: Since the emergence of HIV and the AIDS pandemic, the majority of risk-reduction interventions have been centred on the use of condoms in sex workers. Methods: This qualitative study recruited 25 male migrant sex workers in London to understand their risk perception and condomless sex experiences within the context of sex work and private life. The data was collected using face-to-face interviews, analysed using thematic analysis, and the findings interpreted through the theory of planned behaviour. Results: The themes explain that condomless sex with clients occurred when participants consciously accepted to perform this service deploying a risk assessment of clients, faulty strategies, and sexual practices to reduce their risk; or when they lost control because of recreational drugs, feeling attraction to clients, in precarious circumstances, or were victims of violence. Conversely, condomless sex with non-commercial partners occurred according to the type of relationship, with formal partners it was rationalised through emotional aspects attached to this kind of relationship, while with casual partners it was connected to sexual arousal and the use of alcohol and drugs.  Conclusions: Reinforce educational interventions to deliver STI-HIV information, enhance the use of condoms, and to address specific contextual factors that facilitate condomless practice with commercial and non-commercial sexual partners.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Quantifying endothelial cell proliferation in the zebrafish embryo [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: Endothelial cell (EC) proliferation is a fundamental determinant of vascular development and homeostasis, and contributes to cardiovascular disease by increasing vascular permeability to blood-borne lipoproteins. Rodents have been traditionally used to analyse EC proliferation mechanisms in vascular health and disease; however, alternative models such as the zebrafish embryo allow researchers to conduct small scale screening studies in a physiologically relevant vasculature whilst reducing the use of mammals in biomedical research. In vitro models of EC proliferation are valuable but do not fully recapitulate the complexity of the in vivo situation. Several groups have used zebrafish embryos for vascular biology research because they offer the advantages of an in vivo model in terms of complexity but are also genetically manipulable and optically transparent. Methods: Here we investigated whether zebrafish embryos can provide a suitable model for the study of EC proliferation. We explored the use of antibody, DNA labelling, and time-lapse imaging approaches. Results: Antibody and DNA labelling approaches were of limited use in zebrafish due to the low rate of EC proliferation combined with the relatively narrow window of time in which they can label proliferating nuclei. By contrast, time-lapse imaging of fluorescent proteins localised to endothelial nuclei was a sensitive method to quantify EC proliferation in zebrafish embryos. Discussion: We conclude that time-lapse imaging is suitable for analysis of endothelial cell proliferation in zebrafish, and that this method is capable of capturing more instances of EC proliferation than immunostaining or cell labelling alternatives. This approach is relevant to anyone studying endothelial cell proliferation for screening genes or small molecules involved in EC proliferation. It offers greater biological relevance than existing in vitro models such as HUVECs culture, whilst reducing the overall number of animals used for this type of research.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Status of self-esteem in medical students of a college in Kathmandu: A descriptive cross sectional study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Self-esteem is vital to living a happy, confident and content life. Medical students experience various forms of stress due to academic, financial and social pressures which could affect their levels of self-esteem. This study aims to study the status of self-esteem among undergraduates of a medical college at Tribhuvan University, Nepal. Methods: After receiving the ethical approval from the Institutional Review Committee (IRC) of NAIHS; we conducted a descriptive cross-sectional study among the first- to fifth-year medical students from December 2020 to April 2021. 190 were selected for the study using a stratified random sampling technique. This study used the Rosenberg self-esteem scale to measure self–esteem of the participants. A Google Forms questionnaire was sent to the participants via email. Then, the data obtained were entered in the Google sheet and later analyzed using SPSS 27. A Chi-square test was used to identify potential differences in self-esteem scores among different variables. A p-value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.  Results: This study included a total of 180 participants, among which, 18.9% (13.19% to 24.61%; at 95% CI) students showed low self -esteem. 74.4% (68.02% to 80.78%; at 95% CI) students had normal self-esteem and 6.7% (3.05% to 10.35%; at 95% CI) students had high self-esteem. The mean self-esteem score was 19.19 (15.01 to 23.37; at 95% CI). Female participants suffered more than males from low self-esteem, and third-year students had the highest percentage of low self-esteem (30.77%). Conclusion: The majority (74.4%) of medical students had normal self-esteem. However, 18.9% students had low self-esteem, among which, third-year students suffered the most (30.77%). Likewise, females exhibited higher prevalence of low self-esteem compared to males. Interventions to boost the level of self-esteem should be carried out to help medical students become confident and efficient doctors.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Prediction of Tensile Strength of 3D Printed Bronze PLA Part Using Response Surface Modelling [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background - 3D printing is a dynamic process with many process parameters influencing the product, including the type of the material; it is often difficult to understand the combined influence of these parameters.   Purpose - The tensile strength of 3D printed parts is important for the functionality of components. The effects of process parameters on tensile strength must therefore be examined. The objective of this study is to develop a response surface model (RSM) to predict the final quality of a 3D printed bronze part from a different set of input parameters.   Methods - The tensile test specimen was built in a Makerbot 3D printer with bronze polylactic acid (PLA) material. The three controllable input parameters were; thickness of layers, number of shells, and infill density. The three levels of layer thickness were 0.1mm, 0.2mm and 0.3mm. The number of shells was 2, 3 and 4. The infill densities were 20%, 30% and 40%. A tensile experiment tested the strength of the specimens. RSM is a statistical approach for modelling and analyzing how different variables affect the response of interest, and for optimizing it.   Results - The result obtained shows that the specimen with a high layer thickness of 0.3mm and infill density of 40% is the best among all the other parameters. Finally, the regression equation produced was used for random values of layer thickness, the number of shells, and infill density, to see whether the values obtained from the tests fall into the range of experimental data.   Conclusion - Infill density and layer thickness are the two criteria that significantly influence the tensile property. The number of shells has the least influence on the tensile property. However, the best tensile strength is the part printed with higher infill density, a greater number of shells, and higher layer thickness.

     alt="Constitutive tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-deficiency causes a reduction in spine density in mouse dentate granule cells accompanied by homeostatic adaptations of spine head size"/>
<p>TNF plays a role in physiological and pathophysiological processes in the CNS. To investigate whether constitutive TNF-deficiency affects the number and geometry of dendritic spines, dentate granule cells of TNF-deficient mice and controls were intracellularly filled and immunolabeled for the plasticity-related protein Synaptopodin (SP), which marks strong and stable spines. Spine head area, density, presence of SP and SP cluster size were analyzed blindly. Constitutively TNF-deficient granule cells had ∼20% fewer spines compared to controls and exhibited a homeostatic increase in head size of large SP+ spines. These changes are similar to those reported after entorhinal denervation of granule cells.

</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The majority of excitatory synapses terminating on cortical neurons are found on dendritic spines. The geometry of spines, in particular the size of the spine head, tightly correlates with the strength of the excitatory synapse formed with the spine. Under conditions of synaptic plasticity, spine geometry may change, reflecting functional adaptations. Since the cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF) has been shown to influence synaptic transmission as well as Hebbian and homeostatic forms of synaptic plasticity, we speculated that TNF-deficiency may cause concomitant structural changes at the level of dendritic spines. To address this question, we analyzed spine density and spine head area of Alexa568-filled granule cells in the dentate gyrus of adult C57BL/6J and TNF-deficient (TNF-KO) mice. Tissue sections were double-stained for the actin-modulating and plasticity-related protein synaptopodin (SP), a molecular marker for strong and stable spines. Dendritic segments of TNF-deficient granule cells exhibited ∼20% fewer spines in the outer molecular layer of the dentate gyrus compared to controls, indicating a reduced afferent innervation. Of note, these segments also had larger spines containing larger SP-clusters. This pattern of changes is strikingly similar to the one seen after denervation-associated spine loss following experimental entorhinal denervation of granule cells: Denervated granule cells increase the SP-content and strength of their remaining spines to homeostatically compensate for those that were lost. Our data suggest a similar compensatory mechanism in TNF-deficient granule cells in response to a reduction in their afferent innervation.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Motion and Geometric Feature Analysis for Real-time Automatic Micro-expression Recognition Systems [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                The trend of real-time micro-expression recognition systems has increased with recent advancements in human-computer interaction (HCI) in security and healthcare. Several studies in this field contributed towards recognition accuracy, while few studies look into addressing the computation costs. In this paper, two approaches for micro-expression feature extraction are analyzed for real-time automatic micro-expression recognition. Firstly, motion-based approach, which calculates motion of subtle changes from an image sequence and present as features. Then, secondly, a low computational geometric-based feature extraction technique, a very popular method for facial expression recognition in real-time. These approaches were integrated in a developed system together with a facial landmark detection algorithm and a classifier for real-time analysis. Moreover, the recognition performance were evaluated using SMIC, CASME, CAS(ME)2 and SAMM datasets. The results suggest that the optimized Bi-WOOF (leveraging on motion-based features) yields the highest accuracy of 68.5%, while the full-face graph (leveraging on geometric-based features) yields 75.53% on the SAMM dataset. On the other hand, the optimized Bi-WOOF processes sample at 0.36 seconds and full-face graph processes sample at 0.10 seconds with a 640x480 image size. All experiments were performed on an Intel i5-3470 machine.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The effectiveness of EMR implementation regarding reducing documentation errors and waiting time for patients in outpatient clinics: a systematic review [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Electronic medical records (EMRs) refer to the digital copies of paper notes prepared in the physician’s office, outpatient clinics and other departments in health care institutes. EMRs are considered to be significant and preferable to paper records because they allow providers to keep accurate track of patient data and monitoring over time, thus reducing errors, and enhance overall health care quality. The aim of this systematic review was to highlight the significance of EMRs and the effectiveness of implementation regarding reducing documentation errors and waiting time for patients in outpatient clinics. Methods: PubMed, Central, Ovid, Scopus, Science Direct, Elsevier, Cochrane , WHO website and the McMaster University Health Evidence website from 2005-2020 were searched to identify studies that investigated the association between the EMR implementation and documentation error and waiting time for patients. A reviewer screened identified citations and extracted data according to the PRISMA guidelines and data was synthesized in a narrative manner. Results: After full text examination of the articles selected for this literature review, the major themes of relevance that were identified in the context of reducing documentation errors and waiting time for patients in outpatient clinic include: reduction of medical errors because of fewer documentation errors resulting from EMR implementation and reduction of waiting time for patients due to overall improvement of system workflow after use of EMRs. Conclusion: In summary of the reviewed evidence from published material, the implementation of an EMR system in any outpatient setting appears to reduce documentation errors (medication dose errors, issues of prescription errors). It was also seen that in many settings, waiting time for patients in outpatient clinics was reduced with EMR use, while in other settings it was not possible to determine if any significant improvement was seen in this aspect after EMR implementation.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Disease burden and adverse pregnancy outcomes due to cardiovascular conditions complicating pregnancy in Sri Lanka: a protocol [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the commonest indirect medical cause of maternal deaths worldwide, both in high-income and low and middle-income countries. To minimize the effects of CVD in pregnancy, proper risk assessment and appropriate referral is required. In Sri Lanka, cardiovascular disease complicating pregnancy is a significant cause of maternal mortality, second only to postpartum hemorrhage. Screening for CVD in pregnancy in Sri Lanka is limited to a routine clinical assessment. Evidence-based guidelines are yet to be developed, and this deficit may have resulted in a substantial underestimation of the CVD burden. This study aims to determine the burden of CVD in early pregnancy and develop a risk prediction model to be used in field pregnancy clinics in Sri Lanka to reduce CVD effects in pregnancy. Methods A prospective cohort study was carried out in the Anuradhapura district, Sri Lanka. Following registration to the antenatal care, pregnant women fulfilling the eligibility criteria were invited to attend a special clinic at their relevant Medical Officer of Health (MOH) area. Risk assessment was done through history and a clinical examination, and suspected/probable cases were referred for an echocardiogram by a consultant cardiologist. All the recruited participants in the first trimester were prospectively followed up and screened again between 24–28 weeks of the period of amenorrhoea (POA). Antenatal ward admissions with CVD complicating pregnancy will be extracted, and a telephone interview will be carried out between 6–12 weeks after the expected delivery date to cover postpartum morbidities.  Discussion This proposed study will be the largest of its kind carried out in the local setting. The study's findings will be beneficial for policymakers to develop guidelines to reduce maternal cardiovascular disease morbidities and mortalities in Sri Lanka.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Essential oil of Cymbopogon martini, source of geraniol, as a potential antibacterial agent against Bacillus subtilis, a pathogen of the bakery industry [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Bacteria can adhere and grow on any surface due to their chemical and physical interaction, leading to the development of biofilms. Essential oils have a great potential for use in the food industry, as they can effectively prevent the presence of some pathogenic microorganisms.  Species such as those in the Bacillus genus have the ability to produce toxins. Some strains of Bacillus subtilis have been related to cases of food‐borne diseases. In the bakery industry, B. subtilis also has been related to “rope” disease, linked to bread preservation processes. Methods: The aim of the study was to analyse the antibacterial properties of 24 chemotyped essential oils against the growth of B. subtilis. The biological activity study was carried out using disk diffusion in agar and broth dilution methods. Results: The essential oil of Cymbopogon martinii var. motia had a high geraniol content (>80.53%) and showed a high antimicrobial effect against the Gram-positive bacterium B. subtilis. Binary combinations of Cymbopogon martinii var. motia oil with Eugenia caryophyllus showed antagonistic effects on B. subtilis. Conclusions:  The essential oil of Cymbopogon martinii var. motia has an interesting potential use in the bakery industry as a preservative, in applications such as nano encapsulation for bakery doughs, active packaging of baked products, or surface disinfectants.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Effect of Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation associated with aerobic exercise on the autonomic modulation of hemiparetic individuals due to stroke: a study protocol for a double-blind randomized controlled trial [version 2; peer review: 1 approved wi</a></h4>

              
                Background: Individuals after a stroke have an imbalance in the autonomic nervous system, which increases the risk of death or recurrent episodes of stroke. Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) combined with aerobic exercise has shown an effect on the modulation of this system. Objective: The Heart Rate Variability (HRV) and the distance traveled on the exercise bike will be assessed to verify the additional impact of tDCS combined with aerobic exercise on individuals with chronic stroke sequelae. Methods: The 34 adult individuals with diagnoses of chronic stroke will be randomized into two aerobic exercise intervention groups: G1 (with active tDCS) and G2 (with sham tDCS), three times a week, for 12 weeks. Procedures: tDCS will be implemented during the aerobic exercise with the anodal electrode positioned over the lateral dorsal prefrontal left cortex, and the cathodal electrode over the contralateral supraorbital region, with 2mA, for 20 minutes. Assessments will be carried out pre, immediately after the intervention, and on the 12th, 24th, 36th interventions, and 30 days later. The HRV data that are pulse interval (PI), square root of the mean of the squares of the differences between adjacent normal RR intervals (rMSSD), absolute high frequency (HF), absolute low frequency (LF), high and low frequency ratio (LF / HF) will be collected using a cardio frequency meter. The analysis of the distance traveled on the exercise bike before and after interventions will be analyzed in meters. Discussion: The autonomic control via brain networks after a stroke can be altered and can promote an increase in sympathetic tone, and a higher risk of sudden death or relapse of stroke.  It is crucial to demonstrate the effectiveness of available treatments to improve the autonomic function. Trial registration: The study is registered as a BRAZILIAN CLINICAL TEST RECORD (ReBEC): U1111-1222-4588 on the 2018/10/16

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/neuron/inpress.rss">A mechanism for inter-areal coherence through communication based on connectivity and oscillatory power</a></h4>

              
                Schneider et al. establish a mechanism for inter-areal coherence between field potentials, where it is the result and not the cause of communication. Consequently, coherence depends in a lawful manner on connectivity and power and does not require spiking entrainment. This mechanism explains behavior-related changes in fronto-parietal and LGN-V1 coherence.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A pre-screening strategy to assess resected tumor margins by imaging cytoplasmic viscosity and hypoxia</a></h4>

              
                To assure complete tumor removal, frozen section analysis is the most common procedure for intraoperative pathological assessment of resected tumor margins. However, during one operation, multiple biopsies may be sent for examination, but only few of them are made into cryosections because of the complex preparation protocols and time-consuming pathological analysis, which potentially increases the risk of overlooking tumor involvement. Here, we propose a fluorescence-based pre-screening strategy that allows high-throughput, convenient, and fast gross assessment of resected tumor margins. A dual-activatable cationic fluorescent molecular rotor was developed to specifically illuminate live tumor cells’ cytoplasm by emitting two different fluorescence signals in response to elevations in hypoxia-induced nitroreductase (a biochemical marker) and cytoplasmic viscosity (a biophysical marker), two characteristics of cancer cells. The ability of the fluorescent molecular rotor in detecting tumor cells was evaluated in mouse and human specimens of multiple tissues by comparing with hematoxylin and eosin staining. Importantly, the fluorescent molecular rotor achieved 100% specificity in discriminating lung and liver cancers from normal tissue, allowing pre-screening of the tumor-free surgical margins and promoting clinical decision. Altogether, this type of fluorescent molecular rotor and the proposed strategy may serve as a new option to facilitate intraoperative assessment of resected tumor margins.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A beta-glucosidase of an insect herbivore determines both toxicity and deterrence of a dandelion defense metabolite</a></h4>

              
                Gut enzymes can metabolize plant defense compounds and thereby affect the growth and fitness of insect herbivores. Whether these enzymes also influence feeding preference is largely unknown. We studied the metabolization of taraxinic acid β-D-glucopyranosyl ester (TA-G), a sesquiterpene lactone of the common dandelion (<i>Taraxacum officinale</i>) that deters its major root herbivore, the common cockchafer larva (<i>Melolontha melolontha</i>). We have demonstrated that TA-G is rapidly deglucosylated and conjugated to glutathione in the insect gut. A broad-spectrum <i>M. melolontha</i> β-glucosidase, Mm_bGlc17, is sufficient and necessary for TA-G deglucosylation. Using cross-species RNA interference, we have shown that Mm_bGlc17 reduces TA-G toxicity. Furthermore, Mm_bGlc17 is required for the preference of <i>M. melolontha</i> larvae for TA-G-deficient plants. Thus, herbivore metabolism modulates both the toxicity and deterrence of a plant defense compound. Our work illustrates the multifaceted roles of insect digestive enzymes as mediators of plant-herbivore interactions.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Transcription initiation at a consensus bacterial promoter proceeds via a 'bind-unwind-load-and-lock' mechanism</a></h4>

              
                Transcription initiation starts with unwinding of promoter DNA by RNA polymerase (RNAP) to form a catalytically competent RNAP-promoter complex (RP<sub>O</sub>). Despite extensive study, the mechanism of promoter unwinding has remained unclear, in part due to the transient nature of intermediates on path to RPo. Here, using single-molecule unwinding-induced fluorescence enhancement to monitor promoter unwinding, and single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer to monitor RNAP clamp conformation, we analyze RPo formation at a consensus bacterial core promoter. We find that the RNAP clamp is closed during promoter binding, remains closed during promoter unwinding, and then closes further, locking the unwound DNA in the RNAP active-centre cleft. Our work defines a new, 'bind-unwind-load-and-lock' model for the series of conformational changes occurring during promoter unwinding at a consensus bacterial promoter and provides the tools needed to examine the process in other organisms and at other promoters.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Fibrinogen αC-subregions critically contribute blood clot fibre growth, mechanical stability and resistance to fibrinolysis</a></h4>

              
                Fibrinogen is essential for blood coagulation. The C-terminus of the fibrinogen α-chain (αC-region) is composed of an αC-domain and αC-connector. Two recombinant fibrinogen variants (α390 and α220) were produced to investigate the role of subregions in modulating clot stability and resistance to lysis. The α390 variant, truncated before the αC-domain, produced clots with a denser structure and thinner fibres. In contrast, the α220 variant, truncated at the start of the αC-connector, produced clots that were porous with short, stunted fibres and visible fibre ends. These clots were mechanically weak and susceptible to lysis. Our data demonstrate differential effects for the αC-subregions in fibrin polymerisation, clot mechanical strength, and fibrinolytic susceptibility. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the αC-subregions are key for promoting longitudinal fibre growth. Together, these findings highlight critical functions of the αC-subregions in relation to clot structure and stability, with future implications for development of novel therapeutics for thrombosis.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">IFN-γ mediates Paneth cell death via suppression of mTOR</a></h4>

              
                Paneth cells constitutively produce antimicrobial peptides and growth factors that allow for intestinal homeostasis, host protection and intestinal stem cell replication. Paneth cells rely heavily on the glycolytic metabolic program, which is in part controlled by the kinase complex Mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTORC1). Yet, little is known about mTOR importance in Paneth cell integrity under steady state and inflammatory conditions. Our results demonstrate that IFN-γ, a crucial mediator of the intestinal inflammation, acts directly on murine Paneth cells to alter their mitochondrial integrity and membrane potential, resulting in an mTORC1-dependent cell death mechanism distinct from canonical cell death pathways including apoptosis, necroptosis, and pyroptosis. These results were established with the purified cytokine and a physiologically relevant common Th1-inducing human parasite <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i>. Given the crucial role for IFN-γ, which is a cytokine frequently associated with the development of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and compromised Paneth cell functions, the identified mechanisms underlying mTORC1-dependent Paneth cell death downstream of IFN-γ may provide promising novel approaches for treating intestinal inflammation.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Protein Phosphatase 1 in association with Bud14 inhibits mitotic exit in Saccharomyces cerevisiae</a></h4>

              
                Mitotic exit in budding yeast is dependent on correct orientation of the mitotic spindle along the cell polarity axis. When accurate positioning of the spindle fails, a surveillance mechanism named the Spindle Position Checkpoint (SPOC) prevents cells from exiting mitosis. Mutants with a defective SPOC become multinucleated and lose their genomic integrity. Yet, a comprehensive understanding of the SPOC mechanism is missing. In this study, we identified the type 1 protein phosphatase, Glc7, in association with its regulatory protein Bud14 as a novel checkpoint component. We further showed that Glc7-Bud14 promotes dephosphorylation of the SPOC effector protein Bfa1. Our results suggest a model in which two mechanisms act in parallel for a robust checkpoint response: first, the SPOC kinase Kin4 isolates Bfa1 away from the inhibitory kinase Cdc5 and second, Glc7-Bud14 dephosphorylates Bfa1 to fully activate the checkpoint effector.

                The P23H mutation in rhodopsin (Rho), the visual pigment protein in rod photoreceptor neurons, is the most common genetic cause of autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa (adRP), a retinal disease that causes blindness. Despite multiple studies in animal models, the subcellular details of the fate of misfolded mutant Rho in rod photoreceptors have not been completely defined. We generated a new mouse model of adRP, in which the P23H-Rho mutant allele is fused to Tag-RFP-T (P23HhRhoRFP). In heterozygotes, outer segments formed, and WT rhodopsin was properly localized there, but mutant P23H-Rho protein was specifically mislocalized in the inner segments of rods. Despite this cellular phenotype, the P23HhRhoRFP heterozygous mice exhibited only slowly progressing retinal degeneration; in ERG recordings, scotopic a-wave amplitudes were reduced by 24% and 26% at 30 days and 90 days respectively, and the corresponding scotopic b-waves by 18% and 24%. Outer nuclear layer thickness was still 80% of WT at 90 days, but at 364 days had declined to 40% of WT. Transmission electron microscopy revealed greatly expanded membrane lamellae in the inner segment, and by fluorescence imaging, we determined that the mislocalized P23HhRhoRFP was contained in greatly expanded endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes. TUNEL staining revealed a slow pace of cell death involving chromosomal endonucleolytic degradation. Quantification of mRNA for markers of ER stress and the unfolded protein response revealed little or no increases in levels of messages encoding the proteins BiP, CHOP, ATF6, XBP1, PERK, Eif2 and Derlin-1, but a decreased level of total Rhodopsin (mouse + human) mRNA levels. The decline in the rate of cell death after an initial burst suggests that P23HhRhoRFP mutant rods undergo an adaptative process that prolongs survival despite gross P23HhRhoRFP protein accumulation in the ER. Because of its slowly progressing nature, and easy visualization of the mutant protein, the P23H-Rho-RFP mouse may represent a useful tool for the future study of the pathology and treatment of P23H-Rho and adRP.

	<p>Correct blinding is essential for preventing potential biases. The aim of this study was to assess the blinding of participants and a therapist following treatment with transcranial direct current stimulation in subjects with fibromyalgia using James’ and Bang’s blinding indexes. Eighty subjects were randomly allocated either active or sham stimulation groups in an intervention of five sessions lasting 20 min each. A questionnaire was delivered to both the therapist and patients after the last session to record their guess of which treatment had been applied. No differences between the groups were noted at baseline in terms of demographic or clinical data. James’ BI was 0.83 (CI 95%: 0.76–0.90) for the patients and 0.55 (CI 95%: 0.45–0.64) for the therapist. Bang’s BI for subjects was −0.08 (CI 95%: −0.24–0.09) and −0.8 (CI 95%: −0.26–0.1) for the active and sham transcranial direct current stimulation groups, respectively. Bang’s BI for the therapist was 0.21 (CI 95%: −0.02–0.43) and 0.13 (CI 95%: −0.09–0.35) for the active and sham transcranial direct current stimulation groups, respectively. Protocols of active and sham transcranial direct current stimulation applied in this study have shown satisfactory blinding of the therapist and subjects with fibromyalgia.</p>

	<p>(1) Background: Complement system activation has been proposed as one of the different factors that contribute to Multiple Sclerosis (MS) pathogenesis. In this study, we aimed to describe the potential effects of eculizumab, an anticomplement therapy, on MS disease activity in a cohort of relapsing–remitting (RR) MS patients who discontinued IFN-β therapy due to IFN-β-related thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) onset. (2) Methods: In this retrospective observational multicentric study, we searched for all patients with MS treated by eculizumab with a survey of several nephrological and neurological centers (over 45 centers). (3) Results: Nine patients were included. The mean follow-up time under eculizumab was 3.72 ± 2.58 years. There were no significant differences in disease activity (EDSS, relapses, new T2, and/or Gd-enhancing lesions at MRI) considering the two years before and after eculizumab therapy. No adverse events potentially related to eculizumab therapy were reported during follow-up. (4) Conclusions: In this preliminary study, we described a good safety profile for eculizumab therapy in MS. However, the available data are not sufficient to make firm conclusions about the possible efficacy of eculizumab as a disease-modifying therapy for MS patients.</p>

	<p>Few systematic evaluations have been performed of the efficacy of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) as a relapse prevention strategy in major depressive disorder (MDD). This is a single-blind, multicenter, randomized controlled trial to compare the efficacy and tolerability of pharmacotherapy plus maintenance ECT (M-Pharm/ECT) versus pharmacotherapy alone (M-Pharm) in the prevention of MDD relapse. Subjects with MDD who had remitted with bilateral acute ECT (n = 37) were randomly assigned to receive M-Pharm/ECT (n = 19, 14 treatments) or M-Pharm (n = 18) for nine months. The subjects were followed up for 15 months. The main outcome was relapse of depression, defined as a score of 18 or more on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. At nine months, 35% of the subjects treated with M-Pharm/ECT relapsed as compared with 61% of the patients treated with M-Pharm. No statistically significant differences between groups were indicated by either Kaplan–Meier or Cox proportional hazards regression analyses. The subjects without psychotic features were at higher risk of relapse. There were no statistically significant differences in the MMSE scores of the two groups at the end of the study. Further studies are needed to better define the indications for M-ECT in order to improve its efficacy as a relapse prevention strategy.</p>

	<p>Inter-individual and sex differences in pain responses are recognized but their mechanisms are not well understood. This study was intended to provide the behavioral framework for analyses of pain mechanisms using fear extinction learning as a predictor of phenotypic and sex differences in sensory (mechanical withdrawal thresholds) and emotional-affective aspects (open field tests for anxiety-like behaviors and audible and ultrasonic components of vocalizations) of acute and chronic pain. In acute arthritis and chronic neuropathic pain models, greater increases in vocalizations were found in females than males and in females with poor fear extinction abilities than females with strong fear extinction, particularly in the neuropathic pain model. Female rats showed higher anxiety-like behavior than males under baseline conditions but no inter-individual or sex differences were seen in the pain models. No inter-individual and sex differences in mechanosensitivity were observed. The data suggest that vocalizations are uniquely suited to detect inter-individual and sex differences in pain models, particularly in chronic neuropathic pain, whereas no such differences were found for mechanosensitivity, and baseline differences in anxiety-like behaviors disappeared in the pain models.</p>

	<p>The restraining measures due to the COVID-19 outbreak deeply affected the general population’s sleep health and psychological status. The current literature proposes young and older people as two particularly at-risk groups. However, the differential impact of the lockdown period in these specific age categories needs to be disentangled. Through a web-based survey adopting validated questionnaires, we evaluated and compared sleep quality/habits, insomnia, perceived stress, depression, and anxiety symptoms of Italian late adolescents (n = 670; mean age ± SD, 19.38 ± 0.74, 18–20 years) and elderly (n = 253; 68.18 ± 2.79, 65–75 years). Young respondents reported more severe insomnia symptoms, worse subjective sleep quality, longer sleep latency, higher daytime dysfunction, and a more prevalent disruption of sleep habits (bedtime, get-up time, nap) than the elderly. On the other hand, older participants showed shorter sleep duration, lower habitual sleep efficiency, and greater use of sleep medications. Finally, the younger population displayed higher levels of depression and perceived stress. Our findings indicate that the lockdown period had more pervasive repercussions on sleep and the mental health of late adolescents. The implementation of supportive strategies is encouraged for this vulnerable population group.</p>

	<p>Microglia, the immune cells in the brain involved in both homeostasis and injury/infection control, play a predominant role in neurodegenerative diseases. In vivo studies on microglia are limited due to the requirement of surgical intervention, which can lead to the destruction of the tissues. Over the last few years, multiple protocols—presenting a variety of strategies—have described microglia differentiation issued from human pluripotent stem cells. Herein, we have reanalyzed the transcriptomes released on six different microglia differentiation protocols and revealed a consensus core of master transcription regulatory circuitry defining microglia identity. Furthermore, we have discussed the major divergencies among the studied protocols and have provided suggestions to further enhance microglia differentiation assays.</p>

	<p>There is evidence that abnormalities in eye movements exist during reading in dyslexic individuals. A few recent studies applied Machine Learning (ML) classifiers to such eye movement data to predict dyslexia. A general problem with these studies is that eye movement data sets are limited to reading saccades and fixations that are confounded by reading difficulty, e.g., it is unclear whether abnormalities are the consequence or the cause of reading difficulty. Recently, Ward and Kapoula used LED targets (with the REMOBI &amp;amp;amp; AIDEAL method) to demonstrate abnormalities of large saccades and vergence eye movements in depth demonstrating intrinsic eye movement problems independent from reading in dyslexia. In another study, binocular eye movements were studied while reading two texts: one using the “Alouette” text, which has no meaning and requires word decoding, the other using a meaningful text. It was found the Alouette text exacerbates eye movement abnormalities in dyslexics. In this paper, we more precisely quantify the quality of such eye movement descriptors for dyslexia detection. We use the descriptors produced in the four different setups as input to multiple classifiers and compare their generalization performances. Our results demonstrate that eye movement data from the Alouette test predicts dyslexia with an accuracy of 81.25%; similarly, we were able to predict dyslexia with an accuracy of 81.25% when using data from saccades to LED targets on the Remobi device and 77.3% when using vergence movements to LED targets. Noticeably, eye movement data from the meaningful text produced the lowest accuracy (70.2%). In a subsequent analysis, ML algorithms were applied to predict reading speed based on eye movement descriptors extracted from the meaningful reading, then from Remobi saccade and vergence tests. Remobi vergence eye movement descriptors can predict reading speed even better than eye movement descriptors from the meaningful reading test.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The neurons in the rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM) play a major role in pain modulation. We have previously shown that early-life noxious bladder stimuli in rats resulted in an overall spinal GABAergic disinhibition and a long-lasting bladder/colon sensitization when tested in adulthood. However, the neuromolecular alterations within RVM neurons in the pathophysiology of early life bladder inflammation have not been elucidated. In this study, we have identified and characterized RVM neurons that are synaptically linked to the bladder and colon and examined the effect of neonatal bladder inflammation on molecular expressions of these neurons. A transient bladder inflammation was induced by intravesicular instillation of protamine sulfate and zymosan during postnatal days 14 through 16 (P14-16) followed by pseudorabies virus PRV-152 and PRV-614 injections into the bladder and colon, respectively, on postnatal day P60. Tissues were examined 96 hours post-inoculation for serotonergic, GABAergic, and enkephalinergic expressions using In situ Hybridization and/or Immunohistochemistry techniques. The results revealed that &gt;50% of RVM neurons that are synaptically connected to the bladder (i.e., PRV-152+) were GABAergic, 40% enkephalinergic, and about 14% expressing serotonergic marker TpH2. Neonatal cystitis resulted in a significant increase in converging neurons in RVM receiving dual synaptic inputs from the bladder and colon. In addition, neonatal cystitis significantly downregulated GABA transporter VGAT with a concomitant increase in TpH2 expression in bladder-linked RVM neurons suggesting an alteration in supraspinal signaling. These alterations of synaptic connectivity and GABAergic/serotonergic expressions in RVM neurons may contribute to bladder pain modulation and cross-organ visceral sensitivity.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Early evoked brain activity underlies auditory and audiovisual speech recognition deficits in schizophrenia</a></h4>

              
                ObjectivesPeople with Schizophrenia (SZ) show deficits in auditory and audiovisual speech recognition. It is possible that these deficits are related to aberrant early sensory processing, combined with an impaired ability to utilize visual cues to improve speech recognition. In this electroencephalography study we tested this by having SZ and healthy controls (HC) identify different unisensory auditory and bisensory audiovisual syllables at different auditory noise levels.

MethodsSZ (N = 24) and HC (N = 21) identified one of three different syllables (/da/, /ga/, /ta/) at three different noise levels (no, low, high). Half the trials were unisensory auditory and the other half provided additional visual input of moving lips. Task-evoked mediofrontal N1 and P2 brain potentials triggered to the onset of the auditory syllables were derived and related to behavioral performance.

ResultsIn comparison to HC, SZ showed speech recognition deficits for unisensory and bisensory stimuli. These deficits were primarily found in the no noise condition. Paralleling these observations, reduced N1 amplitudes to unisensory and bisensory stimuli in SZ were found in the no noise condition. In HC the N1 amplitudes were positively related to the speech recognition performance, whereas no such relationships were found in SZ. Moreover, no group differences in multisensory speech recognition benefits and N1 suppression effects for bisensory stimuli were observed.

ConclusionOur study shows that reduced N1 amplitudes relate to auditory and audiovisual speech processing deficits in SZ. The findings that the amplitude effects were confined to salient speech stimuli and the attenuated relationship with behavioral performance, compared to HC, indicates a diminished decoding of the auditory speech signals in SZs. Our study also revealed intact multisensory benefits in SZs, which indicates that the observed auditory and audiovisual speech recognition deficits were primarily related to aberrant auditory speech processing.

HighlightsSpeech processing deficits in schizophrenia related to reduced N1 amplitudes Audiovisual suppression effect in N1 preserved in schizophrenia Schizophrenia showed weakened P2 components in specifically audiovisual processing

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Human pluripotent stem cell-derived photoreceptors switch from cell autonomous axon extension to non-cell autonomous process pulling during synaptic marker redistribution.</a></h4>

              
                Photoreceptors (PRs) are the primary visual sensory cells, and their loss leads to blindness that is currently incurable. Cell replacement therapy holds promise as a therapeutic approach to restore vision to those who have lost PRs through damage or disease. While PR transplant research is ongoing in animal models, success is hindered by our limited understanding of PR axon growth during development and regeneration. Using a human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC) reporter line that labels PRs (WA09 CRX+/tdTomato), we generated retinal organoids in order to study mechanisms of PR process extension. We found that the earliest born PRs exhibit autonomous axon extension from dynamic terminals that appear similar to projection neuron growth cones. However, as hPSC-derived PRs age from 40 to 80 days of differentiation, they lose dynamic terminals in 2D plated cultures and within 3D retinal organoids, which does not correlate with cell birth date. Using a rod-specific hPSC reporter line (WA09 NRL+/eGFP), we further determined that rod PRs never form motile growth cones. Interestingly, PRs without motile terminals are still capable of extending axons, but neurites are generated from process stretching via their attachment to motile non-PR cells, which underlies the observed differences in PR neurite lengths on different substrata. While immobile PR terminals express actin, it is less polymerized and less organized than actin present in motile terminals. However, immobile PRs do localize synaptic proteins to their terminals, suggesting a normal developmental progression. These findings help inform the development of PR transplant therapies to treat blinding diseases and provide a platform to test treatments that restore autonomous PR axon extension.

                Flexible mapping between activity in sensory systems and movement parameters is a hallmark of successful motor control. This flexibility depends on continuous comparison of short-term postural dynamics and the longer-term goals of an animal, thereby necessitating neural mechanisms that can operate across multiple timescales. To understand how such body-brain interactions emerge to control movement across timescales, we performed whole-cell patch recordings from visual neurons involved in course control in Drosophila. We demonstrate that the activity of leg mechanosensory cells, propagating via specific ascending neurons, is critical to provide a clock signal to the visual circuit for stride-by-stride steering adjustments and, at longer timescales, information on speed-associated motor context to flexibly recruit visual circuits for course control. Thus, our data reveal a stride-based mechanism for the control of high-performance walking operating at multiple timescales. We propose that this mechanism functions as a general basis for adaptive control of locomotion.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Early mitochondrial stress and metabolic imbalance lead to photoreceptor cell death in retinal degeneration</a></h4>

              
                Neurodegenerative diseases exhibit extensive genetic heterogeneity and complex etiology with varying onset and severity. To deduce the mechanism leading to retinal degeneration, we adopted a temporal multi-omics approach and examined molecular and cellular events before the onset of photoreceptor cell death in the widely-used Pde6brd1/rd1 (rd1) mouse model. Transcriptome profiling of neonatal and developing rods revealed early downregulation of genes associated with anabolic pathways and energy metabolism. Quantitative proteomics of rd1 retina showed early changes in calcium signaling and oxidative phosphorylation, with specific partial bypass of complex I electron transfer, which precede the onset of cell death. Concurrently, we detected alterations in central carbon metabolism, including dysregulation of components associated with glycolysis, pentose phosphate and purine biosynthesis. Ex vivo assays of oxygen consumption and transmission electron microscopy validated early and progressive mitochondrial stress and abnormalities in mitochondrial structure and function of rd1 rods. These data uncover mitochondrial over-activation and related metabolic alterations as early determinants of pathology and implicate dysregulation of calcium signaling as the initiator of higher mitochondrial stress, which then transitions to mitochondrial damage and photoreceptor cell death in retinal degeneration. Our studies support the one hit model arguing against the cumulative damage hypothesis but suggest that cell death in neurodegenerative disease is initiated by specific rather than a random event.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Investigating Emotion Dynamics and Its Association with Multimedia Content During Video Watching Through EEG Microstate Analysis</a></h4>

              
                Emotions dynamically change in response to ever-changing environments. It is of great importance, both clinically and scientifically, to investigate the neural representation and evoking mechanism of emotion dynamics. But, there are many unknown places in this stream of research, such as consistent and conclusive findings are still lacking. In this work, we perform an in-depth investigation of emotion dynamics under a video-watching task by gauging the dynamic associations among evoked emotions, electroencephalography (EEG) responses, and multimedia stimulation. Here, we introduce EEG microstate analysis to study emotional EEG signals, which provides a spatial-temporal neural representation of emotion dynamics. To investigate the temporal characteristics of evoking emotions during video watching with its neural mechanism, we conduct two studies from the perspective of EEG microstates. In Study 1, the dynamic microstate activities under different emotion states and emotion levels are explored to identify EEG spatial-temporal correlates of emotion dynamics. In Study 2, the stimulation effects of multimedia content (visual and audio) on EEG microstate activities are examined to learn about the involved affective information and investigate the emotion-evoking mechanism. The results show that emotion dynamics could be well reflected by four EEG microstates (MS1, MS2, MS3, and MS4). Specifically, emotion tasks lead to an increase in MS2 and MS4 coverage but a decrease in MS3 coverage, duration, and occurrence. Meanwhile, there exists a negative association between valence and MS4 occurrence as well as a positive association between arousal and MS3 coverage and occurrence. Further, we find that MS4 and MS3 activities are significantly affected by visual and audio content, respectively. In this work, we verify the possibility to reveal emotion dynamics through EEG microstate analysis from sensory and stimulation dimensions, where EEG microstate features are found to be highly correlated to different emotion states (emotion task effect and level effect) and different affective information involved in the multimedia content (visual and audio). Our work deepens the understanding of the neural representation and evoking mechanism of emotion dynamics, which can be beneficial for future development in the applications of emotion decoding and regulation.

                The ability of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) to exert top-down control of behavior is affected by stress. The molecular response of mPFC to stress is incompletely understood, however, in part because of the region's cellular heterogeneity. Here we used single nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNAseq) to map specific molecular cell types within the mPFC and to detect cell-type specific transcriptional changes to foot-shock stress. We identified Ptgs2, encoding cyclo-oxygenase 2, as an important candidate that is upregulated in layer II/III excitatory neurons after stress. Specifically, Ptgs2 was transiently upregulated with shock-induced fear learning and fear expression, along with Bdnf, Nptx2, and Lingo1, in a layer II/III neuronal population marked by the neuronal excitatory gene Slc17a7 and cell-type specific neuropeptide Penk. These dynamic cell-type specific expression patterns identified with snRNAseq were validated with quantitative fluorescent in situ hybridization. Using a pharmacological approach, we found that systemic lumiracoxib, a selective Ptgs2-inhibitor, led to a significant reduction in fear expression. Furthermore, genetic ablation of Ptgs2 in excitatory Camk2a-expressing neurons led to reduced stress-induced anxiety-like behaviors. Together these findings suggest that Ptgs2 is expressed in a dynamic, cell-type specific way in Layer II/III Penk+ neurons in mPFC, and that its role in prostaglandin and /or endocannabinoid regulation within these neurons may be an important mediator of stress-related behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Astrocytes encode complex behaviorally relevant information</a></h4>

              
                Astrocytes, glial cells of the central nervous system, help to regulate neural circuit operation and adaptation. They exhibit complex forms of chemical excitation, most prominently calcium transients, evoked by neuromodulator and -transmitter receptor activation. However, whether and how astrocytes contribute to cortical processing of complex behavior remains unknown. One of the puzzling features of astrocyte calcium transients is the high degree of variability in their spatial and temporal patterns under behaving conditions. Here, we provide mechanistic links between astrocytes' activity patterns, molecular signaling, and behavioral cognitive and motor activity variables by employing a visual detection task that allows for in vivo calcium imaging, robust statistical analyses, and machine learning approaches. We show that trial type and performance levels deterministically shape astrocytes' spatial and temporal response properties. Astrocytes encode the animals' decision, reward, and sensory properties. Our error analysis confirms that astrocytes carry behaviorally relevant information depending on and complementing neuronal coding. We also report that cell-intrinsic mechanisms curb astrocyte calcium activity. Additionally, we show that motor activity-related parameters strongly impact astrocyte responses and must be considered in sensorimotor study designs. Our data inform and constrain current models of astrocytes' contribution to complex behavior and brain computation beyond their established homeostatic and metabolic roles.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To describe the neuropathological features of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR)-encephalitis in an archival autopsy cohort.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We examined four autopsies from patients with NMDAR-encephalitis; two patients were untreated, three had comorbidities: small cell lung cancer, brain post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD), and overlapping demyelination.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The two untreated patients had inflammatory infiltrates predominantly composed of perivascular and parenchymal CD3<sup>+</sup>/CD8<sup>−</sup> T cells and CD79a<sup>+</sup> B cells/plasma cells in basal ganglia, amygdala, and hippocampus with surrounding white matter. The hippocampi showed a significant decrease of NMDAR-immunoreactivity that correlated with disease severity. The patient with NMDAR-encephalitis and immunosuppression for kidney transplantation developed a brain monomorphic PTLD. Inflammatory changes were compatible with NMDAR-encephalitis. Additionally, plasma cells accumulated in the vicinity of the necrotic tumor along with macrophages and activated microglia that strongly expressed pro-inflammatory activation markers HLA-DR, CD68, and IL18. The fourth patient developed demyelinating lesions in the setting of a relapse 4 years after NMDAR-encephalitis. These lesions exhibited the hallmarks of classic multiple sclerosis with radially expanding lesions and remyelinated shadow plaques without complement or immunoglobulin deposition, compatible with a pattern I demyelination.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The topographic distribution of inflammation in patients with NMDAR-encephalitis reflects the clinical symptoms of movement disorders, abnormal behavior, and memory dysfunction with inflammation dominantly observed in basal ganglia, amygdala, and hippocampus, and loss of NMDAR-immunoreactivity correlates with disease severity. Co-occurring pathologies influence the spatial distribution, composition, and intensity of inflammation, which may modify patients’ clinical presentation and outcome.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Reliability and Stability Challenges in ABCD Task fMRI Data</a></h4>

              
                Trait stability of measures is an essential requirement for individual differences research. Functional MRI has been increasingly used in studies that rely on the assumption of trait stability, such as attempts to relate task related brain activation to individual differences in behavior and psychopathology. However, recent research using adult samples has questioned the trait stability of task-fMRI measures, as assessed by test-retest correlations. To date, little is known about trait stability of task fMRI in children. Here, we examined within-session reliability and longitudinal stability of task-fMRI using data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study using its tasks focused on reward processing, response inhibition, and working memory. We also evaluated the effects of factors potentially affecting reliability and stability. Reliability and stability [quantified via an intraclass correlation (ICC) that focuses on rank consistency] was poor in virtually all brain regions, with an average ICC of .078 and .054 for short (within-session) and long-term (between-session) ICCs, respectively, in regions of interest (ROIs) historically-recruited by the tasks. ICC values in ROIs did not exceed the  poor cut-off of .4, and in fact rarely exceeded .2 (only 5.9%). Motion had a pronounced effect on estimated ICCs, with the lowest motion quartile of participants having a mean reliability/stability three times higher (albeit still  poor) than the highest motion quartile. Regions with stronger activation tended to show higher ICCs, with the absolute value of activity and reliability/stability correlating at .53. Across regions, the magnitude of age-related longitudinal (between-session) changes positively correlated with the longitudinal stability of individual differences, which suggests developmental change was not necessarily responsible for poor stability. Poor reliability and stability of task-fMRI, particularly in children, diminishes potential utility of fMRI data due to a drastic reduction of effect sizes and, consequently, statistical power for the detection of brain-behavior associations. This essential issue needs to be addressed through optimization of preprocessing pipelines and data denoising methods.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Evaluating Network Threshold Selection for Structural and Functional Brain Connectomes</a></h4>

              
                Structural and functional brain connectomes represent macroscale neurophysical data collected through methods such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Such data may contain noise that contribute to false positive edges, which motivates the use of edge-wise thresholding. Thresholding procedures are useful for reducing network density in graphs to retain only the most informative, non-noisy edges. Nevertheless, limited consensus exists on selecting appropriate threshold levels. We compare existing thresholding methods and introduce a novel thresholding approach in the context of MRI-derived and simulated brain connectomes. Performance is measured using normalized mutual information (NMI), a quantity robust to arbitrary changes in partition labeling, and describes the similarity of community structure between two node-matched networks. We found that the percolation-based threshold and our newly proposed objective function-based threshold exhibited the best performance in terms of NMI. We show an application of these two thresholding methods to real data that showed that both percolation-based and objective function-based thresholding provide statistically similar NMI values between real world FC networks and structural connectivity (SC) counterparts, where shared modular structure is assumed. The two thresholding methods, however, achieve these NMI values at significantly different thresholds (p<0.0001) in both simulated and real networks. Moreover, the threshold obtained from the objective function gives a more accurate estimate of the number of modules present in the network and includes more flexibility in threshold selection, suggesting that this method may represent a useful option for graph thresholding.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neural mechanisms underlying anxiety-related deficits of attentional inhibition: direct ERP evidence from the Pd component</a></h4>

              
                Behavioral evidence shows that anxious individuals tend to be distracted by irrelevant stimulation not only for threat-related stimuli but also for non-emotional neutral stimuli. These findings suggest that anxious individuals may have a general impairment of attentional control, especially inhibition function. However, the neural mechanism underlying the anxiety-related impairment in attentional control is unclear. Here, in a visual search task with geometric stimuli, we examined attentional processing of the non-emotional neutral distractor on participants with different levels of anxiety, using the event-related-potential (ERP) indices of attentional selection (N2 posterior contralateral [N2pc]) and top-down inhibition (distractor positivity [Pd]). We found that distractor-evoked Pd amplitudes were negatively correlated with trait-anxiety scores, i.e., the higher the level of anxiety, the worse the ability of attentional inhibition. In contrast, the amplitudes of distractor-evoked N2pc did not vary with anxiety levels, suggesting that trait-anxiety level does not affect stimulus-driven attentional capture. We also observed attentional processing of target stimuli and found that the peak latency of target-evoked N2pc was delayed as anxiety levels rise, suggesting that anxiety impairs the efficiency of top-down attentional selection of the target. The present study provides direct neurophysiological evidence for general anxiety-related impairment of attentional control.

                Self-grooming is a stereotyped behavior displayed by nearly all animals. Among other established functions, self-grooming is implicated in social communication in some animals. However, whether self-grooming specifically influences behaviors of nearby individuals has not been directly tested, partly due to the technical challenge of inducing self-grooming in a reliable and temporally controllable manner. We recently found that optogenetic activation of dopamine D3 receptor expressing neurons in the ventral striatal islands of Calleja robustly induces orofacial grooming in mice. Using this optogenetic manipulation, here we demonstrate that observer mice display social preference for grooming over non-grooming mice regardless of biological sex. Moreover, grooming-induced social attraction depends on volatile chemosensory cues broadcasted from grooming mice. Collectively, our study establishes self-grooming as a means of promoting social interaction among mice via volatile cues, suggesting an additional benefit for animals to allocate a significant amount of time to this behavior.

                A long-term change in neurotransmitter release is a widely expressed mechanism controlling neural circuits in the mammalian brain. This presynaptic plasticity is commonly mediated by retrograde signaling whereby a messenger released from the postsynaptic neuron upon activity modifies neurotransmitter release in a long-term manner by targeting a presynaptic receptor. In the dentate gyrus (DG), the main input area of the hippocampus, granule cells (GCs) and mossy cells (MCs) form a recurrent excitatory circuit that is critically involved in DG function and epilepsy. Here, we identified adenosine/A2A receptor (A2AR) as a novel retrograde signaling system that mediates presynaptic long-term potentiation (LTP) at MC-GC synapses. Using an adenosine sensor, we found that neuronal activity triggered phasic, postsynaptic TrkB-dependent release of adenosine. Additionally, epileptic seizures released adenosine in vivo, while removing A2ARs from DG decreased seizure susceptibility. Thus, adenosine/A2AR retrograde signaling mediates presynaptic LTP that may contribute to DG-dependent learning and promote epilepsy.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">BDNF signaling in Hebbian and Stentian structural plasticity in the developing visual system</a></h4>

              
                During development, patterned neural activity in input neurons innervating their target, instructs topographic map refinement. Axons from adjacent neurons, firing with similar patterns of neural activity, converge onto target neurons and stabilize their synapses with these postsynaptic partners (Hebbian plasticity). On the other hand, non-correlated firing of inputs promotes synaptic weakening and exploratory axonal growth (Stentian plasticity). We used visual stimulation to control the visually-evoked correlation structure of neural activity in ectopic ipsilaterally projecting (ipsi) retinal ganglion cell axons with respect to their neighboring contralateral eye inputs in the optic tectum of albino Xenopus laevis tadpoles. Multiphoton imaging of the ipsi axons in the live tadpole, combined with manipulation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signaling, revealed that presynaptic p75NTR and TrkB both promoted axonal branch addition during Stentian plasticity, whereas predominantly postsynaptic BDNF signaling mediated activity-dependent Hebbian suppression of axon branch addition. Additionally, we found that BDNF signaling is required for local suppression of branch loss induced by correlated firing.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Variability is actively regulated in speech</a></h4>

              
                Although movement variability is often attributed to unwanted noise in the motor system, recent work has demonstrated that variability may be actively controlled. To date, research on regulation of motor variability has relied on relatively simple, laboratory-specific reaching tasks. It is not clear how these results translate to complex, well-practiced and real-world tasks. Here, we test how variability is regulated during speech production, a complex, highly over-practiced and natural motor behavior that relies on auditory and somatosensory feedback. Specifically, in a series of four experiments, we assessed the effects of auditory feedback manipulations that modulate perceived speech variability, shifting every production either towards (inward-pushing) or away from (outward-pushing) the center of the distribution for each vowel. Participants exposed to the inward-pushing perturbation (Experiment 1) increased produced variability while the perturbation was applied as well as after it was removed. Unexpectedly, the outward-pushing perturbation (Experiment 2) also increased produced variability during exposure, but variability returned to near baseline levels when the perturbation was removed. Outward-pushing perturbations failed to reduce participants produced variability both with larger perturbation magnitude (Experiment 3) or after their variability had increased above baseline levels as a result of the inward-pushing perturbation (Experiment 4). Simulations of the applied perturbations using a state space model of motor behavior suggest that the increases in produced variability in response to the two types of perturbations may arise through distinct mechanisms: an increase in controlled variability in response to the inward-pushing perturbation, and an increase in sensitivity to auditory errors in response to the outward-pushing perturbation. Together, these results suggest that motor variability is actively regulated even in complex and well-practiced behaviors, such as speech.

                The purpose of our study is to understand the impact of a partial dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) on cognitive behavior, mitophagy/autophagy, mitochondrial and synaptic activities in transgenic Tau mice in Alzheimers disease (AD). Our lab reported increased levels of A{beta} and P-Tau, and abnormal interactions between A{beta} and Drp1, P-Tau and Drp1 induced increased mitochondrial fragmentation and reduced fusion and synaptic activities in AD. These abnormal interactions, result in the proliferation of dysfunctional mitochondria in AD neurons. Recent research on mitochondria revealed that fission protein Drp1 is largely implicated in mitochondrial dynamics in AD. To determine the impact of reduced Drp1 in AD, we recently crossed transgenic Tau mice with Drp1 heterozygote knockout (Drp1+/-) mice and generated double mutant (Drp1+/- X Tau) mice. In the current study, we assessed cognitive behavior, mRNA and protein levels of mitophagy, autophagy, mitochondrial biogenesis, dynamics and synaptic genes, mitochondrial morphology & mitochondrial function, dendritic spines in Tau mice relative to double mutant mice. When compared to Tau mice, double mutant mice did better on Morris Maze (reduced latency to find hidden platform, increased swimming speed and time spent on quadrant) and rotarod (stayed a longer period of time) tests. Both mRNA and proteins levels autophagy, mitophagy, mitochondrial biogenesis and synaptic proteins were increased in double mutant mice compared to Tau mice. Dendritic spines were significantly increased; mitochondrial number is reduced and length is increased in double mutant mice. Based on these observations, we conclude that reduced Drp1 is beneficial in a symptomatic-transgenic Tau mice.

                Skull stripping is an initial and critical step in the pipeline of mouse fMRI analysis. Manual labeling of the brain usually suffers from intra- and inter-rater variability and is highly time-consuming. Hence, an automatic and efficient skull-stripping method is in high demand for mouse fMRI studies. In this study, we investigated a 3D U-Net based method for automatic brain extraction in mouse fMRI studies. Two U-Net models were separately trained on T2-weighted anatomical images and T2*-weighted functional images. The trained models were tested on both interior and exterior datasets. The 3D U-Net models yielded a higher accuracy in brain extraction from both T2-weighted images (Dice > 0.984, Jaccard index > 0.968 and Hausdorff distance < 7.7) and T2*-weighted images (Dice > 0.964, Jaccard index > 0.931 and Hausdorff distance < 3.3), compared with the two widely used mouse skull-stripping methods (RATS and SHERM). The resting-state fMRI results using automatic segmentation with the 3D U-Net models are identical to those obtained by manual segmentation for both the seed-based and group independent component analysis. These results demonstrate that the 3D U-Net based method can replace manual brain extraction in mouse fMRI analysis.

                Hearing ability of mammals can be impacted by many factors including social cues, environment, and physical properties of animal morphology. Despite being used commonly to study social behaviors, the hearing ability of the monogamous prairie vole (Microtus ochrogaster) has never been fully characterized. In this study, we measure morphological head and pinna features and use auditory brainstem responses to measure hearing ability of prairie voles characterizing monaural and binaural hearing and hearing range. Additionally, we measured unbonded male and female voles to characterize differences due to sex. We found that prairie voles have intermediate hearing ability with an optimal hearing range of 8 - 32 kHz, robust binaural hearing ability, and characteristic monaural ABRs. We show no differences between the sexes for binaural hearing or hearing range, however female voles have increased amplitude of peripheral ABR waves I and II and increased latency of wave IV. Our results confirm that prairie voles have both low and high frequency hearing, binaural hearing capability, and despite biparental care and monogamy, differences in processing of sound information between the sexes. These data further highlight the necessity to understand sex-specific differences in neural processing that may underly variability in behavioral responses between sexes.

HighlightsO_LIMonogamous prairie voles hear across both low and high frequencies.
C_LIO_LIFemale prairie voles show differences in monaural hearing compared to males.
C_LIO_LIThere is no difference in binaural hearing or pinna/head size morphology between the sexes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Impact of stimulation location relative to grey and white matter on single pulse electrical stimulation responses in the human brain</a></h4>

              
                BackgroundElectrical neuromodulation is an increasingly common therapy for a wide variety of neuropsychiatric diseases. Unfortunately, therapeutic efficacy is inconsistent, possibly a result of our limited understanding of the mechanisms and the massive stimulation parameter space.

Objective/HypothesisTo better understand the role different parameters play in inducing a response, we systematically examined single pulse-induced cortico-cortico evoked potentials (CCEP) as a function of stimulation amplitude, duration and location in the brain and relative to grey and white matter.

MethodsWe measured voltage peak amplitudes and area under the curve of intracranially recorded stimulation responses as a function of distance from the stimulation site, pulse width, current injected, location relative to grey and white matter, and brain region stimulated (N=52, n=719 stimulation sites).

ResultsIncreasing stimulation pulse width increased response values near the stimulation location. Increasing stimulation amplitude (current) increased responses nonlinearly. Locally (<15 mm from the stimulation site), stimulation closer to the grey matter-white matter boundary induced larger responses. In contrast, for distant sites (>15 mm), white matter stimulation consistently produced larger responses than stimulation in or near grey matter. These relationships were different between cingulate, lateral prefrontal, and lateral temporal cortical stimulation.

ConclusionThese results demonstrate the importance of location and stimulation parameters in inducing a specific output and indicate that a stronger local response may require stimulation in the grey-white boundary while stimulation in the white matter may be needed for network activation, suggesting that stimulation location can be tailored for a specific outcome, key to informed neuromodulatory therapy.

HighlightsO_LIIntracranial single pulse electrical stimulation (SPES) response increases with increased pulse duration mostly near the stimulation site
C_LIO_LISPES response varies nonlinearly with injected current with an effect of distance from the stimulation site.
C_LIO_LISPES near the grey-white boundary and 90{degrees} to the nearest cortical axis induces larger local responses, but white matter stimulation produces larger distant responses.
C_LIO_LIThe relationship between SPES location and responses depends on brain region stimulated

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Vagus nerve stimulation increases stomach-brain coupling via a vagal afferent pathway</a></h4>

              
                Maintaining energy homeostasis is vital and supported by vagal signaling between digestive organs and the brain. Previous research has established a gastric network in the brain that is phase synchronized with the rhythm of the stomach, but tools to perturb its function were lacking. Here, we investigated the effect of acute right-sided transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) versus sham stimulation (randomized crossover-design) on stomach-brain coupling. In line with preclinical research, taVNS increased stomach-brain coupling in the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) and the midbrain while boosting coupling across the brain. Crucially, in the cortex, taVNS-induced changes in coupling occurred primarily in transmodal regions and were associated with changes in hunger ratings as indicators of the subjective metabolic state. Hence, taVNS alters stomach-brain coupling via an NTS-midbrain pathway that signals gut-induced reward, potentially paving the way for novel treatments in disorders such as Parkinson's disease or depression.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Multimodal Magnetic Resonance Histology and Light Sheet Imaging for Quantitative Neurogenetics of the Mouse</a></h4>

              
                Paul Lauterbur closed his seminal paper on MRI with the statement that "zeugmatographic (imaging) techniques should find many useful applications in studies of the internal structures, states and composition of microscopic objects" [1]. Magnetic resonance microscopy was subsequently demonstrated in 1986 by three groups [2] [3] [4]. The application of MRI to the study of tissue structure, i.e. magnetic resonance histology (MRH) was suggested in 1993 [5]. MRH, while based on the same physical principals as MRI is something fundamentally different than the clinical exams which are typically limited to voxel dimensions of ~ 1 mm3. Preclinical imaging systems can acquire images with voxels ~ 1000 times smaller. The MR histology images presented here have been acquired at yet another factor of 1000 increase in spatial resolution. Figure S1 in the supplement shows a comparison of a state-of-the-art fractional anisotropy images of a C57 mouse brain in vivo @ 150 m resolution (voxel volume of 3.3 x10-3 mm3) with the atlas we have generated for this work at 15 m spatial resolution (voxel volume of 3.3 x 10-6 mm3). In previous work, we have demonstrated the utility of MR histology in neurogenetics at spatial/angular resolution of 45 m /46 angles [6]. At this spatial/angular resolution it is possible to map whole brain connectivity with high correspondence to retroviral tracers [7]. But the MRH derived connectomes can be derived in less than a day where the retroviral tracer studies require months/years [8]. The resolution index (angular samples/voxel volume) for this previous work was >500,000 [9]. Figure S2 shows a comparison between that previous work and the new atlas presented in this paper with a resolution index of 32 million.

Light sheet microscopy (LSM) has undergone similar rapid evolution over the last 20 years. The invention of tissue clearing, advances in immunohistochemistry and development of selective plane illumination microscopy (SPIM) now make it possible to acquire whole mouse brain images at submicron spatial resolution with a vast array of cell specific markers [10] [11] [12] [13]. And these advantages can be realized in scan times of < 6hrs. The major limitation from these studies is the distortion in the tissue from dissection from the cranium, swelling from clearing and staining, and tissue damage from handling.

We report here the merger of these two methods: O_LIMRH with the brain in the skull to provide accurate geometry, cytoarchitectural measures using scalar imaging metrics and whole brain connectivity at 15 m isotropic spatial resolution with super resolution track density images @ 5 m isotropic resolution;
C_LIO_LIwhole brain multichannel LSM @ 1.8x1.8x4.0 m;
C_LIO_LIa big image data infrastructure that enables label mapping from the atlas to the MR image, geometric correction to the light sheet data, label mapping to the light sheet volumes and quantitative extraction of regional cell density. These methods make it possible to generate a comprehensive collection of image derived phenotypes (IDP) of cells and circuits covering the whole mouse brain with throughput that can be scaled for quantitative neurogenetics.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">CCR5 closes the temporal window for memory linking</a></h4>

              
                Real world memories are formed in a particular context and are not acquired or recalled in isolation 1-5. Time is a key variable in the organization of memories, since events experienced close in time are more likely to be meaningfully associated, while those experienced with a longer interval are not1-4. How does the brain segregate events that are temporally distinct? Here, we report that a delayed (12-24h) increase in the expression of the C-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5), an immune receptor well known as a co-receptor for HIV infection6,7, following the formation of a contextual memory, determines the duration of the temporal window for associating or linking that memory with subsequent memories. This delayed CCR5 expression in mouse dorsal CA1 (dCA1) neurons results in a decrease in neuronal excitability, which in turn negatively regulates neuronal memory allocation, thus reducing the overlap between dCA1 memory ensembles. Lowering this overlap affects the ability of one memory to trigger the recall of the other, thus closing the temporal window for memory linking. Remarkably, our findings also show that an age-related increase in CCL5/CCR5 expression leads to impairments in memory linking in aged mice, which could be reversed with a CCR5 knockout and an FDA approved drug that inhibits this receptor, a result with significant clinical implications. All together the findings reported here provide the first insights into the molecular and cellular mechanisms that shape the temporal window for memory linking.

                Neurons in parietal cortex exhibit task-related activity during decision-making tasks. However, it remains unclear how long-term training to perform different tasks over months or even years shapes neural computations and representations. We examine lateral intraparietal area (LIP) responses during a visual motion delayed-match-to-category (DMC) task. We consider two pairs of monkeys with different training histories: one trained only on the DMC task, and another first trained to perform fine motion-direction discrimination. We introduce generalized multilinear models to quantify low-dimensional, task-relevant components in population activity. During the DMC task, we found stronger cosine-like motion-direction tuning in the pretrained monkeys than in the DMC-only monkeys, and that the pretrained monkeys performance depended more heavily on sample-test stimulus similarity. These results suggest that sensory representations in LIP depend on the sequence of tasks that the animals have learned, underscoring the importance of training history in studies with complex behavioral tasks.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Light-induced asymmetries in the embryonic retina are mediated by the vascular system and extracellular matrix</a></h4>

              
                Left-right asymmetries in the nervous system (lateralisation) influence a broad range of behaviours, from social responses to navigation and language. The role and pathways of endogenous and environmental mechanisms in the ontogeny of lateralisation remains to be established. The domestic chick is a model of both endogenous and experience-induced lateralisation driven by light exposure. Following the endogenous rightward rotation of the embryo, the asymmetrical position in the egg results in a greater exposure of the right eye to environmental light. To identify the genetic pathways activated by asymmetric light stimulation, and their time course, we exposed embryos to different light regimes: darkness, 6 hours of light and 24 hours of light. We used RNA-seq to compare gene expression in the right and left retinas and telencephalon. As expected, no differential expression between left and right was present in darkness. We detected differential gene expression in right vs left retina after 6 hours of light exposure. This difference disappeared before 24 hours of light exposure, suggesting that light-induced activation is a self-terminating phenomenon. This transient effect of light exposure was associated with a downregulation of the sensitive-period mediator gene DIO2 (iodothyronine deiodinase 2) in the right retina. No differences between genes expressed in the right vs. left telencephalon were detected. Gene networks associated with lateralisation were connected to vascularisation, cell motility, and the extracellular matrix. Interestingly, we know that the extracellular matrix- including the differentially expressed PDGFRB (platelet-derived growth factor receptor {beta}) gene - is involved in both sensitive periods and in the endogenous chiral mechanism of primary cilia, that drives lateralisation. Our data show a similarity between endogenous and experience-driven lateralisation, identifying functional gene networks that affect lateralisation in a specific time window.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">iLQR-VAE : control-based learning of input-driven dynamics with applications to neural data</a></h4>

              
                Understanding how neural dynamics give rise to behaviour is one of the most fundamental questions in systems neuroscience. To achieve this, a common approach is to record neural populations in behaving animals, and model these data as emanating from a latent dynamical system whose state trajectories can then be related back to behavioural observations via some form of decoding. As recordings are typically performed in localized circuits that form only a part of the wider implicated network, it is important to simultaneously learn the local dynamics and infer any unobserved external input that might drive them. Here, we introduce iLQR-VAE, a novel control-based approach to variational inference in nonlinear dynamical systems, capable of learning both latent dynamics, initial conditions, and ongoing external inputs. As in recent deep learning approaches, our method is based on an input-driven sequential variational autoencoder (VAE). The main novelty lies in the use of the powerful iterative linear quadratic regulator algorithm (iLQR) in the recognition model. Optimization of the standard evidence lower-bound requires differentiating through iLQR solutions, which is made possible by recent advances in differentiable control. Importantly, having the recognition model implicitly defined by the generative model greatly reduces the number of free parameters and allows for flexible, high-quality inference. This makes it possible for instance to evaluate the model on a single long trial after training on smaller chunks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of iLQR-VAE on a range of synthetic systems, with autonomous as well as input-driven dynamics. We further show state-of-the-art performance on neural and behavioural recordings in non-human primates during two different reaching tasks.

                In a recent bioRxiv preprint, Ott et al. argue that sensitivities to sunk costs that have been reported in two serial foraging tasks (the Restaurant Row task in mice and rats, and the Web-Surf task in humans) may be due to simple consequences of the way that subjects perform these tasks and not due to an actual sensitivity to sunk costs. However, several variants of these tasks have been studied, in which the sensitivity to sunk costs changes. In order to test the Ott et al. model against these experimental observations, we simulated the model under these additional experimental conditions. We find that it is incompatible with the actual data. While we applaud the simplicity of the Ott et al. model, we must reject it as an explanation for the observed sensitivity to sunk costs seen in these tasks. We thus conclude that the alternative explanation - that mice, rats, and humans are sensitive to actual sunk costs in these tasks - is a better explanation for the data.

                Bitterlings are a group of teleost fish (Cyprinifromes: Acheilanathidae) notable for their brood parasitic lifestyle. Bitterling embryos develop as parasites inside the gill chamber of their freshwater mussel hosts. However, little is known about brain development in this species. Here, we have imaged the development of the brain of the Rosy Bitterling (Rhodeus ocellatus) at four embryonic stages (165, 185, 210, 235 hours post-fertilization) using micro-computed tomography (microCT) with special emphasis on developmental regionalization and brain ventricular organization. We provide a detailed neuroanatomical account of the development of the brain divisions with reference to The Atlas of Early zebrafish Brain Development and the updated prosomeric model. Segmentation and three-dimensional visualization of the ventricular system were performed in order to clarify changes in the longitudinal brain axis as a result of cephalic flexure during development. During early embryonic and larval development, we find that histological differentiation, tissue boundaries, periventricular proliferation zones, and ventricular spaces are all recognizable using microCT. Importantly, our approach is validated by the fact that the profile of CT values displayed here in the bitterling brain are consistent with genoarchitecture identified in previous studies. We also find developmental heterochrony of the inferior lobe in the Rosy Bitterling compared to the zebrafish. Our study provides a foundation for future studies of the brain development in the Rosy Bitterling, a valuable model species for studying the evolutionary adaptations associated with brood parasitism.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Learning from the physical consequences of our actions improves motor memory</a></h4>

              
                Actions have consequences. Motor learning involves correcting actions that lead to movement errors and remembering these actions for future behavior. In most laboratory situations, movement errors have no physical consequences and simply indicate the progress of learning. Here we asked how experiencing a physical consequence when making a movement error affects motor learning. Two groups of participants adapted to a new, prism-induced mapping between visual input and motor output while performing a precision walking task. Importantly, one group experienced an unexpected slip perturbation when making foot-placement errors during adaptation. Because of our innate drive for safety, and the fact that balance is fundamental to movement, we hypothesized that this experience would enhance motor memory. Learning generalized to different walking tasks to a greater extent in the group who experienced the adverse physical consequence. This group also showed faster relearning one week later despite exposure to a competing mapping during initial learning--evidence of greater memory consolidation. The group differences in generalization and consolidation occurred even though they both experienced similar magnitude foot-placement errors and adapted at similar rates. Our results suggest the brain considers the potential physical consequences of movement error when learning and that balance-threatening consequences serve to enhance this process.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Age-related change in task-evoked amygdala-prefrontal circuitry: a multiverse approach with an accelerated longitudinal cohort aged 4-22 years</a></h4>

              
                There has been considerable interest in the development of the amygdala and its connections with medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) given the central role of these brain regions in emotional processes. While several studies have suggested that this circuitry exhibits functional changes across the first two decades of life, they have typically employed cross-sectional designs, and findings have been mixed. Additionally, analytic choices may contribute to discrepancies across studies. Here we used an accelerated longitudinal design to examine task-evoked changes in amygdala-mPFC circuitry from 4-22 years of age (N=98; 183 total scans; 1-3 scans per participant). Participants were recruited from the greater Los Angeles area, and completed an event-related emotional face (fear, neutral) task designed to be appropriate for the wide age range.  Multiverse analyses examined the robustness of our findings to fMRI analysis choices. 2808 parallel analyses varying in preprocessing and modeling choices found evidence for average age-related decreases in amygdala reactivity to faces. Greater amygdala reactivity at younger ages was attributable to elevated responses during the first few trials relative to later trials. Within-participant changes in amygdala reactivity with age could not be differentiated from between-participant differences, however. Across analysis decision points, we did not find consistent evidence of age-related change in amygdala- mPFC connectivity through generalized psychophysiological interaction (gPPI) or beta-series correlation (BSC) methods. We also did not find evidence for associations between separation anxiety behaviors and amygdala reactivity or amygdala-mPFC connectivity. Within the context of this faces task and age range, age-related changes in amygdala reactivity were more robust to processing pipeline than were task-evoked functional connectivity measures, particularly those using gPPI. These findings highlight both the challenges in estimating developmental change in longitudinal cohorts and the value of multiverse approaches in developmental neuroimaging for assessing robustness of results.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A bias generating temporal distortions in serial perception</a></h4>

              
                A precise estimation of event timing is essential for survival.1 Yet, temporal distortions are ubiquitous in our daily sensory experience.2 A specific type of temporal distortion is the time order error (TOE), which occurs when estimating the duration of events organized in a series.3 TOEs shrink or dilate objective event duration. Understanding the mechanics of subjective time distortions is fundamental since we perceive events in a series, not in isolation. In previous work,4 we showed that TOEs appear when discriminating small duration differences (20 or 60 ms) between two short events (Standard, S and Comparison, C), but only if the interval between events is shorter than 1 second. TOEs have been variously attributed to sensory desensitization,5,6 reduced temporal attention,7,4 poor sensory weighting of C relative to S,8 or idiosyncratic response bias.6

Surprisingly, the serial dynamics of relative event duration were never considered as a factor generating TOEs. In two experiments we tested them by swapping the order of presentation of S and C. Bayesian hierarchical modelling showed that TOEs emerge when the first event in a series is shorter than the second event, independently of event type (S or C), sensory precision or individual response bias. Participants disproportionately expanded first-position shorter events. Significantly fewer errors were made when the first event was objectively longer, confirming the inference of a strong bias in perceiving ordered event durations. Our finding identifies a hitherto unknown duration-dependent encoding inefficiency in human serial perception.

                Cardiac arrest (CA) produces global ischemia/reperfusion injury resulting in substantial multiorgan damage. There are limited efficacious therapies to save lives despite CA being such a lethal disease process. Surviving patients suffer extensive brain damage with mitochondrial dysfunction implicated as a major source of injury. Metformin, a first-line treatment for diabetes, has also shown promising results in other diseases and is known to interact with mitochondria. In the present study, we evaluated the therapeutic benefits of metformin administration immediately after resuscitation using a 10 min asphxyial-CA rat model. This is the first study to show that metformin treatment post-CA a) improves survival and neurologic function, b) potentiates early normalization of brain electrophysiologic activity, and c) protects mitochondrial function with a reduction in apoptotic brain injury. Overall, as an effective and safe drug, metformin has the potential to be an easily translatable intervention for improving survival and preventing brain damage after CA.

                Brain perivascular macrophages (PVMs) belong to border-associated macrophages. PVMs are situated along blood vessels in the Virchow-Robin space and are thus found at a unique anatomical position between the endothelium and the parenchyma. Owing to their location and phagocytic capabilities, PVMs are regarded as important components that regulate various aspects of brain physiology in health and pathophysiological states. Here, used LYVE-1 to identify PVMs in the mouse brain. We used brain-tissue sections and cleared whole-brain to learn how they are distributed within the brain and across different developmental postnatal stages. We find that LYVE-1+ PVMs associate with the vasculature in a brain-region-dependent manner, where the hippocampus shows the highest density of LYVE-1+ PVMs. We show that their postnatal distribution is developmentally dynamic and peaks at P10-P20 depending on the brain region. We further demonstrate that their density is reduced in the APP/PS1 mouse model of Alzheimers Disease. In conclusion, our results show an unexpected heterogeneity and dynamics of LYVE-1+ PVMs, and support an important role for this population of PVMs during development and in regulating brain functions in steady-state and disease conditions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Disrupted intrinsic connectivity links to language and social deficits in toddlers with autism</a></h4>

              
                Social and language abilities are closely intertwined during early development. Yet, it is still unknown how neural features underlying early social and language deficits are linked in toddlers with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). We examined functional connectivity of left and right temporal language regions and its correlations with language and social abilities in a cohort of 1-4 years old toddlers (52 ASD/34 non-ASD). Further, ASD toddlers were stratified into those who strongly prefer social visual stimuli (ASDSoc) vs. those who do not (ASDnonSoc) based on performance on an eye-tracking paradigm. In non-ASD toddlers, connectivity between temporal regions and other language- and social-related cortical regions was significantly correlated with language, communication, and social scores. Conversely, ASD toddlers showed atypical correlations between temporal-visual cortex (cuneus) connectivity and communication ability. This temporal-visual connectivity was also correlated with social visual attention in ASDnonSoc but not in ASDSoc toddlers. These findings suggest language- and social-related functional connectivity was not correlated with language and social functions in ASD toddlers. Abnormal engagement of temporal-visual cortex connectivity may be an early-age signature of ASD and may help explain why interventions targeting social skills and language are so challenging, particularly in those with poor social engagement.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Txn1 mutation causes epilepsy associated with vacuolar degeneration in the midbrain</a></h4>

              
                Thioredoxin (TXN), encoded by Txn1, acts as a critical antioxidant in the defense against oxidative stress by regulating the dithiol/disulfide balance of interacting proteins. The role of TXN in the central nervous system (CNS) is largely unknown. A phenotype-driven study of N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea-mutated rats with running seizures at around five-week of age revealed the relevance of Txn1 mutations to CNS disorders. Genetic mapping identified Txn1-F54L in epileptic rats. The insulin-reducing activity of Txn1-F54L rats was approximately one-third that of the wild-type. Vacuolar degeneration in the midbrain, mainly in the thalamus and the inferior colliculus, was observed in the Txn1-F54L rats. The lesions displayed neuronal and oligodendrocyte cell death. Neurons in Txn1-F54L rats showed morphological changes in the mitochondria. Vacuolar degeneration began at three weeks of age, and spontaneous repair began at seven weeks; a dramatic change from cell death to repair occurred in the midbrain during a restricted period. In conclusion, Txn1 is essential for the development of the midbrain in juvenile rats.

                Glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs) are highly self-renewing, resistant to therapy, and are able to form lethal tumors1,2. Tumor organoids have been developed to study tumor evolution1-4, and while GSCs can form organoids for glioblastoma multiforme, our understanding of their intrinsic immune, metabolic, genetic, and molecular programs is limited. To address this, we deeply characterized GSC-derived GBM organoids using a modified protocol (GBMOsm) from several patient-derived GSCs and found they develop into complex 3D tissues with unique self-organization, cancerous metabolic states, and burdensome genetic landscapes. We discovered that GBMOsc recapitulate the presence of two important cell populations thought to drive GBM progression, SATB2+ and HOPX+ progenitors. Despite being devoid of immune cells, transcriptomic analysis across GBMOsc revealed an immune-like molecular program, enriched in cytokine, antigen presentation and processing, T-cell receptor inhibitors, and interferon genes. We determined that SATB2+ and HOPX+ populations contribute to this immune and interferon landscape in GBM in vivo and GBMOsm. Our work deepens our understanding of the intrinsic molecular and cellular architecture of GSC-derived GBMO and defines a novel GBMOsm intrinsic immune-like program.

                The perception of optic flow is essential for any visually guided behavior of a moving animal. To mechanistically predict behavior and understand the emergence of self-motion perception in vertebrate brains, it is essential to systematically characterize the motion receptive fields (RFs) of optic flow processing neurons. Here, we present the fine-scale RFs of thousands of motion-sensitive neurons studied in the diencephalon and the midbrain of zebrafish. We found neurons that serve as linear filters and robustly encode directional and speed information of translation-induced optic flow. These neurons are topographically arranged in pretectum according to translation direction. The unambiguous encoding of translation enables the decomposition of translational and rotational self-motion information from mixed optic flow. In behavioral experiments, we successfully demonstrated the predicted decomposition in the optokinetic and optomotor responses. Together, our study reveals the algorithm and the neural implementation for self-motion estimation in a vertebrate visual system.

                Neural oscillations, or brain rhythms, fluctuate in a manner reflecting ongoing behavior. Whether these fluctuations are instrumental or epiphenomenal to the behavior remains elusive. Attempts to experimentally manipulate neural oscillations exogenously using non-invasive brain stimulation have shown some promise, but difficulty with tailoring stimulation parameters to individuals has hindered progress in this field. We demonstrate here using electroencephalography (EEG) neurofeedback in a brain-computer interface that human participants (n=44) learned over multiple sessions across a 6-day period to self-regulate their Beta rhythm (13-20 Hz) over the right inferior frontal cortex (rIFC). This Beta modulation had observable consequences on cognitive behavior: changes in an individual's inhibitory control performance before and after training were predicted by the magnitude of their training-related change in Beta over rIFC. This was not the case for a control group (n=38) who underwent training of their Alpha rhythm (8-12 Hz). The present data support the view that the right frontal Beta rhythm is a key component of the brain's inhibitory control system. Most importantly, we introduce causality to this relationship for the first time, as experimental modulation of rIFC Beta activity had a measurable impact upon behavior.

	<p>Background: Some clinical studies have indicated that neutral and happy music may relieve state anxiety. However, the brain mechanisms by which these effective interventions in music impact state anxiety remain unknown. Methods: In this study, we selected music with clinical effects for therapy, and 62 subjects were included using the evoked anxiety paradigm. After evoking anxiety with a visual stimulus, all subjects were randomly divided into three groups (listening to happy music, neutral music and a blank stimulus), and EEG signals were acquired. Results: We found that different emotional types of music might have different mechanisms in state anxiety interventions. Neutral music had the effect of alleviating state anxiety. The brain mechanisms supported that neutral music ameliorating state anxiety was associated with decreased power spectral density of the occipital lobe and increased brain functional connectivity between the occipital lobe and frontal lobe. Happy music also had the effect of alleviating state anxiety, and the brain mechanism was associated with enhanced brain functional connectivity between the occipital lobe and right temporal lobe. Conclusions: This study may be important for a deep understanding of the mechanisms associated with state anxiety music interventions and may further contribute to future clinical treatment using nonpharmaceutical interventions.</p>

	<p>This study aimed to understand the impact of sex on the neurocognitive function of patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD). Ninety-four participants with idiopathic PD and 167 age-matched healthy individuals as normal controls (NCs) were recruited and underwent comprehensive neuropsychological assessments. Sex differences were found in NCs, but not in patients with PD. Among male participants, patients with PD showed worse performance on the Digit Symbol Substitution (DSS) (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) test and Symbol Search (SS) (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) than NCs. Among female participants, patients with PD showed worse performance on the category score of the Modified Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), SS (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), and pentagon copying (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) than NCs. After controlling for the effects of age and years of education, Hoehn and Yahr stage was found to predict the performance of the Color Trails Test part A (βA = 0.241, pA = 0.036), Stroop Color and Word Test (β = −0.245, p = 0.036), and DSS (β = −0.258, p = 0.035) in men with PD. These results indicate the differential effect of sex on the neurocognitive function among healthy aging and PD populations. The disappearance of sex differences, which is present in healthy aging, in patients with PD suggests a gradual loss of the neuroprotective effect of estrogen after the initiation of the neurodegenerative process. This study also found mental flexibility and visuospatial function to be the susceptible cognitive domains in women with PD, while the disease severity could predict the working memory and processing speed in men with PD.</p>

	<p>Although obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) and the conduct disorders (CD) express a contrasting symptomatology, they could represent different answers to a common matrix about morality. In the literature, some theoretical models describe people with OCD as individuals who experience high levels of responsibility and guilt. On the other hand, adolescents with a CD are described as if they do not feel guilty at all or consider anti-social purposes as more important than existing moral purposes. The aims of this study were to investigate the role of forgiveness in responsibility and guilt levels and to test whether this putative relation was influenced by tendencies towards obsessive–compulsive problems (OCP) or conduct problems (CP). In total, 231 adolescents aged between 16 and 18 years were self-assessed using a Youth Self-Report, Child Responsibility Attitudes Questionnaire, Heartland Forgiveness Scale, and Test Of Self-Conscious Affect. The results show that self-forgiveness predicted responsibility levels, while guilt was predicted by self-forgiveness and situation-forgiveness. Moreover, mediation analyses revealed that the effects of OCP on responsibility and guilt were mediated by self-forgiveness and situation-forgiveness. Regarding CP, no mediated effects were found. In conclusion, lower proneness to forgive increases responsibility and guilt, and this is particularly evident in subjects with higher levels of OCP.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Oscillatory Correlates of Intentional Forgetting: The Role of Theta and Alpha Power in Item-Method Directed Forgetting</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Results from item-method directed forgetting suggest that individuals are able to intentionally forget processed information. Most research suggests that either selective rehearsal of to-be-remembered or inhibitory control of to-be-forgotten information is accountable for the effects of intentional forgetting. Some research, however, hypothesized that the time to process information mediates the underlying mechanism. To test this hypothesis, the current study investigated associations between oscillatory power in theta (3&ndash;7.5 Hz) and alpha frequencies (8&ndash;13 Hz) and intentional forgetting in human participants and explored whether or not these mechanisms depended on processing time. Previously, theta power was shown to be associated with the creation of episodic memory traces and alpha power with inhibition. We therefore expected to find associations between these neural signatures and behavioral effects. Consistent with our hypotheses, we revealed increased theta power for to-be-remembered and increased alpha power for to-be-forgotten information and that the effects of activity in both frequency bands were influenced by the time individuals were given for processing the memory cue. These results suggest that not one but two mechanisms, rehearsal and inhibitory control, are accountable for item-method directed forgetting, both with different temporal profiles.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Human infants who suffer from intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), which is a failure to attain their genetically predetermined weight, are at increased risk for postnatal learning and memory deficits. Hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) granule neurons play an important role in memory formation; however, it is unknown whether IUGR affects embryonic DG neurogenesis, which could provide a potential mechanism underlying abnormal postnatal learning and memory function. Using a mouse model of the most common cause of IUGR, induced by hypertensive disease of pregnancy, we first assessed adult learning and memory function. We quantified the percentages of embryonic hippocampal DG neural stem cells (NSCs) and progenitor cells and developing glutamatergic granule neurons, as well as hippocampal volumes and neuron cell count and morphology 18 and 40 d after delivery. We characterized the differential embryonic hippocampal transcriptomic pathways between appropriately grown and IUGR mouse offspring. We found that IUGR offspring of both sexes had short-term adult learning and memory deficits. Prenatally, we found that IUGR caused accelerated embryonic DG neurogenesis and Sox2<sup>+</sup> neural stem cell depletion. IUGR mice were marked by decreased hippocampal volumes and decreased doublecortin<sup>+</sup> neuronal progenitors with increased mean dendritic lengths at postnatal day 18. Consistent with its known molecular role in embryonic DG neurogenesis, we also found evidence for decreased Wnt pathway activity during IUGR. In conclusion, we have discovered that postnatal memory deficits are associated with accelerated NSC differentiation and maturation into glutamatergic granule neurons following IUGR, a phenotype that could be explained by decreased embryonic Wnt signaling.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Relapse is a major challenge to the treatment of substance use disorders. A progressive increase in cue-induced drug craving, termed incubation of craving, is observed after withdrawal from multiple drugs of abuse in humans and rodents. Incubation of cocaine craving involves the strengthening of excitatory synapses onto nucleus accumbens (NAc) medium spiny neurons via postsynaptic accumulation of high-conductance Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable AMPA receptors. This enhances reactivity to drug-associated cues and is required for the expression of incubation. Additionally, incubation of cocaine craving is associated with loss of the synaptic depression normally triggered by stimulation of metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGlu5), leading to endocannabinoid production, and expressed presynaptically via cannabinoid receptor 1 activation. Previous studies have found alterations in mGlu5 and Homer proteins associated with the loss of this synaptic depression. Here we conducted coimmunoprecipitation studies to investigate associations of diacylglycerol lipase-&alpha; (DGL), which catalyzes formation of the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonylglycerol (2-AG), with mGlu5 and Homer proteins. Although these interactions were unchanged in the NAc core at incubation-relevant withdrawal times, the association of DGL with total and phosphorylated Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II&alpha; (CaMKII&alpha;) and CaMKII&beta; was increased. This would be predicted, based on other studies, to inhibit DGL activity and therefore 2-AG production. This was confirmed by measuring DGL enzymatic activity. However, the magnitude of DGL inhibition did not correlate with the magnitude of incubation of craving for individual rats. These results suggest that CaMKII contributes to the loss of mGlu5-dependent synaptic depression after incubation, but the functional significance of this loss remains unclear.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Perceptual Fading of a Stabilized Cortical Image: Replication in the Undergraduate Classroom</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Prolonged exposure to a stimulus causes desensitization of cortical neurons and results in perceptual changes. One example of this phenomenon is contrast adaptation, in which perceived differences between light and dark regions of a stimulus decrease. Blakemore, Muncey, and Ridley reported evidence for the "perceptual fading of a stabilized cortical image" in a 1971 <I>Nature</I> paper. Our goal was to replicate their second experiment, in which adaptation was measured across many contrasts, and develop an active learning exercise for undergraduate students. The experiment was coded using an open-source python package and psychophysical data were collected from two observers. On each trial, a sinusoidally modulated luminance grating appeared above fixation, and the task of the observer was to adjust the contrast of a grating below fixation until the two appeared identical. Between trials in the adaptation condition, a high contrast grating was presented in the top location; no such grating appeared between trials in the control condition. Contrast matches showed a clear reduction during the adaptation condition, thus demonstrating perceptual fading and a successful replication of <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B1">Blakemore et al. (1971)</cross-ref>. We then simplified the approach and modified the code to create a single, seamless experience for use in the classroom. With instructions and theoretical background provided in a one-page handout, students can perform the experiment on themselves and view their results in an automatically generated figure. This exercise, a primary example of active learning, will help students gain a first-hand understanding of the perceptual effects of adaptation.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">High Behavioral Variability Mediated by Altered Neuronal Excitability in auts2 Mutant Zebrafish</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are characterized by abnormal behavioral traits arising from neural circuit dysfunction. While a number of genes have been implicated in ASDs, in most cases, a clear understanding of how mutations in these genes lead to circuit dysfunction and behavioral abnormality is absent. The <I>autism susceptibility candidate 2</I> (<I>AUTS2</I>) gene is one such gene, associated with ASDs, intellectual disability and a range of other neurodevelopmental conditions. However, the role of AUTS2 in neural development and circuit function is not at all known. Here, we undertook functional analysis of Auts2a, the main homolog of AUTS2 in zebrafish, in the context of the escape behavior. Escape behavior in wild-type zebrafish is critical for survival and is therefore, reliable, rapid, and has well-defined kinematic properties. <I>auts2a</I> mutant zebrafish are viable, have normal gross morphology and can generate escape behavior with normal kinematics. However, the behavior is unreliable and delayed, with high trial-to-trial variability in the latency. Using calcium imaging we probed the activity of Mauthner neurons during otic vesicle (OV) stimulation and observed lower probability of activation and reduced calcium transients in the mutants. With direct activation of Mauthner by antidromic stimulation, the threshold for activation in mutants was higher than that in wild-type, even when inhibition was blocked. Taken together, these results point to reduced excitability of Mauthner neurons in <I>auts2a</I> mutant larvae leading to unreliable escape responses. Our results show a novel role for Auts2a in regulating neural excitability and reliability of behavior.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">HFOApp: A MATLAB Graphical User Interface for High-Frequency Oscillation Marking</a></h4>

              
                <p>Epilepsy affects 3.4 million people in the United States, and, despite the availability of numerous antiepileptic drugs, 36% of patients have uncontrollable seizures, which severely impact quality of life. High-frequency oscillations (HFOs) are a potential biomarker of epileptogenic tissue that could be useful in surgical planning. As a result, research into the efficacy of HFOs as a clinical tool has increased over the last 2 decades. However, detection and identification of these transient rhythms in intracranial electroencephalographic recordings remain time-consuming and challenging. Although automated detection algorithms have been developed, their results are widely inconsistent, reducing reliability. Thus, manual marking of HFOs remains the gold standard, and manual review of automated results is required. However, manual marking and review are time consuming and can still produce variable results because of their subjective nature and the limitations in functionality of existing open-source software. Our goal was to develop a new software with broad application that improves on existing open-source HFO detection applications in usability, speed, and accuracy. Here, we present HFOApp: a free, open-source, easy-to-use MATLAB-based graphical user interface for HFO marking. This toolbox offers a high degree of intuitive and ergonomic usability and integrates interactive automation-assist options with manual marking, significantly reducing the time needed for review and manual marking of recordings, while increasing inter-rater reliability. The toolbox also features simultaneous multichannel detection and marking. HFOApp was designed as an easy-to-use toolbox for clinicians and researchers to quickly and accurately mark, quantify, and characterize HFOs within electrophysiological datasets.</p>

                Background: Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, in 2020, many employees were required to work from home (WFH). During this WFH period, some employees encountered health issues related to sprains and neck or back pain owing to poor working conditions at home. As the WFH trend may continue over a prolonged period, the underlying causes and solutions to ergonomic issues must be addressed to reduce injuries. This study aims to identify the ergonomic issues encountered when working from home and suggests several solutions to minimise these issues.  Methods: A qualitative ethnographic methodology was adopted. This study used focus group discussion and the panellists were among experts from the fields of higher education, healthcare, human resources (HR), and ergonomics patient in Malaysia.  The most common ergonomic issues identified were based on diagnoses and observations in previous studies.  Results: The panellists agreed on ergonomics issues, comprising the use of unergonomic chairs, incorrect sitting postures, irregular arrangement of key objects, improper reach distances of the laptop/keyboard/mouse, poor desk designs, footrest absence, distortion/noise, poor lighting, and poor work environment. Over time, WFH ergonomics issues may lead to burnout, carpal tunnel syndrome or other cumulative trauma disorders, high blood pressure, and stress on the cervical spine and neck. The proposed solutions include a complete WFH ergonomics and wellness checklist for employees and employers, webinar sessions on WFH ergonomics, meet-up sessions with ergonomics or HR experts, workspace rentals for co-workers, implementation of the 20-20-20 rule and job-sharing practices, and the involvement of employers or the government in procuring ergonomic equipment for WFH employees.  Conclusions: This is a preliminary study and the researchers are exploring the root causes of WFH ergonomics issues and proposed solutions. While previous studies have examined workplace ergonomics, this study focuses on WFH ergonomic issues and solutions during the ongoing pandemic.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Japanese sound-symbolic words in global contexts: from translation to hybridization [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                This paper explores the global reception and development of the artistic expression of onomatopoeia and mimetic words in modern and contemporary Japanese literary texts adopting the method of comparative literature. By analyzing sound-symbolic words and their translations in modern Japanese poetry and contemporary comics, the intercultural dialogues of these texts are examined and the emergence of hybrid onomatopoeia in global comic works is illuminated. The Japanese language is often noted for its richness of sound-symbolic words. In the literary world, modern poetry adopted and elaborated the use of these words from the late 19th century in its quest for a new style of poetry. In the early 20th century, poets developed the artistic expression of sound-symbolic words and succeeded in giving musicality to the “new-style poem”. However, the translation of Japanese sound-symbolic words has always been problematic. Experimental uses of these words in modern poems were often untranslatable, making the translations incomprehensible or dull. Nevertheless, graphic narratives and their worldwide distribution changed that situation. Japanese comics (manga) has particularly developed the artistic expression of sound-symbolic words. Usually placed outside speech balloons, these words are elaborately depicted and are important elements of the panel/page layout. Notably, the global popularity of the genre developed a new phase of intercultural dialogue. As not every word has an equivalent or is translatable in the target language, translators have left sound-symbolic words untouched in the translated versions, putting translation aside. Thus, the combination of Japanese and the target language seems to influence the visual comprehension of sound effects among the readers. Through the examinations of some cases, this paper brings to light the emergence of some hybrid onomatopoeia and reveals that the “Third Space” formed by the translation and hybridization of manga is a dynamic field that creates a new culture.

                Background: : Rugby league involves repeated, complex, and high intensity change-of-direction (COD) movements with no existing test protocols that specifically assesses these multiple physical fitness components simultaneously. Thus, the current study examined the convergent validity of a repeated Illinois Agility (RIA) protocol with the repeated T-agility protocol, and the repeatability of the RIA protocol in adolescent Rugby League players. Furthermore, aerobic capacity and anaerobic and COD performance were assessed to determine whether these physical qualities were important contributors to the RIA protocol. Methods: Twenty-two junior Rugby League players completed 4 sessions with each separated by 7 days. Initially, physical fitness characteristics at baseline (i.e., Beep test,, countermovement jump, 30-m sprint, single-effort COD and repeated sprint ability [RSA]) were assessed. The second session involved a familiarisation of RIA and repeated T-agility test (RTT) protocols. During the third and fourth sessions, participants completed the RIA and RTT protocols in a randomised, counterbalanced design to examine the validity and test-retest reliability of these protocols. Results: For convergent validity, significant correlations were identified between RIA and RTT performances (r= >0.80; p<0.05). For contributors to RIA performance, significant correlations were identified between all baseline fitness characteristics and RIA (r = >0.71; p < 0.05). Reliability of the RIA protocol was near perfect with excellent intra-class correlation coefficient (0.87-0.97), good ratio limits of agreement (×/÷ 1.05-1.06) and low coefficient of variations (1.8-2.0%). Conclusions: The current study has demonstrated the RIA to be a simple, valid and reliable field test for RL athletes that can provide coaches with information about their team’s ability to sustain high intensity, multi-directional running efforts.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Applying machine learning EEG signal classification to emotion‑related brain anticipatory activity [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Machine learning approaches have been fruitfully applied to several neurophysiological signal classification problems. Considering the relevance of emotion in human cognition and behaviour, an important application of machine learning has been found in the field of emotion identification based on neurophysiological activity. Nonetheless, there is high variability in results in the literature depending on the neuronal activity measurement, the signal features and the classifier type. The present work aims to provide new methodological insight into machine learning applied to emotion identification based on electrophysiological brain activity. For this reason, we analysed previously recorded EEG activity measured while emotional stimuli, high and low arousal (auditory and visual) were provided to a group of healthy participants. Our target signal to classify was the pre-stimulus onset brain activity. Classification performance of three different classifiers (LDA, SVM and kNN) was compared using both spectral and temporal features. Furthermore, we also contrasted the performance of static and dynamic (time evolving) approaches. The best static feature-classifier combination was the SVM with spectral features (51.8%), followed by LDA with spectral features (51.4%) and kNN with temporal features (51%). The best dynamic feature‑classifier combination was the SVM with temporal features (63.8%), followed by kNN with temporal features (63.70%) and LDA with temporal features (63.68%). The results show a clear increase in classification accuracy with temporal dynamic features.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Pulsed low-energy stimulation initiates electric turbulence in cardiac tissue</a></h4>

Interruptions in nonlinear wave propagation, commonly referred to as wave breaks, are typical of many complex excitable systems. In the heart they lead to lethal rhythm disorders, the so-called arrhythmias, which are one of the main causes of sudden death in the industrialized world. Progress in the treatment and therapy of cardiac arrhythmias requires a detailed understanding of the triggers and dynamics of these wave breaks. In particular, two very important questions are: 1) What determines the potential of a wave break to initiate re-entry? and 2) How do these breaks evolve such that the system is able to maintain spatiotemporally chaotic electrical activity? Here we approach these questions numerically using optogenetics in an <i>in silico</i> model of human atrial tissue that has undergone chronic atrial fibrillation (cAF) remodelling. In the lesser studied sub-threshold illumination régime, we discover a new mechanism of wave break initiation in cardiac tissue that occurs for gentle slopes of the restitution characteristics. This mechanism involves the creation of conduction blocks through a combination of wavefront-waveback interaction, reshaping of the wave profile and heterogeneous recovery from the excitation of the spatially extended medium, leading to the creation of re-excitable windows for sustained re-entry. This finding is an important contribution to cardiac arrhythmia research as it identifies scenarios in which low-energy perturbations to cardiac rhythm can be potentially life-threatening.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Engineering gene overlaps to sustain genetic constructs in vivo</a></h4>

Evolution is often an obstacle to the engineering of stable biological systems due to the selection of mutations inactivating costly gene circuits. Gene overlaps induce important constraints on sequences and their evolution. We show that these constraints can be harnessed to increase the stability of costly genes by purging loss-of-function mutations. We combine computational and synthetic biology approaches to rationally design an overlapping reading frame expressing an essential gene within an existing gene to protect. Our algorithm succeeded in creating overlapping reading frames in 80% of <i>E. coli</i> genes. Experimentally, scoring mutations in both genes of such overlapping construct, we found that a significant fraction of mutations impacting the gene to protect have a deleterious effect on the essential gene. Such an overlap thus protects a costly gene from removal by natural selection by associating the benefit of this removal with a larger or even lethal cost. In our synthetic constructs, the overlap converts many of the possible mutants into evolutionary dead-ends, reducing the evolutionary potential of the system and thus increasing its stability over time.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Segmentation-Less, Automated, Vascular Vectorization</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Samuel A. Mihelic, William A. Sikora, Ahmed M. Hassan, Michael R. Williamson, Theresa A. Jones, Andrew K. Dunn</p>

Recent advances in two-photon fluorescence microscopy (2PM) have allowed large scale imaging and analysis of blood vessel networks in living mice. However, extracting network graphs and vector representations for the dense capillary bed remains a bottleneck in many applications. Vascular vectorization is algorithmically difficult because blood vessels have many shapes and sizes, the samples are often unevenly illuminated, and large image volumes are required to achieve good statistical power. State-of-the-art, three-dimensional, vascular vectorization approaches often require a segmented (binary) image, relying on manual or supervised-machine annotation. Therefore, voxel-by-voxel image segmentation is biased by the human annotator or trainer. Furthermore, segmented images oftentimes require remedial morphological filtering before skeletonization or vectorization. To address these limitations, we present a vectorization method to extract vascular objects directly from unsegmented images without the need for machine learning or training. The Segmentation-Less, Automated, Vascular Vectorization (SLAVV) source code in MATLAB is openly available on GitHub. This novel method uses simple models of vascular anatomy, efficient linear filtering, and vector extraction algorithms to remove the image segmentation requirement, replacing it with manual or automated vector classification. Semi-automated SLAVV is demonstrated on three in vivo 2PM image volumes of microvascular networks (capillaries, arterioles and venules) in the mouse cortex. Vectorization performance is proven robust to the choice of plasma- or endothelial-labeled contrast, and processing costs are shown to scale with input image volume. Fully-automated SLAVV performance is evaluated on simulated 2PM images of varying quality all based on the large (1.4×0.9×0.6 mm<sup>3</sup> and 1.6×10<sup>8</sup> voxel) input image. Vascular statistics of interest (e.g. volume fraction, surface area density) calculated from automatically vectorized images show greater robustness to image quality than those calculated from intensity-thresholded images.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Tracking calcium dynamics from individual neurons in behaving animals</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Thibault Lagache, Alison Hanson, Jesús E. Pérez-Ortega, Adrienne Fairhall, Rafael Yuste</p>

Measuring the activity of neuronal populations with calcium imaging can capture emergent functional properties of neuronal circuits with single cell resolution. However, the motion of freely behaving animals, together with the intermittent detectability of calcium sensors, can hinder automatic monitoring of neuronal activity and their subsequent functional characterization. We report the development and open-source implementation of a multi-step cellular tracking algorithm (Elastic Motion Correction and Concatenation or EMC<sup>2</sup>) that compensates for the intermittent disappearance of moving neurons by integrating local deformation information from detectable neurons. We demonstrate the accuracy and versatility of our algorithm using calcium imaging data from two-photon volumetric microscopy in visual cortex of awake mice, and from confocal microscopy in behaving <i>Hydra</i>, which experiences major body deformation during its contractions. We quantify the performance of our algorithm using ground truth manual tracking of neurons, along with synthetic time-lapse sequences, covering a wide range of particle motions and detectability parameters. As a demonstration of the utility of the algorithm, we monitor for several days calcium activity of the same neurons in layer 2/3 of mouse visual cortex <i>in vivo</i>, finding significant turnover within the active neurons across days, with only few neurons that remained active across days. Also, combining automatic tracking of single neuron activity with statistical clustering, we characterize and map neuronal ensembles in behaving <i>Hydra</i>, finding three major non-overlapping ensembles of neurons (CB, RP1 and RP2) whose activity correlates with contractions and elongations. Our results show that the EMC<sup>2</sup> algorithm can be used as a robust and versatile platform for neuronal tracking in behaving animals.

                Background: Bioinformatics is becoming an essential tool for the majority of biological and biomedical researchers. Although bioinformatics data is exploited by academic and industrial researchers, limited focus is on teaching this area to undergraduates, postgraduates and senior scientists. Many scientists are developing their own expertise without formal training and often without appreciating the source of the data they are reliant upon. Some universities do provide courses on a variety of bioinformatics resources and tools, a few also provide biocuration projects, during which students submit data to annotation resources. Methods: To assess the usefulness and enjoyability of annotation projects a survey was sent to University College London (UCL) students who have undertaken Gene Ontology biocuration projects. Results: Analysis of survey responses suggest that these projects provide students with an opportunity not only to learn about bioinformatics resources but also to improve their literature analysis, presentation and writing skills. Conclusion: Biocuration student projects provide valuable annotations as well as enabling students to develop a variety of skills relevant to their future careers. It is also hoped that, as future scientists, these students will critically assess their own manuscripts and ensure that these are written with the biocurators of the future in mind.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Comparing Seizure‐Related Death and Suicide in Younger Adults with Epilepsy</a></h4>

              
                <p>Younger adults with epilepsy have an increased mortality. Some deaths are seizure-related, for example, sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP), whereas others, for example, suicide, have multiple causes, including adverse effects of the treatment on mood. In this retrospective population-based study of all Danish persons with epilepsy aged 18 to 49 years during 2007 to 2009 we evaluated the risk of death from seizures and suicide. SUDEP comprised 82.7% of all seizure-related death. Younger adults with epilepsy had an 8.3-fold increased risk of death from seizure-related causes compared with suicide. This underpins the importance of effective seizure control in preventing premature death. ANN NEUROL 2021</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10969861/most-recent">Satb1 expression in retinal ganglion cells of marmosets, macaques and humans</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Recent advances in single-cell RNA sequencing have enabled the molecular distinction of ganglion cell populations in mammalian retinas. Here we used antibodies against the transcription factor Special AT-rich binding protein 1 (Satb1, a protein which is expressed by ON-OFF direction selective ganglion cells in mouse retina) to study Satb1 expression in the retina of marmosets (<i>Callithrix jacchus</i>), macaques (<i>Macaca fascicularis</i>) and humans. In all species, Satb1 was exclusively expressed in retinal ganglion cells. The Satb1 cells made up ∼2 % of the ganglion cell population in central retina of all species, rising to a maximum ∼7% in peripheral marmoset retina. Intracellular injections in marmoset and macaque retinas revealed that most Satb1 expressing ganglion cells are widefield ganglion cells. In marmoset, Satb1 cells have a densely branching dendritic tree and included broad and narrow thorny, recursive bistratified and parasol cells, all of which showed some co-stratification with the outer or inner cholinergic amacrine cells. The recursive bistratified cells showed the strongest co-stratification but did not show extensive co-fasciculation as reported for ON-OFF direction selective cells in rabbit and rodent retinas. In macaque, Satb1 was not expressed in recursive bistratified cells, but in large sparsely branching cells. Our findings further support the idea that the expression of transcription factors in retinal ganglion cells is not conserved across Old World (human and macaque) and New World (marmoset) primates and provides a further step to link a molecular marker with specific cell types.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Medicinal properties of Morus alba for the control of type 2 diabetes mellitus: a systematic review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The objective of this review was to evaluate the medicinal potential of Morus alba leaves on the control of type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2). The research question was: what is the therapeutic potential of Morus alba leaves for the control of DM2? Methods: This systematic review was based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The included studies were extracted from Scopus, Pubmed, ScienceDirect, Scielo, and Google Scholar; January 2015 to July 2021. Key search terms were MeSH and DeCS: Morus alba, mulberry, hypoglycemic agent. The inclusion criteria were: studies in rats administered Morus alba leaf extracts; studies that included the dimensions of lipidemia and glycemia; studies that included indicators such as fasting glucose, postprandial glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin, triglycerides, low-density lipoproteins, total cholesterol, and insulin resistance. Exclusion criteria: studies in which Morus alba leaves were administered with other plants; studies with other parts of the Morus alba plant; proteomic studies, cancer, duplicate studies, in vitro studies, and evaluation of included studies. All included investigations were evaluated for biases. Results: Of 253 studies found, 29 were included. The extracts of Morus alba leaves at the phytochemical level improve glucose uptake. Chlorogenic acid, isoquercitrin, and quercitrin, present in the leaves of Morus alba, have hypoglycemic properties and an ameliorating effect on diabetic nephropathy. This leaf has pharmacological effects such as glucose absorption, insulin secretion production, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent, antihyperglycemic and antihyperlipidemic activities, and obesity management. Conclusions: Morus alba leaves have pharmacological effects on DM2 that include glucose absorption, production of insulin secretion, antioxidant agent, antihyperglycemic and antihyperlipidemic activities, and obesity control. Beyond these results, there is a lack of studies on the potential and synergistic effects of Morus alba leaves' components, limiting the possibility of a more effective therapy using the plant's leaves.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Intergenerational adaptations to stress are evolutionarily conserved, stress-specific, and have deleterious trade-offs</a></h4>

              
                Despite reports of parental exposure to stress promoting physiological adaptations in progeny in diverse organisms, there remains considerable debate over the significance and evolutionary conservation of such multigenerational effects. Here, we investigate four independent models of intergenerational adaptations to stress in <i>C. elegans </i>- bacterial infection, eukaryotic infection, osmotic stress and nutrient stress - across multiple species. We found that all four intergenerational physiological adaptations are conserved in at least one other species, that they are stress-specific, and that they have deleterious trade-offs in mismatched environments. By profiling the effects of parental bacterial infection and osmotic stress exposure on progeny gene expression across species we established a core set of 587 genes that exhibited a greater than 2-fold intergenerational change in expression in response to stress in <i>C. elegans</i> and at least one other species, as well as a set of 37 highly conserved genes that exhibited a greater than 2-fold intergenerational change in expression in all four species tested. Furthermore, we provide evidence suggesting that presumed adaptive and deleterious intergenerational effects are molecularly related at the gene expression level. Lastly, we found that none of the effects we detected of these stresses on <i>C. elegans</i> F1 progeny gene expression persisted transgenerationally three generations after stress exposure. We conclude that intergenerational responses to stress play a substantial and evolutionarily conserved role in regulating animal physiology and that the vast majority of the effects of parental stress on progeny gene expression are reversible and not maintained transgenerationally.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Neuropsychological evidence of multi-domain network hubs in the human thalamus</a></h4>

              
                Hubs in the human brain support behaviors that arise from brain network interactions. Previous studies have identified hub regions in the human thalamus that are connected with multiple functional networks. However, the behavioral significance of thalamic hubs has yet to be established. Our framework predicts that thalamic subregions with strong hub properties are broadly involved in functions across multiple cognitive domains. To test this prediction, we studied human patients with focal thalamic lesions in conjunction with network analyses of the human thalamocortical functional connectome. In support of our prediction, lesions to thalamic subregions with stronger hub properties were associated with widespread deficits in executive, language, and memory functions, whereas lesions to thalamic subregions with weaker hub properties were associated with more limited deficits. These results highlight how a large-scale network model can broaden our understanding of thalamic function for human cognition.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">An improved fluorescent noncanonical amino acid for measuring conformational distributions using time-resolved transition metal ion FRET</a></h4>

              
                With the recent explosion in high-resolution protein structures, one of the next frontiers in biology is elucidating the mechanisms by which conformational rearrangements in proteins are regulated to meet the needs of cells under changing conditions. Rigorously measuring protein energetics and dynamics requires the development of new methods that can resolve structural heterogeneity and conformational distributions. We have previously developed steady-state transition metal ion fluorescence resonance energy transfer (tmFRET) approaches using a fluorescent noncanonical amino acid donor (Anap) and transition metal ion acceptor to probe conformational rearrangements in soluble and membrane proteins. Here, we show that the fluorescent noncanonical amino acid Acd has superior photophysical properties that extend its utility as a donor for tmFRET. Using maltose-binding protein (MBP) expressed in mammalian cells as a model system, we show that Acd is comparable to Anap in steady-state tmFRET experiments and that its long, single-exponential lifetime is better suited for probing conformational distributions using time-resolved FRET. These experiments reveal differences in heterogeneity in the apo and holo conformational states of MBP and produce accurate quantification of the distributions among apo and holo conformational states at subsaturating maltose concentrations. Our new approach using Acd for time-resolved tmFRET sets the stage for measuring the energetics of conformational rearrangements in soluble and membrane proteins in near-native conditions.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">TAZ inhibits glucocorticoid receptor and coordinates hepatic glucose homeostasis in normal physiologic states</a></h4>

              
                The elucidation of the mechanisms whereby the liver maintains glucose homeostasis is crucial for the understanding of physiologic and pathologic states. Here, we show a novel role of hepatic transcriptional co-activator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) in the inhibition of glucocorticoid receptor (GR). TAZ is abundantly expressed in pericentral hepatocytes and its expression is markedly reduced by fasting. TAZ interacts <i>via</i> its WW domain with the ligand-binding domain of GR to limit the binding of GR to the GR response element in gluconeogenic gene promoters. Therefore, liver-specific TAZ knockout mice show increases in glucose production and blood glucose concentration. Conversely, the overexpression of TAZ in mouse liver reduces the binding of GR to gluconeogenic gene promoters and glucose production. Thus, our findings demonstrate that hepatic TAZ inhibits GR-transactivation of gluconeogenic genes and coordinates gluconeogenesis in response to physiologic fasting and feeding.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Retinoic acid signaling is directly activated in cardiomyocytes and protects mouse hearts from apoptosis after myocardial infarction</a></h4>

              
                Retinoic acid (RA) is an essential signaling molecule for cardiac development and plays a protective role in the heart after myocardial infarction (MI). In both cases, the effect of RA signaling on cardiomyocytes, the principle cell type of the heart, has been reported to be indirect. Here we have developed an inducible murine transgenic RA-reporter line using CreER<sup>T2</sup> technology that permits lineage tracing of RA-responsive cells and faithfully recapitulates endogenous RA activity in multiple organs during embryonic development. Strikingly, we have observed a direct RA response in cardiomyocytes during mid-late gestation and after MI. Ablation of RA signaling through deletion of the <i>Aldh1a1/a2/a3</i> genes encoding RA-synthesizing enzymes leads to increased cardiomyocyte apoptosis in adults subjected to MI. RNA sequencing analysis reveals <i>Tgm2</i> and <i>Ace1, </i>two genes with well-established links to cardiac repair<i>, </i>as potential targets of RA signaling in primary cardiomyocytes, thereby providing novel links between the RA pathway and heart disease.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Evolutionary transcriptomics implicates new genes and pathways in human pregnancy and adverse pregnancy outcomes</a></h4>

              
                Evolutionary changes in the anatomy and physiology of the female reproductive system underlie the origins and diversification of pregnancy in Eutherian ('Placental') mammals. This developmental and evolutionary history constrains normal physiological functions and biases the ways in which dysfunction contributes to reproductive trait diseases and adverse pregnancy outcomes. Here, we show that gene expression changes in the human endometrium during pregnancy are associated with the evolution of human-specific traits and pathologies of pregnancy. We found that hundreds of genes gained or lost endometrial expression in the human lineage. Among these are genes that may contribute to human-specific maternal-fetal communication (<i>HTR2B</i>) and maternal-fetal immunotolerance (<i>PDCD1LG2</i>) systems, as well as vascular remodeling and deep placental invasion (<i>CORIN</i>). These data suggest that explicit evolutionary studies of anatomical systems complement traditional methods for characterizing the genetic architecture of disease. We also anticipate our results will advance the emerging synthesis of evolution and medicine ('evolutionary medicine') and be a starting point for more sophisticated studies of the maternal-fetal interface. Furthermore, the gene expression changes we identified may contribute to the development of diagnostics and interventions for adverse pregnancy outcomes.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Duox generated reactive oxygen species activate ATR/Chk1 to induce G2 arrest in Drosophila tracheoblasts</a></h4>

              
                Progenitors of the thoracic tracheal system of adult <i>Drosophila</i> (tracheoblasts) arrest in G2 during larval life and rekindle a mitotic program subsequently. G2 arrest is dependent on ATR-dependent phosphorylation of Chk1 that is actuated in the absence of detectable DNA damage. We are interested in the mechanisms that activate ATR/Chk1 (Kizhedathu et al., 2018, 2020). Here we report that levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) are high in arrested tracheoblasts and decrease upon mitotic re-entry. High ROS is dependent on expression of Duox, an H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> generating-Dual Oxidase. ROS quenching by overexpression of Superoxide Dismutase 1, or by knockdown of Duox, abolishes Chk1 phosphorylation and results in precocious proliferation. Tracheae deficient in Duox, or deficient in both Duox and regulators of DNA damage-dependent ATR/Chk1 activation (ATRIP/TOPBP1/ Claspin), can induce phosphorylation of Chk1 in response to micromolar concentrations of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in minutes. The findings presented reveal that H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> activates ATR/Chk1 in tracheoblasts by a non-canonical, potentially direct, mechanism.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Memory recall involves a transient break in excitatory-inhibitory balance</a></h4>

              
                The brain has a remarkable capacity to acquire and store memories that can later be selectively recalled. These processes are supported by the hippocampus which is thought to index memory recall by reinstating information stored across distributed neocortical circuits. However, the mechanism that supports this interaction remains unclear. Here, in humans, we show that recall of a visual cue from a paired associate is accompanied by a transient increase in the ratio between glutamate and GABA in visual cortex. Moreover, these excitatory-inhibitory fluctuations are predicted by activity in the hippocampus. These data suggest the hippocampus gates memory recall by indexing information stored across neocortical circuits using a disinhibitory mechanism.

                Nanocolumns are trans-synaptic structures which align presynaptic vesicles release sites and postsynaptic receptors. However, how these nano structures shape synaptic signaling remains little understood. Given the difficulty to probe submicroscopic structures experimentally, computer modelling is a usefull approach to investigate the possible functional impacts of nanocolumns. In our in silico model, as has been experimentally observed, a nanocolumn is characterized by a tight distribution of postsynaptic receptors aligned with the presynaptic vesicle release site and by the presence of trans-synaptic molecules which can modulate neurotransmitter diffusion. We found that nanocolumns can play an important role in reinforcing synaptic current mostly when the presynaptic vesicle contains a small number of neurotransmitters. We also show that synapses with and without nanocolumns could have differentiated responses to spontaneous or evoked events. Our work provides a new methodology to investigate in silico the role of the submicroscopic organization of the synapse.

                For individual neurons to function appropriately within a network that is undergoing synaptic reorganization and refinement due to developmental or experience-dependent changes in circuit activity, they must homeostatically adapt their intrinsic excitability to maintain a consistent output despite the changing levels of synaptic input. This homeostatic plasticity of excitability is particularly important for the development of sensory circuits, where subtle deficits in neuronal and circuit function cause developmental disorders including autism spectrum disorder and epilepsy. Despite the critical importance of this process for normal circuit development, the molecular mechanism by which this homeostatic control of intrinsic excitability is regulated is not fully understood. Here, we demonstrate that Xenopus optic tectal neurons express distinct fast, persistent and resurgent Na+ currents. Here, we demonstrate that Xenopus optic tectal neurons express distinct fast, persistent and resurgent Na+ currents. These are regulated with developmental changes in synaptic input, and homeostatically in response to changes in visual input. We show that expression of the voltage-gated Na+ channel subtype Nav1.6 is regulated with changes in intrinsic excitability, that blocking Nav1.6 channels is sufficient to decrease intrinsic excitability. Furthermore, that upregulation of Nav1.6 expression is necessary for experience-dependent increases in Na+ currents and intrinsic excitability. Finally, by examining behaviors that rely on visual and multisensory integration, we extend these findings to show that tight regulation of Na+ channel gene expression during a critical period of tectal circuit development is required for the normal functional development of the tectal circuitry.

                Vasoactive intestinal peptide-expressing (VIP) interneurons, which constitute 10-15% of the cortical inhibitory neuron population, have emerged as an important cell type for regulating excitatory cell activity based on behavioral state. VIP cells in sensory cortex are potently engaged by neuromodulatory and motor inputs during active exploratory behaviors like locomotion and whisking, which in turn promote pyramidal cell firing via disinhibition. Such state-dependent modulation of activity by VIP cells in sensory cortex has been studied widely in recent years. However, the function of VIP cells during goal-directed behavior is less well understood. It is not clear how task-related events like sensory stimuli, motor actions, or reward activate VIP cells in sensory cortex since there is often temporal overlap in the occurrence of these events. We developed a Go/NoGo whisker touch detection task which incorporates a post-stimulus delay period to separate sensory-driven activity from action- or reward-related activity during behavior. We used 2-photon calcium imaging to measure task-related signals of L2/3 VIP neurons in S1 of behaving mice. We report for the first time that VIP cells in mouse whisker S1 are activated by both whisker stimuli and goal-directed licking. Whisker- and lick-related signals were spatially organized in relation to anatomical columns in S1. Sensory responses of VIP cells were tuned to specific whiskers, whether or not they also displayed lick-related activity.

                Animals are constantly bombarded with stimuli, which presents a fundamental problem of sorting among pervasive uninformative stimuli and novel, possibly meaningful stimuli. We evaluated novelty detection behaviorally in honey bees as they position their antennae differentially in an air stream carrying familiar or novel odors. We then characterized neuronal responses to familiar and novel odors in the first synaptic integration center in the brain, the antennal lobes. We found that the neurons that exhibited stronger initial responses to the odor that was to be familiarized are the same units that later distinguish familiar and novel odors, independently of chemical identities. These units, including both projection neurons and local neurons, showed a decreased response to the familiar odor but an increased response to the novel odor. Our results suggest that the antennal lobe may assign a category of familiarity or novelty to an odor stimulus in addition to its chemical identity code. Therefore, the mechanisms for novelty detection may be present in early sensory processing, either as a result of local synaptic interaction or via feedback from higher brain centers.

                In todays world, neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimers disease, Parkinsons Disease, Huntingtons Disease as well as brain cancers such as astrocytomas, ependymomas, glioblastomas have become a great threat to us. In this study, we are trying to find a probable molecular connection associated with two very much different diseases, Glioblastoma, also known as Glioblastoma Multiforme (cancers of microglial cells of our brain) and Parkinsons disease. We at first downloaded the microarray datasets of these two diseases from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and then analyzed them by the GEO2R tool. After analysis, we found 249 common upregulated differential expressed genes and 135 common downregulated differential expressed genes of these two diseases. Therefore the common differentially expressed genes, both upregulated and downregulated, were imported into STRING online tool to find out the protein-protein interactions. Now, this whole network was subjected to Cytoscape and the top ten hub genes were found by Cyto-Hubba plug-in. The top then hub genes are EGFR, CCNB1, CDK1, CCNA2, CHEK1, RAD51, MAD2L1, KIF20A, BUB1, and CCNB2. These all genes are upregulated in both diseases. To find out the biological processes, molecular functions, cellular components, and pathways associated with these hub genes Enrichr online software was used. We used miRNet software to determine the interactions of hub genes with microRNAs. This study will be useful in the future for drug targets discovery for these diseases.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Measurements of EEG Alpha Peak Frequencies Over the Lifespan: Validating Target Ranges on an In-Clinic Platform</a></h4>

              
                Background: Peak individual alpha frequencies (IAF) extracted from an EEG exam can provide novel sources of information regarding brain function. This information can help measure and track changes in cognition arising from conditions such as concussion or unhealthy aging. Objective 1: To validate a method for combining eyes-closed EEG with eyes-closed audio P300 ERP in order to streamline testing times involved in IAF extraction. Objective 2: To validate age-stratified target ranges of IAF collected in clinic against published research. Objective 3: To validate the stability of IAF for data collected in routine clinical settings. Participants: Two thousand twenty-five subjects aged 13-90. Methods: EEG with audio P300 was collected as part of a health screening exam for studies through Colorado University, Children's Hospital Colorado, Boone Heart Institute, WAVi Co., and various clinics alongside other clinical evaluations. Results: (1) No differences were seen between IAF extracted during an eyes-closed resting and the P300 protocol. (2) The age-related AF trends measured in clinic match the age-related trends from previous research. (3) IAF remained stable over the course of 0-2 years in a test-retest dataset. Conclusion: In-clinic measures of peak EEG frequency corroborate the age-related trends of published research taken over the last several decades and IAF. These results also confirm that IAF is a stable trait, making it useful for within-person longitudinal tracking. By following changes in IAF over time, deviations from normal CNS functioning, such as onset or progression of disease, can be monitored.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Prediction and preview strongly affect reading times but not skipping during natural reading</a></h4>

              
                In a typical text, readers look much longer at some words than at others and fixate some words multiple times, while skipping others altogether. Historically, researchers explained this variation via low-level visual or oculomotor factors, but today it is primarily explained via cognitive factors, such as how well words can be predicted from context or discerned from parafoveal preview. While the existence of these effects has been well established in experiments, the relative importance of prediction, preview and low-level factors for eye movement variation in natural reading is unclear. Here, we address this question using a deep neural network and Bayesian ideal observer to model linguistic prediction and parafoveal preview from moment to moment in natural reading (n=104, 1.5 million words). Strikingly, neither prediction nor preview was important for explaining word skipping - the vast majority of skipping was explained by a simple oculomotor model. For reading times, by contrast, we found clear but independent contributions of both prediction and preview, and effect sizes matching those from controlled experiments. Together, these results challenge dominant models of eye movements in reading by showing that linguistic prediction and parafoveal preview are not important determinants of word skipping.
