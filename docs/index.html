              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19021">Category learning in deep neural networks: Information content and geometry of internal representations</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2510.19021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In animals, category learning enhances discrimination between stimuli close to the category boundary. This phenomenon, called categorical perception, was also empirically observed in artificial neural networks trained on classification tasks. In previous modeling works based on neuroscience data, we show that this expansion/compression is a necessary outcome of efficient learning. Here we extend our theoretical framework to artificial networks. We show that minimizing the Bayes cost (mean of the cross-entropy loss) implies maximizing the mutual information between the set of categories and the neural activities prior to the decision layer. Considering structured data with an underlying feature space of small dimension, we show that maximizing the mutual information implies (i) finding an appropriate projection space, and, (ii) building a neural representation with the appropriate metric. The latter is based on a Fisher information matrix measuring the sensitivity of the neural activity to changes in the projection space. Optimal learning makes this neural Fisher information follow a category-specific Fisher information, measuring the sensitivity of the category membership. Category learning thus induces an expansion of neural space near decision boundaries. We characterize the properties of the categorical Fisher information, showing that its eigenvectors give the most discriminant directions at each point of the projection space. We find that, unexpectedly, its maxima are in general not exactly at, but near, the class boundaries. Considering toy models and the MNIST dataset, we numerically illustrate how after learning the two Fisher information matrices match, and essentially align with the category boundaries. Finally, we relate our approach to the Information Bottleneck one, and we exhibit a bias-variance decomposition of the Bayes cost, of interest on its own.

                arXiv:2408.00782v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hermann discovered the grid illusion in 1870, but its cause has remained a mystery for more than 150 years. In 1960, Baumgartner proposed a hypothesis for the illusion based on neural receptive fields, but Geier presented a counterexample in 2008. In 1995, Schrauf devised the scintillating grid illusion, an improvement on the Hermann grid illusion. I propose that a hypothesis involving blind spots (optic discs) can significantly contribute to unraveling the mystery of the grid illusion.

                arXiv:2409.08303v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motor dysfunction is a common sign of neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) such as Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD), but may be difficult to detect, especially in the early stages. In this work, we examine the behavior of a wide array of interpretable features extracted from the handwriting signals of 113 subjects performing multiple tasks on a digital tablet, as part of the Neurological Signals dataset. The aim is to measure their effectiveness in characterizing NDs, including AD and PD. To this end, task-agnostic and task-specific features are extracted from 14 distinct tasks. Subsequently, through statistical analysis and a series of classification experiments, we investigate which features provide greater discriminative power between NDs and healthy controls and amongst different NDs. Preliminary results indicate that the tasks at hand can all be effectively leveraged to distinguish between the considered set of NDs, specifically by measuring the stability, the speed of writing, the time spent not writing, and the pressure variations between groups from our handcrafted interpretable features, which shows a statistically significant difference between groups, across multiple tasks. Using various binary classification algorithms on the computed features, we obtain up to 87% accuracy for the discrimination between AD and healthy controls (CTL), and up to 69% for the discrimination between PD and CTL.

                arXiv:2505.11309v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To understand sensory coding, we must ask not only how much information neurons encode, but also what that information is about. This requires decomposing mutual information into contributions from individual stimuli and stimulus features: a fundamentally ill-posed problem with infinitely many possible solutions. We address this by introducing three core axioms, additivity, positivity, and locality that any meaningful stimulus-wise decomposition should satisfy. We then derive a decomposition that meets all three criteria and remains tractable for high-dimensional stimuli. Our decomposition can be efficiently estimated using diffusion models, allowing for scaling up to complex, structured and naturalistic stimuli. Applied to a model of visual neurons, our method quantifies how specific stimuli and features contribute to encoded information. Our approach provides a scalable, interpretable tool for probing representations in both biological and artificial neural systems.

                arXiv:2507.09024v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Data-hungry neuro-AI modelling requires ever larger neuroimaging datasets. CNeuroMod-THINGS meets this need by capturing neural representations for a wide set of semantic concepts using well-characterized images in a new densely-sampled, large-scale fMRI dataset. Importantly, CNeuroMod-THINGS exploits synergies between two existing projects: the THINGS initiative (THINGS) and the Courtois Project on Neural Modelling (CNeuroMod). THINGS has developed a common set of thoroughly annotated images broadly sampling natural and man-made objects which is used to acquire a growing collection of large-scale multimodal neural responses. Meanwhile, CNeuroMod is acquiring hundreds of hours of fMRI data from a core set of participants during controlled and naturalistic tasks, including visual tasks like movie watching and videogame playing. For CNeuroMod-THINGS, four CNeuroMod participants each completed 33-36 sessions of a continuous recognition paradigm using approximately 4000 images from the THINGS stimulus set spanning 720 categories. We report behavioural and neuroimaging metrics that showcase the quality of the data. By bridging together large existing resources, CNeuroMod-THINGS expands our capacity to model broad slices of the human visual experience.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18404">Saccade crossing avoidance as a visual search strategy</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2508.18404v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although visual search appears largely random, several oculomotor biases exist such that the likelihoods of saccade directions and lengths depend on the previous scan path. Compared to the most recent fixations, the impact of the longer path history is more difficult to quantify. Using the step-selection framework commonly used in movement ecology, and analyzing data from 45-second viewings of "Where's Waldo?", we report a new memory-dependent effect that also varies significantly between individuals, which we term self-crossing avoidance. This is a tendency for saccades to avoid crossing those earlier in the scan path, and is most evident when both have small amplitudes. We show this by comparing real data to synthetic data generated from a memoryless approximation of the spatial statistics (i.e. a Markovian nonparametric model with a matching distribution of saccade lengths over time). Maximum likelihood fitting indicates that this effect is strongest when including the last $\approx 7$ seconds of a scan path. The effect size is comparable to well-known forms of history dependence such as inhibition of return. A parametric probabilistic model including a self-crossing penalty term was able to reproduce joint statistics of saccade lengths and self-crossings. We also quantified individual strategic differences, and their consistency over the six images viewed per participant, using mixed-effect regressions. Participants with a higher tendency to avoid crossings displayed smaller saccade lengths and shorter fixation durations on average, but did not display more horizontal, vertical, forward or reverse saccades. Together, these results indicate that the avoidance of crossings is a local orienting strategy that facilitates and complements inhibition of return, and hence exploration of visual scenes.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17138">Analyzing Memory Effects in Large Language Models through the lens of Cognitive Psychology</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2509.17138v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Memory, a fundamental component of human cognition, exhibits adaptive yet fallible characteristics as illustrated by Schacter's memory "sins".These cognitive phenomena have been studied extensively in psychology and neuroscience, but the extent to which artificial systems, specifically Large Language Models (LLMs), emulate these cognitive phenomena remains underexplored. This study uses human memory research as a lens for understanding LLMs and systematically investigates human memory effects in state-of-the-art LLMs using paradigms drawn from psychological research. We evaluate seven key memory phenomena, comparing human behavior to LLM performance. Both people and models remember less when overloaded with information (list length effect) and remember better with repeated exposure (list strength effect). They also show similar difficulties when retrieving overlapping information, where storing too many similar facts leads to confusion (fan effect). Like humans, LLMs are susceptible to falsely "remembering" words that were never shown but are related to others (false memories), and they can apply prior learning to new, related situations (cross-domain generalization). However, LLMs differ in two key ways: they are less influenced by the order in which information is presented (positional bias) and more robust when processing random or meaningless material (nonsense effect). These results reveal both alignments and divergences in how LLMs and humans reconstruct memory. The findings help clarify how memory-like behavior in LLMs echoes core features of human cognition, while also highlighting the architectural differences that lead to distinct patterns of error and success.

                arXiv:2502.02904v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Writing is a cognitively demanding activity that requires constant decision-making, heavy reliance on working memory, and frequent shifts between tasks of different goals. To build writing assistants that truly align with writers' cognition, we must capture and decode the complete thought process behind how writers transform ideas into final texts. We present ScholaWrite, the first dataset of end-to-end scholarly writing, tracing the multi-month journey from initial drafts to final manuscripts. We contribute three key advances: (1) a Chrome extension that unobtrusively records keystrokes on Overleaf, enabling the collection of realistic, in-situ writing data; (2) a novel corpus of full scholarly manuscripts, enriched with fine-grained annotations of cognitive writing intentions. The dataset includes \LaTeX-based edits from five computer science preprints, capturing nearly 62K text changes over four months; and (3) analyses and insights into the micro-dynamics of scholarly writing, highlighting gaps between human writing processes and the current capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in providing meaningful assistance. ScholaWrite underscores the value of capturing end-to-end writing data to develop future writing assistants that support, not replace, the cognitive work of scientists.

                arXiv:2510.18037v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural activity forecasting is central to understanding neural systems and enabling closed-loop control. While deep learning has recently advanced the state-of-the-art in the time series forecasting literature, its application to neural activity forecasting remains limited. To bridge this gap, we systematically evaluated eight probabilistic deep learning models, including two foundation models, that have demonstrated strong performance on general forecasting benchmarks. We compared them against four classical statistical models and two baseline methods on spontaneous neural activity recorded from mouse cortex via widefield imaging. Across prediction horizons, several deep learning models consistently outperformed classical approaches, with the best model producing informative forecasts up to 1.5 seconds into the future. Our findings point toward future control applications and open new avenues for probing the intrinsic temporal structure of neural activity.

                arXiv:2510.19764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The majority of research in both training Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and modeling learning in biological brains focuses on synaptic plasticity, where learning equates to changing the strength of existing connections. However, in biological brains, structural plasticity - where new connections are created and others removed - is also vital, not only for effective learning but also for recovery from damage and optimal resource usage. Inspired by structural plasticity, pruning is often used in machine learning to remove weak connections from trained models to reduce the computational requirements of inference. However, the machine learning frameworks typically used for backpropagation-based training of both ANNs and Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are optimized for dense connectivity, meaning that pruning does not help reduce the training costs of ever-larger models. The GeNN simulator already supports efficient GPU-accelerated simulation of sparse SNNs for computational neuroscience and machine learning. Here, we present a new flexible framework for implementing GPU-accelerated structural plasticity rules and demonstrate this first using the e-prop supervised learning rule and DEEP R to train efficient, sparse SNN classifiers and then, in an unsupervised learning context, to learn topographic maps. Compared to baseline dense models, our sparse classifiers reduce training time by up to 10x while the DEEP R rewiring enables them to perform as well as the original models. We demonstrate topographic map formation in faster-than-realtime simulations, provide insights into the connectivity evolution, and measure simulation speed versus network size. The proposed framework will enable further research into achieving and maintaining sparsity in network structure and neural communication, as well as exploring the computational benefits of sparsity in a range of neuromorphic applications.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18886">Emergence of Internal State-Modulated Swarming in Multi-Agent Patch Foraging System</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2510.18886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active particles are entities that sustain persistent out-of-equilibrium motion by consuming energy. Under certain conditions, they exhibit the tendency to self-organize through coordinated movements, such as swarming via aggregation. While performing non-cooperative foraging tasks, the emergence of such swarming behavior in foragers, exemplifying active particles, has been attributed to the partial observability of the environment, in which the presence of another forager can serve as a proxy signal to indicate the potential presence of a food source or a resource patch. In this paper, we validate this phenomenon by simulating multiple self-propelled foragers as they forage from multiple resource patches in a non-cooperative manner. These foragers operate in a continuous two-dimensional space with stochastic position updates and partial observability. We evolve a shared policy in the form of a continuous-time recurrent neural network that serves as a velocity controller for the foragers. To this end, we use an evolutionary strategy algorithm wherein the different samples of the policy-distribution are evaluated in the same rollout. Then we show that agents are able to learn to adaptively forage in the environment. Next, we show the emergence of swarming in the form of aggregation among the foragers when resource patches are absent. We observe that the strength of this swarming behavior appears to be inversely proportional to the amount of resource stored in the foragers, which supports the risk-sensitive foraging claims. Empirical analysis of the learned controller's hidden states in minimal test runs uncovers their sensitivity to the amount of resource stored in a forager. Clamping these hidden states to represent a lesser amount of resource hastens its learned aggregation behavior.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17393">[RETRACTED]Evolving Form and Function: Dual-Objective Optimization in Neural Symbolic Regression Networks</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2502.17393v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: [RETRACTED]Data increasingly abounds, but distilling their underlying relationships down to something interpretable remains challenging. One approach is genetic programming, which `symbolically regresses' a data set down into an equation.
  However, symbolic regression (SR) faces the issue of requiring training from scratch for each new dataset. To generalize across all datasets, deep learning techniques have been applied to SR.
  These networks, however, are only able to be trained using a symbolic objective: NN-generated and target equations are symbolically compared. But this does not consider the predictive power of these equations, which could be measured by a behavioral objective that compares the generated equation's predictions to actual data.
  Here we introduce a method that combines gradient descent and evolutionary computation to yield neural networks that minimize the symbolic and behavioral errors of the equations they generate from data.
  As a result, these evolved networks are shown to generate more symbolically and behaviorally accurate equations than those generated by networks trained by state-of-the-art gradient based neural symbolic regression methods.
  We hope this method suggests that evolutionary algorithms, combined with gradient descent, can improve SR results by yielding equations with more accurate form and function.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18221">The Emergence of Complex Behavior in Large-Scale Ecological Environments</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2510.18221v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore how physical scale and population size shape the emergence of complex behaviors in open-ended ecological environments. In our setting, agents are unsupervised and have no explicit rewards or learning objectives but instead evolve over time according to reproduction, mutation, and natural selection. As they act, agents also shape their environment and the population around them in an ongoing dynamic ecology. Our goal is not to optimize a single high-performance policy, but instead to examine how behaviors emerge and evolve across large populations due to natural competition and environmental pressures. In an effort to discover how complex behaviors naturally emerge, we conduct experiments in large-scale worlds that reach populations of more than 60,000 individual agents, each with their own evolved neural network policy. We identify various emergent behaviors such as long-range resource extraction, vision-based foraging, and predation that arise under competitive and survival pressures. We examine how sensing modalities and environmental scale affect the emergence of these behaviors, finding that some appear only in sufficiently large environments and populations, with larger scales increasing behavioral stability and consistency. While there is a rich history of research in evolutionary settings, our scaling results provide promising new directions to explore ecology as an instrument of machine learning in an era of abundant computational resources.

                <p>People are remarkably self-focused, disproportionately choosing to think about themselves relative to other topics. Self-focus can be adaptive, helping individuals fulfill their needs. It can also be maladaptive, with self-focus a risk and maintenance factor for internalizing disorders like depression. Yet, the drive to focus on the self remains to be fully characterized. We discovered a brain pattern that when spontaneously brought online during a quick mental break predicts the desire to focus on oneself just a few seconds later. In Study 1 (19 female and 13 male human subjects), we identified a default network neural signature from pr-trial activity that predicts multiple indicators of self-focus within our sample. In Study 2 (588 female and 498 male human subjects), we applied our neural signature to independent resting-state data from the Human Connectome Project. We found that individuals who score high on internalizing, a form of maladaptive self-focus, similarly move in and out of this pattern during rest, suggesting a systematic trajectory toward self-focused thought. This is the first work to "decode" the bias to focus on the self and paves the way toward stopping maladaptive self-focus in its course.</p>

                <p>The purpose of this study was to investigate how Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) signaling regulates glial phenotype, neuroprotection, and reprogramming of Mu&#x0308;ller glia (MG) into neurogenic MG-derived progenitor cells (MGPCs) in the adult male and female mouse retina. We found that S1P-related genes were dynamically regulated following retinal damage. <I>S1pr1</I> (S1P receptor 1) and <I>Sphk1</I> (sphingosine kinase 1) are expressed at low levels by resting MG and are rapidly upregulated following acute damage. Overexpression of the neurogenic bHLH transcription factor Ascl1 in MG downregulates <I>S1pr1</I>, and inhibition of Sphk1 and S1pr1/3 enhances Ascl1-driven differentiation of bipolar-like cells. Treatments that activate S1pr1 or increase retinal levels of S1P initiate proinflammatory NFB signaling in MG, whereas treatments that inhibit S1pr1 or decreased levels of S1P suppress NFB signaling in MG. Conditional knock-out (cKO) of <I>S1pr1</I> in MG, but not <I>Sphk1</I>, enhances the accumulation of immune cells in damaged retinas. cKO of <I>S1pr1</I> promotes the survival of ganglion cells, whereas cKO of <I>Sphk1</I> promotes the survival amacrine cells in damaged retinas. Consistent with these findings, pharmacological treatments that inhibit S1P receptors or inhibit Sphk1 have protective effects upon inner retinal neurons. We conclude that the S1P signaling pathway is activated in MG after damage and this pathway restricts the accumulation of immune cells, impairs neuron survival, and suppresses the reprogramming of MG into neurogenic progenitors in the adult mouse retina.</p>

                <p>During cortical development, oligodendrocyte precursor (OPC) attachment and detachment to microvessels play a crucial role in their positioning and differentiation. In the developing brain, endothelial cells are regionally diverse, and previous studies showed a peak in cortical endothelial NMDA receptor (eNMDAR) expression during perinatal life, coinciding with OPC migration along microvessels. This raises the hypothesis that eNMDAR might influence the fate of vessel-associated OPC. In this study, a Grin1<sup>lox/lox</sup>/VeCad<sup>Cre</sup> mouse model was used to investigate in females and males the effects of endothelial GluN1 invalidation (eNMDAR<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup>) on (1) positioning and differentiation of cortical oligodendrocytes and myelination, (2) OPC/microvessel association and endothelial MMP9-like activity, and (3) motor activity. Results showed that, from postnatal days (P) 2 to P15, PDGFR&alpha; expression was increased in eNMDAR<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> mice and returned to wild-type levels by P45. CNPase and MBP expression was reduced at P15 and remained low in adult eNMDAR<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> mice. Histological analysis revealed no change in OPC&ndash;microvessel association, but positioning was altered with increased density in layers VI and V at P15. Myelination was impaired, as evidenced by thinner corpus callosum, reduced myelin sheath thickness, and higher g-ratio. Axonal mitochondria density was significantly increased. Functional tests revealed that glutamate could not stimulate endothelial MMP9-like activity in eNMDAR<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> mice. Molecular, histological and functional changes were linked to sensorimotor disabilities. At P45, despite the absence of observable myelination defects, locomotor impairments persisted, suggesting that early OPC differentiation disruption contributes to lasting motor dysfunction. These findings offer new insights into OPC vulnerability in human preterm infants.</p>

                <p>Alcohol use disorders (AUDs) are complex phenomena governed by genetics, neurophysiology, environment, and societal structures. New methods to understand the underlying neurogenetics are valuable for designing personalized interventional strategies. Here, we used a two-choice self-administration zebrafish assay to isolate the function of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunit alpha3 (<I>chrna3</I>) in alcohol response. Juvenile zebrafish, of either sex, prior to complete sex differentiation, were examined in this study. They exhibited a biphasic response when self-administering alcohol that transitioned from attraction to aversion within minutes, suggesting they can regulate exposure to alcohol. This inverted U-shaped self-administration mirrored the effect alcohol has on shoaling behavior. Exposure to low concentration of alcohol reduced anxiety-like behaviors, while sedative effects became prominent at higher concentrations resulting in reduced locomotion and uncoordinated swimming. In contrast, these responses are blunted in <I>chrna3</I> mutants. They exhibited prolonged alcohol self-administration and increased gregariousness. Transcriptomic analyses suggest that glutamatergic and GABAergic neurotransmission alongside cholinergic signaling is impacted in the mutant brains. Our results thus suggest that <I>chrna3</I> dysfunction has a systemic change with an increase in alcohol tolerance being one effect. These findings also highlight the use of nonrodent alternatives to understand the neurogenetics of development of AUD.</p>

                <p>Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) is a conserved RNA surveillance mechanism that degrades transcripts with premature termination codons (PTCs) and fine-tunes gene expression by targeting RNA transcripts with other NMD inducing features. This study demonstrates that conditional knock-out of <I>Smg5</I>, a key NMD component, in oligodendrocyte lineage cells disrupts the degradation of PTC-containing transcripts, including aberrant variants of the RNA-binding protein <I>Hnrnpl</I>. The loss of SMG5 in both sexes of mice impaired oligodendrocyte differentiation, reduced myelin gene expression, and led to thinner myelin sheaths and compromised motor function in mice. Mechanistically, HNRNPL was shown to regulate the alternative splicing of myelin-associated genes <I>Mag</I> and <I>Nfasc</I> and promote oligodendrocyte differentiation. These findings reveal that SMG5-mediated NMD ensures RNA processing fidelity essential for proper oligodendrocyte development and CNS myelination.</p>

                <p>Following injury, the peripheral nervous system (PNS) exhibits remarkable regenerative capacity, whereas the central nervous system (CNS) has limited regenerative potential. This difference is partially attributed to distinct postinjury myelin breakdown. However, the underlying mechanisms driving this disparity remain unclear. By comparing the expression profiles of injured peripheral and central nerves in adult male and female C57BL/6J mice, we identified insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 2 (IGFBP2) as a key regulator that determines the differences in myelin breakdown between the injured PNS and CNS. Schwann cell-derived IGFBP2 in the injured PNS promotes myelin breakdown and facilitates axonal regeneration. Furthermore, through lipidomics, we identify ceramide, a sphingolipid regulated by ceramide synthase 6 in injured nerves, as playing a critical role in IGFBP2-mediated myelin breakdown. Conversely, minimal IGFBP2 expression is observed in the injured CNS, contributing to the limited myelin breakdown and axon regeneration in injured CNS. These findings provide insights into the divergent regenerative potential of the PNS and CNS and unveil IGFBP2 and ceramide as promising targets for promoting CNS regeneration after injury.</p>

                <p>The paraventricular thalamic nucleus (PVT) integrates subcortical signals related to arousal, stress, addiction, and anxiety with top-down cortical influences. Increases or decreases in PVT activity exert profound, long-lasting effects on behavior related to motivation, addiction, and homeostasis. Yet the sources of its subcortical excitatory and inhibitory afferents, their distribution within the PVT, and their integration with layer-specific cortical inputs remain unclear. Using transgenic male and female mice selective for GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons, or for different cortical layers, we found that the input organization of PVT is unique among thalamic nuclei. PVT received subcortical GABAergic and glutamatergic inputs from multiple, distinct hypothalamic and brainstem regions. Most regions provided either excitatory or inhibitory afferents; however, subcortical inputs with dual components have also been found. Most of these subcortical inputs selectively targeted the core region of the PVT that contained large number of densely packed calretinin-positive (CR+) neurons. Cortical afferents to PVT displayed layer-specific segregation. Layer 5 neurons of the medial prefrontal cortex preferentially innervated the CR+ core, whereas layer 6 input was more abundant in the transition zone between PVT and the mediodorsal nucleus. These findings demonstrate extensive convergence of excitatory and inhibitory inputs from diverse subcortical sources, selectively, in a sharply delineated CR+ core region of PVT which is also under strong top-down control from layer 5. This unique organization may explain why the CR+ PVT core serves as a critical bottleneck in the subcortex&ndash;cortex communication involved in affective behavior.</p>

                <p>At the glutamatergic synapses between rod photoreceptors and ON-type bipolar cells (BCs), neurotransmitter is detected by the postsynaptic metabotropic glutamate receptor mGluR6. This receptor forms trans-synaptic interactions with ELFN1, a presynaptic cell adhesion molecule expressed in rods, and ELFN1 is important for mGluR6 localization at BC dendritic tips. Here, we show that in mice of either sex lacking mGluR6, the presynaptic localization of ELFN1 is disrupted. In rods of mGluR6 null mice, ELFN1 is still restricted to the axon terminal spherules but is only partially colocalized with synapses. The ELFN1 localization defect is rescued by expressing mGluR6-EGFP in ON-BCs. In vitro binding experiments demonstrated that the leucine-rich repeat (LRR) and LRR C-terminal cap (LRRCT) regions of the ELFN1 extracellular domain (ECD) are necessary and sufficient for binding to all of the Group 3 mGluRs, including mGluR6. ELFN1-flag expressed in rods of wild-type mice is correctly localized at presynapses, colocalizing with the postsynaptic marker TRPM1 in the outer plexiform layer. Deletion of the LRRCT domain abolished trafficking of ELFN1-flag to rod spherules, whereas deletion of other parts of the ELFN1 ECD did not prevent axonal trafficking or correct presynaptic localization. Our results demonstrate bidirectional mutual regulation of presynaptic enrichment of ELFN1 and postsynaptic enrichment of mGluR6 at photoreceptor synapses.</p>

                <p>Action control is hypothesized to be mediated by corticothalamo-basal ganglia loops subserving the acquisition and updating of action contingencies. Within this, the mediodorsal thalamus (MD) is thought to contribute to volitional control over behavior largely through its interactions with prefrontal cortex. However, MD also projects into striatum, the main input nucleus of the basal ganglia, and the contribution of such projections to behavioral control is not known. Using a mouse model of volitional action control in either sex, here we find that MD terminal calcium activity in dorsal medial striatum (MD-&gt;DMS) represents action information during initial acquisition of a novel action contingency. This representation of action information decreases with continued experience. Data demonstrate MD-&gt;DMS activity is necessary to learn and employ a contingency control over actions. Functional attenuation of MD-&gt;DMS activity negated normal exploration, instead biasing repetitive action control, and resulted in mice unable to adapt their initial action strategy upon changes in action contingency. This suggests MD supports plasticity underlying initial action strategy learning used to adjust control given changing contingencies. Overall, these data show that MD projections into striatum contribute to volitional action control that supports acquisition of adaptive behavior.</p>

                <p>Presenilin mutations are the most common cause of familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD), but the mechanisms by which they disrupt neuronal function remain unresolved, particularly in relation to -secretase activity. Using <I>Caenorhabditis elegans</I>, we show that the presenilin ortholog SEL-12 supports synaptic transmission and axonal integrity through a pathway involving the ryanodine receptor RYR-1. Loss-of-function mutations in either <I>sel-12</I> or <I>ryr-1</I> reduce neurotransmitter release and cause neuronal structural defects, with no additional impairment in double mutants, suggesting a shared pathway. Transgenic expression of a -secretase&ndash;inactive SEL-12 variant or human presenilin 1 restores normal synaptic transmission in <I>sel-12</I> mutants. Notably, <I>sel-12</I> loss does not alter <I>ryr-1</I> transcript or protein levels. These findings define a novel -secretase&ndash;independent role of presenilin in maintaining neuronal function via ryanodine receptor signaling, providing new mechanistic insight into presenilin-linked neurodegeneration and pointing to potential therapeutic strategies for FAD.</p>

                <p>Stress is a potent trigger for drug-seeking behaviors in both rodents and humans with a history of substance use. Kappa opioid receptors (kORs) play a critical role in mediating stress responses. Our previous studies in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) demonstrated that acute stress activates kORs to block long-term potentiation at GABA<SUB>A</SUB> synapses on dopamine neurons (LTP<SUB>GABA</SUB>) and triggers stress-induced reinstatement of cocaine seeking. Here we identify the specific GABAergic afferents affected by stress, the precise localization of kORs within the VTA, and show that VTA kOR activation is sufficient to drive reinstatement. In male and female mice, we optogenetically activated specific GABAergic afferents and found that nucleus accumbens (NAc)-to-VTA, but not lateral hypothalamus-to-VTA projections, exhibit stress-sensitive LTP<SUB>GABA</SUB>. Using a conditional knock-out approach, we found that selectively deleting kORs from NAc neurons but not from dopamine cells prevents stress-induced block of LTP<SUB>GABA</SUB>. Selectively activating dynorphin-containing NAc neurons with an excitatory DREADD mimics acute stress, preventing LTP<SUB>GABA</SUB> at VTA synapses. We furthermore demonstrated that without acute stress, microinjection of a selective kOR agonist directly into the VTA of male rats facilitates cocaine reinstatement without similarly affecting sucrose-motivated responding, demonstrating the critical role of kORs in stress-induced cocaine reinstatement. Our results show that kORs on GABAergic NAc nerve terminals in the VTA underlie loss of LTP<SUB>GABA</SUB> that may drive stress-induced addiction&ndash;related behaviors. Our work highlights the importance of inhibitory inputs for controlling dopamine neuron excitability in the context of addiction and contributes to defining the circuit involved in stress-induced drug reinstatement.</p>

                <p>The work of Hubel and Wiesel has been instrumental in shaping our understanding of V1, leading to modeling neural responses as cascades of linear and nonlinear processes in what is known as the "standard model" of vision. Under this formulation, however, some dendritic properties cannot be represented in a practical manner, while evidence from both experimental and theoretical work indicates that dendritic processes are an indispensable element of key neural behaviors. As a result, current V1 models fail to explain neural responses in a number of scenarios. In this work, we propose an implicit model for V1 that considers nonlinear dendritic integration and backpropagation of action potentials from the soma to the dendrites. Our model can be viewed as an extension of the standard model that minimizes an energy function, allows for a better conceptual understanding of neural processes, and explains several neurophysiological phenomena that have challenged classical approaches.</p>

                <p>Preventing deception requires understanding how lie detectors process social information across social distance. Although the outcomes of such information are crucial, how detectors evaluate gains or losses from close versus distant others remains unclear. Using a sender&ndash;receiver paradigm and functional near-infrared spectroscopy hyperscanning, we recruited 66 healthy adult dyads (32 male and 34 female dyads) to investigate how perceived social distance modulates the neural basis in receivers (the detector) during deceptive gain/loss evaluation. The results showed that detectors were more prone to deception in gain contexts, with these differences mediated by connectivity in risk evaluation (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, DLPFC), reward-processing (orbitofrontal cortex, OFC), and intention-understanding regions (frontal pole area). Hyperscanning analyses revealed that friend dyads exhibited higher interpersonal neural synchrony (INS) in these regions than stranger dyads. In gain contexts, friend dyads showed enhanced INS in the OFC, whereas in loss contexts, enhanced INS was observed in the DLPFC. Trial-level analysis revealed that the INS during the current trial effectively predicted the successful deception of that trial. We constructed a series of regression models and found that INS provides superior predictive power over single-brain measures. The INS-based support vector regression model achieved an accuracy of 86.66% in predicting deception. This indicates that increased trust at closer social distances reduces vigilance and fosters relationship-oriented social information processing. As the first to identify INS as a neural marker for deception from the detector's perspective, this work advances interpersonal deception theory and offers a neuroscientific basis for credit risk management.</p>

                <p>Studying locomotor activity in animal models is crucial for understanding physiological, behavioral, and pathological processes. This study aimed to develop an artificial intelligence-based tracking system called Goblotrop, designed to localize rodents within their laboratory environment. The Goblotrop system uses two infrared cameras to record videos of rodents in their home cages. A neural network analyzes these videos to determine the rodent's position at each time point. By tracking changes in position over time, the system provides detailed insights into rodent behavior, including speed, mobility, and climbing activity. To evaluate the system's reliability, we utilized a starvation-induced hyperactivity model, employed as a female mouse model for anorexia nervosa. This model is characterized by pronounced hyperactivity, typically assessed using electronically monitored running wheels. Both the Goblotrop system and running wheel measurements demonstrated that starvation increases food-anticipatory activity (up to 4&nbsp;h before food availability) while reducing nocturnal activity. The results from the Goblotrop system and running wheel measurements exhibited remarkable consistency. Thus, the Goblotrop system proves to be a valuable tool for studying locomotor activity and circadian rhythms in different cage areas in animal models. This tool provides potential for various scientific fields, including neuroscience, pharmacology, toxicology, and behavioral research.</p>

                <p>Recent investigations have revealed that selective attention to lateralized speech increases ipsilateral tonic electromyographic activity in the vestigial human auriculomotor system. However, it has yet to be determined whether this modulation depends upon predictive cues that are inherent in continuous speech or whether it is a general concomitant of selective attention to sounds in the auditory periphery. The present study addressed this question by replacing speech with randomized, unpredictable sequences of brief tonal stimuli in a dichotic listening task that necessitated a sustained anticipatory focus of attention. Participants (8 female, 23 male) were presented with sequences of brief tone bursts in one ear and frequency-modulated "chirps" in the other ear and were instructed to focus on sounds in one ear and report attenuated deviant stimuli in that ear. Posterior auricular muscle (PAM) activity was recorded behind both ears, and non-rectified stimulus-locked responses were assessed to ensure the reliability of PAM activity. Recordings of non-stimulus-locked rectified activity indicated that ipsilateral tonic PAM amplitudes were elevated when same-side sounds were attended, and follow-up analyses demonstrated that these modulations were independent of sound-evoked PAM reflexes. These findings provide evidence that this ipsilateral tonic increase in PAM activity is generally present in scenarios of lateralized selective listening and not reliant on predictive linguistic cues that may facilitate tracking of the attended stream. Due to its accessibility and capability of decoding the spatial focus of attention, this PAM modulation could support the development of intelligent hearing devices that maximize sensitivity toward a user&rsquo;s listening goals.</p>

                This paper presents a synthetic dataset to study the performance of perovskite solar cells (PSC) simulations using the simulation tool SCAPS-1D. The dataset consists of 18.570 simulated devices generated from four baseline device architectures and their respective photovoltaic performance values. The data set was generated through numerical simulations, and the evaluation of the electrical performance of the device was carried out by studying current density-voltage (J-V) curves under standard illumination conditions, temperature, and maximum applied voltage as working conditions, which were not modified. The dataset can be used to train different machine learning (ML) models using supervised methods or unsupervised techniques such as clustering or dimensionality reduction, which facilitate the identification of patterns or relationships between parameters. Thus, it can be useful in reverse design strategies to determine optimal configurations based on defined objectives. This work contributes to the development of PSC by providing a broad dataset for further analysis and optimization.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-1157/v1?src=rss">Stage 1 Registered Report:  Rationale, design and study protocol for a prospective, exploratory study Predicting Response to image-Guided Cryoneurolysis of the Greater Occipital Nerve (CryoGON) in Chronic Migraine Using a Conventional Greater Occipital Ne</a></h4>

              
                Background Chronic migraine is frequently refractory to available preventive therapies. Image-guided cryoneurolysis of the greater occipital nerve (CryoGON) may provide longer-lasting relief than conventional greater occipital nerve (GON) blocks. This Stage 1 Registered Report describes a prospective, exploratory study evaluating whether response to a conventional GON block predicts subsequent response to CryoGON, and assesses open-label safety, tolerability, feasibility and efficacy of CryoGON. Methods The study is planned as a single-site, investigator-initiated, open-label clinical investigation. Adults with chronic migraine will complete a ≥28-day electronic baseline diary before receiving bilateral conventional GON blocks, followed by a ≥28-day observation. Eligible participants then undergo navigation-guided CryoGON with 12-week follow-up. The primary endpoint is the association between change in moderate-to-severe headache days after GON block (weeks 1–4) and after CryoGON (weeks 9–12). Key secondary endpoints estimate the diagnostic performance of GON-block response applying a ≥30% reduction threshold for treatment effect to identify CryoGON responders, including sensitivity, specificity and predictive values. Additional endpoints include change in migraine days, patient-reported global impression of change, Migraine-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire v2.1, procedure tolerability, technical success, and safety (treatment-emergent adverse events and adverse device effects). Women of childbearing potential, including pregnant and breastfeeding participants, are eligible for participation. Discussion This study will provide the first systematic evaluation of whether a simple, widely available GON block can guide patient selection for CryoGON and will generate foundational open-label data on its clinical performance and safety. Findings will inform the design and justification of a subsequent sham-controlled trial. Trial registration and approvals The study will preregister at ClinicalTrials.gov. and obtain all necessary ethical approvals before study initiation.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-760/v2?src=rss">A bibliometric review of research on resilience, motivation and prisoners, 1912-2024 [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background Research on resilience and motivation among incarcerated individuals has gained increasing academic interest due to its relevance in rehabilitation, reducing recidivism, and promoting societal reintegration. Prisoners often face psychological distress, social isolation, and behavioral challenges, making resilience and motivation essential for enduring incarceration and engaging in rehabilitative efforts. However, a comprehensive bibliometric analysis that maps the evolution, influence, and thematic development of this research area remains limited. Methods This study aims to examine publication trends, key contributors, major thematic domains, and intellectual structures in resilience and motivation research related to prisoners from 1912 to 2024. Using Scopus-indexed literature, a bibliometric analysis was conducted employing co-authorship networks, keyword co-occurrence, and citation analysis to assess research output, collaboration patterns, and thematic progression. Results Findings reveal a significant surge in research since the early 2000s, with the United States, United Kingdom, and Germany leading in publication volume. Keyword analysis identifies four dominant thematic clusters: psychological resilience and coping, addiction rehabilitation, post-incarceration reintegration strategies, and decision-making within correctional environments. Citation analysis highlights pivotal works that have shaped the field, reflecting a shift from punitive correctional models toward rehabilitative, psychological, and policy-oriented approaches. Despite advancements, gaps remain in cross-cultural perspectives, gender-specific interventions, and post-release support systems. Conclusions The findings underscore the need for global collaboration, interdisciplinary approaches, and innovative rehabilitation strategies to advance resilience and motivation research in correctional contexts. This review contributes to the development of evidence-based policies, correctional education, and rehabilitation frameworks aimed at improving prisoner well-being, reducing recidivism, and fostering successful reintegration into society.

                Background Behçet’s disease (BD) is a chronic, inflammatory disorder with unpredictable relapses. It can significantly impair quality of life (QoL) and sexual function, but data on these outcomes remain limited. This study aimed to evaluate QoL and sexual function in patients followed for BD and identify associated clinical factors. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional, monocentric study involving 35 adult patients with BD, diagnosed according to the 2013 International Criteria. Demographic, clinical, and therapeutic data were collected. Disease activity was measured using the Behçet’s Disease Current Activity Form (BDCAF). Quality of life was assessed with the SF-36 and the Behçet’s Disease Quality of Life questionnaire (BD-QoL). Sexual function was evaluated using the IIEF-5 for men and the FSFI for women. Statistical analyses included correlations, group comparisons, and assessment of associations with clinical factors. Results Participants had a mean age of 45.3, with 74.3 % male. Common manifestations included oral ulcers (97 %), articular involvement (54 %), ocular lesions (40 %), and vascular involvement (34 %). Impaired QoL was identified in 66 % of patients via SF-36 and 40 % via BD-QoL. SF-36 and BD-QoL scores were strongly inversely correlated (p < 0.001). Higher disease activity, ocular and vascular involvement, elevated inflammatory markers, and comorbidities were significantly associated with poorer QoL. Erectile dysfunction occurred in 82.6 % of men and sexual dysfunction in 71.4 % of women; vascular involvement was significantly associated with male erectile dysfunction (p = 0.024). Conclusions BD imposes a substantial negative impact on quality of life and sexual health. Disease activity, particular organ involvement, inflammation, and comorbidities are key determinants of reduced QoL. Sexual dysfunction is highly prevalent, notably among men with vascular involvement. These findings support the need for routine QoL and sexual health assessments in BD and for integrated multidisciplinary care to address these concerns.

                Purpose Research on inhibitors that hinder the progress of startups and their underlying motivators is increasingly gaining prominence in contemporary times. Encouraging and assisting start-up businesses to generate more employment has become an increasingly important issue at the global level. Methods This study aims to perform a bibliometric analysis of the scholarly literature pertaining to the drivers that motivate entrepreneurs and the inhibitors that influence their entrepreneurial activity. The gathered information was extracted from the Scopus and Web of Science (WoS) databases from 1991 to 2020 (three decades). R-studio was used for initial data analysis, citation and co-citation analysis, and bibliographic coupling with co-authoring. Findings The study found that the pace of start-up research has been increasing since 2009, with a mean citation per document of 30.24. During the analysis, we identified that the most contributing countries producing the maximum number of research articles on entrepreneurship are the USA, the Netherlands, Germany, China, and France. The Journal of Business Venturing produced the maximum number of research articles, followed by international entrepreneurship and management journal. Originality/value This study aims to enrich our understanding of the content and structure related to startups and how it is presented in the literature. In contrast to recent advancements in entrepreneurial drivers and inhibitors, the current study exhibits a higher level of comprehensiveness regarding the methodologies and utilized databases. The findings of this study make a valuable contribution to the existing body of literature on the factors that drive and hinder entrepreneurship.

                Background As lung cancer treatment has progressed, there has been an increase in awareness of the short- and long-term adverse effects of targeted cancer therapies of tyrosine kinase inhibitors, particularly cardiovascular toxicities. Methods The current study assessed the potential drug-drug interactions using interaction checkers (IBM Micromedex and Drugs.com). Molecular docking was employed to further investigate the involvement of human ether-à-go-go-related gene (hERG) and pregnane X receptor (PXR) proteins to elucidate their potential interactions and their underlying mechanisms. Results A total of 74 pharmacokinetic and 105 pharmacodynamic interactions were detected between tyrosine kinase inhibitors and cardiovascular drugs, along with a report on the severity and level of documentation. A considerable fraction of molecular modelling outcomes concurred with information from drug-drug interaction checkers. The binding energies of tyrosine kinase inhibitors with hERG and PXR were high, indicating significant interactions. The cardiovascular drug class encompasses calcium channel blockers, antiarrhythmic medicines, and statins, which were observed to exhibit synergistic interactions. The identification of these potential drug-drug interactions involving CYP3A4, P-gp, and hERG proteins can be utilized in therapy optimization in clinical settings. Conclusion This study will aid clinicians in designing safe dosage regimens for patients with lung cancer. In cases where patients have multiple comorbidities, it is essential to study the clinical aspects to design efficient chemotherapy and manage adverse effects and toxicities.

                <p>by David P. Shorten, Viola Priesemann, Michael Wibral, Joseph T. Lizier</p>

When analysing high-dimensional time-series datasets, the inference of effective networks has proven to be a valuable modelling technique. This technique produces networks where each target node is associated with a set of source nodes that are capable of providing explanatory power for its dynamics. Multivariate Transfer Entropy (TE) has proven to be a popular and effective tool for inferring these networks. Recently, a continuous-time estimator of TE for event-based data such as spike trains has been developed which, in more efficiently representing event data in terms of inter-event intervals, is significantly more capable of measuring multivariate interactions. The new estimator thus presents an opportunity to more effectively use TE for the inference of effective networks from spike trains, and we demonstrate in this paper for the first time its efficacy at this task. Using data generated from models of spiking neurons—for which the ground-truth connectivity is known—we demonstrate the accuracy of this approach in various dynamical regimes. We further show that it exhibits far superior inference performance to a pairwise TE-based approach as well as a recently-proposed convolutional neural network approach. Moreover, comparison with Generalised Linear Models (GLMs), which are commonly applied to spike-train data, showed clear benefits, particularly in cases of high synchrony. Finally, we demonstrate its utility in revealing the patterns by which effective connections develop from recordings of developing neural cell cultures.

                <p>by Ying Joey Zhou, Mats W. J. van Es, Saskia Haegens</p>

Why do we sometimes perceive a faint stimulus but miss it at other times? One explanation is that fluctuations in the brain’s internal state result in variability in perception. Ongoing neural oscillations in the alpha band (8–13 Hz), crucial in setting the internal state of the brain, have been shown as a key contributor to such perceptual variability. However, findings on how alpha oscillations modulate perceptual variability have been mixed. Some studies suggested alpha modulates perceptual criterion (<i>c</i>), shifting the threshold for interpreting sensory information; while others suggested alpha modulates sensitivity (<i>d′</i>), changing the precision of sensory encoding. Moreover, most studies have focused solely on overall alpha activity—whether within a region of interest or across the whole brain—and overlooked the coexistence of multiple distinct alpha networks, leaving it unclear whether different alpha networks contribute differently to perception. Here, to characterize how different alpha networks influence perceptual decision-making, we analyzed magnetoencephalography (MEG) data recorded while human participants performed a visual detection task with threshold-level stimuli. We found that while the visual alpha network modulates sensitivity, the sensorimotor alpha network modulates criterion in perceptual decision-making. These findings reconcile previous conflicting results and highlight the functional diversity of alpha networks in shaping perception.

                <p>by Wakiko Iwata, Nora Haggerty, Hiromi Sesaki, Miho Iijima</p>

Mitochondrial division and fusion are critical regulators of cancer cell metabolism, proliferation, survival, metastasis, and drug resistance. Division promotes tumor development by reprogramming energy metabolism, whereas its inhibition can suppress tumor growth and metastasis. The mechanochemical GTPase DRP1, a key mediator of mitochondrial division, has emerged as a promising therapeutic target. Mitochondrial cristae also contribute to cancer progression by modulating metabolic reprogramming and oncogenic signaling. Targeting these processes may stimulate anti-tumor innate immune responses through the release of mitochondrial DNA into the cytoplasm. A deeper understanding of tumor-specific mitochondrial membrane structures and dynamics could therefore reveal novel intervention strategies and guide precision cancer therapies.

                <p>by Manasvi Balachandran, Rohini Chatterjee, Ishaan Chaudhary, Chinmaya Jena, Nishad Matange</p>

Pathways of intrinsic resistance in bacteria are promising targets for novel antibiotics and resistance breakers. Here, we used a genome-wide screen to identify single gene knockouts of <i>Escherichia coli</i> that were hypersusceptible to trimethoprim and chloramphenicol, two chemically diverse broad-spectrum antibiotics. Among the hits from our screen, knockouts of <i>acrB</i>, an efflux pump, and <i>rfaG</i> or <i>lpxM</i>, both involved in cell envelope biogenesis, were hypersensitive to multiple antimicrobials and could sensitize genetically resistant <i>E. coli</i> strains to antibiotics. Using experimental evolution under trimethoprim pressure, we show that high drug selection regimes drove these knockouts to extinction more frequently than wild type. Among them, Δ<i>acrB</i> was most compromised in its ability to evolve resistance, establishing it as a promising target for “resistance proofing.” At a sub-inhibitory trimethoprim concentration, however, all three knockouts adapted to the antibiotic and consequently recovered from hypersensitivity, albeit to different extents. This recovery was driven by mutations in drug-specific resistance pathways, rather than compensatory evolution, frequently involving upregulation of the drug target. Notably, resistance-conferring mutations could by-pass defects in cell wall biosynthesis more effectively than efflux even though resistant mutations did not directly engage either pathway. Since inhibiting drug-efflux emerged as a better strategy, we tested the ability of chlorpromazine, an efflux pump inhibitor (EPI), to resistance proof <i>E. coli</i> against trimethoprim. While qualitatively similar in the short term, genetic and pharmacological inhibition differed dramatically on an evolutionary time scale due to evolution of resistance to the EPI. Further, adaptation to the EPI-antibiotic pair also led to multidrug adaptation. The lack of concordance between genetic and pharmacological inhibition revealed a crucial lacuna in our understanding of the mutational repertoires that facilitate adaptation to antibiotics in bacteria. We propose that while intrinsic resistance mechanisms are effective targets for antibiotic sensitization, rapid evolutionary recovery may significantly limit their utility.

                Sabnis et al. explain why non-conjugative plasmids move at a low rate in nature. While increased mobility can easily evolve by incorporating phage DNA into plasmids, this is disadvantageous because it reduces diversity in populations. This ultimately leaves bacterial populations more vulnerable to being killed, for example by antibiotics.

BRD3 initiates DSB-induced chromatin remodeling by CHD4 and TIP60 on actively transcribed loci to promote R-loop-mediated HR. Thus, BRD3 deficiency reduces HR and increases the potential mutagenic NHEJ pathway and is linked to HRD cancer.

                Cohen et al. show that glucocorticoid receptor-dependent Cxcr4 expression by skin Tregs is partially required for accumulation to Cxcl12-expressing isthmic/infundibular regions of the hair follicle. The Cxcr4/Cxcl12 axis is required for optimal hair growth in mice and is an evolutionally conserved chemotactic pathway in human skin.

It shows that shallow-water species that have mutually beneficial relationships with microalgae have been more vulnerable and less resilient than their deep-water counterparts across past adverse environmental events.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/105815">Longitudinal assessment of DREADD expression and efficacy in the monkey brain</a></h4>

              
                Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADDs) offer a powerful means for reversible control of neuronal activity through systemic administration of inert actuators. Because chemogenetic control relies on DREADD expression levels, understanding and quantifying the temporal dynamics of their expression is crucial for planning long-term experiments in monkeys. In this study, we longitudinally quantified in vivo DREADD expression in macaque monkeys using positron emission tomography with the DREADD-selective tracer [<sup>11</sup>C]deschloroclozapine (DCZ), complemented by functional studies. Twenty macaque monkeys were evaluated after being injected with adeno-associated virus vectors expressing the DREADDs hM4Di or hM3Dq, whose expression was quantified as changes in [<sup>11</sup>C]DCZ binding potential from baseline levels. Expression levels of both hM4Di and hM3Dq peaked around 60 days post-injection, remained stable for about 1.5 years, and declined gradually after 2 years. Significant chemogenetic control of neural activity and behavior persisted for about 2 years. The presence of protein tags significantly influenced expression levels, with co-expressed protein tags reducing overall expression levels. These findings provide valuable insights and guidelines for optimizing the use of DREADDs in long-term primate studies and potential therapeutic applications.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/102784">Chromatin activity of IκBα mediates the exit from naïve pluripotency</a></h4>

              
                Maintenance of pluripotency is a multifactorial process in which NF-κB is a negative regulator. Our previous work identified a chromatin role for IκBα, the master regulator of NF-κB signaling, that is critical for the proper regulation of various tissue stem cells. Here, we found that IκBα accumulates specifically in the chromatin fraction of mouse pluripotent stem cells. IκBα depletion does not affect NF-kB-dependent transcription, but causes a profound epigenetic rewiring in pluripotent stem cells, including alterations in H3K27me3, a histone mark catalyzed by Polycomb repression complex 2. Chromatin changes induced by IκBα depletion affect a subset of pluripotency genes and are associated with altered gene transcription. At the cellular level, IκBα-deficient embryonic stem cells are arrested in a naive pluripotency state when cultured in serum/LIF conditions and fail to exit pluripotency under differentiation conditions. By constructing separation-of-function mutants, we show that the effects of IκBα in regulating stem cell pluripotency are NF-κB-independent, but mainly rely on its chromatin-related function. Taken together, our results reveal a novel mechanism by which IκBα participates in the regulation of the pluripotent state of mouse embryonic stem cells and shed light on the interplay between inflammatory signals and the regulation of pluripotency.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/104082">Blood pressure variability compromises vascular function in middle-aged mice</a></h4>

              
                Blood pressure variability (BPV) has emerged as a significant risk factor for cognitive decline and dementia, independent of alterations in average blood pressure (BP). However, the impact of large BP fluctuations on neurovascular function remains poorly understood. In this study, we developed a novel murine model of BPV in middle-aged mice using intermittent angiotensin II infusions. Radio telemetry confirmed that 24 hr BP averages in BPV mice remained comparable to controls, demonstrating BPV in the absence of hypertension. Chronic (20–25 days) BPV resulted in a blunted bradycardic response and cognitive deficits. Two-photon imaging revealed heightened pressure-evoked constrictions (myogenic response) in parenchymal arterioles of BPV mice. While sensory stimulus-evoked dilations (neurovascular coupling) were amplified at higher BP levels in control mice, this pressure-dependent effect was abolished in BPV mice. Our findings indicate that chronic BP fluctuations impair vascular function within the neurovascular complex and contribute to cognitive decline, emphasizing BPV as a critical factor in brain health.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101929">IFIT1 is rapidly evolving and exhibits disparate antiviral activities across 11 mammalian orders</a></h4>

              
                Mammalian mRNAs possess an N7-methylguanosine (m7G) cap and 2'O methylation of the initiating nucleotide at their 5' end, whereas certain viral RNAs lack these characteristic features. The human antiviral restriction factor IFIT1 recognizes and binds to specific viral RNAs that lack the 5' features of host mRNAs, resulting in targeted suppression of viral RNA translation. This interaction imposes significant host-driven evolutionary pressures on viruses, and many viruses have evolved mechanisms to evade the antiviral action of human IFIT1. However, little is known about the virus-driven pressures that may have shaped the antiviral activity of IFIT1 genes across mammals. Here, we take an evolution-guided approach to show that the IFIT1 gene is rapidly evolving in multiple mammalian clades, with positive selection acting upon several residues in distinct regions of the protein. In functional assays with 39 IFIT1s spanning diverse mammals, we demonstrate that IFIT1 exhibits a range of antiviral phenotypes, with many orthologs lacking antiviral activity against viruses that are strongly suppressed by other IFIT1s. We further show that IFIT1s from human and a bat, the black flying fox, inhibit Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) and strongly bind to Cap0 RNAs. Unexpectedly, chimpanzee IFIT1, which differs from human IFIT1 by only eight amino acids, does not inhibit VEEV infection and exhibits minimal Cap0 RNA-binding. In mutagenesis studies, we determine that amino acids 364 and 366, the latter of which is rapidly evolving, are sufficient to confer the differential anti-VEEV activity between human and chimpanzee IFIT1. These data suggest that virus-host genetic conflicts have influenced the antiviral specificity of IFIT1 across diverse mammalian orders.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99383">Sequential temporal anticipation characterized by neural power modulation and in recurrent neural networks</a></h4>

              
                Relevant prospective moments arise intermittently, while most of the time is filled with irrelevant events, or noise, that constantly bombard our sensory systems. Thus, anticipating a few key moments necessitates disregarding what lies between the present and the future – the noise. Here, through examining how the brain and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) anticipate a sequence of prospective moments without relying on any external timing cues, we provided a reinterpretation of temporal anticipation. We first designed a ‘premembering’ task, where we marked three temporal locations in white noise and asked human listeners to detect a tone at one of these points. Using power modulation analyses, we investigated the memory-guided anticipatory processes in trials involving only flat noise. Our research revealed a unique neural-power modulation pattern for sequential temporal anticipation: neural power within the alpha-beta band range fluctuates over time, accurately identifying the marked locations on a sub-second scale and correlating with tone detection performance. To understand the functional roles of these neural modulations, we utilized RNNs optimized for the behavioral task. The hidden dynamics of the RNNs mirrored the neural modulations, and additional analyses and perturbations on the RNNs indicated that the neural power modulations in the alpha-beta band resulted from selective suppression of irrelevant noise periods and heightened sensitivity to anticipated temporal locations. Our behavioral, neural, and modeling findings collectively indicate that sequential temporal anticipation involves a process of dynamic gain control: anticipating a few significant moments involves actively disregarding irrelevant events that frequently occur.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/107419">Stabilisation of HIF signalling in the mouse epicardium extends embryonic potential and neonatal heart regeneration</a></h4>

              
                In humans, new-born infants can regenerate their heart during early life. This is modelled in the mouse, where regenerative capacity is maintained for the first week after birth but lost thereafter. Reactivation of this process holds great therapeutic potential; however, the molecular pathways that might be targeted to extend neonatal regeneration remain elusive. Here, we explored a role for hypoxia and HIF signalling on the regulation of epicardial activity in the developing mouse heart and in modulating the response to injury. Hypoxic regions were found in the epicardium from mid-gestation, associating with HIF-1α and HIF-2α, and expression of the epicardial master regulator Wilms’ tumour 1 (WT1). Epicardial deletion of <i>Hif1α</i> reduced WT1 levels, leading to impaired coronary vasculature. Targeting of the HIF degradation enzyme PHD, through pharmacological inhibition with a clinically approved drug or epicardial-specific genetic deletion of <i>Egln1</i>, stabilised HIF and promoted WT1 activity ex vivo. Finally, a combination of genetic and pharmacological stabilisation of HIF during neonatal heart injury led to prolonged epicardial activation, preservation of myocardium, augmented infarct resolution and preserved function beyond the 7-day regenerative window. These findings suggest modulation of HIF signalling extends epicardial activation to maintain myocardial survival beyond the neonatal regenerative window and may represent a viable strategy for treating ischaemic heart disease.

">Dorsal Raphe Nucleus Enkephalin Peptide Modulates Behavioral Preference</a></h4>

              
                The endogenous opioid system is a powerful modulator of motivation and affect. The dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) in the midbrain has been established as an important site of opioid action and is an integral hub in behavioral modulation. To investigate the functional significance of DRN opioid signaling in aversive and appetitive behaviors we disrupted preproenkephalin (Penk) in DRN using CRISPR-Cas9 technology in Penk-Cre mice. We found that CRISPR mediated knockdown of enkephalin peptide in the DRN (DRNPenk) enhanced inflammation-induced mechanical sensitivity and odor avoidance. Additionally, loss of DRNPenk diminished sucrose preference and engagement with a novel social stimulus. To further characterize the opioid system within the DRN, we performed Hiplex in situ hybridization of 12 genes in the same tissue. This revealed that DRNPenk is largely separate from DRN serotonin cells and is instead distributed on glutamatergic and GABAergic cells. However, subtype-specific knockdown of DRNPenk from glutamatergic and GABAergic cells did not replicate the behavioral effects of general DRNPenk knockdown. This suggests that these neurons represent a novel population that mediate motivated behaviors distinctly from canonical DRN mechanisms.

">Visceral signaling of post-ingestive malaise directs memory updating in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Consolidation is a time when labile memories transition to a stable form. Malaise learning in Drosophila reveals consolidation to also permit memory updating. Flies taught to associate one of two odors with toxin-tainted sugar initially express conditioned odor approach, that following consolidation switches to avoidance. Behavioral reversal emerges from dopaminergic update of parallel memories for the two trained odors. Differential serotoninergic modulation of specific aversive and rewarding dopaminergic neuron subtypes permits post-ingestive intoxication to suppress consolidation of initial odor-sugar memory and simultaneously invert reward memory plasticity into "safety" memory for the odor experienced without food. Fat body release of the Toll-ligand activating protease modSP, and resilience factor Turandot A, instruct malaise updates by triggering autocrine Toll signaling in the same brain dopaminergic neurons that form and consolidate initial sugar memory. This neural mechanism overcomes the credit assignment problem of delayed post-ingestive reinforcement by updating earlier memories of the trained odors.

">Networks of sexually dimorphic neurons that regulate social behaviors in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Neural mechanisms underlying sexually dimorphic social behaviors remain enigmatic in most species. In Drosophila, sexually dimorphic P1/pC1x neurons have been described as a site of sensory integration that regulates mating and aggressive behaviors. We show that the male P1/pC1x population forms a highly intertwined network with male-specific mAL and aSP-a neurons that is poised to regulate male behavior. The 48 P1/pC1x cell types exhibit heterogeneous synaptic connections with a subset receiving strong input from identified sensory pathways. We also describe circuit motifs by which P1 and sexually dimorphic aIPg neurons co-regulate social behaviors. Genetic driver lines for these cell types were generated and used to discover distinct roles for P1/pC1x cell types in promoting social acoustic signaling and male-male interactions. Our results reveal unexpected diversity in the connectivity and behavioral roles of the P1/pC1x cell types and provide essential genetic tools for interrogating their neurophysiological and behavioral functions.

">{triangleup}FOSB in the nucleus accumbens core is required for increased anxiety, but not decreased social motivation, following estrogen withdrawal in female mice</a></h4>

              
                During pregnancy, estrogen levels rise dramatically, but quickly drop to prepartum levels following birth, and remain suppressed until ovulation resumes. This postpartum estrogen withdrawal state has been linked to changes in the brain and behavior in humans and rodents. Previous research has demonstrated that following a hormone-simulated pseudopregnancy (HSP), an experimental model of postpartum estrogen withdrawal, female mice show increased anxiety-like behaviors and decreased social motivation. Further, these behavioral changes occur concurrently with an increase in {Delta}FOSB, a transcription factor associated with stable long-term plasticity, in the nucleus accumbens core. To test whether this increase in {Delta}FOSB is required for these behavioral changes, we used a viral-mediated gene transfer approach to prevent {Delta}FOSB-mediated transcription in the NAcC during HSP and found that it reduced the high-anxiety behavioral phenotype in estrogen-withdrawn females. However, preventing {Delta}FOSB-mediated transcription had little effect on social motivation. Together, these results suggest that postpartum estrogen withdrawal increases {Delta}FOSB in the NAc core to impact anxiety-like behaviors, but not social motivation, following estrogen withdrawal.

">A splice-switching antisense oligonucleotide approach for pediatric genetic epilepsies</a></h4>

              
                Variants in ion channel genes are common causes of pediatric epilepsy, often leading to intractable seizures, developmental delay and other comorbidities, which increases risk of death. Pathogenic variants in the SCN8A gene, which encodes a voltage-gated sodium channel critical for action potential generation in the brain, account for ~1% of genetic epilepsies. The voltage sensor in SCN8A domain 1 is encoded by one of two developmentally-regulated mutually exclusive alternative exons, 5N and 5A. We observe that variants in these exons are more likely to cause infantile spasms, a severe seizure type, than variants elsewhere in SCN8A, and that some pathogenic variants affect exon 5 splicing, impacting patient phenotype. Molecular and evolutionary analyses implicate the exon sequences of these and other voltage-gated ion channel alternative exons in splicing regulation. We identified antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) that shift splicing of SCN8A exon 5N to 5A or vice versa. These ASOs normalize neuronal activity in patient-derived iPSC neurons, and reduce seizures and motor impairment and extend lifespan in a new exon 5N mutant mouse model. Our results demonstrate that splice-switching ASOs can effectively reduce the expression of pathogenic isoforms and rescue both seizure and non-seizure phenotypes. Similar approaches should be applicable to pediatric genetic epilepsies caused by mutations in other ion channel alternative exons.

">Imbalanced Brain Connectome: A Novel Link between Functional Somatic Disorders, Multiple Chemical Sensitivity, and Post-COVID patients</a></h4>

              
                This study aimed to investigate and assess shared patterns of structural brain connectivity across three clinical populations. Despite significant advancements in neuroimaging, structural connectivity alterations have been underexplored in functional somatic disorders (FSDs), multiple chemical sensitivity (MCS), and post-COVID-19 conditions (PC). Clinical observations suggest that olfactory symptoms may represent a missing link between these three patient groups. Using diffusion-weighted MRI and voxel-based probabilistic tractography, structural connectivity was analysed in 57 females (MCS: 16, FSD: 15, PC: 11, and 15 matched healthy controls). Independent-sample t-tests (with FDR correction) and permutation testing were applied to assess group-level differences, particularly in inter- and intra-hemispheric connectivity. A marked decrease in inter-hemispheric connectivity was observed in patients (70.9%) compared with controls (29.1%; p < 0.001). The finding was consistent across all diagnostic groups. These alterations remained stable following reanalysis and aggregation, reliably distinguishing patients from controls. No significant differences were found in intra-hemispheric connectivity across the patient groups. Additionally, out of 12 predefined interregional connections, ten showed significant alterations in at least one patient group. The findings reveal robust and consistent reduced inter-hemispheric connectivity in patients with MCS, FSD, and PC, highlighting a potentially shared neurobiological signature among the patient groups.

                The complexity of the mammalian brain's vast population of interconnected neurons poses a formidable challenge to elucidate its underlying mechanisms of coordination and computation. A key step forward will be technologies that can perform large-scale, cellular-resolution monitoring and interrogation of distributed brain circuit activity in behaving animals. Here, we present an all-optical strategy for precise optogenetic activity control of [~]10^3 neurons and simultaneous activity monitoring of [~]10^4 neurons within and across areas of mouse cortex--an order-of-magnitude leap beyond previous capabilities. Tracking population responses following delivery of precisely-defined widely-distributed activity patterns to the visual cortex of awake mice, we were surprised to identify neurons robustly responsive to stimulation of diverse ensembles, defying conventional like-to-like wiring rules. These cells were primarily deep L2/3 somatostatin-positive (SST) interneurons with functional properties distinct from other SST neurons, and appeared to play a role in brain dynamics that could only have been identified through broad cellular-resolution circuit interrogation. Our work reveals the value of measuring large-scale circuit-dynamical properties of functionally-resolved single cells, beyond genetic and anatomical classification, to define and explore the roles of cell types in brain function.

">Canonical Hidden Markov Model Networks for Studying M/EEG</a></h4>

              
                Dynamic brain networks identified in magneto/encephalography (M/EEG) recordings provide new insights into human brain activity. One established method uses Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and has been shown to infer reproducible, fast-switching brain networks in a variety of cognitive and disease conditions. Often these studies are done on small bespoke (boutique) datasets (N<100) and analysed in isolation of other M/EEG datasets. Instead of training a new model for each boutique study, which is computationally expensive, we propose the use of a canonical HMM. This provides a common reference through which different studies can be described using the same set of networks. We provide HMMs for a range of model orders (4-16 states) in parcellated source space and sensor space. These HMMs were trained on 1849 MEG recordings (N=621, 18-88 years old, 194 hours), capturing population variability in both rest and task data. We illustrate applications of this canonical HMM approach in parcellated source space using boutique MEG and EEG datasets. Applying the canonical HMM in parcel space requires the boutique dataset to be preprocessed and source reconstructed in the same way as the canonical HMM training data. Apply the canonical HMM in the sensor space requires the same sensor layout and preprocessing as the canonical HMM training data. The canonical HMMs have been made publicly available as an open-access resource, providing sets of canonical brain networks that can be used to compare individuals within and across a range of datasets.

">Environmental Novelty Modulates Rapid Cortical Plasticity During Navigation</a></h4>

              
                In novel environments, animals quickly learn to navigate, and position-correlated spatial representations rapidly emerge in both the retrosplenial cortex (RSC) and primary visual cortex (V1). However, the role of plasticity in building these spatial representations, and how experience modulates this process, are not well understood. Here, we investigated the plasticity of spatial representations with real-time, cellular-resolution read and write control of neural activity using two-photon calcium imaging combined with holographic optogenetic stimulation in mice navigating virtual reality environments. Targeted stimulation of individual layer 2/3 neurons rapidly biased neural activity towards stimulation-paired locations in novel, but not familiar, environments. In contrast, RSC layer 5 neurons exhibited stimulation-induced plasticity regardless of environmental familiarity. These findings reveal a layer-specific, experience-dependent modulation of plasticity and offer a framework for how neocortical spatial representations strike a balance between stability of familiar environments with flexibility for continuous updates of relevant context information.

">Monovision-induced motion illusions in presbyopic and non-presbyopic populations</a></h4>

              
                Monovision is a common correction for presbyopia that focuses one eye at far distances and the other at near distances, resulting in an interocular difference in blur between the eyes. Because blur increases the speed of visual processing by a few milliseconds, these optical conditions can induce dramatic misperceptions of the distances and 3D directions of moving objects. To date, however, the illusion has been demonstrated in only non-presbyopic individuals. We analyze the prevalence of both the processing speed differences and the visibility of the resulting illusions in the presbyopic and general populations.17 presbyopes (54.4 +/- 5.9years) and 36 non-presbyopes (22.2 +/- 5.0years) participated. The proportions of these participant populations approximately match their proportions in the general population. Two strips of horizontally moving bars were presented on an autostereoscopic display with interocular blur and light-level differences. The task was to report which strip appeared closer in depth. Blur- and light-level differences caused illusions that are respectively known as the reverse and classic Pulfrich effects. Interocular delay and an illusion visibility index - the ratio of interocular delay and the detection threshold-were obtained from each participant for both blur and light-level differences between the eyes. Blur- and light-level differences cause highly significant changes in processing speed at the individual and group levels. (The two populations were statistically indistinguishable in their susceptibility to stimulus-induced processing speed differences.) The reverse and classic Pulfrich effects occurred in 94% and in 96%, respectively, of the general participant population. The visibility index showed that the processing speed discrepancy exceeded the detection threshold in a smaller number of participants - 30% and 43%, respectively. Interocular differences in optical blur reliably cause interocular differences in processing speed across presbyopic and non-presbyopic populations, although they create visible (suprathreshold) illusions in only a subset of participants. However, this subset included individuals with processing delays that were many times larger than the detection threshold. These latter participants are likely to be afflicted by large, highly visible illusions in real-world conditions. Methods for reducing or eliminating these illusions are discussed.

">Generative inference unifies feedback processing for learning and perception in natural and artificial vision</a></h4>

              
                We understand how neurons respond selectively to patterns in visual input to support object recognition; however, how these circuits support perceptual grouping, illusory percepts, and imagination is not understood. These perceptual experiences are thought to require combining what we have learned about the world with incoming sensory signals, yet the neural mechanism for this integration remains unclear. Here we show that networks tuned for object recognition implicitly learn the distribution of their input, which can be accessed through feedback connections that tune synaptic weights. We introduce Generative Inference, a computational framework in which feedback pathways that adjust connection weights during learning are repurposed during perception to combine learned knowledge with sensory input, fulfilling flexible inference goals such as increasing confidence. Generative Inference enables networks tuned solely for recognition to spontaneously produce perceptual grouping, illusory contours, shape completion, and pattern formation resembling imagination, while preserving their recognition abilities. The framework reproduces neural signatures observed across perceptual experiments: delayed responses in feedback-receiving layers of early visual cortex that disappear when feedback connections are disrupted. We show that, under stated assumptions, gradients of classification error approximate directions that are informative about the data distribution, establishing a theoretical connection between recognition and generation. Together, these findings show that pattern recognition and pattern generation rely on a shared computational substrate through dual use of feedback pathways. This principle explains how neural systems recognize familiar objects reliably while remaining flexible enough to interpret incomplete or ambiguous information, and suggests that reusing learning signals for perception may be a general feature of both biological brains and artificial networks.

">Insights from multidimensional analyses of post-stroke fatigue</a></h4>

              
                Post-stroke fatigue (PSF) is an overlooked and debilitating condition. As a multidimensional construct, fatigue encompasses physical, cognitive, and emotional components, complicating efforts to understand PSF pathophysiological mechanisms and identify key predictors. We aimed to investigate the impact of lesion characteristics on the different facets of PSF while accounting for socio-demographic, psychological, and neurological factors. 231 first-ever ischemic stroke patients from a prospective hospital-based cohort were assessed using the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI) and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HAD) alongside routine clinical evaluations. Lesion analysis was done through two approaches: a voxel-based method using support vector regression-based multivariate lesion-symptom mapping (SVR-LSM), and a network-based method using principal component analysis (PCA) of lesioned gray and white matter regions. The overall prevalence of PSF was 20.8%. PSF was more frequent among women and younger patients and strongly associated with HAD scores. SVR-LSM identified an association between lesions in the right corona radiata and external capsule and total MFI scores but none with HAD scores. The network-based approach showed associations between mental fatigue and reduced activity subdimensions and brain components involving cerebro-cerebellar tracts. Our findings suggest that PSF arises from an interplay of socio-demographic, emotional, and cerebral risk factors, accounting for its heterogeneous presentation. Regarding the associations with the lesioned regions, the involvement of motor pathways raises the possibility that neuronal overactivity, compensating for disrupted networks, may contribute to long-term fatigue. Further whole-brain analyses are warranted to confirm and extend these observations.

">Sleep deprivation constrains dynamic configurations of integrated and segregated brain states impacting cognitive performance</a></h4>

              
                The breakdown of cognitive control following sleep deprivation is widely recognised, but the physiological mechanisms and brain signatures that produce this vulnerability have not been resolved. Effective cognition relies on large-scale brain networks flexibly reconfiguring between states of integration and segregation. Here we combined functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), electroencephalography (EEG), and electrocardiography (ECG) collected during cognitive tasks under rested wakefulness, after sleep deprivation, and following a recovery nap to test the hypothesis that sleep deprivation constrains this dynamical repertoire and disrupts its physiological regulation. Using time-resolved functional connectivity and graph theory, we show that sleep deprivation increases the distribution of connections across networks, while reducing the temporal variability of between-network connectivity. Furthermore, dynamic fluctuations between integrated and segregated modes of network topology were dampened, with brain regions spending more time in intermediate configurations and showing greater instability of mode transitions. These alterations were tightly linked to behavioural impairment: participants who exhibited greater contraction toward intermediate topologies also showed poorer task accuracy and slower responses. Under well-rested conditions, thalamic activity peaked prior to transitions into integrated states and was suppressed during transitions into segregated states, consistent with a coordinating role in cortical dynamics. Sleep deprivation weakened and delayed this thalamic coupling. Finally, global and regional fMRI fluctuations were elevated after sleep loss, becoming decoupled from cardiac physiology while more strongly coupled to EEG delta power, further linking reduced arousal to constrained network flexibility. Together, these findings show that sleep deprivation narrows the brain's dynamical repertoire, due to disrupted thalamic regulation and changes to the physiological integration with cortical networks.

">Hebbian learning accounts for the effects of experience and novel exposure on representational drift in CA1 of hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                Neuronal activity patterns slowly change over time even when sensory stimuli and animal behavior remain stable, a phenomenon known as representational drift. In area CA1 of the hippocampus, the amount of drift in the tuning of place cells on a familiar linear track is proportional to the time the animal spends exploring that track while the drift in cells' mean rate depends on the absolute time elapsed between sessions. Recently it was shown that exploration of a novel, enriched environment between sessions on the familiar track actually decreases the drift in tuning on that track, i.e. it stabilizes place fields compared to a baseline condition without the novel learning. This finding challenges computational models of drift in which new learning leads to overwriting and hence one would expect more drift, not less. Here we show that such models are indeed compatible with the observed findings as long as spatially-tuned input populations to CA1 which are active on the track versus the enriched environment are largely non-overlapping. Furthermore, in order to reproduce the findings, we must assume that the total amount of learning between the baseline and novel-exposure conditions is the same. Namely, the synaptic resources available for encoding patterns, or episodes, is fixed over a given period of time, but can be preferentially allocated to episodes of particular salience, such as the exploration of novel environments.

">MRI-Based Quantification of Central Nervous System Tissue and Cerebrospinal Fluid Volumes in Developing Pigs</a></h4>

              
                There is a growing need for alternative animal models to test brain-targeted therapies, and pigs are emerging as a promising option. Their utility, however, depends on reliable estimations of central nervous system (CNS) tissue and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) volumes, which are essential for translating therapeutic doses between studies in animals and humans. To address this need, we conducted a cross-sectional study of 12 commercial pigs (Sus scrofa) across four age groups (2, 5, 11, and 19 weeks). High-resolution magnetic resonance images (MRI) of the brain and spinal cord were acquired using T2-weighted turbo spin echo with fat saturation and short tau inversion recovery scans. CNS tissue and CSF volumes were segmented and quantified using 3D Slicer, along with additional anatomical measurements. Our findings reveal notable age-related changes, including spinal CSF volume surpassing brain CSF volume in older pigs, highlighting shifts in CSF distribution that may influence dosing and delivery strategies for CNS-targeted therapies. This study provides a reference for future research using pig models in CNS disease studies and underscores the importance of incorporating brain and spinal CSF and CNS volume data into preclinical models.

">Luteal-phase resistance training enhances nocturnal heat dissipation and delta power during sleep</a></h4>

              
                Study Objectives: This study examined the effects of resistance training on sleep architecture, physiological heat dissipation, and {delta} power in young adult women during the follicular and luteal phases of the menstrual cycle. Methods: Twelve healthy young women participated in a four-condition crossover protocol comprising (1) follicular phase non-exercise, (2) follicular phase exercise, (3) luteal phase non-exercise, and (4) luteal phase exercise. The exercise condition consisted of 30 minutes of resistance training at 70% of one-repetition maximum performed during the day. During each night, electroencephalography, body temperature, and core body temperature were measured in the home environment. The distal-proximal body temperature gradient (DPG), which is a validated indicator of heat dissipation, was calculated. Results: Resistance training enhanced heat dissipation, as reflected by increased DPG values, and increased the proportion of stage N3 sleep during both menstrual cycle phases, with more pronounced effects during the luteal phase. Sleep from bedtime to wake time was divided into four equal segments. Under the luteal phase with exercise, the appearance of stage N3, {delta} power, and the DPG were elevated in the mid-to-late segments of sleep. Conclusions: These findings suggest that daytime resistance training promotes nocturnal deep sleep and facilitates thermoregulatory heat loss, as indicated by an increased DPG, particularly during the luteal phase when thermoregulation is less stable than the follicular phase. This training may represent a practical intervention to improve sleep quality and physiological recovery in women across different phases of the menstrual cycle.

">A clinical grade neurostimulation implant for hierarchical control of physiological activity</a></h4>

              
                Bioelectronic implants for neurostimulation aim to steer disordered neurophysiological processes back towards a healthy state. However, physiology is subject to biological rhythms, including the circadian rhythm and the sleep-wake cycle. These predictable rhythms affect disease symptomatology, biomarkers used in closed-loop therapies, and a physiological system's expected response to stimulation. Therefore, therapeutic devices should incorporate feedforward elements to align algorithm parameters with predictable changes in physiological state, as a parallel of physiological rheostatic control. Here we introduce the DyNeuMo-2c, the first clinical-grade implant capable of delivering closed-loop neurostimulation while flexibly changing its functional configuration according to time of day. The device can chronically measure brain activity and motion state to track potential biomarker patterns in natural, out-of-clinic settings, allowing identification and targeting of patient-specific chronotypes. The system implements a hierarchical control flow, with baseline therapy set by a circadian scheduler, and adaptive policies layered to take effect based on specific biomarkers indicating patient and disease state. Using a benchtop validation setup, we demonstrate that the system has the required capabilities for delivering time-contingent closed-loop therapy in two established clinical use cases: Parkinson's disease and epilepsy. Next, we deploy the system in vivo to deliver closed-loop deep brain stimulation in a healthy non-human primate model of vigilance, highlighting the importance of synchronisation between device operation and physiological state in various conditions (task performance, unconstrained behaviour, and sleep). Time-of-day-dependent adaptation of closed-loop stimulation enabled modulation of both vigilance and behaviour. Overall, the novel device architecture provides a proof-of-concept for delivering time-contingent therapy in chronic therapeutic settings where biological rhythms are of key importance.

">DNA Break Induced Epigenetic Alterations Promote Plaque Formation and Behavioral Deficits in an Alzheimer's Disease Mouse Model</a></h4>

              
                The dramatic increase in human longevity over recent decades has contributed to a rising prevalence of age-related diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). While accumulating evidence implicates DNA damage and epigenetic alterations in the pathogenesis of AD, their precise mechanistic role remains unclear. To address this, we developed a novel mouse model, DICE (Dementia from Inducible Changes to the Epigenome), by crossing the APP/PSEN1 (APP/PS1) transgenic AD model with the ICE (Inducible Changes to the Epigenome) model, which allows for the controlled induction of double-strand DNA breaks (DSBs) to stimulate aging-related epigenetic drift. We hypothesized that DNA damage induced epigenetic alterations could influence the onset and progression of AD pathology. After experiencing DNA damage for four weeks, DICE mice, together with control, ICE, and APP/PS1 mice, were allowed to recover for six weeks before undergoing a battery of behavioral assessments including the open-field test, light/dark preference test, elevated plus maze, Y-maze, Barnes maze, social interaction, acoustic startle, and pre-pulse inhibition (PPI). Molecular and histological analyses were then performed to assess amyloid-beta pathology and neuroinflammatory markers. Our findings reveal that DNA damage-induced epigenetic changes significantly affect cognitive behavior and alters amyloid-beta plaque morphology and neuroinflammation as early as six months of age. These results provide the first direct evidence that DNA damage can modulate amyloid pathology in a genetically susceptible AD model. Future studies will be aimed at investigating DNA damage-induced epigenetic remodeling across additional models of AD and neurodegeneration to further elucidate its role in brain aging and disease progression.

">Architecture of Near-Death Experience Spaces</a></h4>

              
                Near-Death Experiences (NDEs) challenge conventional research methods, as they are often described as exceeding the limits of verbal expression. While most studies rely on narrative accounts, little attention has been given to graphic representations as a complementary mode of investigation. This study employs a hybrid approach combining a semi-structured digital questionnaire with a graphic reconstruction task. Participants first segmented their Out-of-Body Experience (OBE) and NDE into distinct experiential sequences by assigning chronological numbers to each phase. This sequencing enabled the identification and isolation of the core NDE component across participants. The graphic reconstructions represent each perceived space, Self-Location (S-L), the perceived spatial position where one experiences oneself to be located and Self-Motion (S-M), the perceived spatial trajectories and directionalities of oneself within these visuo-spatial configurations. This dual-method design was intended to capture experiential features of OBEs and NDEs that may not be conveyed through verbal reports alone. Notably, OBEs have rarely been examined regarding their independence from or conjunction with NDEs, nor their placement within the overall temporal sequence. The graphic reconstructions revealed consistent visual-field invariants: conical forms, elliptic arcs with variable Visual-Field Extents (VFE), and ellipsoidal configurations, each correlated with specific chromatic and luminance perceptual qualities of the Visual Field (VF).

">Resting-state Functional Connections with the Hippocampus and with the Caudate Nucleus Predict Working Memory Performance in Multiple Sclerosis</a></h4>

              
                Episodic memory (EM) dysfunction is a common symptom of multiple sclerosis (MS). A related process, working memory (WM), supports long-term EM and is often also impaired. Functional connectivity (FC) between the hippocampus and caudate nucleus supports EM performance. However, this connectivity's specific influences on WM performance in MS is relatively unknown. Resting-state FC (RSFC) possesses clinical utility, including predicting cognitive impairments before they are captured by assessment. The present study tested whether RSFC with the hippocampus and caudate could predict WM performance in people with MS and in healthy individuals (HC). In a secondary analysis of 78 participants (42 MS, 36 HC), RSFC between the hippocampus, caudate nucleus, and other regions was quantified. These connections' predictive influence on WM performance was then examined using a global WM performance measure for a subset with available neuropsychological data (26 MS, 15 HC). Across the entire sample (N=78), MS participants displayed stronger coupling between the right hippocampus and left dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, compared to HC participants. Within MS participants, stronger coupling between the left hippocampus (LHipp) and left ventral anterior cingulate (LvACC), and between the left caudate (LCaud) and right insula, were observed. Stronger decoupling between the LHipp and left supramarginal gyrus (LSMG) also emerged. Stronger LHipp-LvACC connectivity predicted worse WM performance, whereas stronger LHipp-LSMG connectivity and LCaud-RInsula connectivity each predicted better performance. The hippocampal connections were also inversely correlated. Findings identify a caudate circuit and potential hippocampal network whose aberrant, intrinsic activity could serve as neural markers for WM dysfunction in MS.

">Selective reduction of KCNA4 in vulnerable glutamatergic-serotonin neurons of the dorsal raphe nucleus in Alzheimers Disease</a></h4>

              
                INTRODUCTIONWe previously demonstrated that htau mice recapitulate many neuropsychiatric features of early Alzheimers disease (AD), and that the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) contains distinct subregions. Herein, we investigate vulnerability of the centromedial DRN to pathologically-phosphorylated tau (pTau), a region composed predominantly of dually serotonergic/glutamatergic (5HT/glut) neurons.

METHODSWe use computational, molecular, biophysical, and behavioral techniques to assess the centromedial DRN across preclinical and post-mortem settings.

RESULTSThe centromedial DRN contains 5HT/glut neurons that differentially express ion-channel genes in the htau mouse. 5HT/glut neurons exhibit increased excitability, which we demonstrate may dually promote pTau accumulation and the severity of depressive-like behaviors in htau mice. At Braak 2, KCNA4 is reduced in 5HT/glut neurons in AD, which are especially vulnerable to pTau compared to 5HT-nonglut neurons.

DISCUSSIONTau-mediated dysfunction of the DRN may be driven by changes in ion channel activity that concomitantly promote the spread of pTau in Braak progression.

">PGC-1α and PPARs cooperatively mediate photoreceptor neuroprotection in rd1 mouse inherited retinal degeneration</a></h4>

              
                Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is a group of inherited diseases characterized by a primary rod photoreceptor dysfunction and progressive rod and cone cell death. Due to their very high energy demand, the degeneration of photoreceptors may be linked to insufficient energy supply or metabolic imbalance. Critical transcription factors that regulate metabolism such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) and their co-activator PGC-1 have been found to play important roles in neurodegenerative diseases, but their potential roles in RP have yet not been disclosed. In this study, we used organotypic retinal explant cultures derived from the rd1 mouse model for RP to investigate the effects of PPAR, PPAR{gamma}, PPAR{beta}/{delta} agonists, as well as PGC-1 activation and inhibition. Photoreceptor death in the outer nuclear layer (ONL) of the retina was quantified using the TUNEL assay, while in situ activity assays were used to monitor effects of PPARs and PGC-1 on poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase (PARP) and calpain activity. In addition, we performed immunostainings to evaluate poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) generation and activation of calpain-1 and calpain-2. We found that PPAR{beta}/{delta} agonists had limited effects, while activation of PPAR, PPAR{gamma}, and PGC-1 significantly reduced photoreceptor death and PARP activity in rd1 retina. Conversely, inhibition of PGC-1 had a strong detrimental effect on photoreceptor viability. Activation of the histone deacetylase sirtuin-1, an upstream agonist of PGC-1, had no effect unless it was combined with simultaneous inhibition of PARP. Furthermore, PPAR{gamma} and PGC-1 effectively suppressed overall calpain activity and overactivation of calpain-2, alleviating photoreceptor degeneration caused by Ca2+ imbalance. In summary, our data supports the concept of a PARP-sirtuin-1-PGC-1-PPAR-PARP feedback control that connects defective energy metabolism to photoreceptor degeneration. Specifically, our findings suggest that PPAR, PPAR{gamma}, and PGC-1 cooperate to preserve photoreceptor viability, highlighting PPAR signaling as a promising target for future therapeutic interventions.

">Burst suppression: a default brain state associated with loss of network complexity</a></h4>

              
                Burst suppression (BS) is a highly stereotyped EEG pattern observed across a wide range of clinical contexts, from general anesthesia and postanoxic coma to neonatal encephalopathy. Despite its consistent appearance, BS comprises two distinct forms with markedly different implications. BS with identical bursts (IBS) is almost exclusively seen in patients with severe, irreversible encephalopathy and is consistently associated with poor neurological outcome. In contrast, heterogeneous BS (HBS) can appear in reversible conditions such as anesthesia. The mechanisms that give rise to these divergent forms remain elusive. Existing theories impose disease-specific processes on otherwise healthy networks, but such models fail to explain why BS emerges across diverse etiologies and disregard the clinically critical distinction between IBS and HBS. We combined clinical, experimental, and computational approaches to identify shared mechanisms underlying BS. We analyzed EEG recordings from patients with a severe postanoxic encephalopathy and from patients undergoing general anesthesia. These clinical observations were compared with activity recordings from human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neuronal networks and rodent cortical cultures, and simulations of biophysically grounded neuronal network models. Purely excitatory, low-complexity networks, both in vitro and in silico, spontaneously generated activity virtually indistinguishable from pathological IBS. Introducing inhibitory neurons, modular network structure, or diverse external inputs progressively increased signal complexity and produced HBS-like or continuous activity resembling physiological EEG. Our findings suggest that BS, and particularly IBS, reflects a default dynamic state of simplified excitatory networks that emerges when biological complexity is lost. Different clinical conditions may compromise distinct mechanisms--inhibition, connectivity, or afferent input--yet converge on the same underlying activity pattern. While IBS reflects near-complete loss of complexity, HBS indicates partial preservation. This unified framework explains how diverse etiologies converge on BS and highlights identical forms as signatures of severely reduced network complexity.

">Exploring the functions of JAKMIP1 in neuronal IL-6/STAT3 signaling and its relevance to chromosome 15q-duplication syndrome</a></h4>

              
                Growing evidence supports neuroinflammation as a risk factor for neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders. Interleukin 6 (IL-6), a classical pro-inflammatory cytokine, has been associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD)-related phenotypes. To better understand molecular factors that modify neuronal cytokine responses in ASD, we investigated potential roles for JAKMIP1, a gene linked to chromosome 15q-duplication syndrome (Dup15q; a form of syndromic ASD), in regulating IL-6/STAT3 signaling. We observe that JAKMIP1 deficiency impairs IL-6/STAT3 signaling and IL-6-induced neuritogenesis in SH-SY5Y cells; and discover that JAKMIP1 may regulate STAT3 expression via its C-terminus, which exhibits nucleoplasmic localization. Additionally, we find that IL-6/STAT3 signaling is altered in Dup15q hiPSCs-derived cortical neurons, which display heightened responsiveness to IL-6; though it is unclear whether and how JAKMIP1 contributes to this. Overall, our findings identify JAKMIP1 as a modulator of neuronal IL-6/STAT3 signaling and support that ASD-linked genetic variants can alter the inflammatory landscape of ASD.

">The serotonin 1B receptor modulates striatal activity differentially based on behavioral context</a></h4>

              
                The dorsomedial striatum (DMS) is critical for goal-directed behavior and has been implicated in both motivating and inhibiting behavioral responses. The DMS circuitry is complex as it integrates multiple inputs from the cortex, thalamus, and other subcortical structures including midbrain dopamine neurons. Though less studied, serotonin neurons from the dorsal raphe nucleus also richly innervate the DMS, which expresses the majority of the 14 receptor subtypes for serotonin. In particular, slice electrophysiology shows that the serotonin 1B receptor (5-HT1BR) impacts DMS physiology and plasticity, and behavioral experiments show that 5-HT1BR expression modulates impulsivity and other DMS-dependent reward-related behaviors. In these studies, our goal was to investigate the effects of 5-HT1BR on the DMS in vivo during goal-directed behavior in mice. Using a genetic 5-HT1BR loss-of-function model, we examined the calcium activity of individual medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in the DMS during operant tasks of responding and waiting. We found that knockout of 5-HT1BRs resulted in a significant reduction of excitatory calcium responses and an increase in the proportion of cells with inhibitory calcium responses following receipt of a reward. This suggests that serotonin may recruit MSN activity in response to reward via actions at 5-HT1BRs. On the other hand, in a behavioral paradigm designed to test impulsivity, we found that serotonin may inhibit DMS calcium activity through 5-HT1BRs. Specifically, mice lacking 5-HT1BR expression had a larger proportion of cells showing increased calcium responses during the waiting period of the trial, compared to controls. These results point to the importance of in vivo studies to understand the functional role of DMS serotonin in reward-related behavior. Overall our results demonstrate that serotonin can modulate the DMS in a behavioral state-specific manner, potentially providing a mechanism for how serotonin effects on behavior are context-dependent.

">Elevated activity of the mesolimbic dopamine system promotes feeding during pregnancy in mice</a></h4>

              
                The pregnancy period is accompanied by increased feeding behavior to accommodate the elevated energy demands associated with fetal growth and development. However, the underlying neural circuitry and molecular mechanisms mediating increased feeding during pregnancy are largely unknown. Here, we utilize a combination of fiber photometry, chemogenetics, and mouse behavioral assays to characterize altered feeding behavior during pregnancy in mice. We uncover that pregnancy increases the activity of the mesolimbic dopamine system during both homeostatic and hedonic feeding behavior in mice. VTA dopamine neurons are ultimately required for promoting increased hedonic feeding during pregnancy as inhibition of these cells selectively reduces acute high fat diet intake in pregnant mice. Further, pregnant mice exhibit increased sensitivity to food deprivation, an effect which requires activity of the mesolimbic dopamine system. Together, these findings provide a circuit basis mediating altered hedonic feeding behavior and sensitivity to negative energy balance during pregnancy in mice.

">Musicianship and active musical engagement predict facilitation of auditory-motor plasticity: evidence from auditory-motor paired associative stimulation</a></h4>

              
                Abstract: Background and Aim: Auditory motor paired associative stimulation (PAS) probes experience dependent plasticity in auditory motor circuits. We tested whether musical experience and musical sophistication modulate PAS induced facilitation when instrument tones are paired with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over the left primary motor cortex. Method: Sixteen musicians and thirteen non-musicians completed two sessions. Session 1 estimated an individualized inter-stimulus interval (ISI) by testing seven tone TMS delays (25 to 300 ms). Session 2 applied PAS at the optimal ISI. Corticospinal excitability was assessed by motor evoked potentials (MEPs) from right first dorsal interosseus at baseline and post-intervention. Group comparisons and a stepwise multiple regression with Goldsmiths Musical Sophistication Index (Gold MSI) subscales evaluated predictors of the PAS effect. Results: A stepwise multiple regression model selected Group and Active Engagement (Gold MSI Factor 1) as independent predictors (F (2,26) = 4.59, p = 0.020, adjusted R2 = 0.204), without interaction: musicians exhibited smaller facilitation than non-musicians, and higher Active Engagement predicted greater facilitation across groups. Discussion: The lack of facilitation in musicians contrasts with somatosensory PAS reports of enhanced plasticity in experts. A modality specific ceiling effect may contribute, whereby long term training optimizes auditory motor transmission, reducing headroom for facilitation. The association with Active Engagement suggests motivational/reward mechanisms potentially dopaminergic gate responsiveness to auditory motor PAS. Conclusion: Under this protocol, auditory motor PAS with instrument tones facilitated corticospinal excitability in non-musicians but not in musicians. Individual differences in Active Engagement predicted facilitation, indicating that both group membership and active musical engagement shape susceptibility to auditory motor associative plasticity.
