              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00190">On the utility of toy models for theories of consciousness</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2508.00190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Toy models are highly idealized and deliberately simplified models that retain only the essential features of a system in order to explore specific theoretical questions. Long used in physics and other sciences, they have recently begun to play a more visible role in consciousness research. This chapter examines the potential utility of toy models for developing and evaluating scientific theories of consciousness in terms of their ability to clarify theoretical frameworks, test assumptions, and illuminate philosophical challenges. Drawing primarily on examples from Integrated Information Theory (IIT) and Global Workspace Theory (GWT), I show how these simplified systems could make abstract concepts more tangible, enabling researchers to probe the coherence, consistency, and implications of competing frameworks. In addition to supporting theory development, toy models can also address specific features of experience, as exemplified by the account of spatial extendedness and temporal flow provided by integrated information theory (IIT) and recent theory-independent structural approaches. Moreover, toy models bring philosophical debates into sharper focus, such as the distinction between functional and structural theories of consciousness. By bridging abstract claims and empirical inquiry, toy models provide essential insights into the challenges of building comprehensive theories of consciousness.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00191">State-switching navigation strategies in C. elegans are beneficial for chemotaxis</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2508.00191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Animals employ different strategies for relating sensory input to behavioral output to navigate sensory environments, but what strategy to use, when to switch and why remain unclear. In C. elegans, navigation is composed of 'steering' and 'turns', corresponding to small heading changes and large reorientation events, respectively. It is unclear whether transitions between these elements are driven solely by sensory input or are influenced by internal states that persist over time. It also remains unknown how worms accomplish seemingly surprising feats of navigation--for example, worms appear to exit turns correctly oriented toward a goal, despite their presumed lack of spatial awareness during the turn. Here, we resolve these questions using detailed measurements of sensory-guided navigation and a novel statistical model of state-dependent navigation. We show that the worm's navigation is well described by a sensory-driven state-switching model with two distinct states, each persisting over many seconds and producing different mixtures of sensorimotor relations. One state is enriched for steering, while the other is enriched for turning. This hierarchical, temporal organization of strategies challenges the previous assumption that strategies are static over time and driven solely by immediate sensory input. Sensory input causally drives transitions between these persistent internal states, and creates the appearance of 'directed turns.' Genetic perturbations and a data-constrained reinforcement learning model demonstrate that state-switching enhances gradient-climbing performance. By combining measurement, perturbation, and modeling, we show that state-switching plays a functionally beneficial role in organizing behavior over time--a principle likely to generalize across species and contexts.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00531">The Repeated-Stimulus Confound in Electroencephalography</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2508.00531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In neural-decoding studies, recordings of participants' responses to stimuli are used to train models. In recent years, there has been an explosion of publications detailing applications of innovations from deep-learning research to neural-decoding studies. The data-hungry models used in these experiments have resulted in a demand for increasingly large datasets. Consequently, in some studies, the same stimuli are presented multiple times to each participant to increase the number of trials available for use in model training. However, when a decoding model is trained and subsequently evaluated on responses to the same stimuli, stimulus identity becomes a confounder for accuracy. We term this the repeated-stimulus confound. We identify a susceptible dataset, and 16 publications which report model performance based on evaluation procedures affected by the confound. We conducted experiments using models from the affected studies to investigate the likely extent to which results in the literature have been misreported. Our findings suggest that the decoding accuracies of these models were overestimated by between 4.46-7.42%. Our analysis also indicates that per 1% increase in accuracy under the confound, the magnitude of the overestimation increases by 0.26%. The confound not only results in optimistic estimates of decoding performance, but undermines the validity of several claims made within the affected publications. We conducted further experiments to investigate the implications of the confound in alternative contexts. We found that the same methodology used within the affected studies could also be used to justify an array of pseudoscientific claims, such as the existence of extrasensory perception.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00425">Design, Simulation, and Fabrication of a Hexagonal Microfluidic Platform for Culturing Neurons</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2508.00425v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Developing an organoid computing platform from neurons in vitro demands stable, precisely controlled microenvironments. To address this requirement, we designed, simulated, and fabricated a microfluidic device featuring hexagonal wells ($34.64\,\mathrm{\mu m}$ side length) in a honeycomb array connected by $20\,\mathrm{\mu m}$ channels. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling, validated by high mesh quality ($0.934$ orthogonal quality) and robust convergence, confirmed the architecture supports flow regimes ideal for ensuring cell viability. At target flow rates of $0.1$ - $1\,\mathrm{\mu L/min}$, simulations revealed the extrapolated pressure differential across the full $50{,}000\,\mathrm{\mu m}$ device remains within stable operating limits at $177\,\mathrm{kPa}$ (average) and $329\,\mathrm{kPa}$ (maximum). Photolithography successfully produced this architecture, with only minor corner rounding observed at feature interfaces. This work therefore establishes a computationally validated and fabricated platform, paving the way for experimental flow characterization and subsequent neural integration.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17224">HuiduRep: A Robust Self-Supervised Framework for Learning Neural Representations from Extracellular Recordings</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2507.17224v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Extracellular recordings are transient voltage fluctuations in the vicinity of neurons, serving as a fundamental modality in neuroscience for decoding brain activity at single-neuron resolution. Spike sorting, the process of attributing each detected spike to its corresponding neuron, is a pivotal step in brain sensing pipelines. However, it remains challenging under low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), electrode drift, and cross-session variability. In this paper, we propose HuiduRep, a robust self-supervised representation learning framework that extracts discriminative and generalizable features from extracellular recordings. By integrating contrastive learning with a denoising autoencoder, HuiduRep learns latent representations robust to noise and drift. With HuiduRep, we develop a spike sorting pipeline that clusters spike representations without ground truth labels. Experiments on hybrid and real-world datasets demonstrate that HuiduRep achieves strong robustness. Furthermore, the pipeline significantly outperforms state-of-the-art tools such as KiloSort4 and MountainSort5 on accuracy and precision on diverse datasets. These findings demonstrate the potential of self-supervised spike representation learning as a foundational tool for robust and generalizable processing of extracellular recordings.

                arXiv:2507.23454v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article explores a critical gap in Mixed Reality (MR) technology: while advances have been made, MR still struggles to authentically replicate human embodiment and socio-motor interaction. For MR to enable truly meaningful social experiences, it needs to incorporate multi-modal data streams and multi-agent interaction capabilities. To address this challenge, we present a comprehensive glossary covering key topics such as Virtual Characters and Autonomisation, Responsible AI, Ethics by Design, and the Scientific Challenges of Social MR within Neuroscience, Embodiment, and Technology. Our aim is to drive the transformative evolution of MR technologies that prioritize human-centric innovation, fostering richer digital connections. We advocate for MR systems that enhance social interaction and collaboration between humans and virtual autonomous agents, ensuring inclusivity, ethical design and psychological safety in the process.

Abstract: In this study, we explore how the combination of synthetic biology, neuroscience modeling, and neuromorphic electronic systems offers a new approach to creating an artificial system that mimics the natural sense of smell. We argue that a co-design approach offers significant advantages in replicating the complex dynamics of odor sensing and processing. We propose a hybrid system of synthetic sensory neurons that provides three key features: (a) receptor-gated ion channels, (b) interface between synthetic biology and semiconductors and (c) event-based encoding and computing based on spiking networks. Our approach is validated using simulation-based modeling of the complete sensing and processing pipeline. This research seeks to develop a platform for ultra-sensitive, specific, and energy-efficient odor detection, with potential implications for environmental monitoring, medical diagnostics, and security.

                arXiv:2508.00212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Loss of plasticity is a phenomenon in which a neural network loses its ability to learn when trained for an extended time on non-stationary data. It is a crucial problem to overcome when designing systems that learn continually. An effective technique for preventing loss of plasticity is reinitializing parts of the network. In this paper, we compare two different reinitialization schemes: reinitializing units vs reinitializing weights. We propose a new algorithm, which we name \textit{selective weight reinitialization}, for reinitializing the least useful weights in a network. We compare our algorithm to continual backpropagation and ReDo, two previously proposed algorithms that reinitialize units in the network. Through our experiments in continual supervised learning problems, we identify two settings when reinitializing weights is more effective at maintaining plasticity than reinitializing units: (1) when the network has a small number of units and (2) when the network includes layer normalization. Conversely, reinitializing weights and units are equally effective at maintaining plasticity when the network is of sufficient size and does not include layer normalization. We found that reinitializing weights maintains plasticity in a wider variety of settings than reinitializing units.

                arXiv:2508.00229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is twofold. First, it explores hybrid evolutionary-swarm metaheuristics that combine the features of PSO and GA in a sequential, parallel and consecutive manner in comparison with their standard basic form: Genetic Algorithm and Particle Swarm Optimization. The algorithms were tested on a set of benchmark functions, including Ackley, Griewank, Levy, Michalewicz, Rastrigin, Schwefel, and Shifted Rotated Weierstrass, across multiple dimensions. The experimental results demonstrate that the hybrid approaches achieve superior convergence and consistency, especially in higher-dimensional search spaces. The second goal of this paper is to introduce a novel consecutive hybrid PSO-GA evolutionary algorithm that ensures continuity between PSO and GA steps through explicit information transfer mechanisms, specifically by modifying GA's variation operators to inherit velocity and personal best information.

Abstract: Recent advances in data-driven evolutionary algorithms (EAs) have demonstrated the potential of leveraging data to improve optimization accuracy and adaptability. Nevertheless, most existing approaches remain dependent on handcrafted heuristics, which limits their generality and automation. To address this challenge, we propose Evolutionary Generative Optimization (EvoGO), a fully data-driven framework empowered by generative learning. EvoGO streamlines the evolutionary optimization process into three stages: data preparation, model training, and population generation. The data preparation stage constructs a pairwise dataset to enrich training diversity without incurring additional evaluation costs. During model training, a tailored generative model learns to transform inferior solutions into superior ones. In the population generation stage, EvoGO replaces traditional reproduction operators with a scalable and parallelizable generative mechanism. Extensive experiments on numerical benchmarks, classical control problems, and high-dimensional robotic tasks demonstrate that EvoGO consistently converges within merely 10 generations and significantly outperforms a wide spectrum of optimization approaches, including traditional EAs, Bayesian optimization, and reinforcement learning based methods. Source code will be made publicly available.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00387">STF: Shallow-Level Temporal Feedback to Enhance Spiking Transformers</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2508.00387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transformer-based Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) suffer from a great performance gap compared to floating-point Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) due to the binary nature of spike trains. Recent efforts have introduced deep-level feedback loops to transmit high-level semantic information to narrow this gap. However, these designs often span multiple deep layers, resulting in costly feature transformations, higher parameter overhead, increased energy consumption, and longer inference latency. To address this issue, we propose Shallow-level Temporal Feedback (STF), a lightweight plug-and-play module for the encoding layer, which consists of Temporal-Spatial Position Embedding (TSPE) and Temporal Feedback (TF).Extensive experiments show that STF consistently improves performance across various Transformer-based SNN backbones on static datasets, including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet-1K, under different spike timestep settings. Further analysis reveals that STF enhances the diversity of the spike patterns, which is key to performance gain. Moreover, evaluations on adversarial robustness and temporal sensitivity confirm that STF outperforms direct coding and its variants, highlighting its potential as a new spike encoding scheme for static scenarios. Our code will be released upon acceptance.

                arXiv:2508.00063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Anomaly detection offers a promising strategy for discovering new physics at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). This paper investigates AutoEncoders built using neuromorphic Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) for this purpose. One key application is at the trigger level, where anomaly detection tools could capture signals that would otherwise be discarded by conventional selection cuts. These systems must operate under strict latency and computational constraints. SNNs are inherently well-suited for low-latency, low-memory, real-time inference, particularly on Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). Further gains are expected with the rapid progress in dedicated neuromorphic hardware development. Using the CMS ADC2021 dataset, we design and evaluate a simple SNN AutoEncoder architecture. Our results show that the SNN AutoEncoders are competitive with conventional AutoEncoders for LHC anomaly detection across all signal models.

Abstract: We argue that existing definitions of interpretability are not actionable in that they fail to inform users about general, sound, and robust interpretable model design. This makes current interpretability research fundamentally ill-posed. To address this issue, we propose a definition of interpretability that is general, simple, and subsumes existing informal notions within the interpretable AI community. We show that our definition is actionable, as it directly reveals the foundational properties, underlying assumptions, principles, data structures, and architectural features necessary for designing interpretable models. Building on this, we propose a general blueprint for designing interpretable models and introduce the first open-sourced library with native support for interpretable data structures and processes.

">Unfolding spatiotemporal representations of 3D visual perception in the human brain</a></h4>

              
                Although visual input is initially recorded in two dimensions on our retinas, we perceive and interact with the world in three dimensions. Achieving 3D perception requires the brain to integrate 2D spatial representations with multiple depth cues, such as binocular disparity. However, most studies typically examine 2D and depth information in isolation, leaving the integrated nature of 3D spatial encoding largely underexplored. In this study, we collected a large-scale, multimodal neuroimaging dataset consisting of multiple EEG and fMRI sessions while participants viewed stereoscopic 3D stimuli through red-green anaglyph glasses. Participants first completed a behavioral session including depth judgement tasks and a novel cube adjustment task to quantify and calibrate individual depth perception in units of binocular disparity. Then during two EEG and two fMRI sessions, participants passively viewed stimuli presented at 64 systematically sampled 3D locations, yielding over 66,000 trials in total across ten participants. Combining this large-scale EEG-fMRI dataset with computational methods via representational similarity analysis, we not only systematically characterized the spatiotemporal representation of multiple spatial features in 3D perception but also explored how different coordinate systems (e.g., Cartesian or Polar) might be employed across brain regions and time. Our results reveal that human brains employ multiple types of spatial feature representations and coordinate systems to encode spatial locations at different temporal stages and across distinct cortical regions. In addition to strong representations of 2D space throughout visual cortex, we find unique representations for depth and 3D features in later timepoints and visual areas, including some evidence for 3D processing in parahippocampus. These findings contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the spatiotemporal organization of neural representations that support 3D perception. Additionally, our novel large dataset will be made openly available to support future research on 3D perception and spatial cognition.

">Oxytocin neurons in the anterior and posterior paraventricular nucleus have distinct behavioral functions and electrophysiological profiles</a></h4>

              
                Oxytocin is a neuropeptide that can either promote or inhibit affiliative social behaviors. Recent evidence suggests that these diverse effects are mediated by distinct oxytocin receptor-expressing neuron. An outstanding question is whether these behavioral effects are also driven by distinct or overlapping populations of oxytocin-producing neurons. The paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus is a major source of oxytocin and sends projections to the mesolimbic dopamine system and the extended amygdala. Previous work found that social defeat increased oxytocin neuron activity in the anterior PVN (aPVN) but not posterior PVN (pPVN). We reduced oxytocin synthesis with antisense morpholino oligonucleotides in either anterior or posterior PVN in California mice (Peromyscus californicus), a strong model system for studying effects of social stress on brain function and behavior. Antisense morpholinos in aPVN had no effect on behavior in unstressed females but increased social approach and reduced social vigilance in females exposed to social defeat stress. In pPVN, antisense morpholinos reduced social approach in unstressed male and female California mice. We then used OxtCre mice to compare electrophysiological profiles of oxytocin in aPVN and pPVN with a population of oxytocin neurons in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST). Oxytocin neurons in aPVN and BNST oxytocin neurons had higher post-synaptic potentials and responded more strongly to current injections versus oxytocin neurons in pPVN. These findings shed light onto functional and physiological heterogeneity of PVN oxytocin neurons. Our results suggest that context dependent effects of oxytocin are mediated by different populations of oxytocin neurons.

">Defining and measuring proximity to criticality</a></h4>

              
                Over the half century since the renormalization group (RG) brought about deep understanding of critical phenomena in condensed matter physics, it has been claimed that diverse social, engineered, astrophysical, and biological systems operate close to criticality. However, these systems do not afford the neat phase diagrams and exquisite control available in condensed matter physics. How can one assess proximity to criticality when control parameters are unknown, difficult to manipulate experimentally, and fluctuating in response to changing environmental or internal conditions? Here we meet this challenge with a rigorous theoretical framework and data-analytic strategy for measuring proximity to criticality from observed system dynamics. We developed a temporal RG, well-suited to commonly measured time series, and an information theoretic quantification of proximity to criticality that is independent of model parameterization. After benchmarking our approach on diverse ground-truth cases, we apply it to recordings of spiking activity in the mammalian brain, addressing a long-standing controversy. We show that brain dynamics shift closer to criticality during wakefulness and shift away during deep sleep.

">Large-scale wearable data reveal spatiotemporal organization of annual sleep patterns</a></h4>

              
                Sleep is fundamental to health, yet large-scale, objective data on how geography shapes sleep behavior remain scarce. We analyzed over 45 million nights of sensor data from 105,741 German adults wearing consumer-grade wearables across 2.7 years. Sleep timing displayed a continuous east-west gradient, with later onset, midsleep, and offset in western regions, consistent with solar progression. This effect was strongest on weekends and in rural areas, where midsleep was delayed by 2.2 minutes per degree longitude and sleep duration increased by 1.0 minute. A north-south gradient also emerged. Weekday midsleep advanced by 0.9 minutes per degree latitude, while weekend midsleep was delayed by 0.2 minutes, resulting in greater social jetlag in the north. Sleep duration declined toward higher latitudes across both day types. Seasonal analyses revealed consistent annual rhythms. Sleep duration increased by 24.7 minutes in winter relative to summer, and sleep offset closely followed sunrise. These patterns highlight the joint influence of solar and social time on sleep, with implications for regionally tailored public health strategies.

">Distinguishing cortical indexes of arousal and awareness in sleeping patients with unresponsive wakefulness syndrome</a></h4>

              
                Consciousness is assumed to be defined by two components: awareness and arousal. However, the cortical indexes for these two components remain unclear. Since patients with unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (UWS) are supposed to have no awareness but arousal, sleep-wake cycle in patients with UWS may reflect pure arousal fluctuations, and then could distinguish the cortical indexes for arousal from ones for awareness. This study recorded nighttime polysomnography in patients with UWS, patients with minimally conscious state (MCS) and healthy controls, showing that spectral slope could index arousal, fluctuating among sleep stages in all three groups. Both spectral entropy and Lempel-Ziv complexity can index awareness, showing a significant difference between conscious and unconscious states. These findings provide fundamental evidence for the two-component hypothesis of consciousness.

">Alpha-Beta oscillations implement inhibition of the ventral attention network during an attention task</a></h4>

              
                Selective attention is a crucial mechanism that allows us to focus on relevant information while ignoring irrelevant information. Although extensive literature has proposed that alpha oscillations (7-14 Hz) suppress distractor processing, recent studies have questioned this role. In this magnetoencephalography (MEG) study, we used a modified Stroop task to investigate whether (1) alpha oscillations are associated with functional inhibition in higher-order visual regions and the ventral attention network (VAN), and (2) alpha phase adjusts in anticipation of relevant and irrelevant stimuli. We found no significant increase in pre-stimulus alpha power or phase adjustment over higher-order visual regions in the attend-color condition, consistent with the absence of a behavioral Stroop effect. However, we observed elevated alpha-beta power (10-20 Hz) in the VAN during both attend-color and attend-word conditions compared to control conditions, occurring before stimulus onset. Higher alpha-beta power in the right temporo-parietal junction correlated with faster reaction times, suggesting that inhibition of this network region facilitates task performance. This alpha-beta modulation in the VAN may represent a general mechanism for resisting distraction, preventing attentional capture by irrelevant information regardless of task condition. Additionally, we found enhanced theta power (4 Hz) over the VAN and left medial frontal gyrus (part of the cognitive control network) in both experimental conditions. Theta power correlated with improved reaction times across these regions. Furthermore, theta activity in the left medial frontal gyrus synchronized with VAN nodes, potentially indicating cross-network interaction between cognitive control and attention systems.

">Microglia-to-neuron signaling increases lipid droplet metabolism, enhancing neuronal network activity</a></h4>

              
                Microglia regulate neuronal circuit plasticity. Disrupting their homeostatic function has detrimental effects on neuronal circuit health. Neuroinflammation contributes to the onset and progression of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimers disease, with several microglial activation genes linked to increased risk for these conditions. Inflammatory microglia alter neuronal excitability, inducing metabolic strain. Interestingly, expression of APOE4, the strongest genetic risk factor for Alzheimers disease, affects both microglial activation and neuronal excitability, highlighting the interplay between lipid metabolism, inflammation, and neuronal function. It remains unclear how microglial inflammatory state is conveyed to neurons to affect circuit function and whether APOE4 expression alters this intercellular communication. Here, we use a reductionist model of human iPSC-derived microglial and neuronal monocultures to dissect how the APOE genotype in each cell-type independently contributes to microglial regulation of neuronal activity during inflammation. Conditioned media from LPS-stimulated microglia increased neuronal network activity, assessed by calcium imaging, with APOE4 microglial conditioned media driving higher neuronal firing rates than APOE3 conditioned media. Both APOE3 and APOE4 neurons increase network activity in response to conditioned media treatments, while APOE4 neurons uniquely increase presynaptic puncta with APOE4 microglial conditioned media. Conditioned media-derived exosomes from LPS-stimulated microglia can mediate increases to network activity. Lastly, increased network activity is accompanied by increased lipid droplet metabolism and blocking lipid droplet metabolism abolishes network activity. These findings illuminate how microglia-to-neuron communication drives inflammation-induced changes in neuronal circuit function, demonstrate a role for neuronal lipid droplets in network activity, and support a potential mechanism through which APOE4 increases neuronal excitability.

">Mechanically-gated currents in mouse sensory neurons lacking PIEZO2</a></h4>

              
                Touch sensation starts with the opening of mechanically-gated activated ion channels at neuroglial endings of mechanoreceptors in the skin. The function of around half of low threshold mechanoreceptors is dependent on the presence of the mechanically gated ion channel PIEZO2. It has been reported that particularly rapidly-adapting mechanosensitive currents (RA-currents) in the cell bodies of acutely cultured sensory neurons are dependent on PIEZO2. Here we re-examined this question by making a quantitative study of mechanically-gated currents activated by substrate deflection in sensory neurons lacking PIEZO2. We characterized mechanically-gated currents from embryonic and post-natal sensory neurons, taken from global Piezo2-/- or Piezo2 conditional knockouts (Piezo2cko), respectively. Surprisingly in both models, Piezo2 gene deletion was not associated with any significant reduction in the sensitivity or incidence of mechanosensitive currents compared to wild type controls. There was, however, a moderate reduction in the incidence of RA-currents with very fast activation and inactivation kinetics in both embryonic Piezo2-/- and juvenile Piezo2cKO mice. These results show that PIEZO2 channels are not the only mechanosensitive channels mediating RA-currents in sensory neurons. Furthermore, our data suggest that the phenotypes associated with Piezo2 loss of function alleles may sometimes be due to secondary effects of gene deletion, for example, by changing the developmental trajectory of sensory neurons. Emphasis should be put on the diversity of mechanosensitive ion channel function in sensory neurons which needs to be further elucidated.

">Ca2+-phospholipid-dependent regulation of Munc13-1 is essential for post-tetanic potentiation at mossy fiber synapses and supports working memory</a></h4>

              
                Hippocampal mossy fiber (hMF) to CA3 pyramidal cell synapses are thought to support the formation of working memory through presynaptic short-term facilitation (STF) and post-tetanic potentiation (PTP). However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these transient forms of synaptic enhancement remain poorly understood. We show here that Munc13-1-mediated priming of synaptic vesicles (SVs) at active zones controls hMF STF and PTP in response to Ca2+-phospholipid and Ca2+-calmodulin (CaM) signaling. Knock-in mice expressing Munc13-1 variants that are insensitive to Ca2+-phospholipid and Ca2+-CaM signaling exhibit severely impaired STF and PTP at hMF synapses. Moreover, the PTP-induction threshold is strongly increased upon the loss of Ca2+-phospholipid-Munc13-1 signaling. Since these synaptic defects are accompanied by working memory deficits, especially in mice expressing the Ca2+-phospholipid-insensitive Munc13-1 variant, we conclude that Ca2+-dependent regulation of Munc13-1-mediated SV priming co-determines hMF short-term plasticity and working memory formation.

">Habenular μ-opioid receptor knockout and chronic systemic receptor blockade promote negative affect and heighten nociceptive sensitivity</a></h4>

              
                The -opioid receptor (MOR), a subtype of opioid G protein-coupled receptor, is expressed in multiple brain circuits and is particularly enriched in the habenula, a small epithalamic structure implicated in aversive states. MOR dysfunction has been linked to several psychiatric and nociceptive disorders. Identifying the key brain regions mediating the behavioral consequences of disrupted MOR signaling can shed light on the role of the opioid system in mood and pain regulation. In this study, we administered methocinnamox (MCAM), a long-acting, pseudo-irreversible MOR antagonist, acutely or chronically to adult C57BL/6J mice. A comprehensive behavioral battery was used to assess affective, social, and pain behavior. A single MCAM administration (10 mg/kg, s.c.) did not alter baseline behavior, but blocked opioid-induced analgesia, suggesting that basal -opioid tone does not contribute to these behaviors. In contrast, chronic MCAM administration (10 mg/kg, s.c., 3x/week for 4 weeks) led to increased anxiety-like behavior and decreased sociability, as well as enhanced mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia. Remarkably, selective knockout of habenular MORs in adult Oprm1fl/fl mice reproduced key features of the chronic MCAM phenotype, including anxiety-like behavior and mechanical hyperalgesia. Together, these findings reveal that sustained inhibition of MOR signaling disrupts affective and nociceptive processing and highlight the habenula as a node mediating key behavioral deficits of disrupted opioid signaling.

">PyMouse Lifter: Real Time 3-D Pose Estimation for Mice with Only 2-D Annotation Via Data Synthesis</a></h4>

              
                Neural-network based pose estimation models have become increasingly popular for quantitative analysis of mouse behavior, yet most recordings still use a single 2 D camera view and therefore lack the depth cues needed for accurate 3 D kinematics. Existing open source 3 D mouse datasets for training deep-learning models cover only a narrow range of environments and do not generalize well to various laboratory settings. To overcome these limitations, we introduce PyMouseLifter, a pipeline that automatically reconstructs 3 D mouse poses from ordinary 2-D top view videos with minimal manual 2-D annotation. PyMouseLifter combines (i) an anatomically realistic 3 D mouse model for automated data synthesis, (ii) a monocular depth estimation model, and (iii) a 2 D key point estimation model, enabling accurate 3 D reconstruction (model-based 3D inference) in virtually any open field arena without using depth or multiple camera views for reconstruction. We validate the system on multiple datasets against depth camera ground truth and show that the lifted 3D trajectories yield improved behavior classification over 2 D data and can be implemented in real time.

                Background: The blood-brain barrier (BBB) interferes with the treatment of central nervous system disorders owing to the complexity of its structure and restrictive function. Thus, it is challenging to develop central nervous system drug delivery strategies. Specific mode electroacupuncture (EA) stimulation can effectively open the BBB in rats. Methods: Here, we used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to comprehensively map the cell population in the rat cerebral cortex. Results: We identified 23 cell subsets and eight types of cells in the brain by cell annotation. scRNA-seq revealed transcriptional changes in the cerebral cortex under EA. Conclusions: Our findings offer valuable insights into the molecular and cellular modifications in the brain resulting from EA intervention and serve as a resource for drug delivery across healthy and diseased states. Innovative approaches to enhance BBB opening will lead to more effective therapeutic plans and enhanced drug delivery.

">Targeting intracranial electrical stimulation to network regions defined within individuals causes network-level effects</a></h4>

              
                Intracranial electrical stimulation (ES) is routinely used therapeutically, diagnostically, and to provide causal evidence in neuroscience studies. However, our understanding of the brain network-level effects of ES remains limited. We applied precision functional mapping (PFM), based on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), to define large-scale networks within individual epilepsy patients. We show that single-pulse electrical stimulation (SPES) and high-frequency electrical stimulation (HFES) are more likely to evoke within-network responses and elicit network-related behavioral effects, respectively, when applied near to a PFM-defined network region. Network-level effects were more likely when stimulating sites in white matter, in close proximity to the targeted network, and within a region predominantly occupied by the targeted network. Further, network-specific modulation may be achievable by applying lower current intensities at these sites. Our findings support that modulation of specific networks is achievable by targeting ES to a functional anatomic "sweet spot" that can be identified using PFM.

">Processing of inner bodily signals: evidence and insight from adolescence</a></h4>

              
                Interoception, the sense of inner bodily signals, plays a key role in emotional regulation, cognition and mental health. While its relevance in adulthood has been extensively explored, less is known about how these abilities develop during adolescence, a period characterised by significant physical and psychological changes. This study aimed to investigate three distinct dimensions of interoception -- accuracy, sensitivity and awareness -- in adolescents and adults to better understand the developmental profile of this sense. Fifty-four adolescents (aged 12-14) and 50 adults (aged 25-34) completed the Heartbeat Monitoring Task to assess their actual ability to detect heartbeats, their confidence in this ability, and the confidence-accuracy correspondence, and a questionnaire on the tendency to focus on bodily sensations. The study also examined where participants localised bodily sensations during the interoceptive task. The results revealed no significant differences in interoceptive accuracy between the two groups. Both age groups exhibited similar body localisation patterns, primarily focusing on the chest during heartbeat detection. However, adolescents showed significantly lower metacognitive awareness of their ability to perceive internal bodily sensations, and higher focus on interoceptive sensations, as reflected in their higher confidence ratings and questionnaire scores. No significant correlations emerged among the three interoceptive dimensions in either group, which supports the view that these dimensions represent independent components of interoception. These findings suggest that, while basic interoceptive detection may be established by early adolescence, the capacity to accurately reflect on these internal sensations continues to mature into adulthood. The mismatch observed between adolescents' heightened bodily focus and their limited metacognitive insight may partly help explain why adolescence is a period of increased vulnerability to mental health difficulties.

">Transcranial magnetic stimulation induced pupil dilations can serve as a cortical excitability measure</a></h4>

              
                The application of non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) often relies on proxy estimates of cortical excitability (CE), such as the resting motor threshold (rMT), measured through transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). However, estimating the rMT is not always possible, as it requires an intact corticospinal pathway for neural signals to travel from the cortex to the periphery. To broaden the application of NIBS there is a need for additional CE measures. In three experiments combining TMS, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), and eye-tracking, we measured TMS-induced pupil dilations as a potential CE proxy. We present Bayesian evidence (Experiment 1: BF > 9; Experiment 2: BF > 46; Experiment 3: BFs > 6) that TMS-induced pupil dilations serve as an objective CE proxy, with larger pupil size reflecting higher CE. We also show that these effects are not due to auditory, muscle, or sensory confounds. The introduction of this novel measure paves the way for a deeper understanding of CE by enabling objective NIBS measures beyond the motor cortex. Moving away from the reliance on the motor cortex would allow NIBS research and therapy to become more inclusive, allowing access to populations that are affected by damage along the corticospinal pathway.

">Evidence for a Transient State of Auditory Hypersensitivity During Initial Onset of Tinnitus, Evidenced by Intensity Dependence of the Auditory Evoked Potential (IDAEP)</a></h4>

              
                Our understanding of tinnitus pathophysiology may be greatly advanced by understanding how the condition evolves from its initial onset or acute stage to its chronic manifestation. Such a transition likely reflects dynamic neurophysiological changes within central auditory and non-auditory networks. Our integrated model of tinnitus posits that sensory precision (sensory weighting) may be heightened during the acute stages of tinnitus to resolve degraded auditory input, but in chronic tinnitus, its role may diminish as plastic processes take over the percept's maintenance. Consequently, we hypothesize that bottom-up neural mechanisms linked to initiation of tinnitus, such as central gain and neural synchrony, are maximal around the time of tinnitus onset, but later subside by way of regression to the mean. We evaluated this hypothesis by measuring central auditory reactivity through the Intensity Dependence of Auditory Evoked Potential (IDAEP), a non-invasive index of higher-order inhibitory processing within the auditory system. A steeper IDAEP slope is associated with heightened sensory reactivity (higher sensitivity to changes in auditory stimuli), indicative of reduced central inhibition. Conversely, a shallower slope reflects greater inhibitory control. Studying a group with acute tinnitus (onset within six weeks), with a repeated assessment after six months from onset, we found an initially increased IDAEP slope in the acute stage, which had significantly reduced at follow-up, supporting our hypothesis that there is increased sensory reactivity during tinnitus onset, which need not persist in order for tinnitus to become chronic.

">Unveiling Distinct Neuroimmune Responses in Mouse Models of Cervical Spinal Cord Injury: Hemisection versus Hemicontusion</a></h4>

              
                Traumatic cervical spinal cord injury (cSCI) causes severe neurological deficits and long-term disability. Preclinical models such as cervical 2 (C2) hemisection (C2HS), resulting in disrupted communication between the respiratory centers and the phrenic motoneurons (PMN) pool, have been used since decades to study respiratory dysfunction and neuroinflammation after cSCI. Recently, contusive injuries such as C3 hemi-contusion (C3HC) have been increasingly used, as they induce phrenic motoneuron damage and offer a more clinically relevant model of SCI. However, these two different models may engage distinct pathophysiological cascades, raising concerns about the generalizability of findings across injury paradigms. In this study, we compared neuroimmune responses following C2HS or C3HC in mice. Animals underwent C2HS or C3HC, and spinal cord segments (C1-C8) were collected seven days post-injury for immuno-histological analyses around the lesion level and flow cytometry analyses at the lesion level. We observed that C2HS preserved more neurons and exhibited elevated CD86 and F4/80 expression. These markers are typically expressed by activated microglia and are indicative of a response oriented toward phagocytic and reparative functions. This phenotype was associated with limited pro-inflammatory cell infiltration and normalized level of systemic IL-6 in this model. Conversely, C3HC induced more extensive tissue damage, heightened microglial activation, a trend toward increased astrocytic reactivity, and significantly elevated CSPG levels on the contralateral side. Moreover, a persistent NK cell, neutrophil, and CD43 antigen-presenting cells infiltration, along with persistently high circulating IL-6 has been observed following C3HC. These findings demonstrate distinct neuroinflammatory signatures and repairing mechanisms between models, with C2HS promoting a microglia profile toward repair and C3HC leading to a prolonged and potentially harmful immune response. This study underscores, for the first time, how injury type shapes neuroimmune mechanisms, reinforcing the need for lesion-specific therapeutic strategies in cervical spinal cord injury.

">Feature-specific inhibitory connectivity augments the accuracy of cortical representations</a></h4>

              
                To interpret complex sensory scenes, animals exploit statistical regularities to infer missing features and suppress redundant or ambiguous information. Cortical microcircuits might contribute to this cognitive goal by either completing or cancelling predictable activity, but it remains unknown whether, and how, a single circuit can implement these antagonistic computations. To address this central question, we used all-optical physiology to simulate sensory-evoked activity patterns in pyramidal cells (PCs) and somatostatin interneurons (SSTs) in the mouse primary visual cortex. In the absence of external visual input, photostimulation of orientation-tuned PC ensembles drove either completion or cancelation of input-matching representations, depending on the number of photostimulated cells. This dual computational capacity arose from the co-existence of "like-to-like" excitatory interactions between PCs, and a newly discovered "like-to-like" SST-PC connectivity motif, in which SSTs are preferentially recruited by, and in turn suppress, similarly tuned PCs. Finally, we show that photoactivation of tuned SST ensembles during visual processing improved the discriminability of their preferred visual input by suppressing ambiguous activity. Thus, these complementary feature-specific connectivity motifs allow different strategies of contextual modulation to optimize inference by either completion (through PC-PC interactions) or cancelation (via PC-SST-PC loops) of predictable activity, depending on the structure of the input and the network state.

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Early-life stress and depression among youths are linked to hippocampal gray- and white-matter alterations. Less is known about hippocampal alterations in adolescent anxiety disorders (Anx) or the role that stress or comorbid depressive disorders (Anx + Dep) might play. Here, structural- and diffusion-MRI along with early-life stress-exposure reports were acquired from 197 adolescents (13.58–17.00 years) with Anx, Anx + Dep, and those without (Controls). A normative model externally validated on a large, healthy sample revealed that Anx were more likely than Controls and Anx + Dep to exhibit undersized hippocampal gray-matter volumes for their ages. Volume reductions among Anx were further localized to subfield CA1. No significant gray-matter differences were observed between Anx + Dep and Controls. Standardized probabilistic tractography in hippocampal white-matter pathways demonstrated that, relative to Controls, Anx and Anx + Dep exhibited lower fractional anisotropy specifically in the cingulum-temporal branch. All effects were specific to hippocampal structures. Group differences were not accounted for by early-life stress exposures, despite Anx and Anx + Dep reporting more than Controls. Findings indicated that gray-matter expansion, principally within CA1, may be disrupted among adolescents with anxiety disorders, but not those with comorbid depression. The progressive strengthening of hippocampal-cortical circuits occurring during adolescence may also be disrupted in adolescents with anxiety disorders, regardless of depression.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To determine whether established heart rate parameters of exercise, related to cardiac autonomic function, are associated with incident Parkinson's disease, independent of both clinical and autonomic prodromal features.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>A study of UK Biobank participants who performed a standardized bicycle exercise test (2009–2013), followed until November 2022, and analyzed in January 2024, was carried out. Heart rate increase from rest to exercise, and heart rate decrease from peak exercise to recovery were associated with incident Parkinson's disease. Multivariable adjustment was performed both for clinical characteristics and for prodromal non-cardiac autonomic features.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 69,288 eligible participants (men 48%, mean age 56.8 years [SD 8.2 years]) were followed for 12.5 years: among the 319 (0.5%) who developed Parkinson's disease, recognized prodromal markers (constipation, bladder dysfunction) were more common at baseline. The median lag time to diagnosis was 9.3 years (interquartile range 4.4). Both heart rate increase (37.5 [SD 11.5] vs 40.8 [SD 12.4] b.p.m., <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and recovery (23.4 [SD 8.8] vs. 27.8 [SD 10.3] b.p.m., <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) were significantly lower in incident cases compared with controls. Heart rate recovery was independently associated with incident Parkinson's disease, whereas heart rate increase was not. Specifically, a blunted heart rate lowering during recovery was associated with a 30% higher risk of incident Parkinson's disease (HR 1.3; 95% CI 1.1–1.4; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001 per 10 beats less recovery).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Collectively, this suggests that cardiac autonomic involvement precedes clinically manifest Parkinson's disease, and that heart rate recovery might serve as a quantitative prodromal marker. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Ischemic stroke (IS) is a prevalent and serious neurological disorder, and is one of the major contributors to mortality and disability worldwide. The activation of autophagy and the inflammatory response following cerebral ischemia are crucial in the progression of IS. Protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit 15A (PPP1R15A), as a stress-responsive protein, has been proven to be closely associated with autophagy. Nevertheless, the molecular mechanism of PPP1R15A in IS remains to be fully understood. Our study screened PPP1R15A as a candidate gene by bioinformatics analysis of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in IS and autophagy-related genes (ARGs). Functionally, experiments uncovered that down-regulation of PPP1R15A alleviated oxygen–glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R)-mediated inhibition of cell viability and promotion of LDH release, cell apoptosis, autophagy, and inflammation in A172 and SH-SY5Y cells. Simultaneously, silencing PPP1R15A ameliorated the IS progression in the middle cerebral artery occlusion and reperfusion (MCAO/R) rat model. Furthermore, PPP1R15A activated the toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)/nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) pathway in vivo and in vitro. Rescue experiments indicated that TLR4 inhibitors TAK-242 and NF-κB inhibitors BAY-11-7082 effectively alleviated the malignant progression of IS mediated by overexpression of PPP1R15A. Our data illustrated that PPP1R15A promoted OGD/R-induced cytotoxicity, apoptosis, autophagy, and inflammation by activating the TLR4/NF-κB pathway.</p>

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Melatonin and its receptors play a primary role in regulating circadian rhythms, which are frequently disrupted in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Furthermore, there is increasing evidence that the use of a ketogenic diet (KD) delays the onset of AD. Therefore, we aimed to investigate whether KD has an ameliorative effect on AD through the regulation of melatonin receptors. In this study, male Sprague–Dawley rats were divided into three groups: sham, AD, and KD. At the end of KD supplementation, behavioral parameters were determined by the Morris Water Maze. Melatonin levels, protein expression levels, and immunoreactivity of MT1–MT2 in thehippocampus and striatum were determined by ELISA, Western blotting, and immunofluorescence staining, respectively. As a result, KD improved memory decline in AD rats. Also, KD increased melatonin levels in the hippocampus but did not affect striatum melatonin levels. MT1 expression tended to increase in the hippocampus of the AD group, while MT2 expression decreased. On the contrary, KD treatment increased both MT1 and MT2 expressions. In the striatum, there was no change in MT1 expression in the AD and KD groups, but MT2 expression increased in the AD group compared with the sham group and was suppressed in the KD group. In addition, KD treatment reduced streptozotocin-induced apoptosis and neuroinflammation in the hippocampus and striatum. Our results suggest that KD may improve AD-associated inflammation and apoptosis by altering melatonin levels and the expression of MT2 receptors in the hippocampus and striatum. Therefore, KD may be a promising preventive and therapeutic option for AD.</p>

                Hamm et al. uncovered layers of epigenetic and transcriptional regulation in human thymocyte development that support the generation of mature T lymphocytes, which retain a non-exhausted DNA methylome. The DNA methylation datasets of human thymocyte subsets generated in this study can be used to quality control thymocyte development in model systems.

                Sudholz et al. identified the core fucosyltransferase, FUT8, as an essential component for maintaining NK cell homeostasis, namely through the post-translational modification of the IL-15 receptor. The absence of FUT8 in murine NK cells resulted in significant impairments to their survival, proliferation, and cytotoxicity, which impaired anti-tumor immunity.

                The precise mechanism by which stress augments inflammation via Th17 cells remains unclear. Shimba et al. show that stress-associated hormone glucocorticoids enhance the glycolysis, proliferation, and differentiation of Th17 cells. Acute stress-induced glucocorticoids expand TCF1low Th17 cells, which promotes IL-17 production and neutrophil infiltration, thereby exacerbating intestinal inflammation.

">Backward Conditioning Reveals Flexibility in Infralimbic Cortex Inhibitory Memories</a></h4>

              
                While the infralimbic cortex (IL) is recognized as critical for behavioral inhibition, the content of the inhibitory memories stored in this region remains elusive. To probe this content, we examined some of the conditions that allow retrieval and facilitation of an inhibitory memory stored in the IL using optogenetic stimulation in female and male rats. We found that IL stimulation did not facilitate an initial fear extinction session. However, prior experience with fear extinction enabled IL stimulation to facilitate subsequent fear extinction. Importantly, the facilitative effects of IL stimulation were not limited to fear extinction experience, as prior exposure to backward fear conditioning also enabled IL stimulation to enhance later fear extinction. The effects were stimulus-specific and did not depend on the motivational context present during the prior experience, as backward appetitive conditioning allowed IL stimulation to facilitate later fear extinction. Additional experiments ruled out stimulus familiarity as an explanation for the facilitative effects of IL stimulation and demonstrated that IL-mediated facilitations occur in procedures other than fear extinction. Together, these findings demonstrate that the IL stores inhibitory memories that are extremely flexible since they can be retrieved and used across many inhibitory procedures and distinct motivational contexts. These features establish the IL as a critical hub for the flexible application of inhibitory knowledge that allows adaptive responses in dynamic environments.

">Exercise-induced plasma-derived extracellular vesicles increase adult hippocampal neurogenesis</a></h4>

              
                Aerobic exercise enhances cognition in part by increasing adult hippocampal neurogenesis, angiogenesis, and astrogliogenesis. Since hippocampal atrophy is a hallmark of several neurological and psychiatric conditions- including depression, PTSD, Alzheimers disease, and aging- understanding the mechanisms by which exercise increases neurogenesis has broad therapeutic relevance. One potential mechanism involves extracellular vesicles (EVs), lipid bilayer-enclosed particles released by multiple tissues during exercise that transport bioactive molecular cargo to distant organs, including the brain. In this study, we tested whether plasma-derived EVs from exercising mice (ExerVs) are sufficient to promote hippocampal neurogenesis, astrogliogenesis, and vascular density in sedentary mice. EVs were isolated from the plasma of sedentary or exercising C57BL/6J mice and injected intraperitoneally into sedentary recipients twice weekly for four weeks. To evaluate reproducibility, the study was conducted across two independent cohorts using identical procedures. ExerV-treated mice showed a significant increase in BrdU-positive cells in the granule cell layer compared to both PBS- and SedV-treated controls in both cohorts. Approximately 90% of these cells co-expressed NeuN, indicating neuronal differentiation, while 6% co-expressed S100B;, indicating astrocyte generation. No changes were observed in vascular density across groups. These findings provide initial evidence that systemically delivered exercise-derived EVs can enhance hippocampal neurogenesis and astrogliogenesis in sedentary mice. This proof-of-concept work supports further investigation into ExerVs as a potential therapeutic strategy for conditions associated with hippocampal atrophy.

">Digestive Dimensions of Autism: A Multiscale Exploration of Gut-Brain Interactions</a></h4>

              
                Social communication difficulties characterize autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms are more common in ASD than in the general population. The identification of GI problems in individuals with ASD is challenging due to their altered pain perception and irregular behaviors. Importantly, GI symptoms and ASD can potentially aggravate each other. However, it is unclear if GI problems cause ASD symptoms or vice versa. A crosstalk between the digestive system, gut microbiota, and the central and enteric nervous systems has been repeatedly reported. The enteric nervous system (ENS) regulates the GI tract with the central nervous system (CNS) and the autonomic nervous system (ANS), as well as independently through specific neural circuits. Several mechanisms contribute to GI problems in ASD, including genetic mutations that affect the enteric nervous system (ENS), dysregulation of the ANS, alterations in gut microbiota, unhealthy dietary preferences, and changes in metabolomic profiles. Furthermore, studies have shown molecular and cellular differences in the GI biopsy of children with and without ASD. These findings highlight the unique nature of GI issues in ASD, underscoring the importance of further investigating the changes that occur in the digestive system and enteric nervous system (ENS) in ASD models.

However, the exact information content of these representations is still unclear, as is their degree of specificity.

Multivoxel pattern analysis revealed that animate and inanimate sounds, as well as human, animal, vehicle, and object sounds could be decoded from fMRI activity patterns in early visual regions V1, V2, and V3. Further, pairwise classification of the different sound categories demonstrated that sounds produced by humans were represented in early visual cortex more distinctively than other semantic categories. Whole-brain searchlight analysis showed that sounds could be decoded also in higher level visual and multisensory brain regions. Our findings extend our understanding of early visual cortex function beyond visual feature processing and show that semantic and categorical sound information is represented in early visual cortex, potentially used to predict visual input.</span>

Male and female Long Evans rats completed 6-odor IST and DST. No differences in total exploration times or stimuli visits were observed in either test or sex.

This study employed electroencephalogram (EEG) to investigate the temporal dynamics of TIS-induced modulation, with a particular focus on hemispheric lateralization, an aspect often overlooked. Using a delayed recognition task, we categorized WM into high-load and low-load conditions and applied TIS to the left and right hemispheres with sham stimulation as a control. The results revealed a robust right-lateralized effect of TIS under high-load conditions, characterized by increased N200 amplitude and decreased P300 amplitude at the right parietal site post-stimulation, whereas no significant effects emerged under low-load conditions. This pattern of results contrasts sharply with the null effects in low-load conditions, highlighting the influence of TIS on verbal WM under high-load conditions. Furthermore, our study uncovered distinct activation patterns between the 2 hemispheres, suggesting a complex interplay between hemispheric lateralization and TIS-induced neural modulation.

                <p>Neurodevelopmental disorders disproportionately affect males compared with females. The biological mechanisms of this male susceptibility or female protection have not been identified. There is evidence that fetal/neonatal gonadal hormones, which play a pivotal role in many aspects of development, may contribute. Here, we investigate the effects of excess testosterone (T) during a critical period of sex-specific brain organization on social approach and fear learning behaviors in C57BL/6J wild-type mice. Male, but not female, mice treated with T on the day of birth (Postnatal Day 0; PN0) exhibited decreased social approach as juveniles and decreased contextual fear memory as adults, compared with vehicle (veh)-treated controls. These deficits were not driven by anxiety-like behavior or changes in locomotion or body weight. Mice treated with the same dose of T on PN18, which is outside of the critical period of brain masculinization, did not demonstrate impairments compared with the veh group. These findings indicate that excess T during a critical period of early development, but not shortly after, induces long-term deficits relevant to the male sex bias in neurodevelopmental disorders.</p>

Understanding the functions of proteins is of great importance for deciphering the mechanisms of life activities. To date, there have been over 200 million known proteins, but only 0.2% of them have well-annotated functional terms. By measuring the contacts among residues, proteins can be described as graphs so that the graph leaning approaches can be applied to learn protein representations. However, existing graph-based methods put efforts in enriching the residue node information and did not fully exploit the edge information, which leads to suboptimal representations considering the strong association of residue contacts to protein structures and to the functions. In this article, we propose SuperEdgeGO, which introduces the supervision of edges in protein graphs to learn a better graph representation for protein function prediction. Different from common graph convolution methods that uses edge information in a plain or unsupervised way, we introduce a <i>supervised</i> attention to encode the residue contacts <i>explicitly</i> into the protein representation. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that SuperEdgeGO achieves state-of-the-art performance on all three categories of protein functions. Additional ablation analysis further proves the effectiveness of the devised edge supervision strategy. The implementation of edge supervision in SuperEdgeGO resulted in enhanced graph representations for protein function prediction, as demonstrated by its superior performance across all the evaluated categories. This superior performance was confirmed through ablation analysis, which validated the effectiveness of the edge supervision strategy. This strategy has a broad application prospect in the study of protein function and related fields.

                <p>by Viktoria Zemliak, Gordon Pipa, Pascal Nieters</p>

Familiarity memory enables recognition of previously encountered inputs as familiar without recalling detailed stimuli information, which supports adaptive behavior across various timescales. We present a spiking neural network model with lateral connectivity shaped by unsupervised spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) that encodes familiarity via local plasticity events. We show that familiarity can be decoded from network activity using both frequency (spike count) and temporal (spike synchrony) characteristics of spike trains. Temporal coding demonstrates enhanced performance under sparse input conditions, consistent with the principles of sparse coding observed in the brain. We also show how connectivity structure supports each decoding strategy, revealing different plasticity regimes. Our approach outperforms LSTM in temporal generalizability on the continual familiarity detection task, with input stimuli being naturally encoded in the recurrent connectivity without a separate training stage.

                <p>by Gaurav Mendiratta, Kodye Abbott, Yao-Cheng Li, Jingting Yu, Peter Carlip, Melinda Tong, Jianfeng Huang, Maxim N. Shokhirev, Thomas McFall, Geoffrey M. Wahl, Edward C. Stites</p>

RAF inhibitor “paradoxical activation” (PA) is a phenomenon where RAF kinase inhibitors increase RAF kinase signaling. Through mathematical modeling and experimental data analysis, we recently demonstrated that the combination of conformational autoinhibition (CA) with the disruption of CA by RAF inhibitors plays an important role in PA. 14-3-3 proteins are known to modulate RAF CA and RAF dimerization. We here extend our mathematical model to include both roles of 14-3-3 proteins, and we derive rigorous analytical expressions of RAF signal regulation as modulated by 14-3-3 proteins. We then use the model to investigate how 14-3-3 proteins may modulate PA. We mathematically show 14-3-3 protein stabilization of the autoinhibited form of RAF should potentiate PA, while 14-3-3 protein stabilization of the active RAF dimer should reduce PA. Our analysis suggests that the net-effect will often be a potentiation of PA, and that 14-3-3 proteins may be capable of inducing PA for RAF inhibitors that normally show little to no PA. We test model-based insights experimentally with two different approaches: forced increases in 14-3-3 expression (which we find amplifies PA) and evolved resistance assays (which suggest increased 14-3-3 expression may contribute to resistance to RAF inhibitors). Overall, this work supports a role for 14-3-3 in modulating RAF-inhibitor mediated paradoxical activation.

                Kines et al. find the pro-tumorigenic protein SEMA7A is upregulated in the aged environment and may be a downstream target of TGF-β signaling. The aged environment accelerates tumor growth and a mesenchymal phenotype, and this depends on SEMA7A host expression. SEMA7A overexpression accelerates metastasis, which is attenuated by inhibiting SEMA7A.

                Using the epitope maps of 121 DENV antibodies, Grinyo-Escuer et al. identify seven key residues driving DENV-ZIKV cross-reactivity. They engineer a ZIKV E protein variant, “ZIKVm10,” that minimizes DENV cross-reactivity, reduces ADE risk, and protects against lethal ZIKV challenge in mice, offering a pathway for safer, more targeted ZIKV vaccines.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/104918">Trained immunity in the lung</a></h4>

              
                Trained immunity represents a recent concept that elucidates the long-term reprogramming of innate immune cells, enabling them to adapt and respond more effectively to subsequent encounters with diverse pathogens. Initially recognized through the Bacillus Calmette–Guérin vaccine, <i>Candida albicans</i> infection, and β-glucan administration, this phenomenon challenges the traditional view that immune memory is exclusive to the adaptive immune system. Trained immunity is characterized by epigenetic and metabolic modifications in innate immune cells that facilitate enhanced responses to infections through mechanisms like chromatin remodeling and altered gene expression. This review focuses on the implications of trained immunity within the lung environment, which is constantly exposed to a plethora of pathogens and environmental irritants. We discuss the roles of various immune cell types, including alveolar macrophages and dendritic cells, in mediating trained immunity and how these adaptations may influence pulmonary insults and disease. Furthermore, we highlight the potential for leveraging trained immunity to enhance vaccine efficacy and develop novel therapeutic strategies for immune-related lung conditions. As research progresses, understanding trained immunity in the lung could pave the way for innovative interventions that improve lung health and resilience against infections.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98843">Srs2 binding to proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and its sumoylation contribute to replication protein A (RPA) antagonism during the DNA damage response</a></h4>

              
                Activation of the DNA damage checkpoint upon genotoxin treatment induces a multitude of cellular changes to cope with genome stress. After prolonged genotoxin treatment, the checkpoint can be downregulated to allow cell cycle and growth resumption. In yeast, downregulation of the DNA damage checkpoint requires the Srs2 DNA helicase, which removes the ssDNA binding complex replication protein A (RPA) and the associated Mec1 checkpoint kinase from DNA, thus dampening Mec1-mediated checkpoint. However, it is unclear whether the ‘anti-checkpoint’ role of Srs2 is temporally and spatially regulated to allow timely checkpoint termination while preventing superfluous RPA removal. Here we address this question by examining regulatory elements of Srs2, such as its phosphorylation, sumoylation, and protein-interaction sites. Our genetic analyses and checkpoint level assessment suggest that the RPA countering role of Srs2 is promoted by Srs2 binding to proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), which recruits Srs2 to a subset of ssDNA containing regions. RPA antagonism is further fostered by Srs2 sumoylation, which we found depends on the Srs2-PCNA interaction and Mec1, and peaks after Mec1 activity reaches maximal levels. These data support a model in which Srs2 recruitment to PCNA adjacent to ssDNA-RPA filaments, followed by Mec1-dependent sumoylation, modulates RPA-mediated checkpoint signaling, while Srs2 action is limited at ssDNA regions lacking proximal PCNA, thereby favoring RPA-mediated ssDNA protection and repair.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/105430">Meteorins regulate the formation of the left-right organizer and the establishment of vertebrate body asymmetry</a></h4>

              
                While the exterior of vertebrate bodies appears bilaterally symmetrical, internal organ positioning and morphology frequently exhibit left-right (L-R) asymmetries. In several vertebrates, including human, mouse, frog, and zebrafish, left-right symmetry-breaking during embryonic development is initiated by a ciliated organ called the Node or left-right organizer. Within the Node, a leftward flow of extraembryonic fluid named the Nodal flow mediates the asymmetric expressions of Nodal factors. Although downstream Nodal pathway components leading to the establishment of the embryonic left-right axis are well known, less is known about the development and formation of the embryonic Node itself. Here, we reveal a novel role for the Meteorin protein family in the establishment of the left-right axis and in the formation of Kupffer’s vesicle, the Node equivalent structure in zebrafish. We show that the genetic inactivation of each or all three members of the zebrafish Meteorin family (<i>metrn</i>, <i>metrn-like a,</i> and <i>metrn-like b</i>) leads to defects in properties of the Kupffer’s vesicle, caused by impaired assembly and migration of the Kupffer’s vesicle forming dorsal forerunner cells. In addition, we demonstrate that Meteorins genetically interact with integrins ItgαV and Itgβ1b, regulating the dorsal forerunner cell clustering, and that <i>meteorins</i> loss-of-function results in disturbed Nodal factor expression and consequently in randomized or symmetric heart looping and jogging. These results identify a new role for the Meteorin protein family in the left-right asymmetry patterning during embryonic vertebrate development.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/105585">Loss of olfaction reduces caterpillar performance and increases susceptibility to a natural enemy</a></h4>

              
                Insect herbivores such as caterpillars are under strong selection pressure from natural enemies, especially parasitoid wasps. Although the role of olfaction in host-plant seeking has been investigated in great detail in parasitoids and adult lepidopterans, the caterpillar olfactory system and its significance in tri-trophic interactions remain poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the olfactory system of <i>Pieris brassicae</i> caterpillars and the importance of olfactory information in the interactions among this herbivore, its host-plant <i>Brassica oleracea</i>, and its primary natural enemy <i>Cotesia glomerata</i>. To examine the role of olfaction, we utilized CRISPR/Cas9 to knockout (KO) the odorant receptor co-receptor (<i>Orco</i>). This KO impaired olfactory detection and primary processing in the brain. <i>Orco</i> KO caterpillars exhibited reduced weight and lost preference for their optimal food plants. Interestingly, the KO caterpillars also experienced reduced weight when challenged by the parasitoid <i>C. glomerata</i> whose ovipositor had been removed, and the mortality of the KO caterpillars under the attack of unmanipulated parasitoids increased. We then investigated the behavior of <i>P. brassicae</i> caterpillars in response to volatiles from plants attacked by conspecific caterpillars and volatiles from plants on which the caterpillars were themselves attacked by <i>C. glomerata</i>. After analyzing the volatile compounds involved in these interactions, we concluded that olfactory information enables caterpillars to locate suitable food sources more efficiently as well as to select enemy-free spaces. Our results reveal the crucial role of olfaction in caterpillar feeding and natural-enemy avoidance, highlighting the significance of chemoreceptor genes in shaping ecological interactions.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/106657">Conserved and unique features of terminal telomeric sequences in ALT-positive cancer cells</a></h4>

              
                A significant portion of human cancers utilize a recombination-based pathway, alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT), to maintain telomere length. Targeting the ALT is of growing interest as a cancer therapy, yet a substantial knowledge gap remains regarding the basic features of telomeres in ALT-positive cells. To address this, we adopted END-seq, an unbiased sequencing-based approach, to define the identity and regulation of the terminal sequences of chromosomes in ALT cells. Our data reveal that the terminal portions of chromosomes in ALT cells contain canonical telomeric sequences with the same terminus bias (-ATC) observed in non-ALT cells. Furthermore, as reported for non-ALT cells, POT1 is required to preserve the precise regulation of the 5′ end in cells that maintain telomere length using the ALT pathway. Thus, the regulation of the terminal 5′ of chromosomes occurs independently of the mechanism of telomere elongation. Additionally, we employed an S1 endonuclease-based sequencing method to determine the presence and origin of single-stranded regions within ALT telomeres. These data shed light on conserved and unique features of ALT telomeres.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/105087">Interleukin-4 induces CD11c+ microglia leading to amelioration of neuropathic pain in mice</a></h4>

              
                Neuropathic pain, a debilitating chronic pain condition, is a major clinical challenge. The pleiotropic cytokine interleukin-4 (IL-4) has been shown to suppress neuropathic pain in rodent models, but its underlying mechanism remains unclear. Here, we show that intrathecal administration of IL-4 to mice with spinal nerve transection (SpNT) increased the number of CD11c<sup>+</sup> microglia (a microglia subset important for pain remission) in the spinal dorsal horn (SDH) and that this effect of IL-4 was essential for its ameliorating effect on SpNT-induced pain hypersensitivity. Furthermore, in mice with spared nerve injury (SNI), another model in which pain remission does not occur, the emergence of CD11c<sup>+</sup> SDH microglia was curtailed, but intrathecal IL-4 increased their emergence and ameliorated pain hypersensitivity in a CD11c<sup>+</sup> microglia-dependent manner. Our study reveals a mechanism by which intrathecal IL-4 ameliorates pain hypersensitivity after nerve injury and provides evidence that IL-4 increases CD11c<sup>+</sup> microglia with a function that ameliorates neuropathic pain.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/105955">Separable dorsal raphe dopamine projections mimic the facets of a loneliness-like state</a></h4>

              
                Affiliative social connections facilitate well-being and survival in numerous species. Engaging in social interactions requires positive or negative motivational drive, elicited through coordinated activity across neural circuits. However, the identity, interconnectivity, and functional encoding of social information within these circuits remains poorly understood. Here, we focus on downstream projections of dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) dopamine neurons (DRN<sup>DAT</sup>) in mice, which we previously implicated in social motivation alongside an aversive affective state. We show that three prominent DRN<sup>DAT</sup> projections – to the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), central amygdala (CeA), and posterior basolateral amygdala (BLP) – play separable roles in behavior, despite substantial collateralization. Photoactivation of the DRN<sup>DAT</sup>-CeA projection promoted social behavior and photostimulation of the DRN<sup>DAT</sup>-BNST projection promoted exploratory behavior, while the DRN<sup>DAT</sup>-BLP projection supported place avoidance, suggesting a negative affective state. Downstream regions showed diverse receptor expression, poising DRN<sup>DAT</sup> neurons to act through dopamine, neuropeptide, and glutamate transmission. Furthermore, we show ex vivo that the effect of DRN<sup>DAT</sup> photostimulation on downstream neuron excitability depended on region and baseline cell properties, resulting in excitatory responses in BNST cells and diverse responses in CeA and BLP. Finally, in vivo microendoscopic cellular-resolution recordings in the CeA with DRN<sup>DAT</sup> photostimulation revealed a correlation between social behavior and neurons excited by social stimuli, suggesting that increased dopamine tone may recruit different CeA neurons to social ensembles. Collectively, these circuit features may facilitate a coordinated, but flexible, response in the presence of social stimuli that can be flexibly guided based on the internal social homeostatic need state of the individual.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/105887">Phage-displayed synthetic library and screening platform for nanobody discovery</a></h4>

              
                Nanobodies, single-domain antibodies derived from camelid heavy-chain antibodies, are known for their high affinity, stability, and small size, which make them useful in biological research and therapeutic applications. However, traditional nanobody generation methods rely on camelid immunization, which can be costly and time-consuming, restricting their practical feasibility. In this study, we present a phage-displayed synthetic library for nanobody discovery. To validate this approach, we screened nanobodies targeting various <i>Drosophila</i> secreted proteins. The nanobodies identified were suitable for applications such as immunostaining and immunoblotting, supporting the phage-displayed synthetic library as a versatile platform for nanobody development. To address the challenge of limited accessibility to high-quality synthetic libraries, this library is openly available for non-profit use.

">Shank3 establishes AMPA receptor subunit composition at cerebellar mossy fiber-granule cell synapses and shapes regional microglia activation.</a></h4>

              
                Mutations in Shank3 are the primary genetic cause of Phelan-McDermid Syndrome (PMS), a neurodevelopmental disorder frequently comorbid with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). As a key scaffolding protein in the postsynaptic site, SHANK3 is critical for excitatory glutamatergic synapse function by interacting with AMPARs, NMDARs, and mGluRs. While Shank3 deficiency has been extensively studied in forebrain regions, its role in the cerebellum, a brain area increasingly implicated in ASD pathobiology, remains comparatively underexplored. Cerebellar granule cells (CGCs) exhibit high Shank3 expression. However, its role in cerebellar glutamatergic synapses is poorly understood. This study aims to investigate how Shank3 loss affects mossy fiber-CGC glutamatergic synaptic function. Whole-cell patch clamp electrophysiological recordings from CGCs in ex vivo cerebellar brain slices from adult (4-6 months old) wild type (WT) and homozygous Shank3{triangleup}ex4-22 KO were performed to record miniature, evoked, and glutamate uncaged responses. Similarly, the current-voltage (I-V) relationship was analyzed with intracellular spermine and pharmacological validation of calcium-permeable AMPARs (CP-AMPARs) was done by IEM-1460. Immunofluorescence staining was performed for microglia using IBA1 labeling. We found a significant increase in mEPSC amplitude and AMPAR-mediated response to glutamate uncaging, which indicates that the loss of Shank3 enhances postsynaptic AMPAR function. Furthermore, the KO group showed faster AMPAR decay kinetics, inward rectification, and increased sensitivity to IEM-1460, suggesting that a high proportion of CP-AMPARs with distinct biophysical properties are present at the MF-CGC synapse. Furthermore, KO mice showed less ramified microglia suggesting the possible presence of activated microglia in the cerebellar cortex. Together, these findings highlight a critical role of Shank3 in maintaining the balance between CP- and CI-AMPARs at the MF-CGC synapse, which is essential for synapse maturation and proper cerebellar circuitry function. Dysregulation of this balance, with possible presence of activated microglia in the cerebellum, may underscore cerebellar-related behavioral deficits in Shank3 KO mice and may suggest a potential mechanism contributing to ASD pathophysiology.

">CaNetiCs - An Open-Source Toolbox for Standardized Dimensionality Reduction of Neuronal Calcium Activity</a></h4>

              
                The widespread use of calcium imaging has produced large-scale datasets capturing neuronal population activity across diverse experimental contexts, posing challenges for analyzing complex, high-dimensional data. Dimensionality reduction (DR) methods have been pivotal in addressing these challenges by simplifying data into interpretable, low-dimensional structures, while capturing essential network dynamics. Among DR methods, Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) can produce biologically meaningful representations through its nonnegativity constraint and parts-based decomposition, making it especially suited for analyzing neuronal calcium signals. To enhance accessibility and standardization in the analysis of state-dependent neuronal dynamics, we introduce Calcium Network dynamiCs (CaNetiCs), an open-source toolbox centered on NMF, integrating standardized DR methods (PCA, ICA, UMAP), geometric low-dimensional component space analyses, and neuronal network simulation modules. We validate our toolbox by applying it to two diverse experimental datasets that describe responses to graded anesthesia: whole-ganglion cellular calcium imaging of C. elegans, and two-photon imaging of murine somatosensory cortex. Our analyses recapitulate previously observed trends, such as network suppression and decorrelation with anesthesia, while uncovering novel insights into neuronal activity under differing contexts. CaNetiCs provides an accessible, modular, and interpretable framework, facilitating broader adoption of standardized dimensionality reduction methodologies for deeper exploration of neuronal network dynamics across experimental paradigms. The open-source code, along with documentation, is available at https://github.com/dannycarbonero/CaNetiCs.

">Corrective sub-movements link feedback to feedforward control in the cerebellum</a></h4>

              
                The ability to execute accurate movements is thought to rely on both anticipatory feedforward commands and rapid feedback corrections, yet how these control systems are integrated within cerebellar circuits remains unclear. Here, we show that corrective sub-movements (CSMs) -- structured, feedback-driven adjustments occurring spontaneously during naturalistic mouse reaching -- are not only encoded in anterior interposed (IntA) output neurons, but also act as instructive signals for feedforward learning. Closed-loop perturbations that trigger CSMs lead to learned shifts in the timing of future corrections, even in the absence of further perturbation. Strikingly, this learning depends on the timing of corrective responses, rather than the timing of the error itself, and is accompanied by physiological adaptation in cerebellar output neuronal firing rates. These findings reveal a cerebellar mechanism by which feedback responses train future anticipatory control signals, bridging the gap between reactive and anticipatory motor control in the cerebellum.

">Transdiagnostic electrophysiological subtypes reveal brain-behavior dimensions in youth psychiatry</a></h4>

              
                Conventional psychiatric diagnoses often fail to reflect the underlying neurobiological and behavioral complexity of mental health conditions. Here, we propose a transdiagnostic, data-driven framework for stratifying youth based on large-scale multisite electroencephalography (EEG) data from 1,707 individuals aged 5-18 years, including healthy controls and individuals diagnosed with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), anxiety disorders (ANX), and learning disabilities (LD), along with their common comorbidities. By applying normative modeling to quantify individual deviations from typical brain functional maturation, and integrating multidimensional EEG features across spectral, temporal, complexity, and dynamical domains via similarity network fusion clustering, we identified three robust neurophysiological biotypes. These biotypes showed distinct electrophysiological and behavioral profiles, and captured meaningful brain-behavior relationships. Our findings suggest that biologically informed subtypes capture meaningful neuropsychiatric heterogeneity in youth, challenging conventional diagnostic boundaries in psychiatric nosology.

">Noninvasive detection of bacterial biofilms using an insect olfactory brain-based gas sensor</a></h4>

              
                Bacteria emit volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that can be targeted for disease detection. Biological olfactory systems have keen senses of smell, can detect VOCs at low concentrations, and are naturally adapted to classifying mixtures of VOCs as odors. Here, we employed locust (Schistocerca americana) olfactory neural circuitry to differentiate biofilm and planktonic cultures of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus using their odors. In vivo extracellular neural recordings were taken from the second-order olfactory processing center (antennal lobe) of locusts. The VOCs from biofilm cultures evoked distinct spiking responses compared to the planktonic cultures for both bacterial species. By analyzing the population neuronal responses, we classified individual bacterial biofilm vs. planktonic odors with up to 96% accuracy. The neural responses were highly discriminatory within the first couple of seconds of odor presentation and our analysis was conducted on less than five seconds of data, highlighting the potential of our biological sensor for real-time biofilm detection.

">GFAP Proteolysis in TBI: Linking Novel Modified Cleavage Products to Astrocyte Pathology and Patient Outcomes</a></h4>

              
                Monitoring patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) is essential for mitigating secondary complications. TBI disrupts proteostasis, leading to increased protein degradation and proteinopathy, which heighten the risk of neurodegeneration and underscore the need for early detection via noninvasive biomarkers. Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), an astroglial intermediate filament, is a well-established TBI biomarker, yet pathomechanisms and proteoforms of GFAP release are incompletely understood. This translational study defined the GFAP degradome in TBI through mass spectrometry (MS) sequencing of immunopurified GFAP breakdown products (BDPs) from patient biofluids. The TBI-GFAP fragments differed from those of Alzheimers and Alexander Diseases, revealing novel coil1/coil2-harboring cleavage products in TBI CSF, while TBI serum samples had only coil1-products. Trauma-specific citrullinations and acetylations were validated via MS spectra. Epitope mapping identified a novel trauma-specific cleavage site and revealed coil1-BDPs as selectively released into fluid, while coil2 fragments remained intracellular in a human trauma culture model. Citrullinated GFAP-specific antibodies exhibited distinct binding patterns from those of unmodified, native GFAP in TBI patients CSF and detected unique granular aggregates in dystrophic astrocytes without staining filamentous GFAP. TBI-GFAP fragments were produced by stepwise trauma-activated calpain and caspase activities shown by in vitro inhibitor studies. Live cell imaging with fluorescent protease reporters demonstrates coexisting calpain and caspase activities, along with membrane disruption jointly identifying distinct astrocyte injury states. The trajectory of GFAP proteolysis was analyzed in CSF samples from 24 TBI patients over 10PIDs, via calibrated, band-specific scaled immunoblot densitometry. These profiles covaried with patient age and body temperature. Full-length GFAP and 45-49kDa fragments peaked on injury day and declined over time, whereas calpain-generated 37-39kDa BDPs remained elevated. Small BDPs exhibited either delayed rises or remained undetected. Compared to the 20-26kDa BDPs, 15-19kDa products were notably underrepresented, consistent with coil1-BDPs preferred release and coil2-BDPs selective cellular retainment. Fluid levels of calpain-generated GFAP fragment were time and severity-dependent in the trauma culture model. TBI CSF trajectories of GFAP-BDPs differentiated TBI patients with poor versus those with good outcomes on the extended Glasgow Outcome scale (GOSE), whereas uncleaved GFAP trajectories failed in early prediction of patient outcome at six months. These findings define trauma-specific GFAP degradome dynamics and highlight novel longitudinal proteolysis profiles for patient monitoring and stratification. This work is significant as it supports GFAP fragment profiling for potential context of use (COU) in neurocritical care TBI monitoring, and offers preliminary insights into diagnosing astroglial proteinopathy-linked neurodegeneration after TBI.

">A sustained Hox program delineates brainstem neurons essential for breathing</a></h4>

              
                Respiratory neurons in the brainstem must diversify and acquire unique properties during development to enable breathing at birth. Dbx1-expressing progenitors give rise to functionally and molecularly distinct excitatory respiratory populations, including rhythm-generating pre-Botzinger complex (preBotC) neurons and phrenic motor neuron (MN)-projecting rostral Ventral Respiratory Group (rVRG) neurons. These neurons are organized rostrocaudally within the ventral respiratory column (VRC) but, despite their critical functions in breathing, the mechanisms that control their organization and diversification are not well understood. Here, we generate a novel genetic tool to label brainstem neurons within the VRC. We find that rVRG neurons selectively express Hox5 genes through postnatal stages. Selective deletion of all Hox5 paralogs from Dbx1-derived neurons leads to respiratory dysfunction, perinatal death, and changes in the pattern and amplitude of phrenic MN firing. We show that Hox5 inactivation leads to a caudal expansion of putative preBotC neurons, likely at the expense of the rVRG. Collectively, our findings indicate that Hox5 proteins are required for the delineation and functional specialization of excitatory brainstem neurons essential for breathing.

">Cortical α-synuclein pathology induces cell autonomous neuronal hypoactivity and compensatory circuit changes in a model of early Lewy Body Dementia</a></h4>

              
                Cognitive impairment is a common non-motor symptom of Parkinson's disease (PD) and a defining feature of Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB). Although many cognitive domains can be affected, impairments in visuospatial/perceptual function are relatively specific for PD and DLB compared to other dementias. Across populations, cognitive impairments correlate with the presence of -synuclein (-syn) pathology in limbic and neocortical brain regions. However, the specific role that -syn pathology plays in driving cortical circuit dysfunction and cognitive impairment remains controversial. We hypothesized that inducing -syn pathology in visual cortex in mice would impair neuronal activity and encoding of visual information, leading to visuoperceptual impairments. To test this hypothesis, we injected -syn pre-formed fibrils (PFF) into primary visual cortex (V1) to seed endogenous -syn pathology. Using longitudinal in vivo two-photon (2P) calcium imaging over 6 months, we recorded visually evoked activity of pyramidal cells in layer 2/3 (L2/3) and quantified -syn pathology using C05-05, a fluorescent ligand that binds aggregated -syn. Injection of PFFs led to the formation of sparse Lewy-like pathology in V1 and other anatomically connected regions. Measuring population activity, we found a greater percentage of neurons in PFF-injected mice were responsive to visual stimuli with lower direction selectivity compared to controls at 4-5 months post-injection (MPI). Within PFF-injected mice, neurons with large somatic Lewy-like inclusions had significantly lower visually evoked activity compared to neighboring neurons without inclusions. Conversely, the activity of neurons without somatic inclusions showed increased activity, positively correlated with the nearby burden of -syn pathology. Measuring visuoperceptual function using a head-fixed coherent motion discrimination task, we found no impairments in visuoperceptual ability in PFF-injected mice up to 6 MPI. Our results demonstrate, for the first time in vivo, that -syn pathology leads to cell autonomous reductions in neuronal activity and reciprocal changes in local population activity that may be compensatory, helping to preserve visuoperceptual function. Reflecting the early stages of neocortical -syn pathology, our model provides a framework for future studies incorporating risk factors for dementia in PD to better understand the heterogeneity of cognitive symptoms and -syn pathology across patients.

                <p>by Agastya Mondal, Rushil Anirudh, Prashanth Selvaraj</p>

Agent-based models of malaria transmission are useful tools for understanding disease dynamics and planning interventions, but they can be computationally intensive to calibrate. We present a multitask deep learning approach for emulating and calibrating a complex agent-based model of malaria transmission. Our neural network emulator was trained on a large suite of simulations from the EMOD malaria model, an agent-based model of malaria transmission dynamics, capturing relationships between immunological parameters and epidemiological outcomes such as age-stratified incidence and prevalence across eight sub-Saharan African study sites. We then use the trained emulator in conjunction with parameter estimation techniques to calibrate the underlying model to reference data. Taken together, this analysis shows the potential of machine learning-guided emulator design for complex scientific processes and their comparison to field data.

                <p>by Sofie Verhees, Chandrasekhar Venkataraman, Mariya Ptashnyk</p>

We derive and simulate a mathematical model for mechanotransduction related to the Rho GTPase signalling pathway. The model addresses the bidirectional coupling between signalling processes and cell mechanics. A numerical method based on bulk-surface finite elements is proposed for the approximation of the coupled system of nonlinear reaction-diffusion equations, defined inside the cell and on the cell membrane, and the equations of elasticity. Our simulation results illustrate novel emergent features such as the strong dependence of the dynamics on cell shape, a threshold-like response to changes in substrate stiffness, and the fact that coupling mechanics and signalling can lead to the robustness of cell deformation to larger changes in substrate stiffness, ensuring mechanical homeostasis in agreement with experiments.

We present q2-fmt, a QIIME 2 plugin that provides diverse methods for assessing the extent of microbiome engraftment following fecal microbiota transplant. The methods implemented here were informed by a recent literature review on approaches for assessing FMT engraftment, and cover aspects of engraftment including Community Coalescence, Indicator Features, and Resilience. q2-fmt is free for all use, and detailed documentation illustrating worked examples on a real-world data set are provided in the project’s documentation.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Among all upper extremity nerves, the ulnar nerve is both the most commonly injured and notoriously difficult to regenerate. Despite this, ulnar nerve injuries remain understudied. Nonhuman primates (NHPs) offer an ideal model for the human upper extremity, but existing NHP nerve trauma literature is biased towards median and radial injury models. To address this, a nonhuman primate ulnar nerve injury model was developed and regeneration assessed following sural nerve autografting using electrophysiological and histological techniques. Unilateral 4 cm ulnar nerve injuries were created at the mid-forearm level, sural nerve autografts were sutured into resulting defects (<i>n</i> = 3), and animals were survived for 6 months. At the terminal time point, intraoperative electrophysiological testing, tissue harvest, and tissue processing were performed. Naïve nerves (<i>n</i> = 5) served as controls. Animals appeared clinically normal throughout the study period, other than an expected decrease in fine hand muscle function. After 6 months, histological and electrophysiological evidence suggested that axons crossed the graft and reached distal muscle targets. However, regenerating nerves exhibited a reduced motor nerve conduction velocity, reduced compound action muscle potential (CMAP) amplitude and area under the curve, increased latency, and increased duration versus naïve controls as expected. Histological analysis revealed reduced axon diameters, thinner myelin sheaths, and smaller muscle fiber cross-sectional areas as compared to controls. At 6 months post-injury, 4 cm ulnar defects bridged with sural autografts show signs of ongoing regeneration and nascent reinnervation. Specific electrophysiological and histological benchmarks for ulnar nerve recovery following clinically relevant autografting are presented.</p>

                In the brain, maintaining the appropriate levels of excitation and inhibition is required for proper cognitive function. Inhibitory neurons, essential for maintaining this balance and implicated in various neurodevelopmental diseases, are generated during embryonic development from the ganglionic eminences (GEs). This review discusses the importance of inhibitory neuronal subtypes generated from the most posterior GE subregion, the caudal ganglionic eminence (CGE), highlighting what is known about their developmental origins, diversity, and functions in mice, humans, and non-human primates. By reviewing the molecular composition and patterning of the CGE, we discuss how technological advances have provided insights into the spatial heterogeneity of progenitor populations and the distinctive molecular characteristics and functions of CGE-derived neurons.

                Fabiano et al. show that extracellular vesicle (EV)-associated GAS6/PROS1 trigger inhibitory TAM receptors in macrophages, whereas adenosine generated by EV-associated CD39/CD73 inhibits neutrophil respiratory burst. Hence, the authors propose that plasma EVs are homeostatic regulators of innate immune responses, favoring inflammation resolution.

                Acosta et al. find that ADP-ribosylation of the lipoic acid carrier protein GcvH-L promotes Staphylococcus aureus resistance to oxidative burst and facilitates infection. ADP-ribosylation leads to a structural shift within GcvH-L that safeguards lipoic acid sulfhydryls from detrimental oxidation and regulates its transfer to enzyme complexes required for growth.
