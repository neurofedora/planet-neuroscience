              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Preexisting memory CD4 T cells in naïve individuals confer robust immunity upon hepatitis B vaccination</a></h4>

              
                Antigen recognition through the T cell receptor (TCR) αβ heterodimer is one of the primary determinants of the adaptive immune response. Vaccines activate naïve T cells with high specificity to expand and differentiate into memory T cells. However, antigen-specific memory CD4 T cells exist in unexposed antigen-naïve hosts. In this study, we use high-throughput sequencing of memory CD4 TCRβ repertoire and machine learning to show that individuals with preexisting vaccine-reactive memory CD4 T cell clonotypes elicited earlier and higher antibody titers and mounted a more robust CD4 T cell response to hepatitis B vaccine. In addition, integration of TCRβ sequence patterns into a hepatitis B epitope-specific annotation model can predict which individuals will have an early and more vigorous vaccine-elicited immunity. Thus, the presence of preexisting memory T cell clonotypes has a significant impact on immunity and can be used to predict immune responses to vaccination.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A low-tech, cost-effective and efficient method for safeguarding genetic diversity by direct cryopreservation of poultry embryonic reproductive cells</a></h4>

              
                Chickens are an important resource for smallholder farmers who raise locally adapted, genetically distinct breeds for eggs and meat. The development of efficient reproductive technologies to conserve and regenerate chicken breeds safeguards existing biodiversity and secures poultry genetic resources for climate resilience, biosecurity, and future food production. The majority of the over 1600 breeds of chicken are raised in low and lower to middle income countries under resource-limited, small-scale production systems, which necessitates a low-tech, cost-effective means of conserving diversity is needed. Here, we validate a simple biobanking technique using cryopreserved embryonic chicken gonads. The gonads are quickly isolated, visually sexed, pooled by sex, and cryopreserved. Subsequently, the stored material is thawed and dissociated before injection into sterile host chicken embryos. By using pooled GFP and RFP-labelled donor gonadal cells and Sire Dam Surrogate mating, we demonstrate that chicks deriving entirely from male and female donor germ cells are hatched. This technology will enable ongoing efforts to conserve chicken genetic diversity for both commercial and smallholder farmers, and to preserve existing genetic resources at poultry research facilities.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10969861/most-recent">Exploring links FROM sensory perception TO MOVEMENT and behavioral motivation in the Caudal nidopallium of female songbirds</a></h4>

              
                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Decision making resides at the interface between sensory perception and movement production. Female songbirds in the context of mate choice are an excellent system to define neural circuits through which sensory perception influences production of courtship behaviors. Previous experiments by our group and others have implicated secondary auditory brain sites, including the caudal nidopallium (NC), in mediating behavioral indicators of mate choice. Here, we used anterograde tracer molecules to define projections that emerge from NC in female songbirds, identifying pathways through which NC influences downstream sites implicated in signal processing and decision making. Our results reveal that NC sends projections into the arcopallium, including the ventral intermediate arcopallium (AIV). Previous work revealed that AIV also receives input from another auditory area implicated in song preference and mate choice (caudal mesopallium, CM), suggesting that convergent input from multiple auditory areas may play important roles in initiating mate choice behaviors. In the present results, NC projects to an area implicated in postural and locomotory control (dorsal arcopallium, Ad), suggesting that NC may play a role in directing those forms of copulatory behavior. NC projections also systematically avoid a vocal motor region of the arcopallium that is innervated by CM (robust nucleus of the arcopallium, RA). These results suggest a model in which both NC and CM project to arcopallial pathways implicated in behavioral motivation. These brain regions may exert different influences on pathways through which auditory information can direct different facets of behavioral responses to information detected in those auditory signals.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">The Impact of Eye Closure on Anticipatory {alpha} Activity in a Tactile Discrimination Task</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>One of the very first observations made regarding &alpha; oscillations (8&ndash;14 Hz), is that they increase in power over posterior areas when awake participants close their eyes. Recent work, especially in the context of (spatial) attention, suggests that &alpha; activity reflects a mechanism of functional inhibition. However, it remains unclear how eye closure impacts anticipatory &alpha; modulation observed in attention paradigms, and how this affects subsequent behavioral performance. Here, we recorded magnetoencephalography (MEG) in 33 human participants performing a tactile discrimination task with their eyes open versus closed. We replicated the hallmarks of previous somatosensory spatial attention studies: &alpha; lateralization across the somatosensory cortices as well as &alpha; increase over posterior (visual) regions. Furthermore, we found that eye closure leads to (1) reduced task performance; (2) widespread increase in &alpha; power; and (3) reduced anticipatory visual &alpha; modulation (4) with no effect on somatosensory &alpha; lateralization. Regardless of whether participants had their eyes open or closed, increased visual &alpha; power and somatosensory &alpha; lateralization improved their performance. Thus, we provide evidence that eye closure does not alter the impact of anticipatory &alpha; modulations on behavioral performance. We propose there is an optimal visual &alpha; level for somatosensory task performance, which can be achieved through a combination of eye closure and top-down anticipatory attention.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The influence of extrovert and introvert personality types on the acceptance of virtual learning during the COVID-19 pandemic: a survey [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, all courses taught in Malaysian schools and universities were conducted entirely virtually, after a movement control order was imposed in Malaysian on 18th March 2020. According to the research by Offir et al., (2007), extroversion-introversion (E-I) personalities have been shown to influence students’ involvement in class, their learning style and their understanding of the course materials. The purpose of this research was to explore how extrovert and introvert personality traits influence the acceptance of virtual learning amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A case study was conducted, focusing on a group of students taught by one of the researchers in our research team, HR. A total of 31 Diploma students (13 first year students and 18 second year students) taking Grooming and Professional Etiquette  at  Multimedia University, Malaysia (MMU) participated in the study. Open-ended questions were used to learn about the personality of each participant, as well as to provide a better understanding on how the opposing personas differs in their experiences with virtual learning. Results: Our results showed that 54.83% (17) of the students were introverts, 29.03 % (9) were extroverts, and 16.1% (5) were private-public-introvert-extroverts (PPIEs). The results for the acceptance level of virtual learning varied based on the different personality types. Results showed the extroverts expressed that the virtual learning experience was unpleasant, while the introverts and the PPIEs found virtual learning a useful and pleasant experience. Conclusion: This study was mainly descriptive, with open-ended questions used to gain insight on how different personality types differ in their acceptance of fully virtual learning. In future studies, inferential analysis could be carried out to test the hypotheses and assumptions. Future studies could also compare and contrast both students and lecturers’ acceptance of, and engagement in, online learning during the COVID-19 pandemic.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>This study was undertaken to follow up predictive factors for α-synuclein–related neurodegenerative diseases in a multicenter cohort of idiopathic/isolated rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (iRBD).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Patients with iRBD from 12 centers underwent a detailed assessment for potential environmental and lifestyle risk factors via a standardized questionnaire at baseline. Patients were then prospectively followed and received assessments for parkinsonism or dementia during follow-up. The cumulative incidence of parkinsonism or dementia was estimated with competing risk analysis. Cox regression analyses were used to evaluate the predictive value of environmental/lifestyle factors over a follow-up period of 11 years, adjusting for age, sex, and center.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Of 319 patients who were free of parkinsonism or dementia, 281 provided follow-up information. After a mean follow-up of 5.8 years, 130 (46.3%) patients developed neurodegenerative disease. The overall phenoconversion rate was 24.2% after 3 years, 44.8% after 6 years, and 67.5% after 10 years. Patients with older age (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] = 1.05) and nitrate derivative use (aHR = 2.18) were more likely to phenoconvert, whereas prior pesticide exposure (aHR = 0.21–0.64), rural living (aHR = 0.53), lipid-lowering medication use (aHR = 0.59), and respiratory medication use (aHR = 0.36) were associated with lower phenoconversion risk. Risk factors for those converting to primary dementia and parkinsonism were generally similar, with dementia-first converters having lower coffee intake and beta-blocker intake, and higher occurrence of family history of dementia.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our findings elucidate the predictive values of environmental factors and comorbid conditions in identifying RBD patients at higher risk of phenoconversion. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Dynamic inference of cell developmental complex energy landscape from time series single-cell transcriptomic data</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Qi Jiang, Shuo Zhang, Lin Wan</p>

Time series single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data are emerging. However, dynamic inference of an evolving cell population from time series scRNA-seq data is challenging owing to the stochasticity and nonlinearity of the underlying biological processes. This calls for the development of mathematical models and methods capable of reconstructing cellular dynamic transition processes and uncovering the nonlinear cell-cell interactions. In this study, we present GraphFP, a nonlinear Fokker-Planck equation on graph based model and dynamic inference framework, with the aim of reconstructing the cell state-transition complex potential energy landscape from time series single-cell transcriptomic data. The free energy of our model explicitly takes into account of the cell-cell interactions in a nonlinear quadratic term. We then recast the model inference problem in the form of a dynamic optimal transport framework and solve it efficiently with the adjoint method of optimal control. We evaluated GraphFP on the time series scRNA-seq data set of embryonic murine cerebral cortex development. We illustrated that it 1) reconstructs cell state potential energy, which is a measure of cellular differentiation potency, 2) faithfully charts the probability flows between paired cell states over the dynamic processes of cell differentiation, and 3) accurately quantifies the stochastic dynamics of cell type frequencies on probability simplex in continuous time. We also illustrated that GraphFP is robust in terms of cluster labelling with different resolutions, as well as parameter choices. Meanwhile, GraphFP provides a model-based approach to delineate the cell-cell interactions that drive cell differentiation. GraphFP software is available at https://github.com/QiJiang-QJ/GraphFP.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">The structural coverage of the human proteome before and after AlphaFold</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Eduard Porta-Pardo, Victoria Ruiz-Serra, Samuel Valentini, Alfonso Valencia</p>

The protein structure field is experiencing a revolution. From the increased throughput of techniques to determine experimental structures, to developments such as cryo-EM that allow us to find the structures of large protein complexes or, more recently, the development of artificial intelligence tools, such as AlphaFold, that can predict with high accuracy the folding of proteins for which the availability of homology templates is limited. Here we quantify the effect of the recently released AlphaFold database of protein structural models in our knowledge on human proteins. Our results indicate that our current baseline for structural coverage of 48%, considering experimentally-derived or template-based homology models, elevates up to 76% when including AlphaFold predictions. At the same time the fraction of dark proteome is reduced from 26% to just 10% when AlphaFold models are considered. Furthermore, although the coverage of disease-associated genes and mutations was near complete before AlphaFold release (69% of Clinvar pathogenic mutations and 88% of oncogenic mutations), AlphaFold models still provide an additional coverage of 3% to 13% of these critically important sets of biomedical genes and mutations. Finally, we show how the contribution of AlphaFold models to the structural coverage of non-human organisms, including important pathogenic bacteria, is significantly larger than that of the human proteome. Overall, our results show that the sequence-structure gap of human proteins has almost disappeared, an outstanding success of direct consequences for the knowledge on the human genome and the derived medical applications.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Foraging as sampling without replacement: A Bayesian statistical model for estimating biases in target selection</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Alasdair D. F. Clarke, Amelia R. Hunt, Anna E. Hughes</p>

Foraging entails finding multiple targets sequentially. In humans and other animals, a key observation has been a tendency to forage in ‘runs’ of the same target type. This tendency is context-sensitive, and in humans, it is strongest when the targets are difficult to distinguish from the distractors. Many important questions have yet to be addressed about this and other tendencies in human foraging, and a key limitation is a lack of precise measures of foraging behaviour. The standard measures tend to be run statistics, such as the maximum run length and the number of runs. But these measures are not only interdependent, they are also constrained by the number and distribution of targets, making it difficult to make inferences about the effects of these aspects of the environment on foraging. Moreover, run statistics are underspecified about the underlying cognitive processes determining foraging behaviour. We present an alternative approach: modelling foraging as a procedure of generative sampling without replacement, implemented in a Bayesian multilevel model. This allows us to break behaviour down into a number of biases that influence target selection, such as the proximity of targets and a bias for selecting targets in runs, in a way that is not dependent on the number of targets present. Our method thereby facilitates direct comparison of specific foraging tendencies between search environments that differ in theoretically important dimensions. We demonstrate the use of our model with simulation examples and re-analysis of existing data. We believe our model will provide deeper insights into visual foraging and provide a foundation for further modelling work in this area.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Polypolish: Short-read polishing of long-read bacterial genome assemblies</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Ryan R. Wick, Kathryn E. Holt</p>

Long-read-only bacterial genome assemblies usually contain residual errors, most commonly homopolymer-length errors. Short-read polishing tools can use short reads to fix these errors, but most rely on short-read alignment which is unreliable in repeat regions. Errors in such regions are therefore challenging to fix and often remain after short-read polishing. Here we introduce Polypolish, a new short-read polisher which uses all-per-read alignments to repair errors in repeat sequences that other polishers cannot. Polypolish performed well in benchmarking tests using both simulated and real reads, and it almost never introduced errors during polishing. The best results were achieved by using Polypolish in combination with other short-read polishers.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">McComedy: A user-friendly tool for next-generation individual-based modeling of microbial consumer-resource systems</a></h4>

              
                <p>by André Bogdanowski, Karin Frank, Thomas Banitz, Linea Katharina Muhsal, Christian Kost</p>

Individual-based modeling is widely applied to investigate the ecological mechanisms driving microbial community dynamics. In such models, the population or community dynamics emerge from the behavior and interplay of individual entities, which are simulated according to a predefined set of rules. If the rules that govern the behavior of individuals are based on generic and mechanistically sound principles, the models are referred to as next-generation individual-based models. These models perform particularly well in recapitulating actual ecological dynamics. However, implementation of such models is time-consuming and requires proficiency in programming or in using specific software, which likely hinders a broader application of this powerful method. Here we present <i>McComedy</i>, a modeling tool designed to facilitate the development of next-generation individual-based models of microbial consumer-resource systems. This tool allows flexibly combining pre-implemented building blocks that represent physical and biological processes. The ability of <i>McComedy</i> to capture the essential dynamics of microbial consumer-resource systems is demonstrated by reproducing and furthermore adding to the results of two distinct studies from the literature. With this article, we provide a versatile tool for developing next-generation individual-based models that can foster understanding of microbial ecology in both research and education.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Efficient ReML inference in variance component mixed models using a Min-Max algorithm</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Fabien Laporte, Alain Charcosset, Tristan Mary-Huard</p>

Since their introduction in the 50’s, variance component mixed models have been widely used in many application fields. In this context, ReML estimation is by far the most popular procedure to infer the variance components of the model. Although many implementations of the ReML procedure are readily available, there is still need for computational improvements due to the ever-increasing size of the datasets to be handled, and to the complexity of the models to be adjusted. In this paper, we present a Min-Max (MM) algorithm for ReML inference and combine it with several speed-up procedures. The ReML MM algorithm we present is compared to 5 state-of-the-art publicly available algorithms used in statistical genetics. The computational performance of the different algorithms are evaluated on several datasets representing different plant breeding experimental designs. The MM algorithm ranks among the top 2 methods in almost all settings and is more versatile than many of its competitors. The MM algorithm is a promising alternative to the classical AI-ReML algorithm in the context of variance component mixed models. It is available in the MM4LMM R-package.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Endogenously produced catecholamines improve the regulatory function of TLR9-activated B cells</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Nadine Honke, Torsten Lowin, Birgit Opgenoorth, Namir Shaabani, Alexander Lautwein, John R. Teijaro, Matthias Schneider, Georg Pongratz</p>

The sympathetic nervous system (SNS) contributes to immune balance by promoting anti-inflammatory B cells. However, whether B cells possess a self-regulating mechanism by which they modulate regulatory B cell (Breg) function is not well understood. In this study, we investigated the ability of B cells to synthesize their own catecholamines upon stimulation with different B cell activators and found that expression of the enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), required to generate catecholamines, is up-regulated by Toll-like receptor (TLR)9. This TLR9-dependent expression of TH correlated with up-regulation of adrenergic receptors (ADRs), enhanced interleukin (IL)-10 production, and overexpression of the co-inhibitory ligands programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) and Fas ligand (FasL). Moreover, concomitant stimulation of ß1-3-ADRs together with a B cell receptor (BCR)/TLR9 stimulus clearly enhances the anti-inflammatory potential of Bregs to suppress CD4 T cells, a crucial population in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases, like rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Furthermore, TH up-regulation was also demonstrated in B cells during the course of collagen-induced arthritis (CIA), a mouse model for the investigation of RA. In conclusion, our data show that B cells possess an autonomous mechanism to modulate their regulatory function in an autocrine and/or paracrine manner. These findings help to better understand the function of B cells in the regulation of autoimmune diseases and the interplay of SNS.

                Background: Osteoporosis has been related to a negative impact on several aspects of patient health, including physical, mental, and emotional well-being. The objective of this study was to examine the effects of pulsed electromagnetic fields (PEMF) and pulsed Nd-YAG laser therapy (HILT) on men with osteopenia or osteoporosis.   Methods: Ninety-five men with osteopenia or osteoporosis (mean age, 52 years; mean height, 176 cm; mean weight, 83 kg; mean body-mass index (BMI), 26.86 kg/m2) took part in the study, and they were randomly assigned to one of three groups: Group 1 received PEMF and exercise program (PEMF +EX), Group 2 received HILT and exercise program (HILT+EX), and Group 3 received exercise program only (EX). PEMF was applied three times per week for 12 weeks using a full-body mat, while HILT was applied to the lower back and hip regions with a total dose of energy of 3000 J delivered in two treatment stages. Flexibility, aerobic exercise, strength, weight-bearing, and balance exercises are included in exercise program, which is followed by whole-body vibration training. Bone mineral density (BMD) of the total hip and lumbar spine, bone markers, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), and fall risk are all outcome measures. Results: There were no significant differences in the parameters between the groups at the baseline (P > 0.05). Patients in all groups, however, showed significant improvements in all measured parameters following treatment (P< 0.05), with Group 1 and Group 2 showing much greater improvements than Group 3. Conclusion: After 12-weeks of treatment, PEMF combined with exercise is more effective than HILT combined with exercise or exercise alone in increasing BMD and promoting bone formation, suppressing bone-resorption markers, and improving quality of life and fall risk, with the effects lasting up to six months. This study was registered in the ClinicalTrial.gov PRS (NCT05029440, 26/08/2021).

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Cardiac arrest (CA) is a major health burden with brain damage being a significant contributor to mortality. We found lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), including a species containing docosahexaenoic acid (LPC-DHA), was significantly decreased in plasma post-CA, supplementation of which significantly improved neurological outcomes. The aim of this study is to understand the protective role of LPC-DHA supplementation on the brain post-CA.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We first evaluated associations between the plasma level of LPC-DHA and neurological injury and outcomes of human patients with CA. We then utilized a rat CA model and cell cultures to investigate therapeutic and mechanistic aspects of plasma LPC-DHA supplementation.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We found that decreased plasma LPC-DHA was strongly associated with neurological outcomes and disappearance of the difference between gray and white matter in the brain after CA in human patients. In rats, the decreased plasma LPC-DHA was associated with decreased levels of brain LPC-DHA after CA, and supplementing plasma LPC-DHA normalized brain levels of LPC-DHA and alleviated neuronal cell death, activation of astrocytes, and expression of various inflammatory and mitochondrial dynamics genes. We also observed deceased severity of metabolic alterations with LPC-DHA supplementation using untargeted metabolomics analysis. Furthermore, LPC treatment showed a similar protective effect for neurons and astrocytes in mixed primary brain cell cultures.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The observed neuroprotection accompanied with normalized brain LPC-DHA level by plasma supplementation implicate the importance of preventing the decrease of brain LPC-DHA post-CA for attenuating brain injury. Furthermore, the data supports the causative role of decreased plasma LPC-DHA for brain damage after CA. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Restoring anti-JC virus (JCV) immunity is the only treatment of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). Interleukin-7 is a cytokine that increases number and function of T cells. We analyzed a population of PML patients who received recombinant human IL-7 (rhIL-7) to estimate survival and its determinants.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>After exclusion of patients with missing data or receiving other immunotherapies, findings from 64 patients with proven PML who received rhIL-7 between 2007 and 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. Logistic regression was used to analyze variables associated with one-year survival.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Underlying conditions were HIV/AIDS (n = 27, 42%), hematological malignancies (n = 16, 25%), primary immunodeficiencies (n = 13, 20%), solid organ transplantation (n = 4, 6%) and chronic inflammatory diseases (n = 4, 6%). One-year survival was 54.7% and did not differ by underlying condition. Survival was not associated with baseline characteristics, but with a &gt; 50% increase in blood lymphocytes (OR 4.1, 95%CI 1.2–14.9) and CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (OR 5.9, 95%CI 1.7–23.3), and a &gt; 1 log copies/mL decrease in cerebrospinal fluid JCV DNA (OR 7.6, 95%CI 1.6–56.1) during the first month after rhIL-7 initiation. Side effects were mainly local and flu-like symptoms (n = 8, 12.5%) and PML-immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) (n = 5, 8%).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>In this non-controlled retrospective study, survival did not differ from that expected in HIV/AIDS patients, but might have been improved in those with hematological malignancies, primary immunodeficiencies and transplant recipients. RhIL-7 might have contributed to the increase in blood lymphocytes and decrease of CSF JCV replication that were associated with better survival.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Estimating the sample size of sham-controlled randomized controlled trials using existing evidence [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: In randomized controlled trials (RCTs), the power is often ‘reverse engineered’ based on the number of participants that can realistically be achieved. An attractive alternative is planning a new trial conditional on the available evidence; a design of particular interest in RCTs that use a sham control arm (sham-RCTs). Methods: We explore the design of sham-RCTs, the role of sequential meta-analysis and  conditional planning in a systematic review of renal sympathetic denervation for patients with arterial hypertension. The main efficacy endpoint was mean change in 24-hour systolic blood pressure. We performed sequential meta-analysis to identify the time point where the null hypothesis would be rejected in a prospective scenario. Evidence-based conditional sample size calculations were performed based on fixed-effect meta-analysis. Results: In total, six sham-RCTs (981 participants) were identified. The first RCT was considerably larger (535 participants) than those subsequently published (median sample size of 80). All trial sample sizes were calculated assuming an unrealistically large intervention effect which resulted in low power when each study is considered as a stand-alone experiment. Sequential meta-analysis provided firm evidence against the null hypothesis with the synthesis of the first four trials (755 patients, cumulative mean difference -2.75 (95%CI -4.93 to -0.58) favoring the active intervention)). Conditional planning resulted in much larger sample sizes compared to those in the original trials, due to overoptimistic expected effects made by the investigators in individual trials, and potentially a time-effect association. Conclusions: Sequential meta-analysis of sham-RCTs can reach conclusive findings earlier and hence avoid exposing patients to sham-related risks. Conditional planning of new sham-RCTs poses important challenges as many surgical/minimally invasive procedures improve over time, the intervention effect is expected to increase in new studies and this violates the underlying assumptions. Unless this is accounted for, conditional planning will not improve the design of sham-RCTs.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Assessment of the knowledge, attitudes and practices of Lebanese shoppers towards food labeling: The first steps in the Nutri-score roadmap [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Food labeling is a fundamental educational tool for advocating for public awareness. It emphasizes knowledge of the nutrient content of food and thus directs the choice towards the healthiest food products. This cross-sectional survey aimed to assess the knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) regarding nutrition label use in Lebanon through a valid questionnaire. Methods: Overall, 768 participants (mean age: 30.8 ±12, males: 60.2%) were recruited randomly between February and May 2020. We used word of mouth and social media to recruit our sample population. Results: Social media was the most accessed tool to attain nutrition information by responders (39.8%). More than half the participants expressed positive attitudes to check information related to sugars (66.4%), vitamins (64.9%), total fats (61.7%), proteins (59.1%), and calories (58.7%) on the food label. Expiry date, price, and brand name were the top three considerations while reading food labels. About half (46.5%) reported to “always” look at the food label. Responders reported reading labels related primarily to sugars (44.3%), calories (38.8%), and total fats (36.8%). The optimal total KAP score was 46; our findings revealed a mean KAP score of 14.46 ±7 (31.4%). When categorizing the KAP scores, 15% had high scores, and 85% scored low. Spearman’s coefficients showed positive correlations between knowledge-attitude, knowledge-practice, and attitude-practice scores, with p<0.001. The regression analysis revealed that gender, age, BMI, residency area, educational level, university degree, health and diet statuses, and activity level were significant predictors of the KAP score. Being on a diet had the highest odds (OR=3.107, CI=1.904-5.072, p<0.001). Conclusion: The low awareness of food labels leads Lebanese people to choose unhealthy food options. A planned educational program is recommended to ease the interpretation of these labels.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Parametric modelling of rainfall return periods in south-western Nigeria: Survival analysis approach [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Rainfall is the main source of water on the earth’s surface. It infiltrates and percolates deep into the soil for groundwater recharge. Rainfall patterns, amounts, durations, and intensities can vary daily, monthly, annually, and spatially. It is therefore important to accurately estimate rainfall return periods, which can be employed in hydraulic design and flood control measures. Methods: This research considered the survival analysis approach for the prediction of rainfall return periods including intensity, and months during which these would occur in south-western Nigeria. Twenty years’ of annual rainfall data were obtained from three metrological stations and these were subjected to nine different probability plotting position methods.  Results from the plotting positions was further subjected to four  survival models using five years of censor time. The Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) was used to determine the best-fitting model for the dataset. Results: The Laplace probability plotting position in conjunction with the log-logistic distribution best describes the datasets, since it gave the lowest AIC value of 22.53. The log-logistic distribution is also suitable for the prediction of return period from the Weibull probability plotting position since the AIC values were 6.934 and -4.332 respectively.  The Hirsh plotting position in conjunction with the Weibull distribution is also suitable for the description of the dataset. Conclusion: The established parametric models are suitable for the accurate prediction of return periods of peak rainfall events during any month of the year.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Dataset of the adoption of digital tools for research sharing among academics in African Varsities during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                This dataset was collected from a total of 1,977 university lecturers across 24 African countries, that were purposively targeted due to their level of exposure to scholarly publications. The dataset was collected through an online survey that was sent to respondents through email, WhatsApp, and the Association of African Universities Telegram group. The questionnaire was designed by the researchers and validated by five experts for face and content validity. The demographic information of the data was analysed and the softcopy of the data uploaded to the Mendeley database for easy retrieval after deidentification (see Data Availability statement). The associated questionnaire can be found in the extended data. In Africa, this appears to be the broadest dataset associated with academics’ perception of utilizing digital platforms for research sharing. This implies that scholars can use this dataset to quantitatively analyse the extent to which different internet-based platforms are being utilized for research communication. Considering the current restrictions on in-person social gatherings due to COVID-19, researchers working on related studies may readily utilize this set of data, saving time and cost. A comprehensive but non-exhaustive number of 20 online platforms were assessed based on academics' awareness and current engagement with them, and the challenges they have faced using them. This offers a wide range of areas for studies to be anchored. Furthermore, researchers interested in specific online platforms can also evaluate the extent to which academic staff in African universities are aware of and willing to utilize them for research dissemination. This data will enable scholars and researchers in Africa and beyond to understand the extent to which academics in varsities are willing to adopt digital repositories for research sharing in the context of Africa.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The purpose of this study was to explore the longitudinal relationship between multiple sclerosis (MS) relapses and information processing efficiency among persons with relapsing–remitting MS.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We conducted a Swedish nationwide cohort study of persons with incident relapsing–remitting MS (2001–2019). Relapse information and symbol digit modalities test (SDMT) scores were obtained from the Swedish MS Registry. Follow-up was categorized into 2 periods based on relapse status: “relapse” (90 days pre-relapse to 730 days post-relapse, subdivided into 10 periods) and “remission.” Linear mixed models compared SDMT scores during the relapse periods to SDMT scores recorded during remission (reference) with results reported as β-coefficients and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), adjusted for age, sex, SDMT type (written vs oral), time-varying, disease-modifying therapy exposure and sequence of SDMT.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Over a mean (SD) follow-up of 10.7 (4.3) years, 31,529 distinct SDMTs were recorded among 3,877 persons with MS. There was a significant decline in information processing efficiency that lasted from 30 days pre-relapse up to 550 days post-relapse, with the largest decline occurring 0 to 30 days post-relapse (β-coefficient: −4.00 (95% CI = −4.61 to −3.39), relative to the period of remission.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>We found evidence of cognitive change up to 1 month prior to relapse onset. The reduction in SDMT lasted 1.5 years and was clinically significant up to 3 months post-relapse. These results suggest that the effects of a relapse on cognition are longer than previously thought and highlight the importance of reducing relapse rates as a potential means of preserving cognitive function.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Cortical correlates of gait compensation strategies in Parkinson's disease</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Gait impairment in persons with Parkinson's disease is common and debilitating. Compensation strategies (e.g. external cues) are an essential part of rehabilitation, but their underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Using EEG, we explored the cortical correlates of three categories of strategies: external cueing, internal cueing, and action observation.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Eighteen participants with Parkinson's disease and gait impairment were included. We recorded 126-channel EEG both during stance and gait on a treadmill under four conditions: (1) uncued; (2) external cueing (listening to a metronome); (3) internal cueing (silent rhythmic counting); and (4) action observation (observing another person walking). To control for the effects of sensory processing of the cues, we computed relative power changes as the difference in power spectral density between walking and standing for each condition.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Relative to uncued gait, the use of all three compensation strategies induced a decrease of beta band activity in sensorimotor areas, indicative of increased cortical activation. Parieto-occipital alpha band activity decreased with external and internal cueing, and increased with action observation. Only internal cueing induced a change in frontal cortical activation, showing a decrease of beta band activity compared to uncued gait.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The application of compensation strategies resulted in changed cortical activity compared to uncued gait, which could not be solely attributed to sensory processing of the cueing modality. Our findings suggest there are multiple routes to control gait, and different compensation strategies seem to rely on different cortical mechanisms to achieve enhanced central motor activation in persons with Parkinson's disease.</p>

                The in vivo impact of non-nAb on SARS-CoV-2 infection is unclear. Here, Beaudoin-Bussières et al. show that Fc-enhanced version of non-nAb CV3-13, delays SARS-CoV-2 spread and death in mice. Fc-enhanced CV3-13 combined with a Fc-compromised nAb synergizes to protect mice revealing the importance of non-nAb during SARS-CoV-2 infection.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Sensing complementary temporal features of odor signals enhances navigation of diverse turbulent plumes</a></h4>

              
                We and others have shown that during odor plume navigation, walking <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> bias their motion upwind in response to both the frequency of their encounters with the odor (Demir et al., 2020), and the intermittency of the odor signal, which we define to be the fraction of time the signal is above a detection threshold (Alvarez-Salvado et al., 2018). Here we combine and simplify previous mathematical models that recapitulated these data to investigate the benefits of sensing both of these temporal features, and how these benefits depend on the spatiotemporal statistics of the odor plume. Through agent-based simulations, we find that navigators that only use frequency or intermittency perform well in some environments - achieving maximal performance when gains are near those inferred from experiment - but fail in others. Robust performance across diverse environments requires both temporal modalities. However, we also find a steep tradeoff when using both sensors simultaneously, suggesting a strong benefit to modulating how much each sensor is weighted, rather than using both in a fixed combination across plumes. Finally, we show that the circuitry of the <i>Drosophila </i>olfactory periphery naturally enables simultaneous intermittency and frequency sensing, enhancing robust navigation through a diversity of odor environments. Together, our results suggest that the first stage of olfactory processing selects and encodes temporal features of odor signals critical to real-world navigation tasks.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Dynamics and nanoscale organization of the postsynaptic endocytic zone at excitatory synapses</a></h4>

              
                At postsynaptic sites of neurons, a prominent clathrin-coated structure, the endocytic zone (EZ), controls the trafficking of glutamate receptors and is essential for synaptic plasticity. Despite its importance, little is known about how this clathrin structure is organized to mediate endocytosis. We used live-cell and super-resolution microscopy to reveal the dynamic organization of this poorly understood clathrin structure in rat hippocampal neurons. We found that a subset of endocytic proteins only transiently appeared at postsynaptic sites. In contrast, other proteins were persistently enriched and partitioned at the edge of the EZ. We found that uncoupling the EZ from the synapse led to the loss of most of these components, while disrupting interactions with the actin cytoskeleton or membrane did not alter EZ positioning. Finally, we found that plasticity-inducing stimuli promoted the reorganization of the EZ. We conclude that the EZ is a stable, highly organized molecular platform where components are differentially recruited and positioned to orchestrate the endocytosis of synaptic receptors.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Distinguishing between recruitment and spread of silent chromatin structures in Saccharomyces cerevisiae</a></h4>

              
                The formation of heterochromatin at <i>HML</i>, <i>HMR</i>, and telomeres in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> involves two main steps: Recruitment of Sir proteins to silencers and their spread throughout the silenced domain. We developed a method to study these two processes at single base-pair resolution. Using a fusion protein between the heterochromatin protein Sir3 and the non-site-specific bacterial adenine methyltransferase M.EcoGII, we mapped sites of Sir3-chromatin interactions genome-wide using long-read Nanopore sequencing to detect adenines methylated by the fusion protein and by ChIP-seq to map the distribution of Sir3-M.EcoGII. A silencing-deficient mutant of Sir3 lacking its Bromo-Adjacent Homology (BAH) domain, <i>sir3-bah∆</i>, was still recruited to <i>HML</i>, <i>HMR</i>, and telomeres. However, in the absence of the BAH domain, it was unable to spread away from those recruitment sites. Overexpression of Sir3 did not lead to further spreading at <i>HML</i>, <i>HMR</i>, and most telomeres. A few exceptional telomeres, like 6R, exhibited a small amount of Sir3 spreading, suggesting that boundaries at telomeres responded variably to Sir3 overexpression. Finally, by using a temperature-sensitive allele of <i>SIR3</i> fused to <i>M.ECOGII</i>, we tracked the positions first methylated after induction and found that repression of genes at <i>HML </i>and <i>HMR </i>began before Sir3 occupied the entire locus.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Environmental selection overturns the decay relationship of soil prokaryotic community over geographic distance across grassland biotas</a></h4>

              
                Though being fundamental to global diversity distribution, little is known about the geographic pattern of soil microorganisms across different biotas on a large scale. Here, we investigated soil prokaryotic communities from Chinese northern grasslands on a scale up to 4,000 km in both alpine and temperate biotas. Prokaryotic similarities increased over geographic distance after tipping points of 1,760 - 1,920 km, generating a significant U-shape pattern. Such pattern was likely due to decreased disparities in environmental heterogeneity over geographic distance when across biotas, supported by three lines of evidences: 1) prokaryotic similarities still decreased with the environmental distance, 2) environmental selection dominated prokaryotic assembly, and 3) short-term environmental heterogeneity followed the U-shape pattern spatially, especially attributed to dissolved nutrients. In sum, these results demonstrate that environmental selection overwhelmed the geographic 'distance' effect when across biotas, overturning the previously well-accepted geographic pattern for microbes on a large scale.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Lytic transglycosylases mitigate periplasmic crowding by degrading soluble cell wall turnover products</a></h4>

              
                The peptidoglycan cell wall is a predominant structure of bacteria, determining cell shape and supporting survival in diverse conditions. Peptidoglycan is dynamic and requires regulated synthesis of new material, remodeling, and turnover - or autolysis - of old material. Despite exploitation of peptidoglycan synthesis as an antibiotic target, we lack a fundamental understanding of how peptidoglycan synthesis and autolysis intersect to maintain the cell wall. Here, we uncover a critical physiological role for a widely misunderstood class of autolytic enzymes, lytic transglycosylases (LTGs). We demonstrate that LTG activity is essential to survival by contributing to periplasmic processes upstream and independent of peptidoglycan recycling. Defects accumulate in <i>Vibrio cholerae </i>LTG mutants due to generally inadequate LTG activity, rather than absence of specific enzymes, and essential LTG activities are likely independent of protein-protein interactions, as heterologous expression of a non-native LTG rescues growth of a conditionally LTG-null mutant. Lastly, we demonstrate that soluble, uncrosslinked, endopeptidase-dependent peptidoglycan chains, also detected in the wild-type, are enriched in LTG mutants, and that LTG mutants are hypersusceptible to the production of diverse periplasmic polymers. Collectively, our results suggest that LTGs prevent toxic crowding of the periplasm with synthesis-derived peptidoglycan polymers and contrary to prevailing models, that this autolytic function can be temporally separate from peptidoglycan synthesis.

                We developed a multiphoton imaging method to capture neural structure and activity in behaving flies through the intact cuticles. Our measurements show that the fly head cuticle has surprisingly high transmission at wavelengths &gt; 900 nm, and the difficulty of through-cuticle imaging is due to the air sacs and/or fat tissue underneath the head cuticle. By compressing or removing the air sacs, we performed multiphoton imaging of the fly brain through the intact cuticle. Our anatomical and functional imaging results show that 2- and 3-photon imaging are comparable in superficial regions such as the mushroom body, but 3-photon imaging is superior in deeper regions such as the central complex and beyond. We further demonstrated 2-photon through-cuticle functional imaging of odor-evoked calcium responses from the mushroom body g-lobes in behaving flies short-term and long-term. The through-cuticle imaging method developed here extends the time limits of <i>in vivo</i> imaging in flies and opens new ways to capture neural structure and activity from the fly brain.

                As individuals learn through trial and error, some are more influenced by good outcomes, while others weight bad outcomes more heavily. Such valence biases may also influence memory for past experiences. Here, we examined whether valence asymmetries in reinforcement learning change across adolescence, and whether individual learning asymmetries bias the content of subsequent memory. Participants ages 8–27 learned the values of ‘point machines,’ after which their memory for trial-unique images presented with choice outcomes was assessed. Relative to children and adults, adolescents overweighted worse-than-expected outcomes during learning. Individuals’ valence biases modulated incidental memory, such that those who prioritized worse- (or better-) than-expected outcomes during learning were also more likely to remember images paired with these outcomes, an effect reproduced in an independent dataset. Collectively, these results highlight age-related changes in the computation of subjective value and demonstrate that a valence-asymmetric valuation process influences how information is prioritized in episodic memory.

                Obesity has repeatedly been linked to reorganization of the gut microbiome, yet to this point obesity therapeutics have been targeted exclusively toward the human host. Here we show that gut microbe-targeted inhibition of the trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) pathway protects mice against the metabolic disturbances associated with diet-induced obesity (DIO) or leptin deficiency (<i>Lep</i><i><sup>ob/ob</sup></i>). Small molecule inhibition of the gut microbial enzyme choline TMA-lyase (CutC) does not reduce food intake but is instead associated with alterations in the gut microbiome, improvement in glucose tolerance, and enhanced energy expenditure. We also show that gut microbial CutC inhibition is associated with reorganization of host circadian control of both phosphatidylcholine and energy metabolism. This study underscores the relationship between microbe and host metabolism and provides evidence that gut microbe-derived trimethylamine (TMA) is a key regulator of the host circadian clock. This work also demonstrates that gut microbe-targeted enzyme inhibitors have potential as anti-obesity therapeutics.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Impact of long- and short-range fiber depletion on the cognitive deficits of fronto-temporal dementia</a></h4>

              
                Recent studies suggest a framework where white matter (WM) atrophy plays an important role in fronto-temporal dementia (FTD) pathophysiology. However, these studies often overlook the fact that WM tracts bridging different brain regions may have different vulnerabilities to the disease and the relative contribution of GM atrophy to this WM model, resulting in a less comprehensive understanding of the relationship between clinical symptoms and pathology. Using a common factor analysis to extract a semantic and an executive factor, we aimed to test the relative contribution of WM and GM of specific tracts in predicting cognition in the Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration Neuroimaging Initiative (FTLDNI). We found that semantic symptoms were mainly dependent on short-range WM fiber disruption, while damage to long-range WM fibers was preferentially associated to executive dysfunction with the GM contribution to cognition being predominant for local processing. These results support the importance of the disruption of specific WM tracts to the core cognitive symptoms associated with FTD. As large-scale WM tracts, which are particularly vulnerable to vascular disease, were highly associated with executive dysfunction, our findings highlight the importance of controlling for risk factors associated with deep white matter disease, such as vascular risk factors, in patients with FTD in order not to potentiate underlying executive dysfunction.

                Model organisms mimicking the pathogenesis of human diseases are useful for identifying pathogenic mechanisms and testing therapeutic efficacy of compounds targeting them. Models of Alzheimers disease and related dementias aim to reproduce the brain pathology associated with these neurodegenerative disorders. Transgenic models, which involve random insertion of disease-causing genes under the control of artificial promoters, are efficient means of doing so. There are confounding factors associated with transgenic approaches, however, including target gene overexpression, dysregulation of endogenous gene expression at transgenes integration sites, and limitations in mimicking loss-of-function mechanisms. Furthermore, the choice of species is important, and there are anatomical, physiological, and cognitive reasons for favoring the rat over the mouse, which has been the standard for models of neurodegeneration and dementia. We report an initial assessment of the spatial learning, reversal, and sequencing task capabilities of knock-in Long-Evans rats with humanizing mutations in the A{beta}-coding region of  App , which encodes amyloid precursor protein ( App h/h  rats), using the IntelliCage, an automated operant social home cage system, at 6-8 weeks of age, then again at 4-5 months of age. These rats were previously generated as control organisms for studies on neurodegeneration involving other knock-in rat models from our lab.  App h/h  rats of either sex can acquire place learning and reversal tasks. They can also acquire a diagonal sequencing task by 6-8 weeks of age, but not a more advanced serial reversal task involving alternating diagonals, even by 4-5 months of age.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Impact of decision and action outcomes on subsequent decision and action behaviors</a></h4>

              
                In general, speed-accuracy tradeoff adjustments in decision-making have been studied separately from those in motor control. In the wild however, animals coordinate their decision and action, freely investing time in choosing versus moving given specific contexts. Recent behavioral studies support this view, indicating that humans can trade decision time for movement time to maximize their reward rate at the level of entire experimental sessions. Besides, it is established that choice outcomes largely impact subsequent decisions. Crucially though, whether and how a decision also influences the subsequent motor behavior, and whether and how a motor error influences the next decision is currently unknown. Here we address these questions by analyzing trial-to-trial changes of choice and motor behaviors in humans instructed to perform successive perceptual decisions expressed with reaching movement whose duration was either bounded or unconstrained in separate tasks. Results indicate that after a bad decision, subjects who were not constrained in their action duration decided more slowly and more accurately. Interestingly, they also shortened their subsequent movement duration by moving faster. Conversely, we found that movement errors not only influenced the speed and the accuracy of the following movement, but those of the decision as well. If the movement had to be slowed down, the decision that precedes that movement was accelerated, and vice versa. Together, these results indicate that from one trial to the next, humans are primarily concerned about determining a behavioral duration as a whole instead of optimizing each of the decision and action speed-accuracy trade-offs independently of each other.

                Myelin, the insulating sheath that surrounds neuronal axons, is produced by oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system (CNS). This evolutionary innovation, which first appears in jawed vertebrates, enabled rapid transmission of nerve impulses, more complex brains and greater morphological diversity. Here we report that RNA level expression of RNLTR12-int, a retrotransposon of retroviral origin, is essential for myelination. We show RNLTR12-int-encoded non-coding RNA binds to the transcription factor SOX10 to regulate transcription of myelin basic protein (Mbp, the major constituent of myelin). RNLTR12-int like sequences (which we name RetroMyelin) are found in all jawed-vertebrates and also regulate myelination in zebrafish, suggesting retroviral endogenization as a key step in the emergence of vertebrate myelin.

                A range of neurological pathologies can cause secondary hydrocephalus. For decades, treatment has been limited to surgical CSF diversion, as still no pharmacological options exist due to the elusive molecular nature of the CSF secretion apparatus and its regulatory properties. We have now identified phospholipid lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) as a biomarker for posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus (PHH) in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and mimicked our results in an animal model of intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH). Intraventricular administration of LPA caused elevated brain water content and ventriculomegaly in experimental rats, via its action as an agonist of the choroidal transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) channel. TRPV4 was revealed as a novel regulator of ICP in experimental rats via its ability to modulate the CSF secretion rate through its direct activation of the Na+, K+, 2Cl- cotransporter (NKCC1) implicated in CSF secretion. Together, our data reveal that a biomarker present in brain pathologies with hemorrhagic events promotes CSF hypersecretion and ensuing brain water accumulation via its direct action on TRPV4 and its downstream regulation of NKCC1. TRPV4 may therefore be a promising future pharmacological target for pathologies involving disturbed brain fluid dynamics.

                Sleep architecture and microstructures alter with aging and sleep disorder-led accelerated aging. We proposed a sleep electroencephalogram (EEG) based brain age prediction model using convolutional neural networks. We then associated the estimated brain age index (BAI) with brain structural aging features, sleep disorders and various sleep parameters. Our model also showed a higher BAI (predicted brain age minus chronological age) is associated with cortical thinning in various functional areas. We found a higher BAI for sleep disorder groups compared to healthy sleepers, as well as significant differences in the spectral pattern of EEG among different sleep disorders (lower power in slow and {theta} waves for sleep apnea vs. higher power in {beta} and {sigma} for insomnia), suggesting sleep disorder-dependent pathomechanisms of aging. Our results demonstrate that the new EEG-BAI can be a biomarker reflecting brain health in normal and various sleep disorder subjects, and may be used to assess treatment efficacy.

                Genomic imprinting is implicated in the control of gene dosage in neurogenic niches. Insulin-like growth factor 2 (Igf2), is an imprinted gene that shows biallelic expression only in the vascular compartment contributing to neural stem cells (NSCs) maintenance in the subventricular zone (SVZ) niche. The effects of this factor in adult NSCs differentiation are not well defined. We show here that IGF2 promotes cell fate commitment of NSCs by inducing the expression of another imprinted gene, the maternally expressed gene cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1c (Cdkn1c), which encodes for p57 protein, eliciting cell cycle exit and terminal differentiation into astrocytes, neurons and oligodendrocytes. Using a conditional mouse model with Cdkn1c-deficient neural progenitors, we confirm that IGF2 and p57 interact in a common pathway to regulate the differentiation program of adult NSCs. This occurs through a mechanism involving the PI3K-Akt pathway that mediates regulation of p57 expression. We also show that the imprinted state of the Cdkn1c gene is not altered after IGF2 treatment confirming maternal expression of the gene in NSCs. Our results identify a molecular mechanism by which a paracrine factor produced and secreted by the neurogenic niche compartment can modulate Cdkn1c dosage to trigger differentiation of adult NSCs.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">RNA-Targeting CRISPR/Cas13d System Eliminates Disease-Related Phenotypes in Pre-clinical Models of Huntington's Disease.</a></h4>

              
                Huntington's disease (HD) is a fatal, dominantly inherited neurodegenerative disorder caused by a CAG trinucleotide expansion in exon 1 of the huntingtin (HTT) gene. Although the pathogenesis of HD remains complex, the CAG-expanded (CAGEX) HTT mRNA and protein ultimately causes disease through a toxic gain-of-function mechanism. As the reduction of pathogenic mutant HTT mRNA is beneficial as a treatment, we developed a CAGEX RNA-eliminating CRISPR-Cas13d system (Cas13d/CAGEX) that binds and eliminates toxic CAGEX RNA in HD patient iPSC-derived striatal neurons. We show that intrastriatal delivery of Cas13d/CAGEX via a single adeno-associated viral vector, serotype 9 (AAV9) mediates significant and selective reduction of mutant HTT mRNA and protein levels within the striatum of heterozygous zQ175 mice, an established mouse model of HD. Moreover, the reduction of mutant HTT mRNA renders a sustained reversal of HD phenotypes, including improved motor coordination, attenuated striatal atrophy, and reduction of mutant HTT protein aggregates. Importantly, phenotypic improvements were durable for at least 8 months without gross or behavioral adverse effects, and with minimal off-target interactions of Cas13d/CAGEX in the mouse transcriptome. Taken together, we demonstrate a proof-of-principle of an RNA-targeting CRISPR/Cas13d system as a therapeutic approach for HD, a strategy with broad implications for the treatment of other dominantly inherited neurodegenerative disorders.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Reduced resilience of functional state transitions in patients with anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis</a></h4>

              
                Background: Patients with anti-NMDA receptor (NMDAR) encephalitis suffer from a severe neuropsychiatric syndrome, yet most patients show no abnormalities in routine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Advanced neuroimaging studies have consistently shown disrupted functional connectivity in this patient population, with recent work suggesting increased volatility of functional state dynamics. Here, we investigate these network dynamics through the spatiotemporal trajectory of meta-state transitions, yielding a time-resolved account of brain state exploration in NMDAR encephalitis. Methods: Resting-state functional MRI data were acquired in 73 patients with NMDAR encephalitis and 73 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Time-resolved functional connectivity was clustered into brain meta-states, giving rise to a time-resolved transition network graph with states as nodes and transitions between brain meta-states as weighted, directed edges. Network topology, robustness, and transition cost of these transition networks were compared between groups. Results: Transition networks of patients showed significantly lower local efficiency (t = -2.43, p = 0.016), lower robustness (t = -2.03, p = 0.044) and higher leap size (t = 2.21, p = 0.029) compared to controls. Furthermore, the ratio of within-to-between module transitions and state similarity was significantly lower in patients. Importantly, these metrics were correlated with disease severity and disease duration. Conclusions: These findings reveal systematic alterations of transition networks in patients, suggesting that NMDAR encephalitis is characterized by reduced stability of brain state transitions and that this reduced resilience of transition networks plays a clinically relevant role in the manifestation of the disease.

                The dwarf cuttlefish, Sepia bandensis, a small cephalopod that exhibits dynamic camouflage, is an emerging model organism in neuroscience. Coleoid cephalopods (cuttlefish, octopus, and squid) evolved large, complex brains capable of learning, problem-solving, and memory. We used high resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), deep learning, and fluorescent histology to generate a dwarf cuttlefish brain atlas and built an interactive web tool (cuttlebase.org) to host the data. Guided by observations in other cephalopods, we identified 38 brain lobes. The dwarf cuttlefish brain is partially encased in cartilage and includes two large optic lobes (74% the total volume of the brain), chromatophore lobes whose motor neurons directly innervate the skin, and a vertical lobe that has been implicated in learning and memory. Motor neurons emerging from the chromatophore lobe modulate the color, pattern, and texture of the skin to elicit camouflage. This brain atlas provides a valuable tool for exploring the neural basis of cuttlefish behavior.

                PyRodentTracks (PRT) is a scalable and customizable computer vision and RFID-41 based system for multiple rodent tracking and behavior assessment that can be set up within 42 minutes in any user-defined arena at minimal cost. PRT is composed of the online Raspberry 43 Pi-based video and RFID acquisition and the subsequent offline analysis tools. The system is 44 capable of tracking up to 6 mice in experiments ranging from minutes to days. PRT 45 maintained a minimum of 88% detections tracked with an overall accuracy >85% when 46 compared to manual validation of videos containing 1-4 mice in a modified home-cage. As 47 expected, chronic recording in home-cage revealed diurnal activity patterns. Moreover, it was 48 observed that novel non-cagemate mice pairs exhibit more similarity in travel trajectory 49 patterns over a 10-minute period in the openfield than cagemates. Therefore, shared features 50 within travel trajectories between animals may be a measure of sociability that has not been 51 previously reported. Moreover, PRT can interface with open-source packages such as 52 Deeplabcut and Traja for pose estimation and travel trajectory analysis, respectively. In 53 combination with Traja, PRT resolved motor deficits exhibited in stroke animals. Overall, we 54 present an affordable, open-sourced, and customizable/scalable rodent-specific behavior 55 recording and analysis system.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Reversal of obesogenic feeding and hypometabolism by a bifurcating GABAergic neural circuit</a></h4>

              
                Diet-induced obesity is characterized by unsatiated consumption of energy-dense diets and impaired metabolism, whereby anti-obesity effect of the high-level of circulating leptin is unknowingly blunted. Emerging evidence suggests that the leptin receptor (LepR) signaling system, residing within the agouti-related protein (AgRP) neurons of the hypothalamus, critically contributes to obesogenic feeding, nutrient partitioning, and energy metabolism. However, the neural circuit mechanism underlying the leptin-dependent control of obesogenic feeding and energy balance remains largely elusive. Here, we show that two distinct subgroups of LepR-expressing AgRP neurons send non-collateral, GABAergic projections to the dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus (DMH) and to the medial part of the medial preoptic nucleus (MPO) for the differential control of metabolic homeostasis and obesogenic feeding, respectively. We found that the AgRP LepR-DMH neural circuit plays a significant role in leptin-dependent control of metabolic homeostasis through the 3-containing GABAA receptor signaling on the melanocortin 4 receptor neurons within the DMH (MC4R DMH). In contrast, the AgRP LepR-MPO neural circuit elicits dominant effects on the appetitive response to high-fat diet through the 2-containing GABAA receptors on the MC4R MPO neurons. Consistent with these behavioral results, the post-synaptic GABAA neurons located within the DMH and MPO displayed differentiated firing responses under various feeding and nutrient conditions. Our results demonstrate that these novel GABAergic neural circuits exert differentiated control of metabolic hemostasis and obesogenic feeding via distinct post-synaptic targets of leptin-responsive AgRP neurons. The findings of two genetically and anatomically distinct GABAA receptor signaling pathways within the DMH and MPO would undoubtedly accelerate the development of targeted, individualized, anti-obesity therapy.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Latent circuit inference from heterogeneous neural responses during cognitive tasks</a></h4>

              
                Higher cortical areas carry a wide range of sensory, cognitive, and motor signals supporting complex goal-directed behavior. These signals are mixed in heterogeneous responses of single neurons tuned to multiple task variables. Dimensionality reduction methods used to analyze neural responses rely merely on correlations, leaving unknown how heterogeneous neural activity arises from connectivity to drive behavior. Here we present a framework for inferring a low-dimensional connectivity structure--the latent circuit--from high-dimensional neural response data. The latent circuit captures mechanistic interactions between task variables and their mixed representations in single neurons. We apply the latent circuit inference to recurrent neural networks trained to perform a context-dependent decision-making task and find a suppression mechanism in which contextual representations inhibit irrelevant sensory responses. We validate this mechanism by confirming the behavioral effects of patterned connectivity perturbations predicted by the latent circuit structure. Our approach can reveal interpretable and causally testable circuit mechanisms from heterogeneous neural responses during cognitive tasks.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Rapid Selectivity to Natural Images Across Layers of Primate V1</a></h4>

              
                Visual systems are thought to have adapted to the statistical properties of natural scenes. However, the extent to which visual neurons respond selectively to natural images, and the stage at which that selectivity emerges remains unclear. To address these questions, we recorded the visual activity of neurons in macaque V1 using high-density electrode arrays (Neuropixels), and compared neuronal responses to images presented at three levels of naturalness. We found that within 60 ms of stimulus onset, neurons in all cortical layers, including input layers 4C alpha and beta, responded more vigorously to natural images than to statistically matched naturalistic texture and noise images. The result remained when residual variations in the local image statistics were factored out. V1 neurons also showed high population and lifetime sparseness for natural images. Across the population of V1 neurons, sensitivity to natural images exceeded the sensitivity to other image categories. The results reveal a rapid and pervasive preference for natural images is present at the earliest stages of cortical processing.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The amyloid precursor protein modulates the position and length of the axon initial segment offering a new perspective on Alzheimer's disease genetics</a></h4>

              
                The small A{beta} peptide has been hypothesized to be the main driver of Alzheimer's disease (AD). A{beta} is a proteolytic cleavage product of a larger protein, the amyloid precursor protein (APP), whose normal functions remain largely unexplored. We report here activities of the full-length APP protein that relate directly to the etiology of AD. Increasing neuronal activity leads to a rapid increase in App gene expression. In both cultures of mouse cortical neurons and human iPSC-derived neurons, elevated APP protein changes the structure of the axon initial segment (AIS), the site of action potential initiation. In neurons with elevated APP, the AIS shortens in length and shifts in position away from the cell body. Both changes would be expected to reduce neuronal excitability. The AIS effects are due to the cell-autonomous actions of APP; exogenous A{beta} - either fibrillar or oligomeric - has no effect. The findings relate directly to AD in several ways. In culture, APP carrying the Swedish familial AD mutation (APPSwe) induces stronger AIS changes than wild type APP. Ankyrin G and {beta}IV-spectrin, scaffolding proteins of the AIS, both physically associate with APP, and APPSwe binds more avidly than wild type APP. Finally, neurons in the frontal cortex of humans with sporadic AD reveal histologically elevated levels of APP protein that invade the domain of the AIS, whose length is significantly shorter than that found in healthy control neurons. The findings offer an alternative explanation for the effects of at least some familial AD mutations.

                How neurons in the CNS can maintain cellular identity over an entire lifespan remains largely unknown. Here we show that long-term maintenance of identity in differentiated dopaminergic and serotonergic neurons is critically reliant on the Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2). Deletion of the obligate PRC2-component, Eed, in these neurons, resulted in global loss of H3K27me3, followed by a gradual activation of genes harbouring both H3K27me3 and H3K9me3 modifications. Notably, H3K9me3 was also lost at these PRC2-targets prior to gene activation. Neuronal survival was not compromised, instead there was a reduction in subtype specific gene expression as well as a progressive impairment of dopaminergic and serotonergic neuronal function leading to behavioural deficits characteristic of Parkinsons disease (PD) and anxiety. Single cell analysis revealed an unexpected subtype specific vulnerability to loss of PRC2-repression in dopamine neurons of the substantia nigra, the neurons primarily affected in PD. Taken together, our study reveals that a PRC2-dependent non-permissive chromatin state is essential to maintain subtype identity and function of dopaminergic and serotonergic neurons.

	<p>The ability to walk without support usually develops in the first year of a typically developing toddler&amp;amp;rsquo;s life and matures further in the following years. Mature walking is characterized by the correct timing of the different gait phases that make up a full gait cycle formed by stance, swing, and double support phases. The harmony of mature walking is given by a specific self-similar structure of the ratios between the durations of these phases (stride/stance, stance/swing, swing/double support), that in adults all converge to the golden ratio (phi, about 1.618). The aim of this longitudinal, prospective, experimental study was to investigate the evolution of this gait harmonic structure in the transition from supported to independent walking. In total, 27 children were recruited and recorded at various stages of locomotor development, ranging from neonatal stepping up to an independent walking experience of about six months. Differently from walking speed that progressively increased with age, the gait phase ratios started to converge to golden value only after the first independent steps, suggesting a relation to the maturation of the walking experience. The independent walking experience seems to represent a trigger for the evolution of a locomotor harmonic pattern in toddlers learning to walk.</p>

	<p>Smell alteration and cognitive impairment are common features of the Long-COVID Syndrome. Mental clouding, often described as brain fog, might affect smell by altering recollection of odors or through a share mechanism of neuroinflammation. We investigated mental clouding, headache, and cognitive function in adult patients with persistent COVID-19 olfactory dysfunction. This multi-center cross-sectional study enrolled 152 adults with self-reported olfactory dysfunction from 3 tertiary centers specialized in COVID-19 olfactory disorders. Inclusion criteria were smell alterations after COVID-19 persisting over 6 months from infection, age &amp;amp;gt;18 and &amp;amp;lt; 65. Exclusion criteria included smell alterations, headache, or memory problems prior to COVID-19 infection. The patients were evaluated by olfactometry, nasal endoscopy, headache scale, cognitive assessment, Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), and self-reported measures. Smell dysfunction was stratified and classified based on olfactory deficit severity and presence of olfactory distortion (parosmia, cacosmia). Data on smell disorder, mental clouding, MMSE, and headache were analyzed to assess correlations. Among the 152 patients studied, 50 (32.8%) presented with anosmia, 25 (16.4%) with hyposmia, 10 (6.6%) with parosmia/cacosmia, and 58 patients (38.2%) with a combination of hyposmia and parosmia; seven (4.6%) patients suffered from headache exclusively, and two (1.4%) had headache and mental clouding as their primary symptom. Headache was reported by 76 (50%) patients, and mental clouding by 71 (46.7%). The patients reporting headache, mental clouding, or both, had significantly increased risk of suffering from anosmia and/or hyposmia when compared with their counterparts without these neurological symptoms. No patients had reduced MMSE scores. In our cohort of adult patients with post-COVID-19, smell alterations persisting over 6 months, cognitive impairment and headache were associated with more severe olfactory loss, consistent with neuroinflammatory mechanisms mediating a variety of Long-COVID symptoms.</p>

	<p>Background and Objective: Heart rate variability (HRV) as an index of the autonomic nervous system appears to be related to reactivity to experimental pain stimuli. HRV could better explain the contributions of sympathetic and parasympathetic activity response to nociceptive stimulation. The aim of this study was to systematically review and synthesize the current evidence on HRV in relation to the experience of pain in experimental tasks. Databases and Data Treatment: Studies indexed in the PubMed, PsycINFO, MEDLINE, WebOfScience, and Scopus databases were reviewed for eligibility. Studies on the autonomic response (i.e., HRV) to experimentally induced pain in healthy adults were included. Different methods of pain induction were considered (e.g., thermal, pressure, and electrical). Data were synthesized considering the association between HRV and both pain induction and subjective measures of pain. Results: Seventy-one studies were included. The results underline significant change in both the sympathetic and parasympathetic autonomic nervous systems during the painful stimulation independent of the pain induction method. The autonomic reaction to pain could be affected by several factors, such as sex, age, body mass index, breathing patterns, the intensity of the stimulation, and the affective state. Moreover, an association between the autonomic nervous system and the subjective experience of pain was found. Higher parasympathetic activity was associated with better self-regulation capacities and, accordingly, a higher pain inhibition capacity. Conclusions: HRV appears to be a helpful marker to evaluate nociceptive response in experimentally induced pain. Future studies are also needed in clinical samples to understand better the interindividual changes of autonomic response due to pain stimuli.</p>

	<p>Motor inhibition is an important cognitive process involved in tic suppression. As the right frontal lobe contains important inhibitory network nodes, we characterized right superior, middle, and inferior frontal gyral (RSFG, RMFG, RIFG) event-related oscillations during motor inhibition in youth with chronic tic disorders (CTD) versus controls. Fourteen children with CTD and 13 controls (10&amp;amp;ndash;17 years old) completed an anticipated-response stop signal task while dense-array electroencephalography was recorded. Between-group differences in spectral power changes (3&amp;amp;ndash;50 Hz) were explored after source localization and multiple comparisons correction. Two epochs within the stop signal task were studied: (1) preparatory phase early in the trial before motor execution/inhibition and (2) active inhibition phase after stop signal presentation. Correlation analyses between electrophysiologic data and clinical rating scales for tic, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, and inattention/hyperactivity were performed. There were no behavioral or electrophysiological differences during active stopping. During stop preparation, CTD participants showed greater event-related desynchronization (ERD) in the RSFG (&amp;amp;gamma;-band), RMFG (&amp;amp;beta;, &amp;amp;gamma;-bands), and RIFG (&amp;amp;theta;, &amp;amp;alpha;, &amp;amp;beta;, &amp;amp;gamma;-bands). Higher RSFG &amp;amp;gamma;-ERD correlated with lower tic severity (r = 0.66, p = 0.04). Our findings suggest RSFG &amp;amp;gamma;-ERD may represent a mechanism that allows CTD patients to keep tics under control and achieve behavioral performance similar to peers.</p>

	<p>Background/aims: Iatrogenic CSF leaks after endoscopic endonasal transsphenoidal surgery remain a challenging entity to manage, typically treated with CSF diversion via lumbar drainage. Objective: To assess the safety and efficacy of high-volume lumbar puncture (LP) and acetazolamide therapy to manage iatrogenic CSF leaks. Methods: We performed a prospective pilot study of four patients who developed iatrogenic postoperative CSF leaks after transsphenoidal surgery and analyzed their response to treatment with concomitant high-volume lumbar puncture followed by acetazolamide therapy for 10 days. Data collected included demographics, intra-operative findings, including methodology of skull base repair and type of CSF leak, time to presentation with CSF leak, complications associated with high-volume LP and acetazolamide treatment, and length of follow-up. Results: Mean patient age was 44.28 years, with an average BMI of 27.4. Mean time from surgery to onset of CSF leak was 7.71 days. All four patients had resolution of their CSF leak at two- and four-week follow-up. Mean overall follow-up time was 179 days, with a 100% CSF leak cure rate at the last clinic visit. No patient suffered perioperative complications or complications secondary to treatment. Conclusion: Although our pilot case series is small, we demonstrate that a high-volume LP, followed by acetazolamide therapy for 10 days, can be considered in the management of post-operative CSF leaks.</p>

	<p>Orexin peptides comprise two neuropeptides, orexin A and orexin B, that bind two G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), orexin receptor 1 (OXR1) and orexin receptor 2 (OXR2). Although cell bodies that produce orexin peptides are localized in a small area comprising the lateral hypothalamus and adjacent regions, orexin-containing fibres project throughout the neuraxis. Although orexins were initially described as peptides that regulate feeding behaviour, research has shown that orexins are involved in diverse functions that range from the modulation of autonomic functions to higher cognitive functions, including reward-seeking, behaviour, attention, cognition, and mood. Furthermore, disruption in orexin signalling has been shown in mood disorders that are associated with low hedonic tone or anhedonia, including depression, anxiety, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and addiction. Notably, projections of orexin neurons overlap circuits involved in the modulation of hedonic tone. Evidence shows that orexins may potentiate hedonic behaviours by increasing the feeling of pleasure or reward to various signalling, whereas dysregulation of orexin signalling may underlie low hedonic tone or anhedonia. Further, orexin appears to play a key role in regulating behaviours in motivationally charged situations, such as food-seeking during hunger, or drug-seeking during withdrawal. Therefore, it would be expected that dysregulation of orexin expression or signalling is associated with changes in hedonic tone. Further studies investigating this association are warranted.</p>

	<p>Evidence indicates an association between executive functioning and increased weight, with different patterns ascribed to individual differences (sex, age, lifestyles). This study reports on the relationship between high-level executive functions and body weight. Sixty-five young adults participated in the study: 29 participants (14 males, 15 females) in the normal weight range; 36 participants (18 males, 18 females) in the overweight range. The Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) and Tower of London Task were administered to assess decision making and planning. Planning did not differ in individuals in the normal-weight and overweight groups, and no difference emerged between females and males. However, normal and overweight males and females had different patterns in decision making. On the long-term consequences index of the IGT, females reported lower scores than males. Males in the overweight range had a lower long-term consequences index on the IGT than normal-weight males, while this pattern did not emerge in females. These findings suggest that decision-making responses may differ in the overweight relative to healthy weight condition, with a different expression in males and females. This pattern should be considered in weight loss prevention strategies, possibly adopting different approaches in males and females.</p>

     alt="A comparative study of pre-alpha islands in the entorhinal cortex from selected primates and in lissencephaly"/>
<p>The drawing at the top shows coronal sections through a gyrified human brain (at left) and a lissencephalic (‘’smooth,” i.e., lacking normal convolutions) human brain (at right). The lower half of the image shows exemplary images of primate brains with a strongly gyrified cortex (<i>Pongo pygmaeus</i>) versus a comparatively smooth brain surface (<i>Perodicticus potto</i>). Although the pre-alpha layer in <i>Pongo pygmaeus</i> (at left) displays cellular islands, these are lacking in the lissencephalic primate (at right). The images are identical to those shown in Figure 1.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The entorhinal cortex (EC) is the main interface between the sensory association areas of the neocortex and the hippocampus. It is crucial for the evaluation and processing of sensory data for long-term memory consolidation and shows damage in many brain diseases, for example, neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease and developmental disorders.</p>
<p>The pre-alpha layer of the EC in humans (layer II) displays a remarkable distribution of neurons in islands. These cellular islands give rise to a portion of the perforant path—the major reciprocal data stream for neocortical information into the hippocampal formation. However, the functional relevance of the morphological appearance of the pre-alpha layer in cellular islands and the precise timing of their initial appearance during primate evolution are largely unknown. Here, we conducted a comparative study of the EC from 38 nonhuman primates and <i>Homo sapiens</i> and found a strong relationship between gyrification index (GI) and the presence of the pre-alpha cellular islands. The formation of cellular islands also correlated with brain and body weight as well as neopallial volume. In the two human lissencephalic cases, the cellular islands in the pre-alpha layer were lacking. These findings emphasize the relationship between cortical folding and island formation in the EC from an evolutionary perspective and suggest a role in the pathomechanism of developmental brain disorders.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10969861/most-recent">Expression and distribution of synaptotagmin family members in the zebrafish retina</a></h4>

              
                <img src="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/b894457b-c24e-4a9f-bb89-afa9f67a3874/cne25238-gra-0001-m.png"
     alt="Expression and distribution of synaptotagmin family members in the zebrafish retina"/>
<p>Zebrafish (<i>D. rerio</i>) synaptotagmins are well conserved and can be grouped in the same classes as mammalian synaptotagmins and show notable distributions in the retina. Zebrafish therefore represent a valuable tool to address the diverse roles of synaptotagmins in retinal physiology.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Synaptotagmins belong to a large family of proteins. Although various synaptotagmins have been implicated as Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensors for vesicle replenishment and release at conventional synapses, their roles at retinal ribbon synapses remain incompletely understood. Zebrafish is a widely used experimental model for retinal research. We therefore investigated the homology between human, rat, mouse, and zebrafish synaptotagmins 1–10 using a bioinformatics approach. We also characterized the expression and distribution of various synaptotagmin (<i>syt</i>) genes in the zebrafish retina using RT-PCR, qPCR, and in situhybridization, focusing on the family members whose products likely underlie Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent exocytosis in the central nervous system (synaptotagmins 1, 2, 5, and 7). Most zebrafish synaptotagmins are well conserved and can be grouped in the same classes as mammalian synaptotagmins, based on crucial amino acid residues needed for coordinating Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding and determining phospholipid binding affinity. The only exception is synaptotagmin 1b, which lacks 34 amino acid residues in the C2B domain and is therefore unlikely to bind Ca<sup>2+</sup> there. Additionally, the products of zebrafish <i>syt5a</i> and <i>syt5b</i> genes share identity with mammalian class 1 and 5 synaptotagmins. Zebrafish <i>syt1</i>, <i>syt2</i>, <i>syt5</i>, and <i>syt7</i> paralogues are found in the zebrafish brain, eye, and retina, excepting <i>syt1b</i>, which is only present in the brain. The complementary expression pattern of the remaining paralogues in the retina suggests that <i>syt1a</i> and <i>syt5a</i> may underlie synchronous release and <i>syt7a</i> and <i>syt7b</i> may mediate asynchronous release or other Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent processes in different retinal neurons.</p>

     alt="Differential investment in visual and olfactory brain regions is linked to the sensory needs of a wasp social parasite and its host"/>
<p>Brain reconstructions reveal differential investment in sensory brain regions between the obligate social parasite <i>Polistes sulcifer</i> and its host, <i>P. dominula</i>. Social parasites have larger optic lobes (blue), which reflects their visual needs to navigate long distances and locate a host nest. Contrastingly, hosts show large antennal lobes (yellow) and calyces of the mushroom bodies (red), coinciding with the olfactory and sensory processing needs of maintaining colony cohesion, including recognizing conspecific and heterospecific intruders.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Obligate insect social parasites evolve traits to effectively locate and then exploit their hosts, whereas hosts have complex social behavioral repertoires, which include sensory recognition to reject potential conspecific intruders and heterospecific parasites. While social parasites and host behaviors have been studied extensively, less is known about how their sensory systems function to meet their specific selective pressures. Here, we compare investment in visual and olfactory brain regions in the paper wasp <i>Polistes dominula</i>, and its obligate social parasite <i>P. sulcifer</i>, to explore the links among sensory systems,brain and behavior. Our results show significant relative volumetric differences between these two closely related species, consistent with their very different life histories. Social parasites show proportionally larger optic lobes and central complex to likely navigate long-distance migrations and unfamiliar landscapes to locate the specific species of hosts they usurp. Contrastingly, hosts have larger antennal lobes and calyces of the mushroom bodies compared with social parasites, as predicted by their sensory means to maintain social cohesion via olfactory signals, allocate colony tasks, forage, and recognize conspecific and heterospecific intruders. Our work suggests how this tradeoff between visual and olfactory brain regions may facilitate different sensory adaptations needed to perform social and foraging tasks by the host, including recognition of parasites, or to fly long distances and successful host localizing by the social parasite.</p>

     alt="Comparative neuroanatomical distribution and expression levels of neuropeptide F in the central nervous system of the female freshwater prawn, Macrobrachium rosenbergii, during the ovarian cycle"/>
<p>We investigated the comparative neuroanatomical distribution of neuropeptide F in the female prawn, <i>Macrobrachium rosenbergii</i> (MrNPF), and its expression levels in the entire CNS during the ovarian cycle. Interestingly, we found a correlation between changes in MrNPF neuroanatomical expression in various parts of the prawn CNS and different stages of the ovarian cycle. Our findings suggest that MrNPF may be a key coordinator that mediates sensory inputs, including photoreception, chemoreception, gustatory reception with feeding, and ovarian development in this female prawn.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Neuropeptide F (NPF) plays critical roles in controlling the feeding and reproduction of prawns. In the present study, we investigated changes in the expression levels of <i>Macrobrachium rosenbergii</i> neuropeptide F (MrNPF), and its neuroanatomical distribution in eyestalk (ES), brain (BR), subesophageal ganglion (SEG), thoracic ganglia (TG), and abdominal ganglia (AG), during the ovarian cycle of female prawn. By qRT-PCR, the amount of <i>MrNPF</i> transcripts exhibited a gradual increase in the ES, BR, and combined SEG and TG from stages I and II, to reach a maximum level at stage III, and slightly declined at stage IV, respectively. The highest to lowest expression levels were detected in combined SEG and TG, BR, ES, and AG, respectively. MrNPF immunolabeling was observed in several neuronal clusters, associated fibers, and neuropils of these central nervous system (CNS) tissues. MrNPF-ir was more intense in neurons and neuropils of SEG and TG than those found in other parts of the CNS. The number of MrNPF-ir neurons and intensity of MrNPF-ir were higher in the ES, BR, SEG, and TG at the late stages than those at the early stages of the ovarian cycle, while those in AG exhibited insignificant change. Taken together, there is a correlation between changes in the neuroanatomical distribution of MrNPF and stages of the ovarian cycle, implying that MrNPF may be an important neuropeptide that integrates sensory stimuli, including photo-, chemo-, and gustatory receptions, to control feeding and reproduction, particularly ovarian development, of this female prawn, <i>M. rosenbergii</i>.</p>

<p>Workers of the stingless bee <i>Tetragonisca angustula</i> consist of defense specialist soldiers and minors. Soldiers have an overall higher lifetime task repertoire than minors and are also age subspecialized on distinct defense tasks. We found that soldiers had larger optic lobes than non-soldiers but only during the period when they were performing the most visually demanding defense task (hovering guarding). Despite having larger task repertoires, soldiers had similar absolute brain size and smaller relative brain size compared to other workers, meaning that lifetime task repertoire size was a poor predictor of brain size.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Individual heterogeneity within societies provides opportunities to test hypotheses about adaptive neural investment in the context of group cooperation. Here, we explore neural investment in defense specialist soldiers of the eusocial stingless bee (<i>Tetragonisca angustula</i>) which are age subspecialized on distinct defense tasks and have an overall higher lifetime task repertoire than other sterile workers within the colony. Consistent with predicted behavioral demands, soldiers had higher relative visual (optic lobe) investment than nonsoldiers but only during the period when they were performing the most visually demanding defense task (hovering guarding). As soldiers aged into the less visually demanding task of standing guarding this difference disappeared. Neural investment was otherwise similar across all colony members. Despite having larger task repertoires, soldiers had similar absolute brain size and the smaller relative brain size compared to other workers, meaning that lifetime task repertoire size was a poor predictor of brain size. Both high behavioral specialization in stable environmental conditions and reassignment across task groups during a crisis occur in <i>T. angustula</i>. The differences in neurobiology we report here are consistent with these specialized but flexible defense strategies. This work broadens our understanding of how neurobiology mediates age and morphological task specialization in highly cooperative societies.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The study was undertaken to assess the impact of B cell depletion on humoral and cellular immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in patients with various neuroimmunologic disorders on anti-CD20 therapy. This included an analysis of the T cell vaccine response to the SARS-CoV-2 delta variant.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We investigated prospectively humoral and cellular responses to SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination in 82 patients with neuroimmunologic disorders on anti-CD20 therapy and 82 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. For quantification of antibodies the Elecsys anti-SARS-CoV-2 S immunoassay against the receptor-binding (RBD) domain was used. IFN-gamma enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot assays were performed to assess T cell responses against the SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan strain and the delta variant.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies were found less frequently in patients (70% (57/82)) compared to controls (82/82 (100%), p &lt; 0.001). In patients without detectable B cells (&lt;1 B cell/mcl), seroconversion rates and antibody levels were lower compared to non-depleted (≥1 B cell/mcl) patients (p &lt; 0.001). B cell levels ≥1 cell/mcl were sufficient to induce seroconversion in our cohort of anti-CD20 treated patients. In contrast to the antibody response, the T-cell response against the Wuhan strain and the delta variant was more pronounced in frequency (p &lt; 0.05) and magnitude (p &lt; 0.01) in B-cell depleted compared to non-depleted patients.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination can be attained in patients on anti-CD20 therapy by the onset of B cell repopulation. In the absence of B cells, a strong T cell response is generated which may help to protect against severe COVID-19 in this high-risk population.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Stochastic resonance and bifurcations in a heterogeneous neuronal population explain intrinsic oscillatory patterns in entorhinal cortical stellate cells</a></h4>

              
                Stellate cells in the medial entorhinal cortex manifest peri-threshold oscillatory patterns in their membrane voltage. Although different theoretical frameworks have been proposed to explain these activity patterns, these frameworks do not jointly account for heterogeneities in intrinsic properties of stellate cells and stochasticity in ion-channel and synaptic physiology. In this study, we first performed in vitro patch-clamp electrophysiological recordings from rat MEC stellate cells and found pronounced cell-to-cell variability in their characteristic physiological properties. We demonstrate that stochasticity introduced into either a simple nonlinear dynamical system (Hopf bifurcation) or into heterogeneous biophysical models yielded activity patterns that were qualitatively similar to peri-threshold oscillations in stellate cells. We developed five quantitative metrics for identification of valid oscillatory traces and confirmed that these metrics reliably captured the variable amplitude and non-rhythmic oscillatory patterns observed in our electrophysiological recordings. We analyzed traces from a stochastic Hopf bifurcation system for further confirmation on the reliability of these quantitative metrics in detecting oscillatory patterns. Apart from providing confirmation, these analyses provided a key insight about the manifestation of stochastic resonance in the stochastic bifurcation system, but not with theta-filtered noise. We then validated peri-threshold activity patterns obtained from a heterogeneous population of stellate cell models, with each model assessed with multiple trials of different levels and forms of noise (ion-channel, synaptic, and additive) at different membrane depolarizations. Strikingly, the validation process confirmed the manifestation of heterogeneous stochastic bifurcations across all models and revealed the detection of the highest number of valid oscillatory traces at an optimal level of each form of noise. The manifestation of stochastic resonance in this heterogeneous model population explained why intrinsic theta oscillations might not be observed under in vivo conditions where noise levels are typically high. Together, we provide several lines of evidence that demonstrate heterogeneous stochastic bifurcations as a unifying framework that fully explains peri-threshold oscillatory patterns in stellate cells and argue for state-dependence in the manifestation of these oscillations.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Extraversion is associated with lower brain amyloid deposition in cognitively normal older adults.</a></h4>

              
                Emerging evidence suggests that some personality traits may link to the vulnerability to or protection for Alzheimer's disease (AD). A causal mechanism underlying this relationship, however, remains largely unknown. Using 18F-Florbetaben positron emission tomography (PET) binding to beta-amyloid (A{beta}) plaques, a pathological feature of AD, and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we investigated pathological and functional correlates of extraversion and neuroticism in a group of healthy young and older subjects. We quantified a level of brain beta amyloid deposition in older individuals. Brain activity was measured in young adults using a task-switching fMRI paradigm. When we correlated personality scores of extraversion and neuroticism with these pathological and functional measures, higher extraversion, but not neuroticism, was significantly associated with lower global A{beta} measures among older adults, accounting for age and sex. This association was present across widespread brain regions. Among young subjects, higher extraversion was associated with lower activity during task switching in anterior cingulate cortex, left anterior insular cortex, left putamen, and middle frontal gyrus bilaterally, while higher neuroticism was associated with increased activity throughout the brain. The present results suggest that possibly via efficient neuronal activity, extraversion, one of lifelong personality traits, may confer the protective mechanism against the development of A{beta} pathology during aging.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A scalp geometry parameter-space for optimization and implementation of conventional TMS coil placement</a></h4>

              
                Transcranial magnetic stimulation efficacy is largely dependent upon coil position and orientation. A good method for describing coil placement is required for both computational optimization (planning) and actual placement (implementation) for TMS applications. In coordinate dependent parameter-spaces (CDPs), three-dimensional coordinates are used to represent coil position and three orthogonal unit vectors are used to represent coil orientation. A CDP can precisely describe arbitrary coil placement; therefore it offers great advantage in computational optimization which checks through all possible placements. However, a neuronavigation system is usually required to accurately implement the optimized CDP parameters on a participant' s head. Routine clinical practice, on the other hand, often uses the International 10-20 system to describe coil placement. Although the 10-20 system can only perform modeling and placement at limited scalp landmarks, it allows the synthesis of different individuals' targeting effects to find group-optimal parameters; it also allows manual placement, which is important for commonly-seen use cases without individual MRI scans and navigation devices. This study proposes a new scalp geometry parameter-space (SGP), integrating the advantages of CDP and 10-20 methods. Our SGP 1) can quantitatively specify all possible conventional coil positions and orientations on an individual' s scalp, which is important for electrical modeling and optimization, 2) maintains inter-individual correspondence, which is important for synthesizing TMS effects from different individuals and studies, 3) enables fast and simple manual implementation. We conducted demonstration experiments to illustrate the application of an SGP-based framework for both individual and group-based optimization. A manual placement experiment was performed to evaluate speed, precision and reliability of our method; results show it surpasses previous manual placement protocols.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">4R-Tobacco-Cembranoid is a Positive Allosteric Modulator of the Alpha7 Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptor that modulates inflammation-induced thermal hypersensitivity in mice</a></h4>

              
                Alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (7nAChRs) are activated in response to inflammation and modulate pain in humans and rodent models. The use of 7nAChRs agonists as a therapeutic option for inflammation and pain is challenged by unwanted effects resulting from constant activation and/or desensitization of 7nAChRs. Positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) represent a compelling alternative as they increase endogenous nicotinic transmission but do not result in progressive desensitization or loss of receptor function. In the present study, we evaluated the function of the 4R tobacco cembranoid (4R) as a PAM of 7nAChR that reduces inflammation and pain-related behaviors in mouse models of inflammatory pain. Our electrophysiological experiments show that 4R potentiates choline-evoked currents in SH-SY5Y cells overexpressing 7nAChRs in a dose-dependent manner. At the behavioral level, we show that subcutaneous administration of 4R decreases inflammation-induced thermal but not tactile hypersensitivity or formalin-induced spontaneous nociceptive responses in both male and female mice. We further show reduced inflammation-induced paw edema in 4R-treated males, with no measurable effect observed in female mice. Altogether, the results from the experiments in this study identify 4R as a PAM of 7nAChRs that reduces thermal hypersensitivity in male and female mice and inflammation in a sex-specific manner. These findings highlight the use of 4R as a potential novel treatment strategy for pain and inflammation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Time-resolved parameterization of aperiodic and periodic brain activity</a></h4>

              
                Macroscopic neural dynamics comprise both aperiodic and periodic components. Recent advances in parameterizing neural power spectra offer practical tools for evaluating these features separately. Although neural signals vary dynamically and express non-stationarity in relation to ongoing behaviour and perception, current methods yield static spectral decompositions. Here, we introduce Spectral Parameterization Resolved in Time (SPRiNT) as a novel method for decomposing complex neural dynamics into periodic and aperiodic spectral elements in a time-resolved manner. First, we demonstrate, with naturalistic synthetic data, SPRiNT's capacity to reliably recover time-varying spectral features and emphasize SPRiNT's specific strengths over other time-frequency parameterization approaches based on wavelets. Second, we use SPRiNT to further illustrate how aperiodic spectral features fluctuate across time in resting-state electroencephalography (n = 178) and relate changes in aperiodic parameters to participants' demographics and behaviour. Lastly, we use SPRiNT to demonstrate aperiodic dynamics related to movement behaviour in intracranial recordings in rodents. We foresee SPRiNT responding to growing neuroscientific interests in the parameterization of neural power spectra and advancing the quantitation of complex neural dynamics at the natural time scales of behaviour.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Universal guide for skull extraction and custom-fitting of implants to continuous and discontinuous skulls</a></h4>

              
                Intracranial neurophysiological recordings require chronic implants to provide transcranial access to the brain. Especially in larger animals, which participate in experiments over extended periods of time, implants should match the skull curvature to promote osseointegration and avoid tissue and bacterial ingress over time. Proposed CAD methods for designing implants to date have focused on naive animals with continuous and even skull surfaces and calculate Boolean differences between implant and skull surface to fit the implant to the skull curvature. However, custom-fitting by calculating the difference fails, if a discontinuous skull surface needs to be matched. Also, the difference method does not allow designs with constant material thickness along the skull curvature, e.g. to allow fixed screw lengths. We present a universal step-by-step guide for custom-fitting implants which overcomes these limitations. It is suited for unusual skull conditions, like surface discontinuities or irregularities and includes virtual bending as a process to match skull surfaces while maintaining implant thickness. We demonstrate its applicability for a wide spectrum of scenarios, ranging from complex-shaped single-pieced implants to detailed multi-component implant systems built on even or discontinuous skull. The guide uses only a few software tools and the final virtual product can be manufactured using CNC milling or 3D printing. A detailed description of this process is available on GitHub including step-by-step video instructions suitable for users without any prior knowledge in CAD programming. We report the experience with these implants over several years in 11 rhesus monkeys.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Common synaptic inputs are not distributed homogeneously among the motor neurons that innervate synergistic muscles</a></h4>

              
                The force generated by the muscles involved in an action is produced by common synaptic inputs received by the engaged motor neurons. The purpose of our study was to identify the low-dimensional latent components, defined hereafter as neural modules, underlying the discharge rates of the motor units from two knee extensors (vastus medialis and lateralis) and two hand muscles (index and thumb muscles) during isometric contractions. The neural modules were extracted by factor analysis from the pooled motor units and no assumptions were made regarding the orthogonality of the modules or the association between the modules and each muscle. Factor analysis identified two independent neural modules that captured most of the covariance in the discharge rates of the motor units in the synergistic muscles. Although the neural modules were strongly correlated with the discharge rates of motor units in each of the synergistic pair of muscles, not all motor units in a muscle were correlated with the neural module for that muscle. The distribution of motor units across the pair of neural modules differed for each muscle: 80% of the motor units in first dorsal interosseous were more strongly correlated with the neural module for that muscle, whereas the proportion was 70%, 60%, and 45% for the thenar, vastus medialis, and vastus lateralis muscles. All other motor units either belonged to both modules or to the module for the other muscle (15% for vastus lateralis). Based on a simulation of 480 integrate-and-fire neurons receiving independent and common inputs, we demonstrate that factor analysis identifies the three neural modules with high levels of accuracy. Our results indicate that the correlated discharge rates of motor units arise from at least two sources of common synaptic input that are not distributed homogeneously among the motor neurons innervating synergistic muscles.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Look-up and look-down neurons in the mouse visual thalamus during freely moving exploration</a></h4>

              
                The traditional view that visuomotor integration is a property of higher brain centres has recently been challenged by the discovery in head-fixed rodents that locomotion increases neuronal activity throughout the early visual system (including the retina). Any appreciation of the importance of this behavioural modulation of visual inputs must encompass a comprehensive understanding of the range of behaviours engaged by this mechanism. This information is unavailable from head-fixed preparations in which head and body postures are fundamentally constrained and dissociated from their natural coupling with visual experience. We addressed this deficit by recording spiking activity from the primary visual thalamus during freely moving exploration, while simultaneously applying frame-by-frame quantification of postures and movements to robust 3D reconstructions of head and body. We found that postures associated with the animal looking up/down affected activity in >50% neurons. The extent of this effect was comparable to that induced by locomotion. Moreover, the two effects were largely independent and jointly modulated neuronal activity. Thus, while most units were excited by locomotion, some expressed highest firing when the animal was looking up ("look up" neurons) while others when the animal was looking down ("look-down" neurons). These results were observed in the dark, thus representing a genuine behavioural modulation, and were amplified in a lit arena. These findings define the influence of natural exploratory behaviour on activity in the early visual system and reveal the importance of up/down postures in gating neuronal activity in the primary visual thalamus.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Improved production and expanded application of CVS-N2c-ΔG virus for retrograde tracing</a></h4>

              
                Neurotropic virus tracers, particularly those with low toxicity and high efficient tracing, are powerful tools for structural and functional dissections of neural circuits. The retrograde trans-mono-synaptic technology based on rabies virus CVS-N2c strain has reduced cytotoxicity and enhanced efficiency, attains long-term gene manipulation for functional studies, but suffers from difficult preparation and low yield. To overcome these shortcomings, an improved production system was established for rapid rescue and preparation of CVS-N2c-{Delta}G virus, CVS-N2c-{Delta}G with the same titer as SAD-B19-{Delta}G can be prepared within a short time. Meanwhile, we found that N2cG coated CVS-N2c-{Delta}G allows efficient retrograde access to projection neurons, and further expand its application in VTA/SNc to DLS pathway that unaddressed by rAAV9-Retro, and the efficiency is 6 folds higher than that of rAAV9-Retro. Then the trans-synaptic efficiency of CVS-N2c-{Delta}G virus was evaluated. Results showed that the trans-mono-synaptic efficiency of oG-mediated CVS-N2c-{Delta}G was 2-3 folds higher than that of oG-mediated SAD-B19-{Delta}G, but there was no difference between oG-mediated and N2cG-mediated CVS-N2c-{Delta}G system. In addition, codon modified N2cG (optiG) did not increase the efficiency of CVS-N2c-{Delta}G tracing. Finally, we found that the CVS-N2c-{Delta}G produced by the improved method can be used for monitoring neural activity of projection neurons, and the time window can be maintained for 3 weeks, and it can also express sufficient recombinases for efficient transgene recombination. That is, the virus produced by the improved production system does not affect its own function, paving the way for its further optimization, popularization and application in structural and functional studies of neural circuits.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Amacrine cells shape retinal functions while dynamically preserving circuits for colour vision</a></h4>

              
                In vertebrate vision, the feature extracting circuits of the inner retina are driven by heavily pre-processed photoreceptor signals. For example, in larval zebrafish, outer retinal circuits serve to split "colour" from "greyscale" information across their four ancestral cone-photoreceptor types. How then can the inner retina simultaneously preserve such incoming spectral information despite the need to combine cone-signals to shape new greyscale functions? To address this question, we imaged light-driven signals from the axon terminals of retinal bipolar cells in the presence and pharmacological absence of inhibition from amacrine cells. Surprisingly, this manipulation had no net effect on the inner retinal representation of colour-opponency, despite profound impacts on all tested greyscale functions such as the gain and kinetics of bipolar cell light responses. This "dynamic balance" was achieved by amacrine cells driving opponency in some bipolar cells, while at the same time suppressing pre-existing opponency in others, such that the net change across the network was essentially zero. To do so, amacrine cells near-exclusively leveraged the On-channel, and correspondingly, a direct in vivo survey of amacrine cell functions revealed that all their colour-opponent responses were located in the On-layer. In contrast, Off-stratifying amacrine cells were largely achromatic. We conclude that complex interactions within the inner retina that underlie greyscale visual processing tasks are intricately balanced via the On-channel to not notably alter the pre-existing population representation of colour information.

                The locus coeruleus (LC) noradrenergic system is involved in a plethora of physiological and pathophysiological processes. Refining our understanding of LC function largely relies on selective transgene expression in molecularly defined cells, enabling targeted manipulation and read-out of noradrenergic neurons. Here, we performed a side-by-side comparison of the most commonly used strategies and model systems enabling genetic access to the locus coeruleus. We report substantial differences among them both in terms of transgene expression efficacy, and in their molecular specificity. These findings are of critical importance for interpreting the results obtained from past experiments using the respective targeting strategies, as well as for the design of future studies.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">An in vitro neuronal model replicating the in vivo maturation and heterogeneity of perineuronal nets</a></h4>

              
                The perineuronal net (PNN) is a condensed form of extracellular matrix (ECM) that enwraps specific populations of neurons and regulates plasticity. To create a PNN, only three classes of components are needed: membrane bound hyaluronan by its synthetic enzyme hyaluronan synthases (HASs), a link protein and a CSPG. However, there is redundancy within the classes as multiple HAS isoforms, link proteins and CSPGs have been found in the PNN in vivo. The effect of this heterogeneity has on PNN function is unresolved. Currently, the most common way to address this question is through the creation and study of PNN component in knockout animals. Here, we reported the development of a primary neuronal culture model which reproduces the in vivo maturation and heterogeneity of PNNs. This model accurately replicated mature cortical PNNs, both in terms of the heterogeneity in PNN composition and its maturation. PNNs transitioned from an immature punctate morphology to the reticular morphology as observed in the mature CNS. We also observed a small population of PNNs that were mature at an earlier time point and a distinct composition, highlighting further heterogeneity. This model will provide a valuable tool for the study of PNN biology, their roles in diseases and the development of PNN focused plasticity treatment.

                The brain predicts the sensory consequences of our movements and uses these predictions to attenuate the perception of self-generated sensations. Accordingly, self-generated touch feels weaker than externally generated touch of identical intensity. In schizophrenia, this somatosensory attenuation is substantially reduced, suggesting that patients with positive symptoms fail to accurately predict and process self-generated touch. Here we hypothesized that a similar impairment might exist in healthy nonclinical individuals with high positive schizotypal traits. One hundred healthy participants (53 female) scored for schizotypal traits and underwent a well-established psychophysics force discrimination task to quantify how they perceived self-generated and externally generated touch. The perceived intensity of tactile stimuli delivered to their left index finger (magnitude) and the ability to discriminate the stimuli (precision) were measured. We observed that higher positive schizotypal traits were associated with reduced somatosensory attenuation and poorer somatosensory precision of self-generated touch. These effects were specific to positive schizotypy and were not observed for the negative or disorganized dimensions of schizotypy. The results suggest that positive schizotypal traits are associated with a reduced ability to predict and process self-generated tactile stimuli. Given that the positive dimension of schizotypy represents the analogue of positive psychotic symptoms of schizophrenia, deficits in processing self-generated tactile information could indicate increased liability to schizophrenia.

Thus, we investigated how learning novel stimulus-outcome associations in a multi-modal environment is influenced by the degree to which perceptual attention has been focused onto a single modality. We trained head-fixed rats to discriminate compound auditory-visual stimuli using one modality and then reduced stimulus discriminability in that modality. We observed perceptual learning and increased EEG Granger causality between frontal cortex and the behaviorally relevant sensory cortex, suggesting that perceptual attention was engaged. We then presented novel and easily discriminable stimuli in both modalities and measured outcome-driven learning to discriminate stimuli in the other modality. We observed slowed learning after engaging perceptual attention onto the previously relevant modality by requiring practice with difficult discriminations. This result could not be explained by changes in non-attentional factors, such as arousal (measured with pupillometry), number of rewards received, or shifted response criterion (measured using response velocity). Our work demonstrates that perceptual attention constrains outcome-based learning by changing the strength of modality-specific cortico-cortical interactions.

                Biochemical mechanisms are temperature-dependent. Brain temperature shows wide variations across brain states, and such changes may explain quantitative changes in network oscillations. Here we report on the coupling of various hippocampal sharp wave ripple features to brain temperature. Ripple frequency, occurrence rate, and duration are correlated with temperature dynamics. By focal manipulation of the brain temperature in the hippocampal CA1 region, we show that ripple frequency can be increased and decreased by local heating and cooling, respectively. Changes of other parameters, such as the rate of SPW-R and ripple duration were not consistently affected. Our findings suggest that brain temperature in the CA1 region plays a leading role in affecting the ripple frequency, whereas other parameters of SPW-Rs may be determined by mechanisms upstream from the CA1 region. These findings illustrate that physiological variations of brain temperature exert important effects on hippocampal circuit operations.

                In Parkinson's disease (PD) patients, dopamine replacement therapy requires days to reach maximal effects, and the return of symptoms without treatment is similarly delayed. We previously postulated that these phenomena are mediated by plasticity of coritcostriatal synapses. As dopamine depletion is expected to promote aberrant potentiation of the cortical inputs onto indirect pathway neurons, we reasoned that induction of LTD here could reduce motor deficits in a PD model. Optogenetic cortical stimulation combined with a D2 receptor agonist, quinpirole, induces robust optical LTD (oLTD) in brain slices from 6-OHDA lesioned mice. When lesioned mice were subjected to corticostriatal oLTD treatment over 5 days, motor performance was improved for >3 weeks. Consistent with LTD induction, oLTD-treated mice had reduced VGLUT1 expression in striatum and greater excitability of D2 neurons. These findings suggest that reversing aberrant corticostriatal synaptic plasticity in the indirect pathway may lead to persistent relief of PD motor symptoms.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">White matter connections of high-level visual areas predict cytoarchitecture better than category-selectivity</a></h4>

              
                Ventral temporal cortex (VTC) consists of high-level visual regions that are arranged in consistent anatomical locations across individuals. This consistency has led to several hypotheses about the factors that constrain the functional organization of VTC. A prevailing theory is that white matter connections influence the organization of VTC, however, the nature of this constraint is unclear. Here, we test two hypotheses: (1) white matter tracts are specific for each category or (2) white matter tracts are specific to cytoarchitectonic areas of VTC. To test these hypotheses, we used diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) to identify white matter tracts and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to identify category-selective regions in VTC in children and adults. We find that in childhood, white matter connections are linked to cytoarchitecture rather than category-selectivity. In adulthood, however, white matter connections are linked to both cytoarchitecture and category-selectivity. These results suggest a rethinking of the view that category-selective regions in VTC have category-specific white matter connections early in development. Instead, these findings suggest that the neural hardware underlying the processing of categorical stimuli may be more domain-general than previously thought, particularly in childhood.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Brain-optimized neural networks learn non-hierarchical models of representation in human visual cortex</a></h4>

              
                Deep neural networks (DNNs) trained to perform visual tasks learn representations that align with the hierarchy of visual areas in the primate brain. This finding has been taken to imply that the primate visual system forms representations by passing them through a hierarchical sequence of brain areas, just as DNNs form representations by passing them through a hierarchical sequence of layers. To test the validity of this assumption, we optimized DNNs not to perform visual tasks but to directly predict brain activity in human visual areas V1--V4. Using a massive sampling of human brain activity, we constructed brain-optimized networks that predict brain activity even more accurately than task-optimized networks. We show that brain-optimized networks can learn representations that diverge from those formed in a strict hierarchy. Brain-optimized networks do not need to align representations in V1--V4 with layer depth; moreover, they are able to accurately model anterior brain areas (e.g., V4) without computing intermediary representations associated with posterior brain areas (e.g., V1). Our results challenge the view that human visual areas V1--V4 act---like the early layers of a DNN---as a serial pre-processing sequence for higher areas, and suggest they may subserve their own independent functions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Glaucoma and Alzheimer: Neurodegenerative disorders show an adrenergic dysbalance</a></h4>

              
                Glaucoma disease is characterized by an increased intraocular pressure (IOP), glaucomatous alterations of the optic disc and corresponding visual field defects. Even lowering the main risk factor IOP until an individual target level does not prevent this neurodegenerative disorder from proceeding. Several autoimmune mechanisms were discovered, partly showing a functionality. One of these autoimmune phenomena targets the beta2 adrenergic receptor (beta2-AR; i.e. agonistic autoantibodies; beta2-agAAb) and is linked to the elevated IOP and an impaired retinal microcirculation. As neurodegenerative disorder, Alzheimer Disease (AD) is postulated to share a common molecular mechanism with glaucoma. In the present study we investigated autoimmune phenomena targeting the beta2-AR in patients with AD. Sera of the patients were analyzed in a rat cardiomyocyte bioassay for the presence of functional autoantibodies against beta2-AR. In addition, different species of amyloid beta (A-beta) monomers were tested (A-beta1-14, A-beta10-25, A-beta10-37 A-beta1-40, A-beta1-42, A-beta28-40, and [Pyr]-beta3-42). Our results demonstrate that none of the short-chain A-beta (A-beta1-14, A-beta10-25, or A-beta28-40) showed any agonistic or inhibitory effect on beta2-AR. Contrary, long-chain [Pyr]-A-beta3-42, representing a major neurogenic plaque component, exerted an activation that was blocked by the beta2-AR antagonist ICI118.551 indicating that the effect was realized via the beta2-AR. Moreover, the long chain A-beta1-40, A-beta1-42, and A-beta10-37 yet not the short-chain A-beta peptides prevented the clenbuterol induced desensitization of the beta2-AR. In addition, we identified functional autoantibodies in the sera of AD patients, activating the beta2-AR like the beta2-agAAb found in patients with glaucoma. As autoimmune mechanisms were reportedly involved in the pathogenesis of glaucoma and Alzheimer Disease, we postulate that overstimulation of the beta2-AR pathway can induce an adrenergic overdrive, that may play an important role in the multifactorial interplay of neurodegenerative disorders.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Delayed Oligodendrocyte Progenitor Cell Recruitment and Maturation in Large Volume Demyelination</a></h4>

              
                Remyelination-inducing therapies have the potential to restore neurologic function and prevent progression in multiple sclerosis (MS). However, preclinical therapies capable of driving oligodendrocyte differentiation and enhancing remyelination in murine models have not yet yielded meaningful clinical improvement. These setbacks suggest that small animal models may be inadequate for the development and identification of promising regenerative therapies. Unlike MS, rodent models of demyelination undergo highly efficient remyelination, have typically very small volumes and exhibit abundant oligodendrocyte recruitment rapidly following demyelination. We hypothesized that oligodendrocyte progenitor cell (OPC) recruitment becomes rate-limiting as lesion volume increases leading to a failure of oligodendrocyte differentiation and endogenous remyelination. In this study, we utilized lysolecithin injection into the large white matter tracts of the rabbit to create demyelinated lesions that have cross-sectional areas 20-fold larger than those previously reported in mice, and volumes 8-fold larger. Unlike rodent lesions which show robust supernumerary OPC recruitment (representing a 3-10 fold increase in Olig2+ cell density), recruitment in the rabbit never exceeds normal levels. Importantly, the density of mature CC1+ oligodendrocytes failed to return to NAWM levels by 56 dpl and the percentage of differentiated oligodendrocytes drastically lagged behind that of rodent lesions. These results suggest that as lesion volume increases the requirement for increased OPC proliferation and migration becomes limiting. As oligodendrocyte differentiation from human OPCs is dependent on the local density of progenitors, the reduced density of progenitors in large lesions may contribute to failed differentiation and remyelination. Together, we show that large volume demyelination in the white matter of the rabbit recapitulates several key features of human MS lesions, and represents an important preclinical model for the assessment of remyelination therapies in human demyelinating disease.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Functional gradients in the human lateral prefrontal cortex revealed by a comprehensive coordinate-based meta-analysis</a></h4>

              
                The human lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) enables flexible goal-directed behavior. Yet, its organizing principles remain actively debated despite decades of research. Meta-analysis efforts to map the LPFC have either been restricted in scope or suffered from limited expressivity in meta-analysis tools. The latter short-coming hinders the complexity of questions that can be expressed in a meta-analysis and hence limits the specificity of structure-function associations. Here, we adopt NeuroLang, a novel approach to meta-analysis based on first-order probabilistic logic programming, to infer the organizing principles of the LPFC with greater specificity from 14,371 neuroimaging publications. Our results reveal a rostrocaudal and a dorsoventral gradient, respectively explaining the most and second-most variance in whole-brain meta-analytic connectivity in the LPFC. Moreover, we find a cross-study agreement on a spectrum of increasing abstraction from caudal to rostral LPFC both in specific network connectivity and structure-function associations that supports a domain-general role for the mid-LPFC. Furthermore, meta-analyzing inter-hemispheric asymmetries along the rostrocaudal gradient reveals specific associations with topics of language, memory, response inhibition, and error processing. Overall, we provide a comprehensive mapping of the organizing principles of task-dependent activity in the LPFC, grounding future hypothesis generation on a quantitative overview of past findings.

                Genome-wide transcriptomic interrogation of organoids and 3D tissue models are increasingly used for characterizing drug, toxicity responses and neurodevelopmental disorders. We established here a neuro-toxicogenomic assay by utilizing 'minibrain', a human in vitro 3D brain model system and a low-cost, highly multiplexable RNA-seq methodology (BRB-seq) for screening the effect of trimethyltin chloride (TMT) induced neurotoxicity. We demonstrate that transcriptomic profiling is insightful to the cellular composition and regional identity of the minibrain. Further, we characterize the transcriptomic changes associated with the dose-time neurotoxic response of minibrain upon exposure to TMT. The distinct gene expression changes and molecular candidates identified with our pipeline provides insight to map the key events involved in the adverse outcome pathway of TMT associated neurotoxicity. We identify processes such as endoplasmic reticulum stress, dysregulation of synaptic genes and downregulation of neuron-morphology associated genes upon exposure to TMT. In response to TMT, we identify activation of an early response homeostatic mechanism in minibrain and an interplay of STAT pathways correlating with the dose severity. In this study, we present a neuro-toxicogenomic assay that demonstrates the power of a low-cost transcriptomic screening to study chemical induced neurotoxicity.

                Sleep is required for the full expression of plasticity during the visual critical period (CP). However, the precise role of rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep in this process is undetermined. Previous studies in rodents indicate that REM sleep weakens cortical circuits following MD, but this has been explored in only one class of cortical neuron (layer 5 apical dendrites). We investigated the role of REM sleep in ocular dominance plasticity (ODP) in layer 2/3 neurons using 2-photon calcium imaging in non-anesthetized CP mice. In contrast to findings in layer 5 neurons, we find that REM sleep promotes changes consistent with synaptic strengthening and weakening. This supports recent suggestions that the effects of sleep on plasticity are highly dependent upon the type of circuit and preceding waking experience.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A survey of neurophysiological differentiation across mouse visual brain areas and timescales</a></h4>

              
                Neurophysiological differentiation (ND), a metric that quantifies the number of distinct activity states that the brain or its part visits over a period of time, has been used as a correlate of meaningfulness or subjective perception of visual stimuli. ND has largely been studied in non-invasive human whole-brain recordings where spatial resolution is limited. However, it is likely that perception is supported by discrete populations of spiking neurons rather than the whole brain. Therefore, in this study, we use Neuropixels recordings from the mouse brain to characterize the ND metric within neural populations recorded at single-cell resolution in localized regions. Using the spiking activity of thousands of simultaneously recorded neurons spanning 6 visual cortical areas as well as the visual thalamus, we show that the ND of stimulus-evoked activity of the entire visual cortex is higher for naturalistic stimuli relative to artificial ones. This finding holds in most individual areas throughout the visual hierarchy as well. For animals performing an image change detection task, ND of the entire visual cortex (though not individual areas) is higher for successful detection compared to failed trials, consistent with the assumed perception of the stimulus. Analysis of spiking activity allows us to characterize the ND metric across a wide range of timescales from 10s of milliseconds to a few seconds. This analysis reveals that although ND of activity of single neurons is often maximized at an optimal timescale around 100 ms, the optimum shifts to under 5 ms for ND of neuronal ensembles. Finally, we find that the ND of activations in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained on an image classification task shows distinct trends relative to the mouse visual system: ND is often higher for less naturalistic stimuli and varies by orders of magnitude across the hierarchy, compared to modest variation in the mouse brain. Together, these results suggest that ND computed on cellular-level neural recordings can be a useful tool highlighting cell populations that may be involved in subjective perception.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Genetic control of neuronal activity enhances axonal growth only on permissive substrates</a></h4>

              
                Neural tissue has limited regenerative ability, to cope with that, in the recent years a diverse set of novel tools have been used to tailor neurostimulation therapies and promote functional regeneration after axonal injuries. In this report, we explore cell-specific methods to modulate neuronal activity, including optogenetics and chemogenetics to assess the effect of specific neuronal stimulation in the promotion of axonal regeneration after injury. We found that opto- or chemogenetic modulations of neuronal activity on both dorsal root ganglia and corticospinal motor neurons increase their axonal growth capacity only on permissive substrates.

	<p>The emergence of cognitive impairment and dementia in people with Lewy body spectrum disorders (LBS) significantly impacts the quality of life of the individual and their care partner. Coping well with the condition may depend, in part, on the degree of psychological resilience or capacity to &amp;amp;lsquo;bounce back&amp;amp;rsquo; from adversity. We explored resilience in people with Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease mild cognitive disorder or dementia, or dementia with Lewy bodies, and their care partners, and its relation to outcomes related to their mental well-being and quality of life. This exploratory, cross-sectional study recruited 76 participant-dyads. Resilience, quality of life, depression, anxiety, and relationship satisfaction were evaluated in both members of the dyad. In care partners, care burden and stress were also assessed. Over 70% of both care partners and recipients reported high levels of resilience. Lower resilience in both members of the dyad was associated with higher anxiety and lower quality of life. Additionally, lower resilience in care partners was associated with lower well-being, relationship satisfaction, and higher burden and stress. Resilience in persons with LBS and their care partners is important to consider when assessing mental health, relationship, and care burden outcomes, acting as a focus of intervention to support positive outcomes.</p>

	<p>Multimedia technologies and virtual reality offer unique possibilities to manipulate sensory, motor, interpersonal, and cognitive processes contributing to atypical developmental trajectories, thus holding an explosive potential to design innovative and engaging interventions. However, there has been little progress in developing interventions that go beyond the patient&amp;amp;rsquo;s diagnosis or the fascination of technology and rather spring from a deep understanding of the specific neuropsychological processes to be nurtured in individuals. This perspective paper outlines how recent insights from developmental cognitive neuroscience can be leveraged to promote children&amp;amp;rsquo;s multidimensional development and highlight future directions and challenges for innovating both research and clinical practice. Finally, we focus on some practical examples of multimedia and virtual reality activities we have designed to stimulate bodily-self experiences, which are crucial for building up a coherent sense of self and lay the foundation for interacting with the external world. Atypical bodily self is an early marker of heterogeneous neurodevelopmental conditions (such as autism spectrum disorders) and seems to be under-targeted in research and clinical approaches.</p>

	<p>Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (AD) does not present uniform symptoms or a uniform rate of progression in all cases. The classification of subtypes can be based on clinical symptoms or patterns of pathological brain alterations. Imaging techniques may allow for the identification of AD subtypes and their differentiation from other neurodegenerative diseases already at an early stage. In this review, the strengths and weaknesses of current clinical imaging methods are described. These include positron emission tomography (PET) to image cerebral glucose metabolism and pathological amyloid or tau deposits. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is more widely available than PET. It provides information on structural or functional changes in brain networks and their relation to AD subtypes. Amyloid PET provides a very early marker of AD but does not distinguish between AD subtypes. Regional patterns of pathology related to AD subtypes are observed with tau and glucose PET, and eventually as atrophy patterns on MRI. Structural and functional network changes occur early in AD but have not yet provided diagnostic specificity.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>This study aimed to elucidate the molecular features of inclusion body myositis (IBM).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We performed RNA sequencing analysis of muscle biopsy samples from 67 participants, consisting of 58 patients of myositis with the pathological finding of CD8-positive T cells invading non-necrotic muscle fibers expressing major histocompatibility complex class I (43 IBM, 6 polymyositis, and 9 unclassifiable myositis), and 9 controls.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Cluster analysis, principal component analysis, and pathway analysis showed that differentially expressed genes and pathways identified in IBM and polymyositis were mostly comparable. However, pathways related to cell adhesion molecules were upregulated in IBM as compared with polymyositis and controls (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.01). Notably, <i>CDH1,</i> which encodes the epidermal cell junction protein cadherin 1, was overexpressed in the muscles of IBM, which was validated by another RNA-sequencing dataset from previous publications. Western blotting confirmed the presence of mature cadherin 1 protein in the muscles of IBM. Immunohistochemical staining confirmed the positivity for anti-cadherin 1 antibody in the muscles of IBM while there was no muscle fiber positive for anti-cadherin 1 antibody in immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy, antisynthetase syndrome, and controls. The fibers stained with anti-cadherin 1 antibody did not have rimmed vacuoles or abnormal protein accumulation. Experimental skeletal muscle regeneration and differentiation systems showed that <i>CDH1</i> is expressed during skeletal muscle regeneration and differentiation.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p><i>CDH1</i> was detected as a differentially expressed gene and immunohistochemistry showed that cadherin 1 exists in the muscles of IBM while it was rarely seen in those of other idiopathic inflammatory myopathies. Cadherin 1 upregulation in muscle could provide a valuable clue to the pathological mechanisms of IBM.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/inpress.rss">Going beyond primary motor cortex to improve brain–computer interfaces</a></h4>

              
                Brain–computer interfaces (BCIs) for movement restoration typically decode the user’s intent from neural activity in their primary motor cortex (M1) and use this information to enable ‘mental control’ of an external device. Here, we argue that activity in M1 has both too little and too much information for optimal decoding: too little, in that many regions beyond it contribute unique motor outputs and have movement-related information that is absent or otherwise difficult to resolve from M1 activity; and too much, in that motor commands are tangled up with nonmotor processes such as attention and feedback processing, potentially hindering decoding.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Microglia integration into human midbrain organoids leads to increased neuronal maturation and functionality.</a></h4>

              
                The human brain is a complex, three-dimensional structure. To better recapitulate brain complexity, recent efforts have focused on the development of human specific midbrain organoids. Human iPSC-derived midbrain organoids consist of differentiated and functional neurons, which contain active synapses, as well as astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. However, the absence of microglia, with their ability to remodel neuronal networks and phagocytose apoptotic cells and debris, represents a major disadvantage for the current midbrain organoid systems. Additionally, neuro-inflammation related disease modeling is not possible in the absence of microglia. So far, no studies about the effects of human iPSC-derived microglia on midbrain organoid neural cells have been published. Here we describe an approach to derive microglia from human iPSCs and integrate them into iPSC-derived midbrain organoids. Using single nuclear RNA Sequencing, we provide a detailed characterization of microglia in midbrain organoids as well as the influence of their presence on the other cells of the organoids. Furthermore, we describe the effects that microglia have on cell death and oxidative stress-related gene expression. Finally, we show that microglia in midbrain organoids affect synaptic remodeling and increase neuronal excitability. Altogether, we show a more suitable system to further investigate brain development, as well as neurodegenerative diseases and neuro-inflammation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A snapshot of brain and cognition in healthy mid-life and older adults</a></h4>

              
                Deficits in memory are seen as a canonical sign of ageing and a prodrome to dementia in older adults. However, the nature of cognitive and brain changes across a wider aperture of adulthood is not well known. We quantify the relationship between cognitive function and brain morphology from mid-life to older adulthood, and the influence of age, sex, amyloid and genetic risk for dementia. We analyzed three observational cohorts (PISA, AIBL, ADNI) with cognitive, genetic and neuroimaging measures comprising a total of 1570 healthy mid-life and older adults (mean age 72, range 49-90 years, 1330 males) and 1365 age- and sex-matched adults with mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer's disease. Among healthy adults, we find robust modes of co-variation between regional sulcal width and multidomain cognitive function that change from mid-life to the older age range. The most prominent cortical changes in mid-life are predominantly associated with changes in executive functions, whereas they are most strongly associated with poorer memory function in older age. These cognitive changes are accompanied by an age-dependent pattern of sulcal widening. Amyloid exerts a weak, but significant, influence on cognition, but not on sulcal width. The APOE {epsilon}4 allele also exerts a weak influence on cognition, but only significantly in the (larger and older) AIBL cohort. These findings provide new insights into brain and cognition in mid-life and older adults, suggesting that cognitive screening in mid-life cohorts should encompass executive functions as well as memory.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Characterizing Variability of Audiovisual Speech Perception Based on Periodic and Aperiodic Features of Prestimulus Brain Activity</a></h4>

              
                Burgeoning pieces of evidence support the idea that differences in the properties of large-scale cortical networks underlie perceptual variability. Here, employing psychophysical experiments in tandem with electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings, we explored the inter-individual and inter-trial differences in McGurk percept to probe the underlying brain dynamics before (prestimulus) and after (poststimulus) the stimulus presentation. Initially, based on our participants' (n = 18) overall susceptibility to the McGurk effect, we categorized them into two groups - 'rare' and 'frequent' groups of perceivers. Subsequently, we investigated the differences in their neuronal dynamics manifested in the oscillatory properties of the prestimulus and compared it with the poststimulus EEG signals during the McGurk perception (audio- /pa/, video- /ka/) and, also during the perception of the congruent audiovisual (AV) stimuli (syllables /pa/, /ta/, and /ka/). We primarily focused on the power spectrum components (periodic oscillations and aperiodic components) and global coherence. At the inter-individual and inter-trial level, we observed that for the prestimulus duration, the 'rare' perceivers' aperiodic (or "background" 1/f) component elicited a lower beta band (15-30 Hz) and gamma band (31-45 Hz) activity than the 'frequent' group of perceivers. Moreover, the periodic oscillations for the 'rare' group showed significance in the alpha (8-12 Hz) and beta bands during the prestimulus time window. 'Rare' perceivers also showed an increased global coherence in the theta (4-7 Hz), alpha, and beta bands but a lower gamma band activity than the 'frequent' perceivers. Finally, 'rare' perceivers elicited higher cross-hemispheric connectivity (imaginary coherence) than the 'frequent' group at the source across different frequency bands, supporting the notion that the fluctuations in the distributed large-scale network underlie the perceptual variability in speech across individuals.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Multiscale computer modeling of spreading depolarization in brain slices</a></h4>

              
                Spreading depolarization (SD) is a slow-moving wave of neuronal depolarization accompanied by a breakdown of ion concentration homeostasis, followed by long periods of neuronal silence (spreading depression), and associated with several neurological conditions. We developed multiscale (ions to tissue slice) computer models of SD in brain slices using the NEURON simulator: 36,000 neurons (2 voltage-gated ion channels; 3 leak channels; 3 ion exchangers/pumps) in the extracellular space (ECS) of a slice (1 mm sides, varying thickness) with ion (K+ , Cl-, Na+) and O2 diffusion and equilibration with a surrounding bath. Glia and neurons cleared K+ from the ECS via Na+/K+ pumps. SD propagated through the slices at realistic speeds of 2-5 mm/min, which was augmented by 25-30% in models incorporating the effects of hypoxia or of propionate. In both cases, the speedup was mediated principally by ECS shrinkage. Our model allows us to make the following testable predictions: 1. SD can be inhibited by enlarging ECS volume; 2. SD velocity will be greater in areas with greater neuronal density, total neuronal volume, or larger/more dendrites; 3. SD is all-or-none: initiating K+ bolus properties have little impact on SD speed; 4. Slice thickness influences SD due to relative hypoxia in the slice core, exacerbated by SD in a pathological cycle; 5. Higher neuronal spike rates and faster spread will be observed in the core than the periphery of perfused slice during SD.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The Retinal Basis of Photoaversion in Neonatal Mice</a></h4>

              
                Aversive responses to bright light (photoaversion) require signaling from the eye to the brain. Melanopsin-expressing intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) encode absolute light intensity and are thought to provide the light signals for photoaversion. Consistent with this, neonatal mice exhibit photoaversion prior to the developmental onset of image vision, and melanopsin deletion abolishes photoaversion in neonates. It is not well understood how the population of ipRGCs, which constitutes multiple physiologically distinct types (denoted M1-M6 in mouse) encodes light stimuli to produce an aversive response. Here, we provide several lines of evidence that M1 ipRGCs that lack the Brn3b transcription factor drive photoaversion in neonatal mice. First, neonatal mice lacking TRPC6 and TRPC7 ion channels failed to turn away from bright light, while two photon Ca2+ imaging of their acutely isolated retinas revealed reduced photosensitivity in M1 ipRGCs, but not other ipRGC types. Second, mice in which all ipRGC types except for Brn3b-negative M1 ipRGCs are ablated, exhibited normal photoaversion. Third, pharmacological blockade or genetic knockout of gap junction channels expressed by ipRGCs, which reduces the light sensitivity of M2-M6 ipRGCs in the neonatal retina, had small effects on photoaversion only at the brightest light intensities. Finally, M1s were not strongly depolarized by spontaneous retinal waves, a robust source of activity in the developing retina that depolarizes all other ipRGC types. M1s therefore constitute a separate information channel between the neonatal retina and brain that could ensure behavioral responses to light but not spontaneous retinal waves.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Core Transcription Programs Controlling Injury-Induced Neurodegeneration of Retinal Ganglion Cells</a></h4>

              
                Neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by neuronal death and regenerative failure. However, gene regulatory programs governing how initial neuronal injuries lead to neuronal death remain poorly understood. In adult mice, optic nerve crush (ONC) injury, which severs all axons of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), results in massive death of axotomized RGCs and regenerative failure of survivors. We performed an in vivo CRISPR/Cas9-based genome-wide screen of 1893 transcription factors (TFs) to seek repressors of RGC survival and axon regeneration following ONC. In parallel, we profiled the epigenetic and transcriptional landscapes of injured RGCs by ATAC-seq and RNA-seq to identify critical injury responsive TFs and their targets. Remarkably, these independent analyses converged on a set of four ATF/CEBP transcription factors: ATF3, ATF4, C/EBPg; and CHOP (Ddit3), as critical regulators of survival. Further studies indicate that these TFs contribute to two pro-death transcriptional programs: ATF3/CHOP preferentially regulate pathways activated by cytokines and innate immunity, whereas ATF4/C/EBP{gamma} regulate pathways engaged by intrinsic neuronal stressors. Manipulation of these TFs also protects RGCs in an experimental model of glaucoma, a prevalent disease in which RGCs die. Together, our results reveal core transcription programs that transform an initial axonal insult into a degenerative result and suggest novel strategies for treating neurodegenerative diseases.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Tonic GluD1 channel current is independent of G protein activity in the dorsal raphe nucleus</a></h4>

              
                Previously, using electrophysiological recordings from adult male and female mouse brain slices containing the dorsal raphe nucleus, we showed that GluD1R channels carry ionic current and are modulated via activation of Gq-coupled a1-adrenergic receptors (a1-AR) in a GTP-dependent manner (Gantz et al., 2020). GluD1R channels also carry a tonic cation current, generally ~-20 pA at subthreshold membrane potentials (Gantz et al., 2020). The origin of tonic GluD1R channel current is unknown. Here, using the same preparation, we show there is no role of on-going G protein-coupled receptor activity in generating or sustaining tonic GluD1R channel current. Neither augmentation nor disruption of G protein activity had an effect on tonic GluD1R current. These results reveal that tonic GluD1R current arises from a mechanism separate from on-going activity of G protein-coupled receptors. Under current clamp, block of GluD1R channels hyperpolarized the membrane by ~10 mV at subthreshold potentials leading to reduced excitability. Thus, GluD1R channels carry a G protein-independent tonic current that contributes to subthreshold drive of action potential firing in the dorsal raphe nucleus.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Development and validation of Arc nanobodies: new tools for probing Arc dynamics and function</a></h4>

              
                Activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated (Arc) protein plays key roles in long-term synaptic plasticity, memory, and cognitive flexibility. However, an integral understanding of Arc mechanisms is lacking. Arc is proposed to function as an interaction hub in neuronal dendrites and the nucleus, yet Arc can also form retrovirus-like capsids with proposed roles in intercellular communication. Here, we sought to develop anti-Arc nanobodies (ArcNbs) as new tools for probing Arc dynamics and function. Six ArcNbs representing different clonal lines were selected from immunized alpaca. Immunoblotting with recombinant ArcNbs fused to a small ALFA-epitope tag demonstrated binding to recombinant Arc as well as endogenous Arc from rat cortical tissue. ALFA-ArcNb also provided efficient immunoprecipitation of stimulus-induced Arc after carbachol-treatment of SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells and induction of long-term potentiation in the rat dentate gyrus in vivo. Epitope mapping showed that all Nbs recognize the Arc C-terminal region containing the retroviral Gag capsid homology domain, comprised of tandem N- and C-lobes. ArcNbs E5 and H11 selectively bound the N-lobe, which harbors a peptide ligand binding pocket specific to mammals. Four additional ArcNbs bound the region containing the C-lobe and terminal tail. For use as genetically encoded fluorescent intrabodies, we show that ArcNbs fused to mScarlet-I are uniformly expressed, without aggregation, in the cytoplasm and nucleus of HEK293FT cells. Finally, mScarlet-I-ArcNb H11 expressed as intrabody selectively bound the N-lobe and enabled co-immunoprecipitation of full-length intracellular Arc. ArcNbs are versatile tools for live-cell labeling and purification of Arc and analysis of capsid domain specific functions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Brainstem somatostatin-expressing cells control the emotional regulation of pain behavior</a></h4>

              
                In mammals, threat-related behavior is typically induced by a noxious physical stressor and is associated with a broad range of behavioral responses such as freezing and avoidance. These behavioral responses are associated with the regulation of pain responses allowing individuals to cope with noxious stimuli. Whereas the structures and mechanisms involved in pain behavior are well documented, little is known about the precise neuronal circuits mediating the emotional regulation of pain behavior. Here we used a combination of behavioral, anatomical, optogenetic, and electrophysiological approaches to show that somatostatin-expressing neurons in the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray matter (vlPAG SST cells) promote antinociceptive responses during the presentation of conditioned stimuli (CS) predicting footshocks. Whereas the optogenetic inhibition of vlPAG SST cells during CS presentation promoted analgesia, their optogenetic activation reduced analgesia by potentiating pain responses in the spinal cord through a relay in the rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM). Together these results identify a brainstem circuit composed of vlPAG SST cells specifically projecting to the RVM and mediating fear conditioned analgesia (FCA) to regulate pain responses during threatful situations.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Network architecture producing swing to stance transitions in an insect walking system</a></h4>

              
                The walking system of the stick insect is one of the most thoroughly described invertebrate systems. We know a lot about the role of sensory input in the control of stepping of a single leg. However, the neuronal organization and connectivity of the central neural networks underlying the rhythmic activation and coordination of leg muscles still remain elusive. It is assumed that these networks can couple in the absence of phasic sensory input due to the observation of spontaneous recurrent patterns (SRPs) of coordinated motor activity equivalent to fictive stepping-phase transitions. Here we sought to quantify the phase of motor activity within SRPs in the isolated and interconnected meso- and metathoracic ganglia. We show that SRPs occur not only in the meso-, but also in the metathoracic ganglia of the stick insect, discovering a qualitative difference between them. We construct a network based on neurophysiological data capable of reproducing the measured SRP phases to investigate this difference. By comparing network output to the biological measurements we confirm the plausibility of the architecture and provide a hypothesis to account for these qualitative differences. The neural architecture we present couples individual central pattern generators to reproduce the fictive stepping-phase transitions observed in deafferented stick insect preparations after pharmacological activation, providing insights into the neural architecture underlying coordinated locomotion.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Sex differences in predictors and regional patterns of brain-age-gap estimates</a></h4>

              
                Background: The brain-age-gap estimate (brainAGE) quantifies the difference between chronological age and age predicted by applying machine-learning models to neuroimaging data, and is considered a biomarker of brain health. Understanding sex-differences in brainAGE is a significant step toward precision medicine. Methods: Global and local brainAGE (G-brainAGE and L-brainAGE, respectively) were computed by applying machine learning algorithms to brain structural magnetic resonance imaging data from 1113 healthy young adults (54.45% females; age range: 22-37 years) participating in the Human Connectome Project. Sex-differences were determined in G-brainAGE and L-brainAGE. Random forest regression was used to determine sex-specific associations between G-brainAGE and non-imaging measures pertaining to sociodemographic characteristics and mental, physical, and cognitive functions. Results: L-brainAGE showed sex-specific differences in brain ageing. In females, compared to males, L-brainAGE was higher in the cerebellum and brainstem and lower in the prefrontal cortex and insula. Although sex-differences in G-brainAGE were minimal, associations between G-brainAGE and non-imaging measures differed between sexes with the exception for poor sleep quality, which was common to both. The most important predictor of higher G-brainAGE was non-white race in males and systolic blood pressure in females. Conclusions: The results demonstrate the value of applying sex-specific analyses and machine learning methods to advance our understanding of sex-related differences in factors that influence the rate of brain ageing and provide a foundation for targeted interventions.

                Ensemble representations have been considered as one of strategies that the visual system adopts to cope with its limited capacity. Thus, they include various statistical summaries such as mean, variance, and distributional properties and are formed over many stages of visual processing. The current study proposes a population coding model of ensemble perception to provide a theoretical and computational framework for these various facets of ensemble perception. The proposed model consists of a simple feature layer and a pooling layer. We assumed ensemble representations as population responses in the pooling layer and decoded various statistical properties from population responses. Our model successfully predicted averaging performance in orientation, size, color, and motion direction across different tasks. Furthermore, it predicted variance discrimination performance and the priming effects of feature distributions. Finally, it explained the well-known variance and set size effects and has a potential for explaining the adaptation and clustering effects.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Selective activation of subthalamic nucleus output quantitatively scales movements</a></h4>

              
                The subthalamic nucleus (STN), a diencephalic nucleus strongly connected with the basal ganglia, is a common target for deep brain stimulation (DBS) treatments of Parkinsonian motor symptoms. The STN is thought to suppress movement by enhancing inhibitory basal ganglia output via the indirect pathway, and disrupting STN output using DBS can restore movement in Parkinson's disease. However, previous studies on STN DBS usually relied on electrical stimulation, which cannot selectively target STN output neurons. Moreover, most studies did not measure behavior precisely during STN manipulations. Here we selectively stimulated STN projection neurons, by expressing channelrhodopsin in vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (VGlut2)-positive projection neurons in the STN. We also quantified behavior in freely moving male mice with high spatial and temporal resolution using 3D motion capture at 200 frames per second. We found STN stimulation resulted in movements with very short latencies (10-15 ms). Unilateral stimulation quantitatively determines orientation, head yaw, and head roll consistently in the ipsiversive direction, toward thee side of stimulation. On the other hand, head raising (increased head pitch) was observed after stimulation on either side. Strikingly, a single pulse of light was sufficient to generate movement, and there was a highly linear relationship between stimulation frequency and kinematics. These results question the common assumption that STN suppresses movement; instead they suggest that STN output can precisely specific action parameters via direct projections to brainstem regions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Characterization of second-order mixing effects in reconstructed cross-spectra of random neural fields</a></h4>

              
                Functional connectivity in electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) data is commonly assessed by using measures that are insensitive to instantaneously interacting sources and as such would not give rise to false positive interactions caused by instantaneous mixing of true source signals (first-order mixing). Recent studies, however, have drawn attention to the fact that such measures are still susceptible to instantaneous mixing from lagged sources (i.e. second-order mixing) and that this can lead to a large number of false positive interactions. In this study we relate first- and second-order mixing effects on the cross-spectra of reconstructed source activity to the properties of the resolution operators that are used for the reconstruction. We derive two identities that relate first- and second-order mixing effects to the transformation properties of measurement and source configurations and exploit them to establish several basic properties of signal mixing. First, we provide a characterization of the configurations that are maximally and minimally sensitive to second-order mixing. It turns out that second-order mixing effects are maximal when the measurement locations are far apart and the sources coincide with the measurement locations. Second, we provide a description of second-order mixing effects in the vicinity of the measurement locations in terms of the local geometry of the point-spread functions of the resolution operator. Third, we derive a version of Lagrange's identity for cross-talk functions that establishes the existence of a trade-off between the magnitude of first- and second-order mixing effects. It also shows that, whereas the magnitude of first-order mixing is determined by the inner product of cross-talk functions, the magnitude of second-order mixing is determined by a generalized cross-product of cross-talk functions (the wedge product) which leads to an intuitive geometric understanding of the trade-off. All results are derived within the general framework of random neural fields on cortical manifolds.

In Experiment 1, ninety-four 18-35-year-olds wore an eye-mask while they slept every night for a week and underwent a control condition in which light was not blocked for another week. Five habituation nights were followed by a cognitive battery on the sixth and seventh days. This revealed superior episodic encoding and an improvement on alertness when using the mask. In Experiment 2, thirty-five 18-35-year-olds used a wearable device to monitor sleep with and without the mask. This replicated the encoding benefit and showed that it was predicted by time spent in slow wave sleep. Our findings suggest that wearing an eye-mask during overnight sleep can improve episodic encoding and alertness the next day.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Dopamine and ALK4 signaling synergize to induce PCBP1-mediated alternative splicing of FosB and sustained behavioral sensitization to cocaine</a></h4>

              
                {Delta}FosB, an alternative spliced product of FosB, is an essential component of dopamine-induced reward pathways and a master switch for addiction. However, the molecular mechanisms of its generation and regulation by dopamine signaling are unknown. Here we report that dopamine D1 receptor signaling synergizes with the activin/ALK4/Smad3 pathway to potentiate the generation of {Delta}FosB mRNA in medium spiny neurons (MSNs) of the nucleus-accumbens (NAc) through activation of the RNA binding protein PCBP1, a regulator of mRNA splicing. Concurrent activation of PCBP1 and Smad3 by D1 and ALK4 signaling induced their interaction, nuclear translocation, and binding to sequences in exon-4 and intron-4 of FosB mRNA. Ablation of either ALK4 or PCBP1 in MSNs impaired {Delta}FosB mRNA induction and nuclear translocation of {Delta}FosB protein in response to repeated co-stimulation of D1 and ALK4 receptors. Importantly, ALK4 was required in NAc MSNs of adult mice for behavioral sensitization to cocaine. These findings uncover an unexpected mechanism for {Delta}FosB generation and drug-induced sensitization through convergent dopamine and ALK4 signaling.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Visualizing Synaptic Dopamine Efflux with a 2D Nanofilm</a></h4>

              
                Chemical neurotransmission constitutes one of the fundamental modalities of communication between neurons. Monitoring release of these chemicals has traditionally been difficult to carry out at spatial and temporal scales relevant to neuron function. To understand chemical neurotransmission more fully, we need to improve the spatial and temporal resolutions of measurements for neurotransmitter release. To address this, we engineered a chemi-sensitive, two-dimensional nanofilm that facilitates subcellular visualization of the release and diffusion of the neurochemical dopamine with synaptic resolution, quantal sensitivity, and simultaneously from hundreds of release sites. Using this technology, we were able to monitor the spatiotemporal dynamics of dopamine release in dendritic processes, a poorly understood phenomenon. We found that dopamine release is broadcast from a subset of dendritic processes as hotspots that have a mean spatial spread of ~3.2 m (full width at half maximum) and are observed with a mean spatial frequency of 1 hotspot per ~7.5 m of dendritic length. Major dendrites of dopamine neurons and fine dendritic processes, as well as dendritic arbors and dendrites with no apparent varicose morphology participated in dopamine release. Remarkably, these release hotspots colocalized with Bassoon, suggesting that Bassoon may contribute to organizing active zones in dendrites, similar to its role in axon terminals.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Imbalance of Neuregulin1-ErbB2/3 signaling underlies altered myelin homeostasis in models of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 4H</a></h4>

              
                Charcot Marie Tooth disease (CMT) is one of the most common inherited neurological disorders, affecting either axons from the motor and/or sensory neurons or Schwann cells (SC) of the peripheral nervous system, and caused by more than 100 genes. We previously identified mutations in FGD4, as responsible for CMT4H, an autosomal recessive demyelinating form of CMT. FGD4 encodes FRABIN a GDP/GTP nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), particularly for the small GTPase cdc42. Remarkably, nerves from patients with CMT4H display excessive redundant myelin called outfoldings that arise from focal hypermyelination, suggesting that FRABIN could play a role in the control of PNS myelination. To gain insights into the role of FGD4/FRABIN in SC myelination, we generated a knock-out mouse model, with conditional ablation of fgd4 in SC. We showed that the specific deletion of FRABIN in SCs leads to aberrant myelination in vitro, in dorsal root ganglion (DRG)/SCs cocultures as well in vivo, in distal sciatic nerves. We observed that those myelination defects are related to an upregulation of some interactors of the NRG1 type III/ErbB2/3 signaling pathway, which is known to ensure a proper level of myelination in the PNS. Based on a yeast two- hybrid screen, we identified SNX3 as a new partner of FRABIN, which is involved in the regulation of endocytic trafficking. Interestingly, we showed that loss of FRABIN impairs endocytic trafficking which may contribute to the defective NRG1 type III/ErbB2/3 signaling and myelination. Finally, we showed that the reestablishment of proper levels of the NRG1 type III/ErbB2/3 pathway using Niacin treatment reduces myelin outfoldings in nerves of CMT4H mice. Overall, our work reveals a new role of FRABIN in the regulation of NRG1 type III/ErbB2/3 NRG1signaling and myelination and opens future therapeutic strategies based on the modulation of NRG1 type III/ErbB2/3 NRG1to reduce CMT4H pathology and more generally others demyelinating CMT.

	<p>Does experience with signed language impact the neurocognitive processes recruited by adults solving arithmetic problems? We used event-related potentials (ERPs) to identify the components that are modulated by operation type and problem size in Deaf American Sign Language (ASL) native signers and in hearing English-speaking participants. Participants were presented with single-digit subtraction and multiplication problems in a delayed verification task. Problem size was manipulated in small and large problems with an additional extra-large subtraction condition to equate the overall magnitude of large multiplication problems. Results show comparable behavioral results and similar ERP dissociations across groups. First, an early operation type effect is observed around 200 ms post-problem onset, suggesting that both groups have a similar attentional differentiation for processing subtraction and multiplication problems. Second, for the posterior-occipital component between 240 ms and 300 ms, subtraction problems show a similar modulation with problem size in both groups, suggesting that only subtraction problems recruit quantity-related processes. Control analyses exclude possible perceptual and cross-operation magnitude-related effects. These results are the first evidence that the two operation types rely on distinct cognitive processes within the ASL native signing population and that they are equivalent to those observed in the English-speaking population.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Hippocampal Disinhibition Reduces Contextual and Elemental Fear Conditioning While Sparing the Acquisition of Latent Inhibition</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Hippocampal neural disinhibition, i.e., reduced GABAergic inhibition, is a key feature of schizophrenia pathophysiology. The hippocampus is an important part of the neural circuitry that controls fear conditioning and can also modulate prefrontal and striatal mechanisms, including dopamine signaling, which play a role in salience modulation. Consequently, hippocampal neural disinhibition may contribute to impairments in fear conditioning and salience modulation reported in schizophrenia. Therefore, we examined the effect of ventral hippocampus (VH) disinhibition in male rats on fear conditioning and salience modulation, as reflected by latent inhibition (LI), in a conditioned emotional response (CER) procedure. A flashing light was used as the conditioned stimulus (CS), and conditioned suppression was used to index conditioned fear. In experiment 1, VH disinhibition via infusion of the GABA-A receptor antagonist picrotoxin before CS pre-exposure and conditioning markedly reduced fear conditioning to both the CS and context; LI was evident in saline-infused controls but could not be detected in picrotoxin-infused rats because of the low level of fear conditioning to the CS. In experiment 2, VH picrotoxin infusions only before CS pre-exposure did not affect the acquisition of fear conditioning or LI. Together, these findings indicate that VH neural disinhibition disrupts contextual and elemental fear conditioning, without affecting the acquisition of LI. The disruption of fear conditioning resembles aversive conditioning deficits reported in schizophrenia and may reflect a disruption of neural processing both within the hippocampus and in projection sites of the hippocampus.</p>

                Background:  The purpose of this study is to explore the professional and personal experiences of multidisciplinary healthcare professionals during and following diabetes counselling and empowerment education. Methods:   Everyone who had participated in a diabetes counselling and empowerment course between 2008-2016 was invited to respond to an online survey and follow-up telephone interview if willing. Interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim. The research team used interpretative phenomenology to identify core themes from both the survey and telephone interviews and which captured the impact of empowerment education. Results:  22 doctors, nurses, dieticians, and psychologists completed an online questionnaire. 10 subsequently took part in telephone interviews. Empowerment education changed them from fixers to facilitators. Their transformation included a sense of becoming authentic, ‘being the way I want to be’ in clinical practice and becoming more self-reflective. This affected them personally as well as reinvigorating them professionally. Conclusions: The participants described a personal and professional journey of transformation that included discovering their person-centred philosophy. They adopted a consultation structure that empowered people with diabetes to care for themselves. It can be speculated that participants’ experience of transformation may also guard against professional burnout.

                Background: Shoulder biomechanics cannot be measured directly in living persons. While different glenohumeral joint simulators have been developed to investigate the role of the glenohumeral muscles in shoulder biomechanics, a standard for these simulators has not been defined. With this scoping review we want to describe available ex-vivo experimental strategies for assessing unconstrained shoulder biomechanics. Objective: The scoping review aims at identifying methodological and/or experimental studies describing or involving ex-vivo simulators that assess unconstrained shoulder biomechanics and synthesizing their strengths and limitations. Inclusion criteria: All unconstrained glenohumeral joint simulators published in connection with ex-vivo or mechanical simulation experiments will be included. Studies on glenohumeral simulators with active components to mimic the muscles will be included. We will exclude studies where the experiment is static or the motion is induced through an external guide, e.g., a robotic device. Methods: We will perform database searching in PubMed, Embase via Elsevier and Web of Science. Two reviewers will independently assess full texts of selected abstracts. Direct backward and forward citation tracking on included articles will be conducted. We will narratively synthesize the results and derive recommendations for designing ex-vivo simulators for assessing unconstrained shoulder biomechanics.

                From the viewpoint of sustainability, annual soil erosion should be controlled below an erosion level. Palau is an island in the Micronesia region of the western Pacific Ocean. The island receives heavy rainfall and has steep slopes, so 80% of the land is categorized within the most fragile rank (T factor = 1) in soil erosion. We tested several methods of preventing soil erosion on the land, with a slope of 15.4° (13.4°–17.3°), cultivated the land, planted sweet potatoes, and compared the amount of soil erosion. Surprisingly, there was no erosion at all in all plots (including control plots), although 24 rainfall events occurred and the USLE equation predicted 32 tons per ha of soil erosion in the cropping period. For the parameters of the USLE equation used in this study, only the K factor was not measured (cited from a USDA report). Namely, the K factor estimated by soil texture was larger than the actual value. Measuring the K factor in the fields can expand Palau's sustainable agricultural land.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Global stability analysis of hepatitis B virus dynamics [version 2; peer review: 1 approved]</a></h4>

              
                This paper considers the impact of an acute individual's spontaneous clearance, recovery of a chronic individual with full immunity, and risk factor reduction on a hepatitis B virus (HBV) model. The existence and the positivity solution of the model are established. The model threshold quantity is defined and sensitivity analysis is analyzed to demonstrate the effect of various parameters on the spread of the virus. The global stability analysis of the equilibrium is shown using Lyapunov and comparison theorem methods. Finally, computational simulation is presented to validate the analytical solution. The results show that treatment, spontaneous clearance and reduction of the risk factor are highly successful in transmitting and regulating HBV transmission. The effective measure of these parameters as substantiated by our simulations, providing an excellent control method of the transmissible infection of HBV.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Transmission of yellow fever vaccine virus from breast feeding mothers to their infants: reporting of yellow fever virus (YFV) RNA detection in milk specimens [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Because of yellow fever’s serious impact on health, vaccination is the principal strategy to control the disease. Administration of the yellow fever vaccine to breastfeeding women should be before they complete 9 months post-delivery, in order to prevent transmission of the yellow fever vaccine virus to their infants through breast feeding. This study aimed to confirm whether the excretion of yellow fever vaccine virus is in milk of vaccinated breastfeeding mothers and to confirm the probable transmission to their infants through breast milk. Methods: Samples were taken as follows: one serum specimen was taken 3-14 days after the date of the vaccination, and breast milk specimens were taken at four different time points between 3-4 days apart. Specimens were obtained from eight nursing mothers, who received the YVF vaccine (17DD). Mothers were asymptomatic before and after the vaccine administration but their infants developed symptoms after administration. Maternal serum samples were tested for YFV specific IgM antibodies through immuno-fluorescent assay (IFA). RNA was extracted from serum and breast milk specimens and YFV RNA screened using real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Results: In total, five mothers (62.5%) were positive for YFV and two mothers (25%) had YFV RNA in serum. Among milk specimens, YFV RNA was detected during the four different mentioned collection times as follows (positive milk specimens/total milk specimens): 3/8 (37.5 %), 4/6 (66.6%) and 1/4(25%). RNA was completely undetectable in the last collection time. Conclusions: YFV transmission from mothers to their babies through breast-feeding was highly probable indicated by the temporal relationship to mother’s YF vaccination.
