              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13859">Neuromodulation-inspired gated associative memory networks:extended memory retrieval and emergent multistability</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2512.13859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical autoassociative memory models have been central to understanding emergent computations in recurrent neural circuits across diverse biological contexts. However, they typically neglect neuromodulatory agents that are known to strongly shape memory capacity and stability. Here we introduce a minimal, biophysically motivated associative memory network where neuropeptide-like signals are modeled by a self-adaptive, activity-dependent gating mechanism. Using many-body simulations and dynamical mean-field theory, we show that such gating fundamentally reorganizes the attractor structure: the network bypasses the classical spin-glass transition, maintaining robust, high-overlap retrieval far beyond the standard critical capacity, without shrinking basins of attraction. Mechanistically, the gate stabilizes transient ghost remnants of stored patterns even far above the Hopfield limit, converting them into multistable attractors. These results demonstrate that neuromodulation-like gating alone can dramatically enhance associative memory capacity, eliminate the sharp Hopfield-style catastrophic breakdown, and reshape the memory landscape, providing a simple, general route to richer memory dynamics and computational capabilities in neuromodulated circuits and neuromorphic architectures.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14160">Forecasting Excessive Anesthesia Depth Using EEG {\alpha}-Spindle Dynamics and Machine Learning</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2512.14160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objectives. Accurately predicting transitions to anesthetic drugs overdosage is a critical challenge in general anesthesia as it requires the identification of EEG indicators relevant for anticipating the evolution of the depth of anesthesia. Methods. In this study, we introduce a real-time, data-driven framework based on alpha spindle dynamics extracted from frontal EEG recordings. Using Empirical Mode Decomposition, we segment transient alpha spindle events and extract statistical features such as amplitude, duration, frequency, and suppression intervals. We apply these features to train a Light Gradient Boosting Machine, LGBM, classifier on a clinical EEG dataset spanning induction, maintenance, and emergence phases of general anesthesia. Results. Our model accurately classifies anesthesia phases with over 80 percent accuracy and anticipates the onset of isoelectric suppression, a marker of anesthetic drugs overdosage, with 96 percent accuracy up to 90 seconds in advance. Conclusion. The spindle-based metrics provides a non-invasive, interpretable, and predictive approach. This real-time method can be used to forecast unintentional anesthetic drugs overdosage, enabling proactive anesthesia management based solely on EEG signals. Significance. This new method is the first to provide a way to prevent too deep anesthesia and its consequence for the well-being of patients after the recovery from anesthesia.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14359">Temporal interference stimulation for deep brain neuromodulation in humans</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2512.14359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For decades, focal non-invasive neuromodulation of deep brain regions has not been possible because of the steep depth-focality trade-off of conventional non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) techniques, such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) or classical transcranial electric stimulation (tES). Deep brain stimulation has therefore largely relied on invasive approaches in clinical populations, requiring surgery. Transcranial Temporal Interference Stimulation (tTIS) has recently emerged as a promising method to overcome this challenge and allows for the first time focal non-invasive electrical deep brain stimulation. The method, which was first validated through computational modeling and rodent work, has now been successfully translated to humans to target deep brain regions such as the hippocampus or striatum. In this Perspective, we present current evidence for tTIS-based neuromodulation, underlying mechanisms and discuss future developments of this promising technology. More specifically, we highlight key opportunities and challenges for fundamental neuroscience as well as for the design of new interventions in neuropsychiatric disorders. We also discuss the status of understanding and challenges regarding the basic mechanisms of action of tTIS and possible lines of technological innovation to optimize stimulation, in particular in terms of intensity and focality. Overall, we suggest that following the first proof-of-concepts, an important multidisciplinary research effort is now required to further validate the use of tTIS in multiple applications, understand its underlying principles and optimize the technology in the view of a wider scientific and clinical deployment.

                arXiv:2512.13724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neurological diseases are the leading global cause of disability, yet most lack disease-modifying treatments. We present PROTON, a heterogeneous graph transformer that generates testable hypotheses across molecular, organoid, and clinical systems. To evaluate PROTON, we apply it to Parkinson's disease (PD), bipolar disorder (BD), and Alzheimer's disease (AD). In PD, PROTON linked genetic risk loci to genes essential for dopaminergic neuron survival and predicted pesticides toxic to patient-derived neurons, including the insecticide endosulfan, which ranked within the top 1.29% of predictions. In silico screens performed by PROTON reproduced six genome-wide $\alpha$-synuclein experiments, including a split-ubiquitin yeast two-hybrid system (normalized enrichment score [NES] = 2.30, FDR-adjusted $p < 1 \times 10^{-4}$), an ascorbate peroxidase proximity labeling assay (NES = 2.16, FDR $< 1 \times 10^{-4}$), and a high-depth targeted exome sequencing study in 496 synucleinopathy patients (NES = 2.13, FDR $< 1 \times 10^{-4}$). In BD, PROTON predicted calcitriol as a candidate drug that reversed proteomic alterations observed in cortical organoids derived from BD patients. In AD, we evaluated PROTON predictions in health records from $n = 610,524$ patients at Mass General Brigham, confirming that five PROTON-predicted drugs were associated with reduced seven-year dementia risk (minimum hazard ratio = 0.63, 95% CI: 0.53-0.75, $p < 1 \times 10^{-7}$). PROTON generated neurological hypotheses that were evaluated across molecular, organoid, and clinical systems, defining a path for AI-driven discovery in neurological disease.

Abstract: Futrell and Mahowald present a useful framework bridging technology-oriented deep learning systems and explanation-oriented linguistic theories. Unfortunately, the target article's focus on generative text-based LLMs fundamentally limits fruitful interactions with linguistics, as many interesting questions on human language fall outside what is captured by written text. We argue that audio-based deep learning models can and should play a crucial role.

                arXiv:2505.16861v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Computational neuroscience has traditionally focused on isolated scales, limiting understanding of brain function across multiple levels. While microscopic models capture biophysical details of neurons, macroscopic models describe large-scale network dynamics. Integrating these scales, however, remains a significant challenge. In this study, we present a novel co-simulation framework that bridges these levels by integrating the neural simulator Arbor with The Virtual Brain (TVB) platform. Arbor enables detailed simulations from single-compartment neurons to populations of such cells, while TVB models whole-brain dynamics based on anatomical features and the mean neural activity of a brain region. By linking these simulators for the first time, we provide an example of how to model and investigate the onset of seizures in specific areas and their propagation to the whole brain. This framework employs an MPI intercommunicator for real-time bidirectional interaction, translating between discrete spikes from Arbor and continuous TVB activity. Its fully modular design enables independent model selection for each scale, requiring minimal effort to translate activity across simulators. The novel Arbor-TVB co-simulator allows replacement of TVB nodes with biologically realistic neuron populations, offering insights into seizure propagation and potential intervention strategies. The integration of Arbor and TVB marks a significant advancement in multi-scale modeling, providing a comprehensive computational framework for studying neural disorders and optimizing treatments.

                arXiv:2512.10984v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose Symmetry-Loss, a brain-inspired algorithmic principle that enforces invariance and equivariance through a differentiable constraint derived from environmental symmetries. The framework models learning as the iterative refinement of an effective symmetry group, paralleling developmental processes in which cortical representations align with the world's structure. By minimizing structural surprise, i.e. deviations from symmetry consistency, Symmetry-Loss operationalizes a Free-Energy--like objective for representation learning. This formulation bridges predictive-coding and group-theoretic perspectives, showing how efficient, stable, and compositional representations can emerge from symmetry-based self-organization. The result is a general computational mechanism linking developmental learning in the brain with principled representation learning in artificial systems.

                arXiv:2512.13696v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Heat pump systems are critical components in modern energy-efficient buildings, yet their operational stress detection remains challenging due to complex thermodynamic interactions and limited real-world data. This paper presents a novel Physics-Guided Deep Neural Network (PG-DNN) approach for heat pump stress classification using the When2Heat dataset, containing 131,483 samples with 656 features across 26 European countries. The methodology integrates physics-guided feature selection and class definition with a deep neural network architecture featuring 5 hidden layers and dual regularization strategies. The model achieves 78.1\% test accuracy and 78.5% validation accuracy, demonstrating significant improvements over baseline approaches: +5.0% over shallow networks, +4.0% over limited feature sets, and +2.0% over single regularization strategies. Comprehensive ablation studies validate the effectiveness of physics-guided feature selection, variable thresholding for realistic class distribution, and cross-country energy pattern analysis. The proposed system provides a production-ready solution for heat pump stress detection with 181,348 parameters and 720 seconds training time on AMD Ryzen 9 7950X with RTX 4080 hardware.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13707">Modular connectivity in neural networks emerges from Poisson noise-motivated regularisation, and promotes robustness and compositional generalisation</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2512.13707v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Circuits in the brain commonly exhibit modular architectures that factorise complex tasks, resulting in the ability to compositionally generalise and reduce catastrophic forgetting. In contrast, artificial neural networks (ANNs) appear to mix all processing, because modular solutions are difficult to find as they are vanishing subspaces in the space of possible solutions. Here, we draw inspiration from fault-tolerant computation and the Poisson-like firing of real neurons to show that activity-dependent neural noise, combined with nonlinear neural responses, drives the emergence of solutions that reflect an accurate understanding of modular tasks, corresponding to acquisition of a correct world model. We find that noise-driven modularisation can be recapitulated by a deterministic regulariser that multiplicatively combines weights and activations, revealing rich phenomenology not captured in linear networks or by standard regularisation methods. Though the emergence of modular structure requires sufficiently many training samples (exponential in the number of modular task dimensions), we show that pre-modularised ANNs exhibit superior noise-robustness and the ability to generalise and extrapolate well beyond training data, compared to ANNs without such inductive biases. Together, our work demonstrates a regulariser and architectures that could encourage modularity emergence to yield functional benefits.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13857">EvoLattice: Persistent Internal-Population Evolution through Multi-Alternative Quality-Diversity Graph Representations for LLM-Guided Program Discovery</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2512.13857v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to evolve programs and multi-agent systems, yet most existing approaches rely on overwrite-based mutations that maintain only a single candidate at a time. Such methods discard useful variants, suffer from destructive edits, and explore a brittle search space prone to structural failure. We introduce EvoLattice, a framework that represents an entire population of candidate programs or agent behaviors within a single directed acyclic graph. Each node stores multiple persistent alternatives, and every valid path through the graph defines a distinct executable candidate, yielding a large combinatorial search space without duplicating structure. EvoLattice enables fine-grained alternative-level evaluation by scoring each alternative across all paths in which it appears, producing statistics that reveal how local design choices affect global performance. These statistics provide a dense, data-driven feedback signal for LLM-guided mutation, recombination, and pruning, while preserving successful components. Structural correctness is guaranteed by a deterministic self-repair mechanism that enforces acyclicity and dependency consistency independently of the LLM. EvoLattice naturally extends to agent evolution by interpreting alternatives as prompt fragments or sub-agent behaviors. Across program synthesis (proxy and optimizer meta-learning), EvoLattice yields more stable evolution, greater expressivity, and stronger improvement trajectories than prior LLM-guided methods. The resulting dynamics resemble quality-diversity optimization, emerging implicitly from EvoLattice's internal multi-alternative representation rather than an explicit external archive.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11496">Runtime Analysis of Evolutionary Diversity Optimization on the Multi-objective (LeadingOnes, TrailingZeros) Problem</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2404.11496v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diversity optimization is the class of optimization problems in which we aim to find a diverse set of good solutions. One of the frequently-used approaches to solve such problems is to use evolutionary algorithms that evolve a desired diverse population. This approach is called evolutionary diversity optimization (EDO).
  In this paper, we analyze EDO on a three-objective function LOTZ$_k$, which is a modification of the two-objective benchmark function (LeadingOnes, TrailingZeros). We prove that the GSEMO computes a set of all Pareto-optimal solutions in $O(kn^3)$ expected iterations. We also analyze the runtime of the GSEMO$_D$ algorithm (a modification of the GSEMO for diversity optimization) until it finds a population with the best possible diversity for two different diversity measures: the total imbalance and the sorted imbalances vector. For the first measure we show that the GSEMO$_D$ optimizes it in $O(kn^2\log(n))$ expected iterations (which is asymptotically faster than the upper bound on the runtime until it finds a Pareto-optimal population), and for the second measure we show an upper bound of $O(k^2n^3\log(n))$ expected iterations.
  We complement our theoretical analysis with an empirical study, which shows a very similar behavior for both diversity measures. The results of experiments suggest that our bounds for the total imbalance measure are tight, while the bounds for the imbalances vector are too pessimistic.

                arXiv:2507.10568v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) promise orders-of-magnitude efficiency gains by communicating with sparse, event-driven spikes rather than dense numerical activations. However, most training pipelines either rely on surrogate-gradient approximations or require dense time-step simulations, both of which conflict with the memory, bandwidth, and scheduling constraints of neuromorphic hardware and blur precise spike timing. We introduce an analytical, event-driven learning framework that computes exact gradients for synaptic weights, programmable transmission delays, and adaptive firing thresholds, three orthogonal temporal controls that jointly shape SNN accuracy and robustness. By propagating error signals only at spike events and integrating subthreshold dynamics in closed form, the method eliminates the need to store membrane-potential traces and reduces on-chip memory traffic by up to 24x in our experiments. Across multiple sequential event-stream benchmarks, the framework improves accuracy by up to 7% over a strong surrogate-gradient baseline, while sharpening spike-timing precision and enhancing resilience to injected hardware noise. These findings indicate that aligning neuron dynamics and training dynamics with event-sparse execution can simultaneously improve functional performance and resource efficiency in neuromorphic systems.

                arXiv:2512.04475v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning on graphs has recently achieved impressive progress in various domains, including molecular property prediction and chip design. However, benchmarking practices remain fragmented, often relying on narrow, task-specific datasets and inconsistent evaluation protocols, which hampers reproducibility and broader progress. To address this, we introduce GraphBench, a comprehensive benchmarking suite that spans diverse domains and prediction tasks, including node-level, edge-level, graph-level, and generative settings. GraphBench provides standardized evaluation protocols -- with consistent dataset splits and performance metrics that account for out-of-distribution generalization -- as well as a unified hyperparameter tuning framework. Additionally, we benchmark GraphBench using message-passing neural networks and graph transformer models, providing principled baselines and establishing a reference performance. See www.graphbench.io for further details.

                Understanding how the human brain develops and functions requires direct analysis of human cells. Single-cell atlases open unprecedented opportunities to survey cell physiological molecular states as the brain develops. However, technical challenges limit their potential. We present NeuRoDev, a computational resource with highly curated transcriptomic data and novel analytical tools to investigate neuronal and glial development in the human cortex. NeuRoDev compresses ~1M single-cell transcriptomes into integrative summary networks of reproducible cell clusters that capture temporal and cellular variation across all stages of human brain development. It provides a reference framework to directly interrogate cellular maturation dynamics, contextualize gene function, and interpret experimental organoid models. We use NeuRoDev to investigate developmental variation in cell physiology, reconstruct genesis and maturation dynamics in neuronal and glial cells, and interpret time-series data from organoid models. NeuRoDev is provided as a freely available software package and as web applications for interactive data analysis.

">Verbal versus Nonverbal Processing Leads to Generalized Hemispheric Laterality Effects that Span Multiple Networks</a></h4>

              
                Precision neuroimaging was used to explore specialization for verbal versus nonverbal processing. Consistent with prior findings, individuals exhibited a spatially left-lateralized association language network, with regions in both hemispheres robustly responding to processing of meaning-based sentences. We next examined differential responses to verbal (words) versus nonverbal (faces) materials within the same working memory task. The right hemisphere components of the language network responded more strongly to nonverbal than to verbal materials, splitting the network's functional profile between the hemispheres. Similar patterns were observed across multiple association networks including putative cognitive-control, action-mode, and attention networks. The hemispheric laterality effect was prospectively replicated in a second independent study. These findings highlight a generalized laterality phenomenon that transcends individual specialized networks and aligns with a broad mechanism that modulates processing between the hemispheres.

">A map of the cortical functional network mediating naturalistic navigation</a></h4>

              
                Navigation through the real world requires close coordination of perception, planning, and motor actions. Prior neuroimaging studies that used controlled stimuli and tasks have suggested that navigation-related information is represented broadly across the human cerebral cortex. While three regions in the anterior visual cortex have been well-studied, the extent and functional properties of regions in the parietal and prefrontal cortices are not as well-characterized. To map and characterize the full cortical network that underpins active navigation in the real world, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to record brain activity from participants performing a naturalistic navigation task. Banded ridge regression was used to fit high-dimensional encoding models for 28,134 features to this data. Results show that naturalistic navigation is supported by a network of 11 functionally distinct cortical regions: five prefrontal and three parietal regions, along with three regions in the visual cortex that had been identified and characterized in previous studies. Analysis of encoding model weights shows that these 11 regions transform perceptual inputs through decision-making processes to produce action outputs, and are organized along distributed cortical functional gradients. These results provide a unified description of the functional properties and organization of the cortical network that mediates naturalistic navigation. We anticipate that these maps will provide rich targets to inform more targeted future studies of human navigation.

                Background Flare-ups may occur after root canal treatment which consist of acute exacerbation of asymptomatic pulpal and/or periradicular pathologic condition. The causative factors of interappointment pain include mechanical, chemical or microbial irritation to the pulp or periradicular tissues. The potential role of microorganisms in interappointment pain is why the success of endodontic treatment depends on complete eradication of microorganisms capable of causing an intraradicular or extraradicular infection. This can be achieved by mechanical cleaning and shaping, in conjunction with irrigation and antibacterial agents. The aim of this study was to assess the ability of triple antibiotic paste with the anti-inflammatory drug diclofenac potassium versus calcium hydroxide used as an intra-canal medication in reducing post-operative pain. Methods 84 patients with asymptomatic uniradicular necrotic teeth were randomly assigned into two groups according to the intra-canal medication used: calcium hydroxide group (CH) and triple antibiotic paste with diclofenac potassium group (TAPC). In the first treatment session, intracoronal cavity preparation was performed after rubber dam isolation followed by chemo-mechanical preparation using rotary Protaper Universal files with saline irrigation followed by intra-canal medication placement then postoperative pain was assessed at 24, 48 and 72 hours postoperatively using Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). In the second treatment session, intracanal medications were removed by irrigation using saline followed by obturation. Results Both intracanal medicaments resulted in a statistically significant decrease in mean pain value from 24 to 48 and 72 hours postoperatively. While when comparing both groups, TAPC intracanal medication showed less post-operative pain compared to that of the CH group at 24, 48 and 72 hours with a statistically significant difference at 48 hours only. Conclusion Both intracanal medicaments were efficient in reducing post-operative pain in asymptomatic uniradicular necrotic teeth.

                Background Crop residue application can maintain soil fertility and sustain agriculture. However, the effects of residue application for crop growth are unstable because of variable weather conditions and the residual effects of crop residue application. Furthermore, residue application often reduces crop yields. Therefore, I tried to clarify effective residue application factors in an environment which was has stable weather conditions and low residualafter effects. Methods Majuro atoll, a coral sand atoll near the equator, was selected for the experiment site because of its stable weather and low residualafter effect of coral sand. A factorial design experiment using sweet corn was conducted based on the following four factors: fungi propagation before application, cutting residue into pieces, dispersion (or accumulationwindrowing) of applied residue, and placement (on the surface or incorporation) with an equal amount of crop residue. The effects of each factors on the corn yields were evaluated using Cohen’s effect size analysis. Results The dispersion showed the largest effect (1.2 in Cohen’s), which exceeded the effect of incorporation (0.7). The interaction of dispersion and incorporation showed a huge effect (4.9) on corn yield. Discussion The effect of dispersion was not positive but it avoided the negative effects of residue clustering. Because, the toxicity of the plant residue and generation of toxic substances by anaerobic decomposition are widely known. Anaerobic decomposition occurs inside the residue clusters. However, dispersion reduced the toxicity by adsorption in soil and avoiding anaerobic decomposition. Furthermore, incorporation showed an interaction effect, but surface placement did not. Conclusion The dispersion of crop residue enhanced the positive effect of crop residue incorporation by avoiding the toxicity from crop residue. This finding adds a new viewpoint for the controversy between conventional and conservation agriculture.

                <p>by Chenhui Ma, Evren Gurkan-Cavusoglu</p>

Understanding how chemotherapy perturbs cell cycle dynamics is critical for advancing cancer treatment. We develop a probabilistic, multi-generational framework based on a Bellman–Harris branching process to quantify treatment-induced shifts in tumor cell dynamics. The model incorporates key drug-responsive behaviors, including checkpoint activation, apoptosis, and checkpoint adaptation that propagates inherited DNA damage, enabling the characterization of heterogeneous survival outcomes after treatment. Biological parameters map directly onto DNA repair fidelity and cell-fate decisions, providing mechanistic insights beyond what is accessible from experiments alone. Dose-dependent extensions further allow exploration of treatment-induced perturbations. Model parameters were calibrated to empirical cell cycle measurements using the robust adaptive Metropolis algorithm. Global sensitivity analysis shows that scale parameters governing unfaithful DNA repair under G2/M- and S phase–specific agents exert major influence on model predictions, particularly at later time points. Across three chemotherapies, the framework reveals consistent dose-dependent alterations in cell cycle dynamics, with higher doses driving pronounced disruptions. Together, these results demonstrate how model-informed analyses can provide quantitative insight into treatment-induced cell cycle perturbations and support the refinement of therapeutic strategies.

                <p>by Naoyuki Okamoto, Michael Taylor, Takatomi Kubo, Shin Ishii, Benedetto De Martino, Aurelio Cortese</p>

Mistakes are valuable learning opportunities, yet in uncertain environments, whether a lack of reward is due to poor performance or bad luck can be hard to tell. To investigate how humans address this issue, we developed a visuomotor task where rewards depended on either skill or chance. Participants consistently displayed a self-attribution bias, crediting successes to their own ability while blaming failures on randomness, an effect that influenced their subsequent decisions. Computational modelling revealed two underlying mechanisms—a distorted perception of ability and a positivity bias in the skill condition. Notably, while distorted self-perception shaped behaviour, it did not affect confidence; instead, self-attribution bias led to overconfidence in external blame. These findings suggest a more complex picture in which self-attribution biases arise from both perceptual distortions and post-decision evaluations, highlighting the need for an interplay between experimental design and computational modelling to understand behavioural biases.

When faced with a choice between exploring an unknown option vs exploiting an option they know well, older adults explore less and exploit more than younger adults. Recent work has suggested that one cause of this age difference in exploration is a reduction in the extent to which older adults use “random exploration” – exploration driven by behavioral variability. Here we investigate potential mechanisms for this age-related difference in random exploration through the lens of a drift diffusion model (DDM) of the explore-exploit choice. In this model, random exploration can be modulated by two mechanisms – the fidelity with which information about the choice is represented in the brain, the “signal-to-noise ratio” (SNR), and the amount of information required to make a decision, the “decision threshold.” Reduced random exploration in aging could be caused either by an increase in signal-to-noise ratio or an increase in decision threshold in older adults. By fitting the DDM to choices and response times in a sample of healthy younger and older adults, we found that older adults had a lower SNR and a higher threshold than younger adults. This suggests that reduced random exploration in aging is driven by higher response thresholds in older adults, which may compensate for the reduced signal-to-noise ratio with which decision information is represented in the brain.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3003553">The Drosophila escape motor circuit shows differential vulnerability to aging linked to functional decay</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Alexandros Gaitanidis, Veronica Pampanin, Jessica Thiem, Georgios Kalaras, Lion Huthmacher, Silvan Hürkey, Dimitrios Kadas, Agapi Dimitriadou, Andriana Ntogka, Subhabrata Sanyal, Christos Consoulas, Carsten Duch</p>

Brain aging can cause cognitive and motor disabilities which often correlate with changes in dendritic branch, axon collateral, and synapse numbers. However, from invertebrates to mammals, age-related decline is typically restricted to specific neuron types or brain parts, indicating differential vulnerability. The rules to pinpoint the susceptibility of distinct brain elements to aging remain largely unknown. Here, we combine longitudinal studies with neuroanatomical, electrophysiological, and optophysiological analyses in the <i>Drosophila</i> genetic model to identify aging-susceptible and aging-resilient elements in a sensorimotor circuit that underlies escape. Young and mid-aged flies escape predator-like visual stimuli with a jump followed by flight, but behavioral performance declines with age. Mapping the underlying functional decline into the brain shows that most circuit components are robust against aging and remain functional even in old flies that have lost the behavior. By contrast, behavioral decline is caused by the selective decay of synaptic transmission between one specific visual projection neuron type (LC4) and the dendrite of one identified descending neuron (GF). Structurally, presynaptic active zone marker density is reduced whereas postsynaptic marker density remains normal. Other central synapses in this circuit as well as neuromuscular synapses are robust to aging. The synaptic connection susceptible to aging is also the circuit element most vulnerable to starvation or oxidative stress. Moreover, the vulnerable circuit element is also required for habituation, and thus, underlying circuit plasticity. In conjunction with data from mammalian brains our data suggest that a trade-off for functional neural circuit plasticity might be vulnerability to aging.

                <p>by Yanying Yu, Nicole E. Wheeler, Lars Barquist</p>

Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) poses a growing threat to human health. Increasingly, genome sequencing is being applied for the surveillance of bacterial pathogens, producing a wealth of data to train machine learning (ML) applications to predict AMR and identify resistance determinants. However, bacterial populations are highly structured, and sampling is biased towards human disease isolates, violating ML assumptions of independence between samples. This is rarely considered in applications of ML to AMR. Here, we demonstrate the confounding effects of sample structure by analyzing over 24,000 whole genome sequences and AMR phenotypes from five diverse pathogens, using pathological training data where resistance is confounded with phylogeny. We show the resulting ML models perform poorly and that increasing the training sample size fails to rescue performance. A comprehensive analysis of 6,740 models identifies species- and drug-specific effects on model accuracy. These findings highlight the limitations of current ML approaches in the face of realistic sampling biases and underscore the need for population structure-aware methods and more diverse datasets to improve AMR prediction and surveillance.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3003532">Most researchers would receive more recognition if assessed by article-level metrics than by journal-level metrics</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Salsabil Arabi, Chaoqun Ni, B. Ian Hutchins</p>

During career advancement and funding allocation decisions in biomedicine, reviewers have traditionally depended on journal-level measures of scientific influence like the impact factor. Prestigious journals reject large quantities of papers, many of which may be meritorious. It is possible that this process could create a system whereby some influential articles are prospectively identified and recognized by journal brands, but most influential articles are overlooked. Here, we measure the degree to which journal prestige hierarchies capture or overlook influential science. We quantify the fraction of scientists’ articles that would receive recognition because (a) they are published in journals above a chosen impact factor threshold, or (b) they are at least as well-cited as articles appearing in such journals. We find that the number of papers cited at least as well as those appearing in high-impact factor journals vastly exceeds the number of papers published in such venues. At the investigator level, this phenomenon extends across gender, racial, and career stage groupings of scientists. We also find that approximately half of researchers never publish in a venue with an impact factor above 15, which, under journal-level evaluation regimes, may exclude them from consideration for opportunities. Many of these researchers publish equally influential work; however, raising the possibility that the traditionally chosen journal-level measures that are routinely considered under decision-making norms, policy, or law, may recognize as little as 10%–20% of this influential work.

                Abstract* Background Traumatic brain injury (TBI) remains one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide, with outcomes influenced by multiple factors, including the timeliness of surgical intervention. This study aimed to investigate the association between surgical waiting time and clinical outcomes in TBI patients at Dr. Sardjito General Hospital, Yogyakarta, using the Glasgow Outcome Scale–Extended (GOSE) as the assessment tool. Methods This prospective cohort study included TBI patients who underwent craniotomy at Dr. Sardjito General Hospital between May and November 2024. Data were obtained from electronic medical records, and regression analysis was performed to evaluate the effect of surgical waiting time on outcomes. Results Among the 70 patients who met the inclusion criteria, the median age was 19 years (IQR 14.5–41) and 71.4% were male. Over half of the patients (51.4%) presented with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of 13–15. Based on GOSE assessment, 27.1% achieved good recovery, 27.1% upper moderate disability, 10% lower moderate disability, 21.4% upper severe disability, 5.7% lower severe disability, and 8.6% died. The median hospital stay was 10 days. Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that increasing age (OR = 1.04; 95% CI: 1.00–1.09; p = 0.028) and surgical delay >17 hours from injury to craniotomy (OR = 7.94; 95% CI: 1.35–46.67; p = 0.022) were independently associated with poorer GOSE outcomes. Shorter injury-to-incision times are associated with higher GOSE scores. However, surgical waiting time alone was not significantly associated with clinical deterioration (OR = 1.58; 95% CI: 0.19–1.80; p = 0.113; median = 7 hours; ROC = 0.597; p = 0.908). Conclusions Craniotomy performed >17 hours after injury was associated with an increased risk of severe disability or death. In contrast, a median surgical waiting time of 7 hours showed no significant impact on GOSE outcomes.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-738/v2?src=rss">Understanding the key factors influencing knowledge management in business environments: a systematic review [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                This study aims to identify and synthesise the main factors that influence knowledge management (KM) in business environments. Using the PRISMA approach, a systematic review of 44 empirical and conceptual articles published between 2020 and 2024 was conducted. The findings indicate eight key variables that are critical for strengthening KM: leadership, technology, entrepreneurial orientation, strategic orientation, learning orientation, innovation, human resource management, and high-performance work systems. The findings show that leadership promotes collaboration and trust, creating a supportive environment for KM. Technological advancements facilitate efficient knowledge sharing and application, while strategic alignment ensures KM supports organizational goals. Human resource practices engage employees in knowledge processes, and high-performance work systems enhance knowledge acquisition and utilization. Innovation drives the generation of new ideas, and entrepreneurial orientation encourages a proactive approach to leveraging knowledge for competitive advantage. Despite the growing interest in KM, challenges such as resistance to change, inadequate infrastructure, and varying employee readiness hinder its effective implementation. This study emphasizes the need for an integrated KM approach that addresses these barriers while aligning KM strategies with organizational needs. Future research should investigate how these factors interact across different industries and cultural contexts to optimize KM practices and improve organizational performance.

                Background In this Bioinformatics study, we took in account the cell types variation of tumor microenvironment (TME) in Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC), with a particular attention to miRNAs dysregulated pathways influencing immune responses, and especially memory CD4+ T cells. Methods For cell types and differentially expressed genes in memory CD4+ T cells, scRNA-seq was conducted on PDAC and non-tumoral pancreas samples. Putative miRNA targeting sequences on downregulated genes were investigated by three prediction databases, MiRWalk, TargetScan, and miRDB, and compared to GSE207345’s differential expression with creation of Affymetrix Multispecies miRNA-4 Array. The miRNA–mRNA interaction network was established in Cytoscape. Results Memory CD4+ T cells were significantly enriched in PDAC TME. At the same time, we observed genotype-specific repression of major immune and metabolic genes in these cells. Some miRNAs were significantly overexpressed in PDAC, and hsa-miR-1207-5p, hsa-miR-6805-5p, and hsa-miR-149-3p might target many immune-related or pancreatic enzyme-associated genes. Of these, a core of CLPS, NR4A2, and SOCS3 was most frequently targeted, which likely indicated the importance of these genes in immune evasion. Conclusions While memory CD4+ T cells exist within the PDAC TME, their activity is suppressed by miRNA-associated gene dysregulation. These data suggest candidate therapeutic approaches in which targeting of miRNAs could be used to normalize immune cells and promote anti-tumor immunity.

                Background Fuzzy soft sets are well-established for decision-making under uncertainty. However, integrating soft set theory with fuzzy codes remains unexplored, as fuzzy soft code sets have not addressed these concepts. This study presents novel fuzzy soft codes and discusses their application in diagnosing medical conditions and decision-making, bridging a critical gap in the literature. Methods Numerous scholars have examined fuzzy sets, fuzzy codes, and the theory of fuzzy soft sets and their applications over the years. This paper introduces the novel concept of fuzzy soft codes by combining fuzzy soft set theory with the notion of fuzzy codes, inspired by Ozkan’s 2002 definition of fuzzy codes. Results We define fuzzy soft codes as a parameterized family of fuzzy codes, detailing their matrix representation, set-theoretic operations, and algebraic properties. A new decision-making method using choice and score values from comparison tables is introduced. An example demonstrates its effectiveness for selecting optimal objects, proving its real-world potential in areas like medical diagnosis. This bridges a key theoretical gap and enables future extensions like intuitionistic fuzzy soft codes. Conclusions This study addresses a gap in the integration of soft set theory with the notion of fuzzy codes. The primary objective is to introduce the concept of fuzzy soft codes within the context of decision-making by merging fundamental ideas from soft set theory and fuzzy coding, while also examining several of their key properties. Additionally, a practical example is provided to demonstrate how this approach can be effectively utilized across a range of real world problem.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-1402/v1?src=rss">A New Analytical Method for Solving the Fractional Swift-Hohenberg Equation with Atangana-Baleanu Derivative [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                This work introduces a hybrid analytical technique for solving the Swift–Hohenberg equation by integrating the newly formulated Yasser–Jassim integral transform with the variational iteration method. The proposed framework is designed to efficiently handle both the classical and fractional forms of the equation, providing fast-convergent and highly accurate approximate solutions. To capture memory effects and nonlocal features more realistically, the Atangana–Baleanu fractional derivative in the Caputo sense is incorporated into the model. A rigorous convergence analysis is conducted, establishing sufficient conditions to ensure the stability, reliability, and accuracy of the iterative solutions. The performance of the method is assessed through a setiries of numerical experiments supported by graphical illustrations and tables of absolute error values, which collectively confirm the method’s superior accuracy and rapid convergence when compared with standard analytical approaches. Additionally, a detailed stability study of the fractional solutions is carried out and clearly verified through analytical arguments and numerical simulations. The results demonstrate that the combined Yasser–Jassim transform and variational iteration method offer a versatile and powerful tool for solving fractional-order partial differential equations. Beyond the Swift–Hohenberg equation, the proposed approach can be extended to a wide range of mathematical models, including nonlinear ordinary differential equations and integro-differential systems. Overall, the findings highlight the potential of this hybrid scheme to advance analytical methodologies within fractional calculus and nonlinear dynamical systems.

                Background Clinical laboratories play a significant role in healthcare, providing tests for diagnosis and treatment monitoring. Having skilled and adequate staffing is crucial for clinical laboratories to operate efficiently, manage their workload effectively, and deliver timely results. Despite being critical for healthcare delivery, ensuring adequate staffing levels in clinical laboratories remains a complex challenge for healthcare providers worldwide due to resource constraints and workforce shortages. Methods This study evaluates the workload in clinical laboratory staff using Workload Indicators of Staffing Need (WISN) method, focusing on workload, work pressure, and staffing requirements to optimize staffing levels and ensure an efficient clinical laboratory environment. Annual clinical laboratory data from June 2021 to May 2023 were collected to calculate the average number of days (234) worked annually, percentage of workload, distribution of activity time measurement units, and the ratio of needed, surplus, and existing staff (n=33, complete enumeration) from the laboratory registers and hospital statistics. WISN software was used to calculate staffing requirements, workload pressure, and WISN ratio. The Shapiro–Wilk test assessed normality and the Kruskal–Wallis test evaluated differences across clinical laboratory sections. Result A total of 33 technical staff employed, performed approximately 3.7 million tests across hematology and clinical pathology during the study period, WISN ratios ranged from 0.2 to 0.7, indicating the existing 33 staff members face a high workload burden. The calculated ideal staffing level was 46.33 personnel, indicating a shortfall of 13.3 staff (28.3%). A p < 0.01 confirmed a significant disparity in workload distribution. Conclusion The results highlight the importance of optimizing staffing levels in clinical laboratories to ensure quality service delivery. The WISN methodology can be a useful tool in healthcare facilities for making evidence-based staff allocation, maximizing the utilization of employee skill sets, and establishing standard staffing benchmarks tailored to the needs of clinical laboratories.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1368/v2?src=rss">Performance of Forensic Age Estimation by Aspartic Acid Racemization and DNA Methylation: A Systematic Review [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background Forensic age estimation is not difficult when the body is found in good condition, but in cases of severe decomposition or damage, such as burnt or separated body parts, then the analysis can only be done with bones and teeth. There has been abundant research and development in the field of related biochemistry over the years. Various molecular changes occur in hard tissues and long-lived proteins, such as those in bones and teeth during the physiological process of aging. Aspartic acid racemization and DNA methylation are still the most frequently used age estimation methods because of their advantages in accuracy. Method This study aimed to compare the accuracy of DNA methylation and aspartic acid racemization methods for age estimation. Journal articles were searched in the electronic databases PubMed, Scopus, and Semantic Scholar of 2017-2022 according to PRISMA guidelines. Result Twelve journal articles were eligible for review. The DNA methylation method is quite simple to use because of commercially available methylation kits. Furthermore, the results can be obtained relatively quickly without requiring many samples, and the method is less sensitive to thermal and other damage than the aspartic acid racemization method. Conclusion The aspartic acid racemization method for age estimation has high accuracy, especially in determining age at death. However, temperature and the condition of the teeth affect the racemization of aspartic acid. Given that DNA methylation is generally stable in a wide range of temperatures, it provides a better approach to determining the chronological age even from charred remains.

                Cinnamomum burmanni (Nees & T.Nees) Blume (Lauraceae) belongs to the Magnoliids group and is mainly distributed in Indonesia and Southeast Asia. The complete chloroplast (cp) genome of C. burmanni sampled from Indonesia was assembled and annotated for the first time in this study. The length of the cp genome is 152,765 bp with a GC content of 39%, and it consists of four subregions: a large single-copy (LSC) region of 93,636 bp, a small single-copy (SSC) region of 18,893 bp and two inverted repeats (IR) regions (IRA 20,121 bp; IRB 20,115 bp) . The cp genome of C. burmanni encodes a total of 173 unique genes, which are 96 protein-coding genes, 19 rRNA genes, and 68 tRNA genes that can be utilized for advanced genetic and genomic studies of the species.

                Shirasaka et al. show that the Cardiovirus-derived protein VPg functions as an interferon-γ receptor agonist, activating its canonical signaling cascade that sensitizes cells to TNF-α-triggered cell death. This synergistic cell death reduces virus load, revealing a non-canonical role of VPg in modulating host antiviral responses.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/103705">The fate of pyruvate dictates cell growth by modulating cellular redox potential</a></h4>

              
                Pyruvate occupies a central node in carbohydrate metabolism such that how it is produced and consumed can optimize a cell for energy production or biosynthetic capacity. This has been primarily studied in proliferating cells, but observations from the post-mitotic <i>Drosophila</i> fat body led us to hypothesize that pyruvate fate might dictate the rapid cell growth observed in this organ during development. Indeed, we demonstrate that augmented mitochondrial pyruvate import prevented cell growth in fat body cells in vivo as well as in cultured mammalian hepatocytes and human hepatocyte-derived cells in vitro. We hypothesize that this effect on cell size was caused by an increase in the NADH/NAD<sup>+</sup> ratio, which rewired metabolism toward gluconeogenesis and suppressed the biomass-supporting glycolytic pathway. Amino acid synthesis was decreased, and the resulting loss of protein synthesis prevented cell growth. Surprisingly, this all occurred in the face of activated pro-growth signaling pathways, including mTORC1, Myc, and PI3K/Akt. These observations highlight the evolutionarily conserved role of pyruvate metabolism in setting the balance between energy extraction and biomass production in specialized post-mitotic cells.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/107108">Transcriptional subtypes on immune microenvironment and predicting postoperative recurrence and metastasis in human pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma</a></h4>

              
                Human pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas (PPGLs) exhibit substantial molecular and immune heterogeneity, complicating risk assessment and treatment. Here, we define three distinct tumor transcriptional subtypes (C1, C2, and C3) in a clinically annotated cohort of PPGL patients through integrative transcriptomic and immunogenomic profiling. C1 is characterized by hypoxia-driven pathways and an immunosuppressive microenvironment, correlating with poor prognosis. C2 exhibits a highly inflamed immune landscape with robust CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell infiltration, suggesting potential sensitivity to immunotherapy. C3 is enriched in metabolic reprogramming pathways and displays intermediate clinical outcomes. Genetic analysis reveals subtype-specific mutational patterns, with pseudohypoxic driver mutations (<i>SDHB</i>, <i>VHL</i>, <i>SDHA</i>, and <i>SDHD</i>) predominant in C1 and C3, while kinase pathway alterations (<i>NF1</i> and <i>RET</i>) define C2. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing of human PPGL tumors further delineates immune ecosystem diversity. Notably, we identify <i>ANGPT2</i>, <i>PCSK1N</i>, and <i>GPX3</i> as key subtype-specific biomarkers, with <i>ANGPT2</i> driving tumor progression in C1 and emerging as a potential therapeutic target. Our findings provide a refined molecular classification integrating immune and genomic features in human PPGLs, offering a framework for improved prognostication and precision therapies in this rare neuroendocrine tumor type.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/90531">Immunoglobulin M regulates airway hyperresponsiveness independent of T helper 2 allergic inflammation</a></h4>

              
                Allergic asthma is a disease driven by T helper 2 (Th2) cells, eosinophilia, airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR), and IgE-secreting B cells. Asthma is largely controlled by corticosteroids and β<sub>2</sub> adrenergic receptor agonists that target and relax airway smooth muscle (ASM). Immunoglobulin M (IgM) isotype secreted by naïve B cells is important for class switching but may have other undefined functions. We investigated the role of IgM in a house dust mite (HDM)-induced Th2 allergic asthma model. We sensitised wild-type (WT) and IgM-deficient (IgM KO) mice with HDM and measured AHR, and Th2 responses. We performed RNA sequencing on the whole lung of WT and IgM KO mice sensitised to saline or HDM. We validated our AHR data on human ASM by deleting genes using CRISPR and measuring contraction by single-cell force cytometry. We found IgM to be essential in AHR but not Th2 airway inflammation or eosinophilia. RNA sequencing of lung tissue suggested that IgM regulated AHR through modulating brain-specific angiogenesis inhibitor 1-associated protein 2-like protein 1 (<i>Baiap2l1</i>) and other genes. Deletion of <i>BAIAP2L1</i> led to a differential reduction in human ASM contraction when stimulated with TNF-α and Acetylcholine, but not IL-13. These findings have implications for future treatment of asthma beyond current therapies.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96437">Postural adaptations may contribute to the unique locomotor energetics seen in hopping kangaroos</a></h4>

              
                Hopping kangaroos exhibit remarkably little change in their rate of metabolic energy expenditure with locomotor speed compared to other running animals. This phenomenon may be related to greater elastic energy savings due to increasing tendon stress; however, the mechanisms which enable the rise in stress without additional muscle work remain poorly understood. In this study, we created a three-dimensional (3D) kangaroo musculoskeletal model, integrating 3D motion capture and force plate data, to analyse the kinematics and kinetics of hopping red and grey kangaroos. Using our model, we evaluated how body mass and speed influence (i) hindlimb posture, (ii) effective mechanical advantage (EMA), (iii) the associated tendon stress in the ankle extensors, and (iv) ankle work during hopping. We found that increasing ankle dorsiflexion and metatarsophalangeal plantarflexion likely played an important role in decreasing ankle EMA by altering both the muscle and external moment arms, which subsequently increased energy absorption and peak tendon stress at the ankle. Surprisingly, kangaroo hindlimb posture changes appeared to contribute to increased tendon stress, allowing more elastic energy storage at faster speeds. These posture-mediated increases in elastic energy storage and return could be a key factor enabling kangaroos to achieve energetic benefits at faster hopping speeds, but may limit the performance of large kangaroos due to the risk of tendon rupture.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98889">A systematic bi-genomic split-GFP assay illuminates the mitochondrial matrix proteome and protein targeting routes</a></h4>

              
                The majority of mitochondrial proteins are encoded in the nuclear genome. Many of them lack clear targeting signals. Therefore, what constitutes the entire mitochondrial proteome is still unclear. We here build on our previously developed bi-genomic (BiG) split-GFP assay (Bader et al., 2020) to solidify the list of matrix and inner membrane mitochondrial proteins. The assay relies on one fragment (GFP<sub>1-10</sub>) encoded in the mitochondrial DNA enabling specific visualization of only the proteins tagged with a smaller fragment, GFP<sub>11</sub>, and localized to the mitochondrial matrix or the inner membrane. We used the SWAp-Tag (SWAT) strategy to tag every protein with GFP<sub>11</sub> and mated them with the BiG GFP strain. Imaging the collection in six different conditions allowed us to visualize almost 400 mitochondrial proteins, 50 of which were never visualized in mitochondria before, and many are poorly studied dually localized proteins. We use structure-function analysis to characterize the dually localized protein Gpp1, revealing an upstream start codon that generates a mitochondrial targeting signal and explore its unique function. We also show how this data can be applied to study mitochondrial inner membrane protein topology and sorting. This work brings us closer to finalizing the mitochondrial proteome and the freely distributed library of GFP<sub>11</sub>-tagged strains will be a useful resource to study protein localization, biogenesis, and interactions.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/105271">Strikingly different neurotransmitter release strategies in dopaminergic subclasses</a></h4>

              
                Neuronal function is intimately tied to axodendritic polarity. Neurotransmitter release, for example, is usually the role of the axon. There are widespread exceptions to this rule, however, including many mammalian neuronal types that can release neurotransmitter from their dendrites. In the mouse olfactory bulb, closely related subclasses of dopaminergic interneuron differ markedly in their polarity, with one subtype lacking an axon entirely. These axon-bearing and anaxonic dopaminergic subclasses have distinct developmental profiles and sensory responses, but how their fundamental polarity differences translate to functional outputs remains entirely unknown. Here, we provide anatomical evidence for distinct neurotransmitter release strategies among these closely related dopaminergic subtypes: anaxonic cells release from their dendrites, while axon-bearing neurons release exclusively from their intermittently myelinated axon. These structural differences are linked to a clear functional distinction: anaxonic, but not axon-bearing, dopaminergic neurons are capable of self-inhibition. Our findings suggest that variations in polarity can produce striking distinctions in neuronal outputs, and that even closely related neuronal subclasses may play entirely separate roles in sensory information processing.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92497">Exploiting fluctuations in gene expression to detect causal interactions between genes</a></h4>

              
                Characterizing and manipulating cellular behavior requires a mechanistic understanding of the causal interactions between cellular components. We present an approach to detect causal interactions between genes without the need to perturb the physiological state of cells. This approach exploits naturally occurring cell-to-cell variability which is experimentally accessible from static population snapshots of genetically identical cells without the need to follow cells over time. Our main contribution is a simple mathematical relation that constrains the propagation of gene expression noise through biochemical reaction networks. This relation allows us to rigorously interpret fluctuation data even when only a small part of a complex gene regulatory process can be observed. We show how this relation can, in theory, be exploited to detect causal interactions by synthetically engineering a passive reporter of gene expression, akin to the established ‘dual reporter assay’. While the focus of our contribution is theoretical, we also present an experimental proof-of-principle to demonstrate the real-world applicability of our approach in certain circumstances. Our experimental data suggest that the method can detect causal interactions in specific synthetic gene regulatory circuits in <i>Escherichia coli,</i> confirming our theoretical result in a narrow set of controlled experimental settings. Further work is needed to show that the approach is practical on a large scale, with naturally occurring gene regulatory networks, or in organisms other than <i>E. coli</i>.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/107103">Endoscopic liquid biopsies of gastric fluid in a large human patient cohort reveal DNA content as a candidate tumor biomarker in gastric cancer</a></h4>

              
                Gastric cancer remains a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge worldwide. Improved prognostic biomarkers could aid treatment planning across surgical, neoadjuvant, and adjuvant settings. We evaluated a novel liquid-biopsy approach integrated with esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) by analyzing gastric fluid DNA (gfDNA) from a large cohort (n=1056) to assess its diagnostic utility and prognostic value in gastric cancer. In this exploratory study, gfDNA concentration was measured in patients with normal gastric mucosa, peptic diseases, preneoplastic conditions, or cancer. Variables included sex, gastric fluid pH, proton-pump inhibitor use, tumor subtype, stage, and outcomes. gfDNA levels were significantly higher in gastric cancer than in all comparison groups (mean 26.86 ng/µL; 95% CI 20.05–33.79; p=3.61 × 10e<sup>-12</sup>) and as compared to non-malignant controls (mean 10.77 ng/µL; 95% CI 9.23–12.33; p=9.55 × 10e<sup>-13</sup>) and preneoplastic states (mean 10.10 ng/µL; 95% CI 7.59–12.60; p=1.10 × 10e<sup>-5</sup>). Advanced tumors (T3) exhibited higher gfDNA than earlier stages (T2 or below; mean 25.66 vs 15.12 ng/µL; p=5.97 × 10e<sup>-4</sup>). In a subset of gastric cancer patients, gfDNA &gt;1.28 ng/µL associated with longer progression-free survival (p=0.009) and correlated with increased tumor-infiltrating immune cells (p=0.001); this association remained after adjusting for stage (p=0.014). Elevated gfDNA supports gastric cancer presence in the general human population and may inform disease management when combined with tissue biopsies. Importantly, gfDNA shows prognostic potential in established gastric cancer, where higher gfDNA content may paradoxically relate to better outcomes, potentially linked to immune-cell infiltration. These findings warrant further validation and integration with complementary diagnostic modalities to enhance accuracy and clinical utility.

                Fungi display a wide range of lifestyles and hosts. We still know little about the impact of lifestyles, including pathogenicity, on their genome architecture. Here, we combined and annotated 552 fungal genomes from the class Sordariomycetes and examined the association between 13 genomic and two lifestyle traits: pathogenicity and insect-association. We found that pathogens, on average, tend to have a larger number of protein-coding genes, including effectors and tRNA genes. In addition, the non-repetitive size of their genomes is larger than that of non-pathogenic species. However, this pattern is not consistent across all groups. Insect endoparasites and symbionts have smaller genome sizes and genes with longer exons; moreover, insect-vectored pathogens possess fewer genes compared to those not transmitted by insects. Our study shows that genes are the main contributors to genome size variation in Sordariomycetes and that pathogens can exhibit distinct genome architectures, depending on their host and vector interactions.

">Bidirectional Crosstalk Between the SAGA Complex Deubiquitinase Module and the Molecular Circadian Clock</a></h4>

              
                The Spt-Ada-Gcn5-acetyltransferase (SAGA) complex is a highly conserved chromatin-modifying transcriptional coactivator that regulates gene expression through both transcriptional and post-translational mechanisms. In addition to histone acetyltransferase activity, SAGA harbors a deubiquitinase module (DUBm) that influences protein stability, localization, and function by removal of ubiquitin. Although SAGAs roles in transcription are well characterized, how its enzymatic modules are dynamically regulated to coordinate its divergent activities remains less known. Here, we identify a bidirectional relationship between the molecular circadian clock and the SAGA DUBm. Our results indicate that circadian rhythms influence DUBm activities and expression, while the DUBm in turn shapes the timing and stability of core clock proteins and transcripts, positioning the DUBm as an important mediator of the molecular circadian clock.

">Gasdermin E couples mitochondrial damage to pyroptotic neurodegeneration in Parkinson disease</a></h4>

              
                Parkinson disease (PD) features progressive loss of nigrostriatal dopamine neurons, but how mitochondrial damage engages programmed cell death pathways remains unresolved. Here, we identify gasdermin E (GSDME), the caspase-3-activated executor of pyroptosis, as a critical mediator of neurodegeneration in toxin-based PD models. In primary neurons and SH-SY5Y cells, the mitochondrial complex I inhibitor MPTP/MPP triggered caspase-3 activation, GSDME cleavage, and lytic membrane rupture. Genetic silencing of Gsdme or its transcriptional regulator SP1 reduced neuronal death. In vivo, Gsdme deficiency preserved substantia nigra pars compacta dopaminergic neurons, improved motor performance, and mitigated anxiety- and depression-like behaviors after MPTP administration. Loss of Gsdme also dampened microglial and astrocytic activation and lowered proinflammatory cytokines in striatum and substantia nigra. Mechanistically, cleaved GSDME localized to mitochondria, disrupted membrane potential, increased reactive oxygen species, and precipitated organelle injury, thereby coupling mitochondrial dysfunction to pyroptotic cell death. These findings identify GSDME-mediated pyroptosis as a mechanistic link between mitochondrial toxicity and neuroinflammation in PD and nominate GSDME as a therapeutic entry point to slow disease progression.

">Connectome Similarity Varies with Global Metastability and Movie Content</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: Recent evidence supports that non-linear segments of brain activity carries most of the individual-specific information which allows unique identification based on functional connectomes (e.g. connectome fingerprints) in MEG. In fMRI, metastability has emerged as a reliable and robust summary measure of brain dynamics. Here, we set out to test the hypothesis that metastability is associated with connectome fingerprinting in naturalistic fMRI. We further examined whether this putative association varies with time scales, across brain functional networks, and depending on the movie content. Methods: We analyzed fMRI data from 86 participants of the Naturalistic Neuroimaging Database. Data was collected during movie-watching of 10 entire movies of different genres. Global and network-level metastability were calculated using an fMRI-appropriate proxy measure based on the variability of spatial coherence. The within-subject stability (Iself) and between-subjects similarity (Iothers) of individual functional connectomes were also calculated. Linear mixed-effects models and appropriate contrasts were used to test associations between metastability and fingerprinting indices. Results: At the whole-brain level and considering data from all movies, an association across windows was found between metastability, Iself, and Iothers, with stronger effects observed for larger windows, such as the 600-second window (Iself: b = -0.13, SE = 0.032, p < 0.001; Iothers: b = -0.23, SE = 0.028, p < 0.001). Associations were also observed with distinct magnitudes within the eight large-scale functional networks, with particularly strong effects in the Motor Network (Iself: b = -0.34, SE = 0.027, p < 0.001; Iothers: b = -0.27, SE = 0.021, p < 0.001). Although no whole-brain differences were observed, movie content exhibited distinct association patterns within networks, notably for the prediction of Iself in the Visual Network for 500 Days of Summer ({Delta} = -0.22, SE = 0.11, p = 0.043). For Iothers, significant between-movie differences were found in the AMN ({Delta} = -0.25, SE = 0.062, p < 0.001), Dorsal Attention ({Delta} = 0.16, SE = 0.08, p = 0.038), Ventral Attention ({Delta} = 0.14, SE = 0.060, p = 0.017), and Visual Networks ({Delta} = -0.17, SE = 0.081, p = 0.031). Conclusion: Metastability is systematically related to functional connectome fingerprints. This relationship is time-scale dependent, varies across functional networks, and is sensitive to movie content. Our findings bridge nonlinear brain dynamics and connectome identifiability, highlighting naturalistic paradigms as a powerful framework for individualized precision neuroimaging.

">Ultrastructure of Inputs to the Granule Cell Domain of the Dorsal Cochlear Nucleus</a></h4>

              
                The granule cell domain of the cochlear nucleus (GCD) receives input from multimodal brain regions including the second cervical spinal ganglion, the spinal trigeminal nucleus, the cuneate nucleus, and the lateral reticular nucleus. Most of the input are in the form of large mossy fibers and small boutons containing round synaptic vesicles and forming asymmetric synapses. A smaller number of inputs arise from the lateral reticular nucleus and the spinal trigeminal nucleus that contain pleomorphic synaptic vesicles implying inhibitory action. This circumstance positions the GCD for integrating polysensory excitatory and inhibitory inputs at the earliest stages of auditory processing, which suggests a role for segregating sound streams. The structural substrate for such a function is naturally elaborate. Mossy fibers from these different origins are large, multilobed endings that form synaptic glomeruli with postsynaptic targets that include granule cells, unipolar brush cells, cartwheel cells, and chestnut cells, which in turn project to principal cells in the dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN). Numerous synapses contribute to the integration of the different modalities, but the organization of these synapses is still not well understood. We investigated this issue by labelling the presynaptic endings of different somatosensory inputs using biotinylated dextran amine or Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin, and studying their post-synaptic relationships in the GCD. The anterogradely-labeled endings and associated targets were visualized by light and electron microscopy. Following computer-aided, three-dimensional reconstructions, we found that unipolar brush cells are the main target of the C2 DRG and cuneate nucleus. Mossy fibers from the spinal trigeminal nucleus project to Golgi cells, an inhibitory neuron. In contrast, inhibitory boutons originated from the lateral reticular nucleus. These results reveal that somatosensory integration in the granule cell domain is achieved by distinctive synaptic wiring and specialized chemical signaling.

">The Role of Insular Anterior Parvalbumin GABAergic Interneurons in Impulsivity-Related and Alcohol-Seeking Behaviors</a></h4>

              
                Alcohol use is a major global health concern, particularly during adolescence, a developmental period characterized by heightened impulsivity, a known risk factor for alcohol misuse. The insular cortex is critically involved in interoceptive processing and impulsivity regulation, and its activity is powerfully shaped by parvalbumin (PV)-expressing GABAergic interneurons. We hypothesized that developmental differences in PV interneuron activity within the insular cortex contribute to impulsivity-related behaviors and alcohol consumption. To investigate this, male C57BL/6 mice were assessed at two developmental stages: adolescence (postnatal day 28) and young adulthood (postnatal day 64). Impulsivity was measured using the Omission-Contingency Learning (OCL) task, while alcohol intake and preference were evaluated using a two-bottle choice paradigm. Adolescent mice displayed higher impulsivity and greater alcohol consumption than adults. Double immunofluorescence labeling (Fos+/NeuN+ and Fos+/PV+) showed that increased impulsivity was associated with reduced activation of PV interneurons in the insular cortex. Chemogenetic activation of PV interneurons in adult PV-Cre mice reduced impulsivity in the OCL task and decreased alcohol intake. These findings indicate that insular PV interneurons play a modulatory role in impulsive behavior and alcohol consumption, suggesting a potential therapeutic target for impulse-control and alcohol-use disorders.

">Connectomic mapping of pharyngeal and gut sensory circuits in adult Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Feeding is regulated by both external sensory signals, such as taste, and internal sensory signals originating from the pharynx and gut. The recent completion of the Full Adult Fly Brain (FAFB) connectome offers an opportunity to map these sensory inputs and their downstream circuits. While the external gustatory receptor neurons have been relatively well characterized, the internal pharyngeal and gut sensory neurons remain less understood. Here, we systemically identify their axonal projections in the FAFB connectome and examine their downstream circuits. We find that the stomodeal nerve, which carries afferent signals from the gastrointestinal tract to the brain, contains multiple types of sensory axons with distinct morphology and downstream output connections. In addition, we identify sensory axons derived from different pharyngeal sense organs and find that chemosensory and mechanosensory axons arborize in distinct regions of the subesophageal zone. Characterization of the second- and third-order neurons reveals the major brain regions that receive input from pharyngeal and gut sensory neurons. Interestingly, a subset of these internal sensory neurons forms monosynaptic connections with various motor neurons and endocrine cells, suggesting that internal signals from the pharynx and gut may directly influence feeding-related motor programs and endocrine output. Together, our study delineates the pharyngeal and gut sensory circuits, laying a foundation for future studies on how internal sensory signals regulate feeding behavior and endocrine functions.

">Cognitive state dependent enhancement of cognitive control with transcranial magnetic stimulation</a></h4>

              
                Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is an effective treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD), yet variability of therapeutic responses remains high. A key contributor to this variability may be state-dependent effects of brain stimulation, where activity in underlying circuits can shape the propagation of TMS-evoked activity. Thus, pushing target circuits into a desired state by engaging cognition may sensitise those circuits to TMS-evoked plasticity. We tested whether TMS effects on cognitive control, a transdiagnostic construct implicated across psychiatric disorders and a putative mediator of TMS efficacy, are state-dependent. Participants (N = 25) completed a context-dependent behavioural assay of cognitive control before and after we delivered rTMS to the prefrontal cortex (PFC). During rTMS, participants performed either the cognitive control task (active-state TMS), or performed a context-independent perceptual task (control-state TMS). We assessed changes in downstream behavioural metrics of circuit function, as well as neural indices of cognitive control measured from electroencephalography (EEG). rTMS enhanced cognitive control performance only when PFC-anchored control circuits were actively engaged during stimulation. Similarly, only active-state TMS modulated theta band oscillatory activity, which is thought to be a marker of cognitive control engagement. Moreover, modulation of those EEG indices by TMS predicted gains in behavioural performance in the cognitive control task. These findings demonstrate that TMS effects on cognitive control are state-dependent, in which endogenous engagement of PFC-anchored networks can shape the magnitude and functional relevance of TMS-induced plasticity. Considering cognitive states during TMS may therefore offer a framework to enhance and/or accelerate TMS therapeutic effects.

">Non-invasive vagus nerve stimulation modulates Pavlovian bias in a state-dependent manner</a></h4>

              
                The vagus nerve transmits vital signals between organ systems of the body and the brain. Despite growing interest in non-invasive transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation (tVNS) for treatments of various disorders, it is not known whether its modulatory effects on behavior are dependent on bodily states. Here, we used a single-blind randomized crossover design with two within-participant factors, stimulation (right tVNS vs. sham) and metabolic state (water vs. caloric load), to investigate 54 healthy participants (210 sessions). To evaluate state-dependent changes in reinforcement learning, we used a valenced go/no-go task. Performance on this task can be used to estimate a Pavlovian choice bias, which captures improved performance for valence-congruent actions (e.g., go to win rewards) versus valence-incongruent actions (e.g., no-go to win rewards) and has been associated with dopaminergic neurotransmission. In line with theorized state-dependency of tVNS-induced changes, we observed that tVNS decreased Pavlovian response biases (Go x Win) after the caloric load (Stimulation x Load: p = .038). Taking into account individual changes in hunger but not satiety ratings best captured behavioral modulation, indicating that this modulatory effect could be driven by motivational effects related to metabolic interoception (sensed "need"). We conclude that right tVNS decreases Pavlovian response biases if the body is in a postprandial, but not a fasting state. Since fasting and Pavlovian biases have been previously associated with elevated dopamine neurotransmission, our results call for additional research on state-dependent motivational effects of tVNS to optimize interventions.

">It's All In The Journey: Putative Strategies Extracted from Navigation Paths Predict Spatial Memory and Hippocampal Recruitment</a></h4>

              
                Navigation in the real world may rely on a multitude of different strategies with distinct advantages and disadvantages. However, the characterization of spontaneous strategy use during wayfinding and underlying neural correlates are scarce. We explore data across three groups of participants who performed a virtual navigation task: (I) epilepsy patients undergoing invasive electrophysiological recordings of the hippocampus, and two groups who underwent fMRI scanning: (II) young adults at genetic risk for Alzheimer's disease (APOE-e4 carriers) and (III) healthy controls. We establish three metrics by which to quantitatively characterize each taken path, with the aim of simultaneously reflecting the putative strategies used by humans to solve the task: 1. straightness of paths; 2. deviation towards the edge of the circular arena; and 3. overlap of individual paths leading to a specific object location, which putatively relate to reliance on allocentric (1) and egocentric reference frames (2 & 3). Extracted metrics were related to performance in the task and to hippocampal activity. We find that strategy use is variable within participant, changes across the experiment, and is adaptive in a group-dependent manner. While hippocampal BOLD activity and theta (gamma) power were generally inversely (positively) related, we found that the recruitment of the hippocampus was both group- and strategy- specific. Our results further our understanding of the heterogeneous and idiosyncratic nature of spatial navigation by revealing how these behaviors are altered by disease and the subsequent compensatory neural dynamics, as well as the link between mesoscopic and macroscopic neural signals.

">Whole-brain connectomics of Drosophila reveals a robust, distributed architecture for the suppression of feeding during escape</a></h4>

              
                Survival demands instant prioritization of escape over maintenance. To decode the dynamic logic embedded in the static Drosophila connectome (FlyWire v783), we simulated the conflict between predator-evasion, feeding, and grooming to uncover the logic of this switch. We show that escape is a holistic state defined by distributed robustness: it is reliably triggered by only a fraction of visual inputs (LC4/LPLC2) and induces a system-wide pause on behaviors like feeding and grooming. Within this global suppression, we identify a specialized, fail-safe architecture for arresting feeding. A redundant ensemble of neurons (DNge031/CB0565) targets the premotor center Roundup, effectively disfacilitating motor output. Crucially, this inhibition is modular, anatomically distinct from grooming suppression, and relies on additive logic to ensure suppression even if individual components fail. Our results demonstrate how connectome topology implements robust, survival-critical control through distributed neural architecture.

">From labels to latents: revealing state-dependent hippocampal computations with Jump Latent Variable Model</a></h4>

              
                Neural activity is usually interpreted by imposing external labels (e.g., stimuli or position during locomotion) and decoding within that space (e.g. replay). While powerful, such supervision can mask structure in the data that do not correspond to the label. Unsupervised methods, in turn, often assume smooth latent dynamics and miss genuine discontinuities. We introduce a conceptually simple, computationally efficient latent variable model that infers both (i) the latent variables organizing population activity and (ii) whether their dynamics are continuous or fragmented in time. Fitting reduces to an expectation-maximization (EM) procedure that alternates two operations familiar to systems neuroscience--tuning-curve estimation and label decoding--without requiring external labels. Applied to rodent hippocampal spike recordings, the model reveals distinct population patterns at the same physical position that supervised spatial decoding fails to detect. While learned latents exhibit place-field-like tuning, their reactivation patterns are better distinguished by behavioral states. The model further identifies a continuity-fragmentation axis that characterizes population activities across sleep-wake brain states that is modulated by cholinergic inputs. By not relying on externally imposed spatial labels, our approach exposes structure that supervised approaches obscure and provides a powerful tool for datasets lacking behavioral tracking.

                A central goal in sensory science is to establish quantitative mappings between physical stimuli and perceptual responses. While such mappings are well characterized in vision and audition, they remain poorly defined in olfaction, limiting progress toward understanding the representations of smell. Predicting perceptual similarity between odor mixtures offers a promising route to formalize these relationships. To advance this effort, the DREAM (Dialogue for Reverse Engineering Assessment and Methods) Olfactory Mixtures Prediction Challenge assembled a curated, cross-study dataset describing the similarity of 507 mixture pairs and an unpublished test set of 46 mixture pairs. Teams competed to predict the perceptual similarity of mixture pairs, and then collaborated post-challenge to create an ensemble combining top-performing models that notably improves predictions over the existing state-of-the-art models. Moreover, ensemble model maintains high predictive accuracy in novel validation set. Our model provides a reproducible framework for neuroscientists, chemists, and engineers to compare odor mixtures and provides a foundation for future efforts towards better understanding the olfactory properties of mixtures.

">The Overlap Area as a Novel Measure of Effect Size in Neuroscience Research</a></h4>

              
                In experimental biomedical research, a common concern is whether a manipulation produces a biologically meaningful effect. Another concern is whether effect sizes are reliable, statistically significant, and generalizable. Traditional effect size measures, such as Cohens d, quantify mean differences but ignore variance heterogeneity between groups. This can result in biased effect size estimates and a lack of thresholds for statistical significance testing. Motivated by this, we introduce a novel effect size measure, termed overlap area (OA), which quantifies the difference between the population distributions of the experimental and control groups. A robust Bayesian method estimated OA, and random resampling determined OA thresholds for statistical significance in single and replicated experiments. Simulations confirmed the approach's sensitivity and robustness. Applied to a real-world dataset, OA revealed that environmental enrichment affects the mouse brain synaptome. Moreover, we developed an open-source toolbox supporting OA as a powerful new measurement for conducting robust, reliable, and reproducible analyses of manipulation effects in neuroscience and related fields.

">Neuroinvasion by Simian Immunodeficiency Virus Triggers Glial Senescence and Accelerated Neurodegeneration</a></h4>

              
                Virus-induced accelerated aging has emerged as a potential contributor to HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND), despite widespread implementation of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). Although evidence of accelerated aging in people living with HIV (PLWH) has been reported, most investigations of acute infection rely on in vitro systems or small animal models, leaving a critical gap in understanding early neuropathological events. To address this, we analyzed formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) brain tissues from rhesus macaques acutely infected with simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV). We focused on two key aging-related proteins: the cellular senescence marker p16INK4a (p16) and the NAD-dependent deacetylase sirtuin 1 (SIRT1). We hypothesized that accelerated aging phenotypes would be detectable during acute infection, manifesting as increased p16 expression and altered SIRT1 levels, correlating with neurodegeneration. Consistent with this hypothesis, we observed marked upregulation of GFAP and p16, along with evidence of neurodegeneration, across multiple brain regions - including the frontal lobe, caudate, putamen, thalamus, hippocampus, and cerebellum - by 21 days post-infection. These findings suggest that aging-related and senescence pathways are activated almost immediately following HIV infection, highlighting the potential importance of astrocyte- or CNS-specific therapeutic strategies to mitigate early neuropathology.

It is not confined to brain but is also extended to peripheral tissues and cells, enabling minimally invasive screens aimed at identifying transcriptional surrogates of the health status in HD mutation carriers. Nonetheless, transcriptomics approaches have failed to identify consistent candidates from peripheral blood, probably due to the low impact of the HD mutation in the transcriptional profiles of circulating cells that can be masked by the high cellular complexity of this biofluid. In this study, we applied for the first time single-cell RNA-seq in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) to determine those cells that accumulate the most prominent gene expression changes as potential sources of reliable biomarkers. We observed both specific and common transcriptional alterations across different blood cell subtypes, justifying partial overlapping of our results with published bulk transcriptomics datasets. To relate these gene expression patterns with disease progression in the absence of a large cohort of patients, we examined selected candidates in a phenotypically characterized cohort of transgenic R6/1 mice. Of the tested genes, only the changes in the interferon related gene Irf7 in blood were correlated with motor coordination performance in mutant mice. Notably, this gene was significantly upregulated in the striatum of these animals. Overall, transcriptional-based changes in peripheral blood can be linked to HD although dissection of individual blood cells in combination with subsequent validation in mouse models emphasizes the challenges in obtaining clinically relevant biomarkers in HD.

">Pharmacological Inhibition of FKBP51 Mitigates Early Life Adversity-Induced Social Deficits</a></h4>

              
                Early life adversity (ELA) is a major risk factor for psychiatric disorders, but targeted preventative strategies are lacking due to poor mechanistic insight. The FKBP51 protein, a co-chaperone of the glucocorticoid receptor, is a key mediator of stress vulnerability. We tested if pharmacological inhibition of FKBP51 with the selective inhibitor SAFit2 prevents the long-term consequences of ELA. Mice exposed to ELA exhibited persistent deficits in social behavior, manifesting as social subordination in adolescence and adulthood. Early-life SAFit2 treatment fully rescued these ELA-induced behavioral impairments. Transcriptional profiling across six stress-relevant brain regions revealed that SAFit2 normalized ELA-driven gene expression changes, particularly in the medial prefrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens. Functional analysis showed the rescue converged on immunoregulatory and neuroactive ligand-receptor signaling pathways. Our findings establish FKBP51 as a critical pharmacological target for reversing the lasting impact of early life adversity on brain function, offering a path toward preventative treatment for ELA-related psychopathology.

">Repeated stress persistently suppressesthe central node in the courtship circuitry in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Stress caused by external stressors, such as painful stimulation, can elicit a drastic set of behavioral responses. Such stress responses normally decay soon after the stressor disappears, but can become persistent when the stressor becomes longer and/or repeated. The neuronal mechanism underlying the persistence of stress responses, however, remains elusive. Here, we discovered that repeated electric shocks persistently suppress male Drosophila's courtship behavior. We comprehensively evaluated the physiological changes in the genetically defined courtship circuitry, and found that a courtship-triggering node of the circuitry, called P1 neurons, is preferentially and persistently suppressed following electric shocks. Our data uncovers in a comprehensively defined courtship circuitry that repeated stress persistently suppresses a critical node of the circuitry in a targeted fashion to alter behavior.

">Neural geometric representations of social memory for multi-individuals in medial prefrontal cortex</a></h4>

              
                Social memory is an ability to recognize specific identities and remember experience with acquainted individuals. The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is one of key brain areas executing this function. However, it is unknown how mPFC neurons encode multiple social identities. By developing a new social-identity discrimination task, where a mouse encounters four conspecifics along with in vivo recordings of mPFC neuron spiking activity, we, here, report that the memory of individual social identities can maintain up to two weeks and are robustly encoded by tuned geometric subspaces in mPFC population activity. On contrary, only few neurons exhibit exclusively social-selective responses. Using a cross-session alignment approach of the linear regression and joint-dimensionality reduction, we identify specific low-dimensional neural-subspaces differentially representing individuals over days. Importantly, shifts in social valence, caused by conditioning rewarding, aversive or neutral stimuli associated with different interacted individuals, significantly increase distance and angle between each neural-subspaces. The latter changes in neural representations result from progressive recruitments of neurons that encode associated information of individual valence and identity. Thus, our findings elucidate that tuned neural subspaces in the mPFC underlie a stable encoding of multiple social identities over days, providing a computational framework for understanding complex social memory.

">Peripheral regeneration of Aβ low-threshold mechanoreceptors is limited despite activation of regenerative transcriptional pathways</a></h4>

              
                Peripheral neurons can regenerate after nerve injury, yet functional recovery is often incomplete due to non-specific or incomplete target reinnervation. Among sensory neuron subtypes, A{beta} low-threshold mechanoreceptors (A{beta}-LTMRs) mediate discriminative touch, a modality often incompletely restored after nerve injury. However, the mechanisms governing A{beta}-LTMR regeneration remain largely unexplored. Here, we characterised the anatomical and transcriptional features of A{beta}-LTMRs regeneration after nerve injury. We assessed the extent of axonal regeneration after sciatic nerve crush and the preferential regeneration following femoral nerve transection using Calb1-Cre/tdTomato reporter mice. In both models, regeneration was incomplete, failing to reach control values. Moreover, A{beta}-LTMRs preferentially reinnervated cutaneous rather than muscle pathways. To define the molecular program underlying this response, we performed ribosome-bound RNA sequencing from Calb1-Cre/Ribotag mice 7 days after nerve crush. A{beta}-LTMRs upregulated canonical regeneration-associated genes, including Atf3, Sprr1a, Gal, and Gap43. Comparison with published RNA-seq datasets from other sensory neuron populations revealed only modest overlap, indicating that the core injury response shared between neurons is accompanied by a neuron subtype-specific programme. Together, these findings define the regenerative profile of A{beta}-LTMRs across anatomical and transcriptomic levels, revealing the limited regenerative capacity of this neuron subpopulation despite robust activation of classical regeneration-associated genes.

">Integrative Genomic and Functional Analyses Reveal NINL as a Modulator of Tau Aggregation</a></h4>

              
                Proteostasis dysfunction is a hallmark of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and Alzheimers disease (AD), yet the genetic and molecular pathways that disrupt protein homeostasis remain poorly understood. Here, we integrated human genetics, transcriptomics, and functional studies to identify proteostasis network components involved in tauopathy. We identified 18 proteostasis network genes harboring 75 rare, damaging variants enriched in FTD and/or AD. These genes, spanning multiple proteostasis pathways, were differentially expressed in MAPT mutant neurons and dysregulated in FTD and AD brains. NINL, which encodes Nlp, emerged as the only gene consistently upregulated across all datasets. NINL overexpression reduced tau seeding and enhanced lysosomal proteolytic activity, whereas two FTD-enriched NINL frameshift variants impaired Nlp expression and abolished these protective effects. Together, our findings identify a set of proteostasis genes with genetic and transcriptional links to neurodegeneration and reveal NINL as a novel regulator of tau aggregation, potentially upregulated as an adaptive response to proteotoxic stress.

">Parallel neuronal ensembles control behavior across sensorimotor levels in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Nervous systems can process information in serial or in parallel, trading off efficiency for flexibility and speed. How these network architectures are implemented across sensorimotor pathways to control behavior is unclear. We investigate this tradeoff directly in Drosophila by comparing neuronal circuits underlying landing and takeoff, behaviors transforming similar visual cues to whole-body motor output. Using a whole-CNS connectome, electrophysiology, and behavioral analysis, we reconstruct the complete feedforward pathway for landing, including visual feature detectors, a dedicated ensemble of descending neurons (DNs), and a core premotor circuit in the nerve cord. Comparison to the takeoff pathway reveals that, despite encoding the same sensory feature and engaging similar muscle groups, neuronal circuits controlling the two behaviors are separated at every sensorimotor level. Extending this analysis to the complete DN population reveals a blueprint for descending motor control: DNs across the behavioral space utilized by the fly are organized as a set of parallel, loosely-overlapping ensembles that form a continuum from command-like control, with individual DNs determining behavioral output, to population coding, with multiple DNs controlling behavior synergistically. Distinct combinations of sensory feature detectors differentially recruit DN ensembles to enable flexible, context-dependent behavioral control.

">Cognitive and autonomic physiological responses to daily transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation in healthy adults</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: The vagus nerve regulates autonomic processes central to cognition. Transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) can acutely modulate executive function in healthy adults, but the effects of repeated dosing, roles of executive subdomains, and importance of sex as a biological variable require clarification. Method: In a randomized, single-blind, sham-controlled, parallel group study, 12 healthy adults (six women) received 10 consecutive days of left monoaural taVNS (VNS) or sham (CON), with a two-week follow-up rechallenge. Stimulation (100Hz; 200us pulse width) was delivered continuously (online) at rest and during the Eriksen Flanker (inhibition), Wisconsin Card Sorting (shifting), and Sternberg (working memory) tasks. Resting autonomic measures included pupil diameter, skin conductance (SCL), mean R-R interval (mRR), respiration, and blood pressure. Primary outcomes were analyzed with linear mixed models and Sidak-corrected contrasts. Results: Ten days of taVNS produced immediate and cumulative changes in multiple executive function subdomains that remained evident at rechallenge, with the strongest effects on accuracy. Across tasks, benefits were most pronounced in women; men displayed initial performance costs, but with greater longitudinal improvements. Cognitive effects were most evident on higher-difficulty trials. Autonomically, taVNS increased SCL during and after stimulation, amplified stimulus- and task-evoked pupil responses, and transiently lengthened mRR. Stimulation was well tolerated and blinding was acceptable. Conclusions: Resolution of taVNS effects to higher-difficulty trials supports adaptive-gain modulation within executive function networks. The combination of larger evoked pupil/SCR, transient mRR lengthening, and increased SCL indicates that taVNS increased autonomic flexibility and arousal. Our findings identify biological sex and stimulation intensity as potentially important considerations for taVNS efficacy and provide longitudinal estimates to guide dosing, biomarker selection, and trial design. Collectively, the results support continued development of taVNS as a safe tool for the modulation of executive function and autonomic activity in healthy adults.

">Elevated neuronal TAF15 expression leads to FTD-like phenotype</a></h4>

              
                TAF15, a DNA/RNA-binding protein whose dysfunction in alternative splicing impairs NMDA receptor signaling, can form amyloid fibrils that contribute to neurodegeneration in the neurodegenerative diseases like FTD and ALS, indicating a close involvement of TAF15 in both neuronal physiological function and activation of pathological pathways. However, the relationship between TAF15 expression levels and neurodegeneration, as well as the specific downstream pathways mediating its neurotoxicity, remains unclear. Here, we found a consistent upregulation of TAF15 in prefrontal cortex neurons from patients across multiple FTD and ALS subtypes. Both in vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated that neuronal TAF15 overexpression triggered oxidative stress, evidenced by reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, leading to neurotoxicity and gliosis. Mice overexpressing TAF15 in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) neurons exhibited heightened anxiety and impaired fear memory, mimicking some key features of FTD behavioral abnormalities. Notably, these pathological and behavioral phenotypes are rescued by the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine amide (NACA), indicating that elevated TAF15 level exacerbates neurodegeneration primarily by activating oxidative stress pathways. Together, this work elucidates a novel TAF15-oxidative stress axis in FTD-associated neurodegeneration, providing a conceptual framework for future therapeutic development.

">The role of MICOS in modulating mitochondrial dynamics and structural changes in vulnerable regions of Alzheimer's Disease</a></h4>

              
                Mitochondrial contact site and cristae organizing system (MICOS) complexes are critical for maintaining the mitochrondrial architecture, cristae integrity, and organelle communication in neurons. MICOS disruption has been implicated in neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer disease (AD), yet the spatiotemporal dynamics of MICOS-associated neuronal alterations during aging remain unclear. Using three-dimensional reconstructions of hypothalamic and cortical neurons, we observed age-dependent fragmentation of mitochondrial cristae, reduced intermitochondrial connectivity, and compartment-specific changes in mitochondrial size and morphology. Notably, these structural deficits were most pronounced in neurons vulnerable to AD-related pathology, suggesting a mechanistic link between MICOS disruption and the early mitochondrial dysfunction observed in patients with AD. Our findings indicate that the loss of MICOS integrity is a progressive feature of neuronal aging, contributing to impaired bioenergetics and reduced resilience to metabolic stress and potentially facilitating neurodegenerative processes. MICOS disruption reduced neuronal firing and synaptic responsiveness, with miclxin treatment decreasing mitochondrial connectivity and inducing cristae disorganization. These changes link MICOS structural deficits directly to impaired neuronal excitability, highlighting vulnerability to AD-related neurodegeneration. These results underscore the importance of MICOS as a critical determinant of neuronal mitochondrial health and as a potential target for interventions aimed at mitigating AD-related mitochondrial dysfunction.

">Diffusion-weighted steady-state free precession imaging in the ex vivo macaque brain on a 10.5T human MRI scanner</a></h4>

              
                Diffusion MRI provides a non-invasive probe of local fibre bundles and long-range anatomical connections to characterise the structural connectome. One way to achieve very high spatial resolution diffusion MRI data for connectivity investigations is to scan ex-vivo brains over many hours or days, ideally at ultra-high field strength to boost signal levels. However, conventional diffusion MRI acquisition techniques do not generally deliver good data quality for the challenging conditions of ex-vivo tissue, characterised by reduced diffusivities and relaxation times when compared to in vivo. In this work, we investigate the potential of the diffusion-weighted steady-state free precession (DW-SSFP) sequence for ex vivo diffusion imaging of the macaque brain using a 10.5 T human MRI scanner with a conventional (G_max=70 mT/m) gradient set. SNR-efficiency optimisations incorporating experimental relaxation times demonstrate that the DW-SSFP sequence is predicted to achieve improved or similar SNR efficiency compared to a diffusion-weighted spin- and stimulated-echo sequence. Importantly, DW-SSFP can achieve this with the additional benefit of negligible geometric distortions, unlike conventional diffusion MRI using an echo-planar imaging readout. Using optimised DW-SSFP sequence parameters, we propose a protocol at 0.4 mm isotropic resolution using a two-shell multi-orientation protocol (effective b-values of 3200 s/mm^2 and 5600 s/mm^2). We fit the data using Tensor, Ball and 3-Sticks and Constrained Spherical Deconvolution signal representations. The results demonstrate high-quality diffusivity estimates across the entire brain with the ability to resolve multiple fibre populations in challenging crossing-fibre regions. The data will be made fully open source and multimodal as part of the Center for Mesoscale Connectomics, providing a resource for future connectivity investigations.

">MRS4Brain: a processing toolbox for preclinical MR spectroscopy and spectroscopic imaging data</a></h4>

              
                Magnetic resonance spectroscopy is a non-invasive technique for probing metabolism and underpins advanced methods such as magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) and diffusion-weighted spectroscopy (DWS). MRSI enables spatial mapping of metabolite distributions, offering insights into regional metabolic heterogeneity that single-voxel spectroscopy (SVS) cannot capture. However, MRSI produces large multidimensional datasets and requires complex processing pipelines, limiting reproducibility and accessibility. While human studies benefit from advanced processing tools, similar developments in preclinical research remain scarce, highlighting a demand for practical tools accessible to non-experts. To address this need, we introduce the MRS4Brain Toolbox, a freely available MATLAB-based platform for preclinical spectroscopy, including MRSI, SVS, and DWS. The toolbox integrates reconstruction, preprocessing, quantification, quality control, brain segmentation automatically overlaid on metabolite maps, modeling, and statistical analysis into unified workflows accessible via a graphical interface. By streamlining data processing and reducing technical barriers, MRS4Brain Toolbox promotes reproducibility, harmonization, and broader adoption of advanced spectroscopic techniques in preclinical studies, ultimately facilitating translational research.

">Towards Video-LLM Driven Workflow for Behavioral Segmentation and Scoring in Mice Performing a Skilled Water Reaching Task: An Evaluation of Recent LLM Models</a></h4>

              
                Significance: Behavior scoring is labor-intensive and subjective, introducing variability in results. Large Language Models (LLMs) capable of video understanding offer a transformative solution to manual scoring, crucial for accelerating and standardizing neuroscience workflows. Aim: We sought to benchmark state-of-the-art video LLMs (Gemini 2.5 Pro, Qwen3-VL, and VideoLLaMA3) for automated behavioural segmentation and scoring of mice performing a water-reaching task. Approach: Videos of mice performing water reaching from the front view were analysed by the LLMs. Accuracy was compared across different models and against prompt adjustments within Gemini. To assess classification determinants, video fidelity was altered through pixel interpolation and key regions blurred (paws/snout-mouth). In addition, the models were asked to describe the mouse's actions over time. Results: Gemini 2.5 Pro (Mean: 0.74, SD: 0.12) and Qwen3-VL-30B (Mean: 0.67, SD: 0.13) exhibited ability to classify trial outcomes. Reliable classification required a minimum pixel resolution of 0.28 mm per pixel. Accuracy is significantly reduced upon obscuring the snout-mouth area. In 549/1058 of videos, Gemini 2.5 Pro also provided completely accurate frame-to- frame behaviour segmentations. Conclusions: Video-LLMs offer potential to accelerate neuroscience by providing scalable, objective quantification of goal-directed behaviors. By producing temporal annotations, Gemini enables fast first-pass labelling that markedly streamlines manual dataset curation.

                <p>The "sign-tracking" and "goal-tracking" model of individual variation in associative learning permits the identification of rats with different cue reactivity and predisposition to addiction-like behaviors. Certainly, compared with "goal-trackers" (GTs), "sign-trackers" (STs) show more susceptibility traits such as increased cue-induced "relapse" of drugs of abuse. Different cue- and reward-evoked patterns of activity in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) have been a hallmark of the ST/GT phenotype. However, it is unknown whether differences in the intrinsic neuronal properties of NAc medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in the core and shell subregions are also a physiological correlate of these phenotypes. We performed whole-cell slice electrophysiology in outbred male rats and found that STs exhibited the lowest excitability in the NAc core, with lower number of action potentials and firing frequency as well as a blunted voltage/current relationship curve in response to hyperpolarized potentials in both the NAc core and shell. Although firing properties of shell MSNs did not differ between STs and GTs, intermediate responders that engage in both behaviors showed greater excitability compared with both STs and GTs. These findings suggest that intrinsic excitability in the NAc may contribute to individual differences in the attribution of incentive salience.</p>

                <p>Accurate electrode implantation in the subthalamic nucleus (STN) of rats is essential for high-quality electrophysiological and neuromodulation studies but remains technically challenging due to the small size and deep location of the STN. Traditional stereotactic methods, relying on bregma or averaged bregma-interaural-based coordinates, often result in misplacement of electrode. Here, we introduce a combined anatomical and functional approach&mdash;bregma-interaural and electrophysiology-guided technique (BITE)&mdash;designed to enhance targeting accuracy for STN electrode implantation in male Sprague Dawley rats. In this method, anterior-posterior (AP), medial-lateral (ML), and dorsal-ventral (DV) coordinates are initially determined using the average of bregma and interaural references. Electrode depth (DV axis) is fine-tuned based on real-time detection of characteristic STN neuronal firing patterns. If STN featured activity is not observed on the first implantation, additional adjustments in the AP and ML axes are made, followed by electrophysiology-guided DV tuning. Using BITE, we achieved an 83% overall success rate for STN electrode implantation, with 50% of electrodes precisely located in the dorsal STN (dSTN). This represents a significant improvement compared with the bregma-based method (17%, <I>p</I> = 0.0005) and the averaged bregma-interaural-based method (40%, <I>p</I> = 0.0188). BITE offers two main advantages: (1) increased accuracy in targeting the STN and (2) improved access to the dSTN, a region of growing interest in basal ganglia research. These findings demonstrate that BITE is a reliable and effective method for precise electrode placement in the STN and may serve as a valuable tool in rat models of deep brain stimulation and basal ganglia function.</p>

     alt="Ultrastructural Synaptic Differences in the Central Inferior Colliculus in the 3xTG Mouse Across Three Disease Stages"/>
<p>Symmetric and asymmetric synapses were significantly downregulated by 50% and 20%, respectively, in the aging inferior colliculus of the Alzheimer's 3xTG mouse model during the emerging disease stage (7–8 months). There was no additional significant loss from the emerging disease stage into the established disease stage. 

</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Numerous studies support a mechanistic link between hearing loss and increased risks of cognitive decline and dementia. Hearing loss is widely viewed as a modifiable risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). During normal aging the inferior colliculus (IC), a large auditory midbrain nucleus, undergoes numerous changes to neurotransmission, and these changes contribute to the development of central gain and presbycusis. Recent reports also implicate the IC as a nucleus that undergoes processing changes during AD. We used transmission electron microscopy (EM) to examine the synaptic ultrastructure of the central IC (ICc) in 3xTG mice during presymptomatic, emerging, and established disease stages. Synapses were identified by a collection of presynaptic vesicles, a clear synaptic cleft, and a postsynaptic density. Symmetric synapses had pre and postsynaptic membranes of similar thickness, whereas asymmetric synapses had postsynaptic densities were conspicuously thicker than the presynaptic densities. We also quantified the presynaptic profile areas, active zone lengths, and presynaptic mitochondria. The data demonstrate a significant loss of symmetric and asymmetric synapses in the emerging disease stage. In particular, the density of symmetric synapses in the ICc was reduced by ∼50%. As inhibitory neurotransmitters gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glycine, and neuropeptide Y are released from neurons that form symmetric synapses in the IC, the robust loss of these synapses may contribute to central gain and presbycusis during AD. Furthermore, as these synapses were lost well before the established disease stages, perhaps alterations in ICc represent an early biomarker for Alzheimer's progression.</p>

     alt="In the Caudal Pontine Reticular Nucleus, Kv1.1 Expression Is Soma Size Dependent and Invariant During Postnatal Development"/>
<p>The caudal pontine reticular nucleus (PnC) holds neurons of different functions and sizes. Our analysis shows that soma size and shape cannot distinguish between PnC subpopulations. Kv1.1 expression is scaled with the soma size. These findings are observed in three different mammals of different brain sizes, indicating a generalization. Moreover, the Kv1.1 scaling and expression are independent of postnatal development from P8 onward, distinguishing the PnC from auditory centers such as the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The acoustic startle reaction is a rapid behavioral response to an unexpected auditory stimulus. In mammals, this reaction is based on an archaic reflex arch connecting auditory inputs via the sensor–motor interface in the caudal pontine reticular nucleus (PnC) of the reticular formation with motor output. The neuronal population in the PnC is heterogeneous, containing an interspersed set of giant neurons that represent the cellular substrate of the sensorimotor interface. To probe whether the heterogeneous cell population can be divided into distinct subpopulations based on somatic morphometry or potassium channel expression, we quantitatively analyzed immunofluorescence labeling in the PnC and compared this between three mammals. In gerbil, mouse, and Etruscan shrew, soma size and roundness showed a continuum over all analyzed cells. Somatic Kv1.1 labeling intensity continuously increased with increasing soma size. Overall, no subpopulations based on somatic morphometric parameters and Kv1.1 expression were observed, suggesting that the PnC is composed of neurons displaying a continuum of soma sizes. Moreover, in mice, neurons of the MNTB but not PnC showed a postnatal developmentally regulated Kv1.1 expression, contrasting this sensorimotor interface with the sensory nuclei of the auditory brainstem.</p>

                Introduction Arterial hypertension affects around 19.4% of Peruvians over 15 years old, constituting a major public health issue. Recent evidence highlights the gut microbiome’s role in regulating blood pressure through bioactive metabolites that influence inflammation and metabolism. This study aims to characterize the gut microbiota of hypertensive adults from three Peruvian regions, contributing to the understanding of microbial influences on hypertension. Objective To analyze the composition and functionality of the gut microbiota in hypertensive and normotensive adults from different Peruvian regions, considering age, body mass index (BMI), and geographical location. Methods An observational, cross-sectional, and analytical study was conducted with 84 adults (46 hypertensive and 38 normotensive) from nine regions of Peru. Fecal samples underwent metagenomic sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene (V3–V4 region). Alpha and beta diversity were evaluated using the Shannon index, UniFrac distances, and multivariate analyses. Microbial functional pathways were examined to identify potential metabolic differences between groups. Results The dominant phyla in all groups were Bacillota and Bacteroidota. At the genus level, Streptococcus was associated with hypertensive patients with BMI ≥25, while Alistipes appeared only in normotensive individuals with BMI <25. Alpha diversity was greater in hypertensive participants under 50 years and with BMI <25, while lower diversity was seen in normotensive adults over 50 and with BMI ≥25. Beta diversity showed partial clustering by hypertension and age, with regional overlap. Functional profiles were similar among groups, mainly involving carbohydrate, amino acid, and lipid metabolism, though BMI and age modulated these patterns. Conclusions Gut microbiota composition and diversity in Peruvian adults are influenced by hypertension, age, BMI, and region. Despite comparable functional profiles, environmental and nutritional factors may have a stronger impact than hypertension alone, offering insight for region-specific prevention and treatment strategies.

                <p>by Lingyu Zhang, Weiyang Shi, Ziyang Zhao, Zhichao Wang, Congying Chu, Bokai Zhao, Jiaqi Zhang, Qianhui Liu, Yueheng Lan, Tianzi Jiang</p>

Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) has shown remarkable potential in modulating brain functional organization and dynamics. However, the exact mechanisms underlying its effects remain unclear. In this study, we employed a data-driven approach to analyze recurrent functional connectivity patterns in resting-state fMRI data and developed a parameterized feedback inhibition model to characterize excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) balance. The findings demonstrate that LSD enhances global brain synchrony and dynamic complexity. This enhanced synchrony likely stems from LSD’s preferential stabilization of a globally synchronized yet functionally non-modular brain state - a pattern showing higher occurrence probability and acts as an “attractor” that recruits transitions from cognitive control networks. Crucially, these phenomena appear underpinned by LSD-induced convergence of excitatory/inhibitory balance across cortical hierarchies, particularly through Sensorimotor (SOM) suppression coupled with transmodal potentiation, where the Sensorimotor cortices emerge as potential regulatory hubs driving this neurochemical rebalancing. These convergent effects are consistent with the emergence of a brain state characterized by weakened sensory anchoring and enhanced cognitive flexibility, where the typical separation between concrete perception and abstract cognition becomes blurred. This neurophysiological remodeling therefore suggests a potential mechanism that could contribute to LSD’s hallucinatory effects and its therapeutic potential in mental disorders characterized by rigid thought patterns.

                <p>by Chengxu Han, Zhangdi Song, Zimu Xu, Jiaxing Chen</p>

Accurately inferring cell-cell interactions from spatial transcriptomics data remains challenging due to tissue complexity and spatial heterogeneity. Recent deep learning models have started to combine different types of cellular information, such as spatial proximity, gene expression similarity, ligand–receptor signaling, and in some cases, gene regulatory networks. However, they often treat a cell’s external interactions and internal gene regulation separately, merging them at the final step using simple concatenation or addition. This limits the model’s ability to capture how cell–cell communication and internal molecular states are connected. In this paper, we present MAGNET (Multi-view Graph Autoencoder with Cell-Gene Attention Network), a framework that reconstructs cell–cell interaction networks by building multiple biological graphs and developing a Cell-Gene attention module to link a cell’s environment with its internal gene activity in a unified representation. On benchmark datasets (seqFISH, MERFISH, STARMAP), MAGNET demonstrates superior performance in reconstructing cell-cell interaction networks, achieving an Average Precision(AP) of 0.901 on the seqFISH dataset and outperforming TENET by 0.185. The Cell-Gene Attention module is critical to MAGNET’s performance, as its removal alone caused the AP on the seqFISH dataset to drop from 0.901 to 0.521. Applied to a breast cancer dataset, MAGNET found functional heterogeneity among cancer cells, distinguishing clusters with molecular signatures for either immune evasion or autonomous tumor growth.

                <p>by Daniel H. Huson</p>

Phylogenetic trees and networks play a central role in biology, bioinformatics, and mathematical biology, and producing clear, informative visualizations of them is an important task. We present new algorithms for visualizing rooted phylogenetic networks in either a “combining” or “transfer” view, in both cladogram and phylogram style. In addition, we introduce a layout algorithm that aims to improve clarity by minimizing the total reticulate displacement of reticulate edges. To address the common issue that biological publications often omit machine-readable representations of depicted trees and networks, we also provide an image-based algorithm that assists in extracting their topology from figures. All algorithms are implemented in our new open source PhyloSketch app.

The subcellular localisation of proteins is a key determinant of their function. High-throughput analyses of these localisations can be performed using mass spectrometry-based spatial proteomics, which enables us to examine the localisation and relocalisation of proteins. Furthermore, complementary data sources can provide additional sources of functional or localisation information. Examples include protein annotations and other high-throughput ‘omic assays. Integrating these modalities can provide new insights as well as additional confidence in results, but existing approaches for integrative analyses of spatial proteomics datasets, such as concatenation-based methods and transfer learning approaches like KNN-TL, are limited in the types of data they can integrate and do not quantify uncertainty in their predictions. Here we propose a semi-supervised Bayesian approach (wherein model parameters are inferred from <i>both</i> labeled marker proteins and unlabeled data while quantifying prediction uncertainty) to integrate spatial proteomics datasets with other data sources, to improve the inference of protein sub-cellular localisation. We demonstrate our approach outperforms other transfer-learning methods and has greater flexibility in the data it can model - including categorical annotations (e.g., Gene Ontology terms), continuous measurements (e.g., protein abundance), and temporal profiles (e.g., time-series expression data). To demonstrate the flexibility of our approach, we apply our method to integrate spatial proteomics data generated for the parasite <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i> with time-series gene expression data generated over its cell cycle. Our findings suggest that proteins linked to invasion organelles are associated with expression programs that peak at the end of the first cell-cycle. Furthermore, this integrative analysis divides the dense granule proteins into heterogeneous populations suggestive of potentially different functions. Our method is disseminated via the mdir R package available on the lead author’s Github.

                <p>by Torbjørn V. Ness, Christof Koch, Gaute T. Einevoll</p>

Electrical stimulation of nervous tissue is grounded in well-established biophysical principles, yet understanding its precise effect on neural activity remains challenging. This represents a major obstacle to both scientific and clinical applications of electrical brain stimulation.
We here show that the reciprocity theorem of electromagnetism can be applied more broadly than previously acknowledged, providing a framework for elucidating the effects of electrical brain stimulation on neurons. Through this new perspective, we account for the observed weak frequency-dependence of extracellular electrical stimulation–induced membrane potential changes, and demonstrate a 1/<i>r</i> falloff for nearby and 1/<i>r</i><sup>2</sup> falloff for distant neurons.
We also show that for transcranial electrical stimulation, the susceptibility of a neuron to the stimulation is directly proportional to the size of the current dipole moment resulting from somatic current input. The induced somatic membrane potential changes are small and exhibit weak spatial but strong orientation dependency across human neocortex.
The reciprocity-based approach to electrical stimulation reproduces a large body of previous experimental data, and provides new insights into how ES affects neurons.

                <p>by Nilapratim Sengupta, Jennifer I. Luebke, Christina M. Weaver</p>

Action potentials (APs) propagate along axons to enable precise and rapid neuronal communication. Axon collaterals extend a given neuron’s range by distributing signals to multiple targets, but also increase its electrical demands. Myelination facilitates saltatory conduction, dramatically enhancing transmission speed and ensuring conduction fidelity over long distances. The interplay between myelin dystrophy and axonal arborization remains largely unexplored, despite their role in the impairment of AP conduction in brain circuits. Here we used cohorts of biophysically detailed, multicompartmental models of rhesus monkey dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) layer 3 pyramidal neurons to investigate how axon collateralization, myelin dystrophy, and other structural and biophysical perturbations affect AP conduction velocity (CV). We identified core diameter and branch point location, particularly its distance from the soma, as key structural determinants of CV. Under pathological conditions, branch points emerged as sites of heightened vulnerability, where even focal myelin damage markedly impaired conduction. The efficacy of remyelination to restore CV depended on the number of segments that replaced each demyelinated region. Effective length constant and focal input resistance largely predicted CV reductions caused by structural changes. In addition to demyelination, CV was highly sensitive to variations in axoplasmic and membrane resistivities, the formation of myelin balloons, and ion channel redistribution. These findings offer a mechanistic framework for understanding AP conduction in myelinated axons with complex topologies, while also pointing to potential factors underlying individual differences in vulnerability to cognitive impairments. This work thus provides an important building block for multiscale modeling of network and behavioral effects of aging, as well as axonopathies such as multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer’s disease, and traumatic brain injury.

                <p>by Lalit Pandey, Samantha M. W. Wood, Justin N. Wood</p>

Shape perception is central to human vision, but its developmental origins remain unknown. Here we show that shape perception develops from three ingredients: (1) generic fitting systems, (2) embodied visual experiences, and (3) biologically plausible sensors. We first show that generic fitting models (transformers) trained on embodied visual experiences change from color-based to shape-based visual systems. We then perform <i>in silico</i> controlled-rearing experiments to determine what causes this developmental change. We find that view diversity—experiencing many views of the same object—produces shape perception. For embodied agents, view diversity comes for free: by moving through the world, agents acquire diverse temporally linked views, explaining how and why animals develop shape perception so rapidly. But when view diversity is restricted, by limiting where an agent can look or move, shape perception fails to develop. Finally, we show that retinas naturally transform images in ways that enhance shape learning, providing a biologically plausible substitute for artificial image augmentations. Together, our results support generic fitting theories of brain development and provide a template for building human-like shape perception in machines.

The ubiquitousness of hyphenated mass spectrometry techniques across life sciences has made researchers around the world aware of their analytical power. However, the analysis of multidimensional high-complexity mass spectrometry data remains virtually impossible for non-specialists. LCMSpector is a standalone graphical user interface application for straightforward analysis of targeted mass spectrometry data, distributed under the MIT license and available free of charge for Windows, MacOS, and Linux. The user can upload and process the data entirely locally on their machine by specifying the desired mass-to-charge ratios of the targeted compound ions and simply clicking “Process”. It allows for the processing of multiple files simultaneously, freely modifying and exporting graphs in real time, and calculating compound concentrations based on calibration standards. We show the versatility and applicability of LCMSpector to different kinds of mass spectrometry data by analyzing a series of publicly available datasets from various samples recorded on instruments from multiple vendors and by different research teams.

                <p>by Solène Song, Paul Villoutreix</p>

Development is a complex process driven by coordinated cell proliferation, differentiation, and spatial organization. Classically, two ways to specify cell types during development have been hypothesized: the mosaic and regulative modes. In the mosaic mode, a particular cell isolated from the rest of the embryo will still give rise to progeny with the same fate as expected in normal development, relying on lineage-inherited factors. In contrast, in the regulative mode, the fate of a cell depends on its interactions with its environment and thus relies on space-dependent factors. While both modes often co-exist, their relative contributions remain poorly quantified at single-cell resolution. We present a novel approach to measure these contributions from single-cell data from <i>C. elegans</i> development. The invariant lineage of <i>C. elegans</i> allows the integration of spatial positions, lineage relationships, and protein expression data. Using single-cell protein expression profiles as a readout of cell state, we define two quantifiable metrics: 1) a proxy for the contribution of the mosaic mode, computed as the strength of the relationship between the cell-cell lineage distance and the cell-cell expression distance, 2) a proxy for the contribution of the regulative mode, computed as the strength of the relationship between the cell-cell context distance – capturing spatial neighborhood similarity - and the cell-cell expression distance. To validate these metrics, we compared empirical results from <i>C. elegans</i> to artificial models with defined developmental rules. Our analysis reveals the coexistence of mosaic and regulative modes, with their relative contributions varying across tissues and developmental stages. For example, in skin tissue, the mosaic mode dominates in early development, while the regulative mode prevails later. Our approach offers a quantitative, unbiased, and perturbation-free method to study fundamental principles of developmental biology.

                <p>by Sofia Radrizzani, Juan Rivas-Santisteban, Namshik Han, Laurence D. Hurst</p>

Despite early assumptions of neutrality, numerous mechanisms are now thought to cause selection on synonymous mutations, commonly supported by a low evolutionary rate at synonymous sites (<i>K</i><sub>s</sub>). This has been best evidenced in the first ~10 codons of genes in <i>E. coli,</i> where <i>K</i><sub>s</sub> is less than around half that of the gene body. Diverse lines of evidence support the hypothesis that these first ~10 codons are under selection for high AT content which causes low mRNA stability that in turn enables ribosomal initiation. There remains one enigmatic discrepancy, however, namely that the low <i>K</i><sub>s</sub> domain extends far beyond the first 10 codons. Here we ask why this is. As we see no evidence that the zone influencing protein levels has been misestimated, we consider three further hypotheses: that reduced <i>K</i><sub>s</sub> is a) owing to overlapping genes, b) reflects an extended slow translational “ramp,” and c) is mutational. We reject the first two as in both <i>Escherichia coli</i> and <i>Bacillus sp.</i> the extended low <i>K</i><sub>s</sub> domain persists on analysis of non-overlapping genes and in <i>Bacillus</i>, where fast optimal codons tend to be A/T-ending, a fast-to-slow codon trend is seen. We fail to falsify the third hypothesis. Employing mutation accumulation data for <i>E. coli</i> we show that the 5′ end has a lower mutation rate, with the first 10 codons having a rate around half that of the gene body, this then steadily increasing following the trend seen for <i>K</i><sub>s</sub>. Compositional variation is likely to explain some of the difference, the 5′ end lacking GC-rich runs while these are most mutagenic. We conclude that even a highly reduced <i>K</i><sub>s</sub> is not always adequate to substantiate selection on synonymous mutations. This result has broad implications for inference of the causes of evolutionary rate variation.

                <p>by Ya-Wen Hsueh, Po-Min Chiang</p>

Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) requires high sensitivity, throughput, and broad compatibility across specimens. Current high-capacity methods lack sensitivity compared to low-capacity counterparts. Moreover, tissue-specific methods for collecting cells/nuclei limit unbiased comparisons across samples. Here, we propose a Unified framework by Split-Pool barcoding with optimal-efficiency PolydeoxyAdenylation for scRNA detection (USPPAR). Using short and long dsDNA substrates, low Co²⁺ concentration, while eliminating all other metal-ion components, enabled terminal deoxynucleotide transferase to efficiently polydeoxyadenylate intractable blunt and 3′ recessed dsDNA ends, which was unattainable with other systems. By benchmarking against six state-of-the-art technologies using HEK293, the efficient addition of PCR handles for cDNA amplification made USPPAR’s gene detection sensitivity comparable to high-sensitivity methods and significantly higher than existing high-cell-capacity platforms. In primary PBMCs, USPPAR enabled high-sensitivity, high-resolution scRNA-seq, and lysine conjugation improved sensitivity as an RNase inactivator. Based on nuclease reporter and mRNA protection assays, partially chelated Cu²⁺ served as a potent, non-precipitating, broad-spectrum nuclease inhibitor across various pH levels. Beyond demonstrating high sensitivity in liver tissue, an organ with low nuclease activity, single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) with this inhibitor enabled one-pot extraction of RNA-stable nuclei from nuclease-rich tissues, such as the pancreas. Finally, comparisons with reference datasets from the 10× platform using mouse spleen and maize tissues showed that USPPAR matched cell-type coverage while achieving higher gene-detection efficiency. With five key enzymes available and quality-controlled, USPPAR provides a unified, cost-effective, sensitive method for high-cell-capacity scRNA profiling of diverse specimens without special equipment.

                The human GBA1 gene encodes glucocerebrosidase (GCase), a lysosomal enzyme that hydrolyzes glucosylceramides. Variants in GBA1 and reduced GCase activity have been linked to Parkinson’s disease and Gaucher’s disease. Here we have characterized twenty-four GCase commercial antibodies for western blot, immunoprecipitation, and immunofluorescence using a standardized experimental protocol based on comparing read-outs in knockout cell lines and isogenic parental controls. These studies are part of a larger, collaborative initiative seeking to address antibody reproducibility issues by characterizing commercially available antibodies for human proteins and publishing the results openly as a resource for the scientific community. While the use of antibodies and protocols vary between laboratories, we encourage readers to use this report as a guide to select the most appropriate antibodies for their specific needs.

It is a multifactorial illness in which environmental and genetic parameters contribute to its cause, one of which is interleukins, including interleukin-18 (IL-18). Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the relations among single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs549908 and serum levels of IL-18 in Iraqi patients with AS. Methods During the period of November 2024 and January 2025, a total of 100 individuals were enrolled in the present work, including 50 patients with AS and 50 healthy controls (HC), were obtained from Baghdad Teaching Hospital. Using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and TaqMan real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), serum levels and rs549908 genotyping of IL-18 were estimated. Results Significantly, levels of IL-18 in serum were raised in patients with AS in compared to HC (235.7060 vs. 151.10 pg/mL, p < 0.001). Genetically, T allele frequency (69.0% vs. 49.0%, p = 0.006) and TT genotype frequency (53.1% vs. 23.5%, p = 0.004) were significantly greater in patients with AS compared to HC. Analysis under the model of dominant (TG + GG vs. TT) demonstrated significant relations among status of illness and genotype (OR = 0.29, p = 0.007). Conclusions These outcomes suggest rs549908 SNP and serum levels of IL-18, are related with raised susceptibilities to AS in the Iraqi population.

                Toxic leadership or showcasing leadership skills, which are destructive to team spirit and individuals in the workplace, have been noted to significantly influence employee turnover. The purpose of the SLR (systematic literature review) is to investigate the impact of perceived toxic leadership on employee turnover, with the primary focus on the retail industry in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Fifty journal articles were identified from a systematic analysis of the Science Direct database from 2018 to 2023 and have been included here to investigate toxic leadership, its influence on job satisfaction, organizational commitment, along with strategies that can be adopted to mitigate toxic leadership. This study finds that toxic leadership has a significant impact on turnover intention and organizational commitment of the employees. It affects both the mental and physical well-being of the employees, which leads to poor employee performance. Toxic leadership also negatively impacts the employer brand image and sustainability of the brand. The study outlines that to minimize the negative influence of toxic leadership, companies should provide sufficient consideration for the interests and goals of employees while also fostering emotional intelligence and ensuring that workers feel appreciated and an essential component of the company.

                Background Cooperative interactions between species play a key role in ecosystem persistence, yet most predator–prey models neglect mutualistic effects between prey species. Methodology We formulate a new three-dimensional ecological model describing one predator feeding on two cooperative prey populations, modeled by a system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations. We prove the positivity and boundedness of solutions, determine all biologically meaningful equilibrium points and establish their local and global stability using linearization, Lyapunov functions and the Routh–Hurwitz criteria. We then perform a bifurcation analysis with respect to key parameters, such as natural growth, natural mortality and predator attack and conversion rates. Finally, we carry out numerical simulations in MATLAB to illustrate and complement the analytical results. Results The analysis shows that, for a realistic set of parameter values, the system admits a unique interior equilibrium that is globally asymptotically stable, and no periodic dynamics are observed. Variations in the growth rates of both prey, the predator mortality rate and the attack and conversion rates can shift the stability of equilibria and generate transcritical bifurcations. The cooperative interaction between the two prey populations enlarges the parameter region that ensures coexistence and improves the long-term persistence of all species. Numerical simulations confirm the analytical predictions and visualize the trajectories converging to the stable equilibrium. Conclusions The proposed model clarifies how mutualistic interactions among prey species can stabilize predator–prey systems and enhance ecosystem sustainability. The theoretical framework and numerical results may be used as a reference for further ecological modeling that incorporates cooperation, harvesting or environmental disturbances.

     alt="Cannabidiol as a Neuroprotective Agent in Acrylamide-Induced Neurotoxicity: Effects on Oxidative Stress, Inflammation, and Cholinergic Function in Male Mice"/>
<p>Cannabidiol (CBD) protects against acrylamide-induced neurotoxicity in mice by reducing oxidative stress, inflammation, and cholinergic dysfunction, while restoring BDNF levels. These findings highlight CBD's potential as a therapeutic agent for preventing environmental neurotoxicity and supporting brain health.</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The neuroprotective potential of cannabidiol (CBD) was assessed in a mouse model of acrylamide-induced neurotoxicity. Acrylamide (AA), an environmental and dietary pollutant, is known to cross the blood–brain barrier and induce oxidative stress, inflammation and neurotoxic effects. Male C57BL/6 mice were randomly assigned to four groups: Control (Con), Acrylamide (AA), Cannabidiol (CBD), and a combination treatment (AA + CBD). The AA group received acrylamide (10 mg/kg, i.p.) daily for 5 days. CBD was administered (10 mg/kg, i.p.) for 10 days in the CBD and AA + CBD groups. In the AA + CBD group, acrylamide (10 mg/kg, i.p.) was co-administered during the last 5 days of CBD treatment. Behavioral outcomes were analyzed using the open field test, revealing that CBD mitigated anxiety-like behavior induced by acrylamide, enhancing movement and center exploration. Further, CBD treatment modulated oxidative stress responses, reducing MDA levels and partially restoring antioxidant markers (GSH, SOD, and CAT) in the hippocampus and striatum. Inflammatory markers were also assessed, revealing that acrylamide elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-6. Notably, CBD co-treatment reduced TNF-α levels in the hippocampus and cortex and attenuated IL-6 levels in the cortex and striatum, suggesting an anti-inflammatory effect. Additionally, CBD modulated neuroplasticity by increasing BDNF levels in the hippocampus, counteracting the reduction caused by acrylamide. CBD also influenced cholinergic activity by restoring Ach levels and altering AChE activity across brain regions. Findings suggest that CBD exhibits neuroprotective properties by reducing oxidative stress, inflammation and cholinergic dysregulation, thereby offering a promising therapeutic approach for mitigating pollutant-induced neurotoxicity and potentially treating neurodegenerative disorders.</p>

<p>Prolonged dual-site intermittent theta burst stimulation combined with cognitive training, may modulate beta and gamma oscillations during the Stroop task, suggesting potential effects on motor inhibition and processing speed in response inhibition.</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) combined with cognitive training (CT) has been explored as a potential novel method to improve response inhibition, but its neural mechanisms remain unclear. This study investigated the effects of rTMS + CT on oscillatory activity across different frequency bands and theta-gamma phase-amplitude coupling during the Stroop task. Sixty healthy participants were randomly assigned to receive four sessions of either active or sham prolonged intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) + CT. Each session involved iTBS over both the right inferior frontal cortex and the pre-supplementary motor area, with participants completing the Stop Signal training task first, followed by the Go/No-Go training task. The Stroop task was administered before and immediately after the intervention while electroencephalography was recorded. There was a significant group effect on the change in beta desynchronization during incongruent trials (<i>t</i> = −2.03, <i>p</i> = 0.048), with a significant decrease observed in the active group (<i>p</i> = 0.03) and no change in the sham group (<i>p</i> = 0.83). Additionally, changes in gamma synchronization differed between groups for congruent trials (<i>t</i> = 2.28, <i>p</i> = 0.03), though neither group showed a significant pre-post change (<i>p</i> &gt; 0.05). Our study suggests that four sessions of iTBS + CT may modulate beta and gamma oscillations during the Stroop task, potentially enhancing motor inhibition and processing speed in response inhibition. These results provide neurophysiological insights into the neural mechanisms through which rTMS + CT may enhance response inhibition.</p>

                Gomez, Wu, et al. demonstrate that breast cancer promotes blunted glucocorticoid diurnal rhythms via disinhibition of PVNCRH neurons. Restoration of normal glucocorticoid rhythms via endogenous activation of the HPA axis reduces tumor progression and boosts anti-tumor immunity. This neural mechanism offers a novel target for potential anti-cancer therapy.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98652">Dissociable memory modulation mechanisms facilitate fear amnesia at different timescales</a></h4>

              
                Memory reactivation renders consolidated memory fragile and thereby opens the window for memory updates, such as memory reconsolidation. However, whether memory retrieval facilitates update mechanisms other than memory reconsolidation remains unclear. We tested this hypothesis in three experiments with healthy human participants. First, we demonstrate that memory retrieval-extinction protocol prevents the return of fear expression shortly after extinction training, and this short-term effect is memory reactivation dependent (Study 1, <i>N</i>=57 adults). Furthermore, across different timescales, the memory retrieval-extinction paradigm triggers distinct types of fear amnesia in terms of cue specificity and cognitive control ability dependence, suggesting that the short-term fear amnesia might be caused by different mechanisms from the cue-specific amnesia at a longer and separable timescale (Study 2, <i>N</i>=79 adults). Finally, using continuous theta-burst stimulation (Study 3, <i>N</i>=75 adults), we directly manipulated brain activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and found that both memory reactivation and intact prefrontal cortex function were necessary for the short-term fear amnesia after the retrieval-extinction protocol. The differences in temporal scale, cue specificity, and cognitive control ability dependence between the short- and long-term amnesia suggest that memory retrieval and extinction training trigger distinct underlying memory update mechanisms. These findings suggest the potential involvement of coordinated memory modulation processes upon memory retrieval and may inform clinical approaches for treating persistent maladaptive memories.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/105452">Early changes in the properties of CA3 engram cells explored with a novel viral tool in mice</a></h4>

              
                Forming new memories after a one-time experience requires initial encoding then consolidation over time. During learning, multimodal information converges onto the hippocampus, activating sparse neuronal assemblies which are thought to form a memory representation through concerted activity and synaptic interconnectivity. In this work, we use a novel tool for fast fluorescent labeling of engram neurons (FLEN). FLEN is based on c-Fos activity-dependent transient expression of a destabilized fluorescent marker ZsGreen1 rapidly after one-trial learning. With FLEN, we explore the electrophysiological properties of c-Fos activated CA3 pyramidal neurons (PNs) a few hours following one-trial learning of an episodic-like memory. In parallel, we employ the Robust Activity Marker (RAM) system, which provides activity-dependent labeling 24 hr following a novel experience. Comparing FLEN+ and RAM+ neurons allows us to characterize how the properties of neuronal assemblies evolve during an initial phase of consolidation. Whereas no difference was observed in the excitability of FLEN+ vs. FLEN− neurons, RAM+ neurons were more excitable than RAM− neurons. This suggests that CA3 PNs recruited in an engram progressively acquire increased excitability as compared to neurons which were not activated by the one-trial contextual memory task. On the other hand, like RAM+ neurons, FLEN+ CA3 neurons show an increased number of excitatory inputs. Overall, with the FLEN strategy, we can show that both the intrinsic excitability and the synaptic properties of CA3 PNs undergo progressive plastic changes over the first day following a one-trial memory task.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/105876">IL-27 limits HSPC differentiation during infection and protects from stem cell exhaustion</a></h4>

              
                Many inflammatory stimuli can induce progenitor cells in the bone marrow to produce increased numbers of myeloid cells as part of the process of emergency myelopoiesis. These events are associated with trained immunity and have long-term impacts on hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) development but can also compromise their function. While many cytokines support emergency myelopoiesis, less is known about the mechanisms that temper these events. When mice that lack the cytokine IL-27 were infected with <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i>, there was enhanced generation of monocyte progenitors and increased numbers of inflammatory monocytes. In the bone marrow of infected mice, there was increased production of IL-27 that localized with HSPCs, and a survey of cytokine receptor expression highlighted that HSPCs were uniquely poised to respond to IL-27. Furthermore, the use of in vitro differentiation assays and mixed bone marrow chimeras revealed that HSPCs from IL-27-deficient mice are predisposed toward the monocyte lineage. Additional studies highlighted that after infection, loss of the IL-27R resulted in reduced HSPC fitness that manifested as reduced proliferative responses and a decreased ability to reconstitute the hematopoietic system. Thus, the ability of IL-27 to act on HSPC provides a regulatory brake on differentiation to limit monocyte induction and preserve HSPC stemness.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98289">Chromatin accessibility variation provides insights into missing regulation underlying immune-mediated diseases</a></h4>

              
                Most genetic loci associated with complex traits and diseases through genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are noncoding, suggesting that the causal variants likely have gene regulatory effects. However, only a small number of loci have been linked to expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) detected currently. To better understand the potential reasons for many trait-associated loci lacking eQTL colocalization, we investigated whether chromatin accessibility QTLs (caQTLs) in lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) explain immune-mediated disease associations that eQTLs in LCLs did not. The power to detect caQTLs was greater than that of eQTLs and was less affected by the distance from the transcription start site of the associated gene. Meta-analyzing LCL eQTL data to increase the sample size to over a thousand led to additional loci with eQTL colocalization, demonstrating that insufficient statistical power is still likely to be a factor. Moreover, further eQTL colocalization loci were uncovered by surveying eQTLs of other immune cell types. Altogether, insufficient power and context specificity of eQTLs both contribute to the ‘missing regulation’.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Little is known about neural mechanisms that suppress learning, although such mechanisms are crucial for adaptive learning, which occurs selectively for items relevant to an observer's task but not for task-irrelevant items. Here, we examined neural mechanisms involved in suppressing visual perceptual learning (VPL), a type of visual skill learning, for a repeatedly exposed task-irrelevant coherent motion direction. The direction was either perceptually salient (suprathreshold for coherent motion detection) or weak (near detection threshold). Excitatory and inhibitory processing of the task-irrelevant direction during exposure was measured in early visual areas (V1 and V2) in the occipital lobes with functional magnetic resonance spectroscopy (fMRS). The results showed that, compared to near threshold exposure, VPL for the coherent motion direction was suppressed in suprathreshold exposure. Excitatory processing in early visual areas, as reflected in the concentration of glutamate, was reduced during suprathreshold compared to near threshold exposure. No modulation of inhibitory processing, as reflected in the concentration of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), was found. These results suggest that a gating mechanism operates within early visual areas that acts to suppress VPL for salient task-irrelevant signals by reducing excitatory processing.</span>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-1396/v1?src=rss">Gamification in digital healthcare: from evidence review to a novel framework for enhancing patient engagement in chronic disease management [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Chronic diseases impose a substantial global health burden, with outcomes frequently compromised by suboptimal long-term patient engagement and adherence to treatment regimens. Gamification, the application of game-design principles in non-game contexts, has emerged as a promising strategy to enhance patient motivation and self-management. Methods This paper introduces a comprehensive, theory-driven gamification framework designed for integration within a Virtual Health Coach (VHC) system for chronic disease management. Based on Self-Determination Theory, Behavioural Economics, and the Health Belief Model, the framework synthesises five core components: adaptive challenges tailored to individual progress, interactive educational modules, structured reward incentives, social support features, and seamless integration with wearable devices for real-time feedback. Results Recognising that implementation is impeded by challenges such as the digital divide, data privacy concerns, and the risk of user fatigue, this work also proposes a robust analytics framework to guide evaluation and continuous refinement. This evaluation model employs a mixed-methods approach, combining metrics for user engagement, clinical health outcomes, and patient-reported satisfaction with A/B testing and machine learning for predictive analytics. Conclusions The proposed gamified VHC architecture offers a blueprint for developing adaptive, personalised, and sustainable digital health interventions that can enhance patient adherence and improve outcomes, thereby advancing the paradigm of patient-centred chronic care.

<p>RT-fMRI neurofeedback targeting the amygdala-hippocampus complex was followed by changes in amygdala connectivity with prefrontal, temporal, and occipital regions in depressed youth. Neurofeedback was also associated with hemisphere-specific amygdala-cuneus shifts that were associated with improvements in rumination and depression symptoms.</p>

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Major depressive disorder is a significant health concern among adolescents due to its link to suicide and lifetime impairments. Current treatments yield limited success, but real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (RT-fMRI) neurofeedback (NF) is a promising intervention. We tested the effects of RT-fMRI neurofeedback on the modulation of neural circuitry underlying self-referential processing and emotion regulation in youth trying to up-regulate the amygdala-hippocampus (AMYHIPP) complex. We examined amygdala functional connectivity during a self-other face recognition task before and after RT-fMRI NF from the AMYHIPP complex. (1) Depressed youth showed higher bilateral amygdala to anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), superior temporal and frontal gyri connectivity compared to controls, who showed lower connectivity before NF. Yet after NF, this pattern reversed, with depressed youth showing lower bilateral amygdala connectivity than controls. (2) Depressed youth showed <i>increased right</i> amygdala-cuneus connectivity while controls showed <i>increased left</i> amygdala-cuneus connectivity during self-other face recognition. (3) Lower right amygdala-cuneus connectivity was linked to improved rumination. Higher left amygdala-cuneus connectivity was linked to improved depression. (4) Shifts of less right versus left amygdala to superior middle temporal gyri connectivity after neurofeedback, and of more right versus left amygdala to middle frontal gyrus after NF, were linked to higher AMYHIPP engagement during training. This is suggestive of NF training effects upon implicit versus explicit emotion circuits. Caution is necessary regarding the meaning of symptoms to circuits associations and putative mechanisms of neurofeedback training given the lack of a placebo group.</p>

                <p>RNA localization to neuronal axons and dendrites provides spatiotemporal control over gene expression to support synapse function. Neuronal messenger RNAs (mRNAs) localize as ribonucleoprotein particles (RNPs), commonly known as RNA granules, the composition of which influences when and where proteins are made. High-throughput sequencing has revealed thousands of mRNAs that localize to the hippocampal neuropil. Whether these mRNAs are spatially organized into common RNA granules or distributed as independent mRNAs for proper delivery to synapses is debated. Here, using highly multiplexed single-molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization (HiPlex smFISH) and colocalization analyses, we investigate the subcellular spatial distribution of 15 synaptic neuropil localized mRNAs in the male and female rodent hippocampus. We observed that these mRNAs are present in the neuropil as heterogeneously sized fluorescent puncta with spatial colocalization patterns that generally scale by neuropil mRNA abundance. Indeed, differentially expressed mRNAs across cell types displayed colocalization patterns that scaled by abundance, as did simulations that reproduce cell-specific differences in abundance. Thus, the probability of these mRNAs colocalizing in the neuropil is best explained by stochastic interactions based on abundance, which places constraints on the mechanisms mediating efficient transport to synapses.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-1395/v1?src=rss">Exploring the Mediating Role of Teacher–Student Interaction in Technology-Enhanced Vocational Education: Evidence from a Structural Equation Modelling Study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                The integration of digital technology in vocational education has redefined instructional delivery and learner engagement. However, the extent to which technology enhances learning depends largely on the quality of teacher–student interaction. This study investigates the mediating role of Teacher–Student Interaction (TSI) in the relationship between the Technology-Enhanced Learning Environment (TEL) and Learning Engagement (LE). Drawing on the Community of Inquiry (CoI) and Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) frameworks, this research tested a structural model to explain how interaction bridges technological and pedagogical processes in vocational learning contexts. A total of 362 valid responses were collected from vocational students across Indonesia using a stratified sampling approach. The data were analyzed through Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) using SmartPLS 4 with 5,000 bootstrap samples. The results demonstrated that TEL positively influenced TSI (β = 0.71, p < .001) and LE (β = 0.39, p < .01). Moreover, TSI significantly predicted LE (β = 0.53, p < .001). The indirect pathway from TEL to LE through TSI was also significant (β = 0.37, p < .001), indicating partial mediation with a Variance Accounted for (VAF) of 48.7%. The model achieved an excellent fit (χ2/df = 2.31, CFI = 0.953, TLI = 0.947, SRMR = 0.046, RMSEA = 0.048) and explained 55% of the variance in TSI and 68% in LE. These findings affirm that technology integration enhances learning engagement primarily when mediated by active teacher–student interaction. The study underscores that digital transformation in vocational education must emphasize pedagogical presence and communicative interaction to sustain engagement, particularly in remote and under-resourced (3T) regions.

Computational modeling of peripheral nerve fibers is a key tool for designing improved neuromodulation therapies. The NEURON software is commonly used to create biophysical simulations of nerve fibers, often in the outdated HOC language. Whether written in HOC or Python, implementing fiber simulations involves a steep learning curve and requires a large amount of standard, boilerplate code that is typically written anew for each project. There is a need for a code package that standardizes and simplifies the creation of model fibers, the execution of simulations of electrical stimulation, and the analysis of the resulting data. We created PyFibers, a NEURON-Python package that provides tools for accomplishing all these tasks and supports the development of new fiber models and stimulation protocols. PyFibers includes 11 fiber models from prior publications under a shared framework, and we validated each model’s implementation in PyFibers against the original results. Our open-source tool simplifies and standardizes computational modeling of peripheral nerve fiber responses to electrical stimulation, providing a platform for the development of novel therapies using electrical stimulation, block, and recording.

                <p>by Yuqing Hou, Oranti Ahmed Omi, Michael W. Stuck, Xi Cheng, Bethany Walker, Ying-Wai Lam, Anna M. Schmoker, Son N. Nguyen, Maria Paz Gonzalez-Perez, Bryan A. Ballif, Karl F. Lechtreck, George B. Witman, Gregory J. Pazour</p>

Variants in the protein kinase CDKL5 cause CDKL5 Deficiency Disorder (CDD), a severe neurodevelopmental condition characterized by seizures, developmental delay, and intellectual disability. The <i>Chlamydomonas</i> homolog of CDKL5, LF5, is a flagellar protein whose loss leads to elongated flagella. Here, we combine live-cell imaging, immunofluorescence, and biochemical approaches including mass spectrometry to define how CDKL5 activity is regulated and how its loss alters ciliary function. We find that <i>Chlamydomonas</i> CDKL5 is activated by LF2, a cyclin-dependent kinase, through phosphorylation of its activation loop. This activation controls CDKL5 localization in steady-state cilia, down-regulates its IFT-mediated transport as flagella reach steady-state, controls ciliary abundance of IFT proteins, and controls phosphorylation of the tubulin-binding domain of IFT74, thereby influencing flagellar length. Mouse Cdkl5 shows similar properties: it localizes within cilia, its loss leads to ciliary elongation, and its localization depends on both its kinase activity and Cdk20, the mammalian ortholog of LF2. These results extend our understanding of ciliary length control, challenge the prevailing model that CDKL5 is activated by autophosphorylation, and suggest that CDD pathogenesis arises, at least in part, from disruption of this conserved ciliary regulatory pathway.

The <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i> species complex inhabits a wide variety of hosts and environments, and is a major cause of antimicrobial resistant infections. Genomics has revealed the population comprises multiple species/sub-species and hundreds of distinct co-circulating sub-lineage (SLs) that are associated with distinct gene complements. A substantial fraction of the pan-genome is predicted to be involved in metabolic functions and hence these data are consistent with metabolic differentiation at the SL level. However, this has so far remained unsubstantiated because in the past it was not possible to explore metabolic variation at scale. Here, we used a combination of comparative genomics and high-throughput genome-scale metabolic modeling to systematically explore metabolic diversity across the <i>K. pneumoniae</i> species complex (<i>n</i> = 7,835 genomes). We simulated growth outcomes for each isolate using carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur sources under aerobic and anaerobic conditions (<i>n</i> = 1,278 conditions per isolate). We showed that the distributions of metabolic genes and growth capabilities are structured in the population, and confirmed that SLs exhibit unique metabolic profiles. In vitro co-culture experiments demonstrated reciprocal commensalistic cross-feeding between SLs, effectively extending the range of conditions supporting individual growth. We propose that these substrate specializations may promote the existence and persistence of co-circulating SLs by reducing nutrient competition and facilitating commensal interactions. Our findings have implications for understanding the eco-evolutionary dynamics of <i>K. pneumoniae</i> and for the design of novel strategies to prevent opportunistic infections caused by this World Health Organization priority antimicrobial resistant pathogen.

The liver’s regenerative capacity is underscored by the plasticity potential of adult hepatocytes. In this context, hepatocyte-to-cholangiocyte transdifferentiation (HCT) has been ascribed with pro-regenerative functions in animal models and is a feature of end-stage human chronic liver diseases. While dampened activities of hepatocyte identity transcription factors (TFs) underlay HCT, how the cholangiocyte transcriptional program is implemented is poorly defined. Here, we identify that HCT does not involve transitioning through a hepatoblast-like transcriptional program. Furthermore, we show that HCT primarily involves induction of the archetypal transcriptional program of monopolarized epithelial cells initially repressed in hepatocytes. Indeed, HCT requires relieving H3K27me3-mediated and polycomb-dependent epigenetic silencing of epithelial TF encoding genes including <i>Grainyhead Like Transcription Factor 2</i> (<i>GRHL2</i>). Ectopic expression of GRHL2 in hepatocytes, including in vivo in the adult mouse liver, induces epithelial genes reminiscent of those activated during HCT. Finally, GRHL2 is detected in human hepatocytes undergoing HCT as evidenced using samples from end-stage chronic liver diseases. Hence, HCT is a process chiefly characterized by induction of a conventional epithelial transcriptional program originally lacking in hepatocytes promoted by derepression of the master epithelial TF GRHL2.

The molecular basis of endospore formation in the model gram-positive bacterium <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> has been investigated for over half a century. Here, using high throughput and classical genetic approaches, we performed a comparative analysis of sporulation in the human pathogen <i>Bacillus anthracis</i>. A transposon-sequencing screen identified >150 genes required for <i>B. anthracis</i> sporulation. As anticipated, many of the genes that are critical for sporulation in <i>B. subtilis</i> were also required for <i>B. anthracis</i> sporulation. However, we identified >50 genes that are important for sporulation in <i>B. anthracis</i> but not in <i>B. subtilis,</i> and 22 <i>B. anthracis</i> sporulation genes that are absent from the <i>B. subtilis</i> genome. To validate the hits from our screen, we generated an ordered transposon-mutant library using Knockout Sudoku. Cytological analysis of a subset of the canonical sporulation-defective mutants revealed similar but not identical phenotypes in the pathogen compared to the model. We investigated several of the newly identified sporulation genes, with an in-depth analysis of one, ORF <i>04167</i>, renamed <i>ipdA</i>. Sporulating cells lacking <i>ipdA</i> are blocked in the morphological process of engulfment, generating septal bulges. An AlphaFold-Multimer screen and a classical genetic enrichment revealed that IpdA is a secreted inhibitor of the polysaccharide deacetylase PdaN. Our data support a model in which induction of IpdA at the onset of sporulation inhibits deacetylation of the cell wall peptidoglycan (PG), enabling the sporulation-specific PG hydrolases to catalyze engulfment. Altogether, our studies reveal that <i>B. subtilis</i> is an excellent model for endospore formation in <i>B. anthracis</i>, while underscoring the importance of direct analysis in <i>B. anthracis</i>. The suite of tools that we have generated will catalyze the molecular dissection of sporulation and other cell biological processes in this important human pathogen.

Red blood cell production is one of the most dynamic processes, yet the underlying mechanisms responsible are only partially understood. A new study in PLOS Biology suggests a broadly applicable mechanism able to balance the maintenance of the steady-state and effective stress response.
