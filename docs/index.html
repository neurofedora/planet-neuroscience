              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">IGF1 Receptor Regulates Upward Firing Rate Homeostasis via the Mitochondrial Calcium Uniporter</a></h4>

              
                Regulation of firing rate homeostasis constitutes a fundamental property of central neural circuits. While intracellular Ca2+ has long been hypothesized to be a feedback control signal, the molecular machinery enabling network-wide homeostatic response remains largely unknown. Here we show that deletion of insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF1R), a well-known regulator of neurodevelopment and ageing, limits firing rate homeostasis in response to inactivity, without altering the baseline firing rate distribution. Disruption of both synaptic and intrinsic homeostatic plasticity contributed to deficient firing rate homeostatic response. At the cellular level, a fraction of IGF1Rs was localized in mitochondria with the mitochondrial calcium uniporter complex (MCUc). IGF1R deletion suppressed mitochondrial Ca2+ (mitoCa2+) evoked by spike bursts by weakening mitochondria-to-cytosol Ca2+ coupling. This coupling was homeostatically maintained following inactivity in control, but upregulated in IGF1R-deficient neurons. MCUc overexpression in IGF1R-deficient neurons rescued the deficits in spike-to-mitoCa2+ coupling and firing rate homeostasis. Our findings highlight IGF1R as a key regulator of the integrated homeostatic response by tuning mitochondrial temporal filtering. Decline in mitochondrial reliability for burst transfer may drive dysregulation of firing rate homeostasis in brain disorders associated with abnormal IGF1R / MCUc signaling.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The human thalamus orchestrates neocortical oscillations during NREM sleep.</a></h4>

              
                A hallmark of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep is the coordinated interplay of slow oscillations (SOs) and sleep spindles. Traditionally, a cortico-thalamo-cortical loop is suggested to coordinate these rhythms: neocortically-generated SOs trigger spindles in the thalamus that are projected back to neocortex. Here, we used direct intrathalamic recordings from human epilepsy patients to test this canonical interplay. We show that SOs in the anterior thalamus precede neocortical SOs, whereas concurrently-recorded SOs in the mediodorsal thalamus are led by neocortical SOs. Furthermore, sleep spindles, detected in both thalamic nuclei, preceded their neocortical counterparts and were initiated during early phases of thalamic SOs. Our findings indicate an active role of the anterior thalamus in organizing the cardinal sleep rhythms in the neocortex and highlight the functional diversity of specific thalamic nuclei in humans. The concurrent coordination of sleep oscillations by the thalamus could have broad implications for the mechanisms underlying memory consolidation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Disruption in structural-functional network repertoire and time resolved subcortical-frontoparietal connectivity in disorders of consciousness</a></h4>

              
                Understanding recovery of consciousness and elucidating its underlying mechanism is believed to be crucial in the field of basic neuroscience and medicine. Ideas such as the global neuronal workspace and the mesocircuit theory hypothesize that failure of recovery in conscious states coincide with loss of connectivity between subcortical and frontoparietal areas, a loss of the repertoire of functional networks states and metastable brain activation. We adopted a time-resolved functional connectivity framework to explore these ideas and assessed the repertoire of functional network states as a potential marker of consciousness and its potential ability to tell apart patients in the unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (UWS) and minimally conscious state (MCS). In addition, prediction of these functional network states by underlying hidden spatial patterns in the anatomical network, i.e. so-called eigenmodes, were supplemented as potential markers. By analysing time-resolved functional connectivity from fMRI data, we demonstrated a reduction of metastability and functional network repertoire in UWS compared to MCS patients. This was expressed in terms of diminished dwell times and loss of nonstationarity in the default mode network and fronto-parietal subcortical network in UWS compared to MCS patients. We further demonstrated that these findings co-occurred with a loss of dynamic interplay between structural eigenmodes and emerging time-resolved functional connectivity in UWS. These results are, amongst others, in support of the global neuronal workspace theory and the mesocircuit hypothesis, underpinning the role of time-resolved thalamo-cortical connections and metastability in the recovery of consciousness.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Ion channel distributions in cortical neurons are optimized for energy-efficient active dendritic computations</a></h4>

              
                The mammalian brain uses more than 20% of the energy consumed by the entire body. This enormous demand for energy is thought to impose strong selective pressure by which neurons evolve in ways that ensure robust function at minimal energy cost. Here we demonstrate that the ion channel expression patterns by which pyramidal tract neurons - the major output cell type of the cerebral cortex - could implement their complex intrinsic physiology is extremely widespread. Surprisingly, this wide spectrum does not reflect morphological variability, but the energy costs for generating dendritic calcium action potentials. We found that energy-efficient calcium action potentials require a low expression of slow inactivating potassium channels in the distal dendrites, an empirical observation whose significance remained unclear for more than a decade. Thus, cortical neurons do not utilize all theoretically possible ways to implement their functions, but instead appear to select those optimized for energy-efficient active dendritic computations.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Entorhinal cortex directs learning-related changes in CA1 representations</a></h4>

              
                Learning-related changes in brain activity are thought to underlie adaptive behaviors. For instance, the learning of a reward site by rodents requires the development of an over-representation of that location in the hippocampus. However, how this learning-related change occurs remains unknown. Here we recorded hippocampal CA1 population activity as mice learned a reward location on a linear treadmill. Physiological and pharmacological evidence suggests that the adaptive over-representation required behavioral timescale synaptic plasticity (BTSP). BTSP is known to be driven by dendritic voltage signals that we hypothesized were initiated by input from entorhinal cortex layer 3 (EC3). Accordingly, the CA1 over-representation was largely removed by optogenetic inhibition of EC3 activity. Recordings from EC3 neurons revealed an activity pattern that could provide an instructive signal directing BTSP to generate the over-representation. Consistent with this function, exposure to a second environment possessing a prominent reward-predictive cue resulted in both EC3 activity and CA1 place field density that were more elevated at the cue than the reward. These data indicate that learning-related changes in the hippocampus are produced by synaptic plasticity directed by an instructive signal from the EC3 that appears to be specifically adapted to the behaviorally relevant features of the environment.

	<p>Theta-burst stimulation (TBS) is a form of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) developed to induce neuroplasticity. TBS usually consists of 50 Hz bursts at 5 Hz intervals. It can facilitate motor evoked potentials (MEPs) when applied intermittently, although this effect can vary between individuals. Here, we sought to determine whether a modified version of intermittent TBS (iTBS) consisting of 30 Hz bursts repeated at 6 Hz intervals would lead to lasting MEP facilitation. We also investigated whether recruitment of early and late indirect waves (I-waves) would predict individual responses to 30 Hz iTBS. Participants (n = 19) underwent single-pulse TMS to assess MEP amplitude at baseline and variations in MEP latency in response to anterior-posterior, posterior-anterior, and latero-medial stimulation. Then, 30 Hz iTBS was administered, and MEP amplitude was reassessed at 5-, 20- and 45-min. Post iTBS, most participants (13/19) exhibited MEP facilitation, with significant effects detected at 20- and 45-min. Contrary to previous evidence, recruitment of early I-waves predicted facilitation to 30 Hz iTBS. These observations suggest that 30 Hz/6 Hz iTBS is effective in inducing lasting facilitation in corticospinal excitability and may offer an alternative to the standard 50 Hz/5 Hz protocol.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=10974547&type=etoc&feed=rss">Neurofluids—Deep inspiration, cilia and preloading of the astrocytic network</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>With the advent of real-time MRI, the motion and passage of cerebrospinal fluid can be visualized without gating and exclusion of low-frequency waves. This imaging modality gives insights into low-volume, rapidly oscillating cardiac-driven movement as well as sustained, high-volume, slowly oscillating inspiration-driven movement. Inspiration means a spontaneous or artificial increase in the intrathoracic dimensions independent of body position. Alterations in thoracic diameter enable the thoracic and spinal epidural venous compartments to be emptied and filled, producing an upward surge of cerebrospinal fluid inside the spine during inspiration; this surge counterbalances the downward pooling of venous blood toward the heart. Real-time MRI, as a macroscale in vivo observation method, could expand our knowledge of neurofluid dynamics, including how astrocytic fluid preloading is adjusted and how brain buoyancy and turgor are maintained in different postures and zero gravity. Along with these macroscale findings, new microscale insights into aquaporin-mediated fluid transfer, its sensing by cilia, and its tuning by nitric oxide will be reviewed. By incorporating clinical knowledge spanning several disciplines, certain disorders—congenital hydrocephalus with Chiari malformation, idiopathic intracranial hypertension, and adult idiopathic hydrocephalus—are interpreted and reviewed according to current concepts, from the basics of the interrelated systems to their pathology.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=10974547&type=etoc&feed=rss">Is cyclooxygenase‐1 involved in neuroinflammation?</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p><i>Purpose:</i> Reactive microglia are an important hallmark of neuroinflammation. Reactive microglia release various inflammatory mediators, such as cytokines, chemokines, and prostaglandins, which are produced by enzymes like cyclooxygenases (COX). The inducible COX-2 subtype has been associated with inflammation, whereas the constitutively expressed COX-1 subtype is generally considered as a housekeeping enzyme. However, recent evidence suggests that COX-1 can also be upregulated and may play a prominent role in the brain during neuroinflammation. In this review, we summarize the evidence that supports this involvement of COX-1. <i>Methods</i>: Five databases were used to retrieve relevant studies that addressed COX-1 in the context of neuroinflammation. The search resulted in 32 articles, describing <i>in vitro</i>, <i>in vivo</i>, post mortem, and <i>in vivo</i> imaging studies that specifically investigated the COX-1 isoform under such conditions. <i>Results</i>: Reviewed literature generally indicated that the overexpression of COX-1 was induced by an inflammatory stimulus, which resulted in an increased production of prostaglandin E2. The pharmacological inhibition of COX-1 was shown to suppress the induction of inflammatory mediators like prostaglandin E2. Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging studies in animal models confirmed the overexpression of COX-1 during neuroinflammation. The same imaging method, however, could not detect any upregulation of COX-1 in patients with Alzheimer's disease. <i>Conclusion</i>: Taken together, studies in cultured cells and living rodents suggest that COX-1 is involved in neuroinflammation. Most postmortem studies on human brains indicate that the concentration of COX-1-expressing microglial cells is increased near sites of inflammation. However, evidence for the involvement of COX-1 in neuroinflammation in the living human brain is still largely lacking.</p>

<p>Shortening the open duration of the ryanodine receptor 2 (RyR2) channel genetically by the RyR2-E4872Q mutation or pharmacologically by R-carvedilol prevented learning and memory impairment, dendritic spine loss, and neuronal cell death in the 3xTG-AD mouse model.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Increasing evidence suggests that Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression is driven by a vicious cycle of soluble β-amyloid (Aβ)-induced neuronal hyperactivity. Thus, breaking this vicious cycle by suppressing neuronal hyperactivity may represent a logical approach to stopping AD progression. In support of this, we have recently shown that genetically and pharmacologically limiting ryanodine receptor 2 (RyR2) open time prevented neuronal hyperactivity, memory impairment, dendritic spine loss, and neuronal cell death in a rapid, early onset AD mouse model (5xFAD). Here, we assessed the impact of limiting RyR2 open time on AD-related deficits in a relatively late occurring, slow developing AD mouse model (3xTG-AD) that bears more resemblance (compared to 5xFAD) to that of human AD. Using behavioral tests, long-term potentiation recordings, and Golgi and Nissl staining, we found that the RyR2-E4872Q mutation, which markedly shortens the open duration of the RyR2 channel, prevented learning and memory impairment, defective long-term potentiation, dendritic spine loss, and neuronal cell death in the 3xTG-AD mice. Furthermore, pharmacologically shortening the RyR2 open time with R-carvedilol rescued these AD-related deficits in 3xTG mice. Therefore, limiting RyR2 open time may offer a promising, neuronal hyperactivity-targeted anti-AD strategy.</p>

<p>LDT–VTA inputs optogenetic manipulation changes motivational drive and modifies preference.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The laterodorsal tegmentum (LDT) is a brainstem nucleus classically involved in REM sleep and attention, and that has recently been associated with reward-related behaviors, as it controls the activity of ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopaminergic neurons, modulating dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens. To further understand the role of LDT–VTA inputs in reinforcement, we optogenetically manipulated these inputs during different behavioral paradigms in male rats. We found that in a two-choice instrumental task, optical activation of LDT–VTA projections shifts and amplifies preference to the laser-paired reward in comparison to an otherwise equal reward; the opposite was observed with inhibition experiments. In a progressive ratio task, LDT–VTA activation boosts motivation, that is, enhances the willingness to work to get the reward associated with LDT–VTA stimulation; and the reverse occurs when inhibiting these inputs. Animals abolished preference if the reward was omitted, suggesting that LDT–VTA stimulation adds/decreases value to the stimulation-paired reward. In addition, we show that LDT–VTA optical activation induces robust preference in the conditioned and real-time place preference tests, while optical inhibition induces aversion. The behavioral findings are supported by electrophysiological recordings and c-fos immunofluorescence correlates in downstream target regions. In LDT–VTA ChR2 animals, we observed an increase in the recruitment of lateral VTA dopamine neurons and D1 neurons from nucleus accumbens core and shell; whereas in LDT–VTA NpHR animals, D2 neurons appear to be preferentially recruited. Collectively, these data show that the LDT–VTA inputs encode positive reinforcement signals and are important for different dimensions of reward-related behaviors.</p>

<p>This study investigated early and late processing of emotional stimuli in incarcerated violent offenders with psychopathic traits as compared to controls. Findings reveal no abnormal early responses in offenders but suggest specific late alterations in the neural processing of emotional stimuli.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Antisocial and psychopathic individuals are characterized by a reduced responsivity to affective information. Yet, the role of attentional processes as possible modulator of these deficits is poorly understood. The current study investigated early and late processing of emotional stimuli in a sample of incarcerated offenders while manipulating the attentional focus. Twenty-seven male violent offenders with psychopathic traits and 27 healthy controls completed two experimental tasks while electroencephalography (EEG) data were collected. Task 1 assessed indirect processing of emotional or neutral distractors during a perceptual judgment task, while Task 2 measured direct processing of the emotional or neutral stimuli and required participants to rate the stimuli regarding valence and arousal. EEG data indicated no differences in early stage processing (early posterior negativity) between the experimental groups. However, we found significant group differences with regard to the late processing stage (late positive potential, LPP). Controls showed increased LPP amplitudes in Task 2 as compared to Task 1, indicating that task demands (i.e., attentional focus) had an effect on the processing of the emotional stimuli. In contrast, LPP amplitudes in the violent offender group were largely unaffected by task demands, suggesting specific late alterations in the neural processing of emotional stimuli. In sum, this study provides new evidence for a modulatory impact of attention on affective information processing in male violent offenders with psychopathic traits.</p>

     alt="Neuronal deficiency of hypoxia-inducible factor 2α increases hypoxic-ischemic brain injury in neonatal mice"/>
<p>Using CaMKIIαCre and floxed-HIF-2α mice, we generated mice with specific deletion of HIF-2α gene in the forebrain neurons. We showed that neuronal deficiency of HIF-2α increased cell death and brain injury following neonatal hypoxia-ischemia suggesting its involvement in neuroprotection.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The cellular responses to hypoxia or hypoxia-ischemia (HI) are governed largely by the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) family of transcription factors. Our previous studies show that HIF-1α induction is an important factor that mediates protective effects in the brain after neonatal HI. In the present study, we investigated the contribution of another closely related HIF α isoform, HIF-2α, specifically the neuronal HIF-2α, to brain HI injury. Homozygous transgenic mice with a floxed exon 2 of HIF-2α were bred with CaMKIIα-Cre mice to generate a mouse line with selective deletion of HIF-2α in forebrain neurons. These mice, along with their wildtype littermates, were subjected to HI at postnatal day 9. Brain injury at different ages was evaluated by the levels of cleaved caspase-3 and spectrin breakdown products at 24 hr; and histologically at 6 days or 3 months after HI. Multiple behavioral tests were performed at 3 months, prior to sacrifice. Loss of neuronal HIF-2α exacerbated brain injury during the acute (24 hr) and subacute phases (6 days), with a trend toward more severe volume loss in the adult brain. The long-term brain function for coordinated movement and recognition memory, however, were not impacted in the neuronal HIF-2α deficient mice. Our data suggest that, similar to HIF-1α, neuronal HIF-2α promotes cell survival in the immature mouse brain. The two HIF alpha isoforms may act through partially overlapping or distinct transcriptional targets to mediate their intrinsic protective responses against neonatal HI brain injury.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Endocannabinoid system has been extensively studied in recent decades, particularly the cannabinoid receptors CB1 and CB2, due to their important role in neuroinflammation. Among these, CB2 has gained prominence due to its selective overexpression in glial cells during neuroinflammation. In contrast to CB1 agonists, CB2 agonists have no side effects such as ataxia, hypothermia, euphoria, psychological, or addiction liabilities. CB2 and its selective agonists' above-mentioned unique properties have become a research focus in neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). The review discusses the neuroprotective role of CB receptors, particularly CB2, in AD, as well as the significance and limitations of this research.</p>

     alt="Isoxazole-9 reduces enhanced fear responses and retrieval in ethanol-dependent male rats"/>
<p>This study used an established animal model of ethanol dependence and found that abstinence from ethanol experience alters fear memory consolidation and plasticity in the hippocampus. Treatment with small molecule isoxazole-9 prevented the altered fear responses during abstinence and normalized cellular and plasticity changes in the ventral dentate gyrus.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Plasticity in the dentate gyrus (DG) is strongly influenced by ethanol, and ethanol experience alters long-term memory consolidation dependent on the DG. However, it is unclear if DG plasticity plays a role in dysregulation of long-term memory consolidation during abstinence from chronic ethanol experience. Outbred male Wistar rats experienced 7 weeks of chronic intermittent ethanol vapor exposure (CIE). Seventy-two hours after CIE cessation, CIE and age-matched ethanol-naïve Air controls experienced auditory trace fear conditioning (TFC). Rats were tested for cue-mediated retrieval in the fear context either twenty-four hours (24 hr), ten days (10 days), or twenty-one days (21 days) later. CIE rats showed enhanced freezing behavior during TFC acquisition compared to Air rats. Air rats showed significant fear retrieval, and this behavior did not differ at the three time points. In CIE rats, fear retrieval increased over time during abstinence, indicating an incubation in fear responses. Enhanced retrieval at 21 days was associated with reduced structural and functional plasticity of ventral granule cell neurons (GCNs) and reduced expression of synaptic proteins important for neuronal plasticity. Systemic treatment with the drug Isoxazole-9 (Isx-9; small molecule that stimulates DG plasticity) during the last week and a half of CIE blocked altered acquisition and retrieval of fear memories in CIE rats during abstinence. Concurrently, Isx-9 modulated the structural and functional plasticity of ventral GCNs and the expression of synaptic proteins in the ventral DG. These findings identify that abstinence-induced disruption of fear memory consolidation occurs via altered plasticity within the ventral DG, and that Isx-9 prevented these effects.</p>

<p>MK-801 and amphetamine are largely used in mice and rats to model schizophrenia-related behavioral phenotypes. Here we compare the effects of these drugs in several zebrafish behavioral assays. We found that MK-801 disrupted social interaction and altered locomotion in a context-dependent manner, with hyperactivity when fish were tested in the presence of social cues and hypoactivity when tested alone. Exposure to amphetamine was devoid of effects on locomotion and social behavior, while it increased lipid peroxidation in the brain.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Schizophrenia pathophysiology has been associated with dopaminergic hyperactivity, NMDA receptor hypofunction, and redox dysregulation. Most behavioral assays and animal models to study this condition were developed in rodents, leaving room for species-specific biases that could be avoided by cross-species approaches. As MK-801 and amphetamine are largely used in mice and rats to mimic schizophrenia features, this study aimed to compare the effects of these drugs in several zebrafish (<i>Danio rerio</i>) behavioral assays. Male and female adult zebrafish were exposed to MK-801 (1, 5, and 10 μM) or amphetamine (0.625, 2.5, and 10 mg/L) and observed in paradigms of locomotor activity and social behavior. Oxidative parameters were quantified in brain tissue. Our results demonstrate that MK-801 disrupted social interaction, an effect that resembles the negative symptoms of schizophrenia. It also altered locomotion in a context-dependent manner, with hyperactivity when fish were tested in the presence of social cues and hypoactivity when tested alone. On the other hand, exposure to amphetamine was devoid of effects on locomotion and social behavior, while it increased lipid peroxidation in the brain. Key outcomes induced by MK-801 in rodents, such as social interaction deficit and locomotor alterations, were replicated in zebrafish, corroborating previous studies and reinforcing the use of zebrafish to study schizophrenia-related endophenotypes. More studies are necessary to assess the predictive validity of preclinical paradigms with this species and ultimately optimize the screening of potential novel treatments.</p>

     alt="Characterizing the hyper- and hypometabolism in temporal lobe epilepsy using multivariate machine learning"/>
<p>We applied multivariate linear support vector classification on voxel-wise glucose uptake measured through PET imaging, and effectively classified mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) patients from healthy controls (cross-validated accuracy &gt;95%). Both ipsilateral hypometabolism and contralateral hypermetabolism significantly contributed to the model, confirming the added values of metabolic abnormalities in assisting MTLE diagnosis through quantitative approaches.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) is the most common type of focal epilepsy, presenting both structural and metabolic abnormalities in the ipsilateral mesial temporal lobe. While it has been demonstrated that the metabolic abnormalities in MTLE actually extend beyond the epileptogenic zone, how such multidimensional information is associated with the diagnosis of MTLE remains to be tested. Here, we explore the whole-brain metabolic patterns in 23 patients with MTLE and 24 healthy controls using [<sup>18</sup>F]fluorodeoxyglucose PET imaging. Based on a multivariate machine learning approach, we demonstrate that the brain metabolic patterns can discriminate patients with MTLE from controls with a superior accuracy (&gt;95%). Importantly, voxels showing the most extreme contributing weights to the classification (i.e., the most important regional predictors) distribute across both hemispheres, involving both ipsilateral negative weights over the anterior part of lateral and medial temporal lobe, posterior insula, and lateral orbital frontal gyrus, and contralateral positive weights over the anterior frontal lobe, temporal lobe, and lingual gyrus. Through region-of-interest analyses, we verify that in patients with MTLE, the negatively weighted regions are hypometabolic, and the positively weighted regions are hypermetabolic, compared to controls. Interestingly, despite that both hypo- and hypermetabolism have mutually contributed to our model, they may reflect different pathological and/or compensative responses. For instance, patients with earlier age at epilepsy onset present greater hypometabolism in the ipsilateral inferior temporal gyrus, while we find no evidence of such association with hypermetabolism. In summary, quantitative models utilizing multidimensional brain metabolic information may provide additional assistance to presurgical workups in TLE.</p>

     alt="Comparing axon regeneration in male and female mice after peripheral nerve injury"/>
<p>In the mammalian peripheral nervous system, axon regeneration occurs spontaneously after injury. This study examined if axon regeneration after sciatic nerve crush injury was sex dependent and found that the extent of axon regeneration was indistinguishable in male and female mice. Transcriptome analysis revealed that many genes associated with neurite outgrowth were commonly induced in the two sexes, despite that a majority of genes were sex-dependently induced by injury. Therefore, although male and female mice exhibit similar axon regeneration, the mechanisms involved might not be identical.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Axons in the adult mammalian central nervous system fail to regenerate after injury. By contrast, spontaneous axon regeneration occurs in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) due to a supportive PNS environment and an increase in the intrinsic growth potential induced by injury via cooperative activation of multifaceted biological pathways. This study compared axon regeneration and injury responses in C57BL/6 male and female mice after sciatic nerve crush (SNC) injury. The extent of axon regeneration <i>in vivo</i> was indistinguishable in male and female mice when observed at 3 days after SNC injury, and primary dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons from injured, male and female mice extended axons to a similar length. Moreover, the induction of selected regeneration-associated genes (RAGs), such as <i>Atf3</i>, <i>Sprr1a</i>, <i>Gap43</i>, <i>Sox11</i>, <i>Jun</i>, <i>Gadd45a</i>, and <i>Smad1</i> were comparable in male and female DRGs when assessed by quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Furthermore, the RNA-seq analysis of male and female DRGs revealed that differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in SNC groups compared to sham-operated groups included many common genes associated with neurite outgrowth. However, we also found that a large number of genes in the DEGs were sex dependent, implicating the involvement of distinct gene regulatory network in the two sexes following peripheral nerve injury. In conclusion, we found that male and female mice mounted a comparable axon regeneration response and many RAGs were commonly induced in response to SNC. However, given that many DEGs were sex-dependently expressed, future studies are needed to investigate whether they contribute to peripheral axon regeneration, and if so, to what extent.</p>

<p>Mice were subjected to the acquisition, extinction, and reinstatement of methamphetamine-induced conditioned place preference, and fecal samples were collected at each phase. The V3 and V4 regions of the 16S rRNA gene were detected, and the composition, network structures, and gene functions of the gut microbiota were compared between groups or phases.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The gut–brain axis provides a pathway for the interaction between gut microbiota and methamphetamine (METH) addiction. However, the gut microbial signatures during different phases of METH use remain unclear. In the present study, we established models of acquisition, extinction, and reinstatement of METH-induced conditioned place preference (CPP) in male mice and detected the gut microbiome profiles of the fecal samples at the three phases by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Our results revealed that the richness of the gut microbiome increased following repeated METH administration, and it decreased after 4 weeks of abstinence. The microbial richness remained at a low level after one METH challenge at the reinstatement phase. The abundance of several genera including <i>Prevotella</i>, <i>Bacteroides</i>, and <i>Lactobacillus</i> differentially altered among phases of METH-induced CPP. The co-occurrence networks of the gut microbiome became weaker and more unstable during the development of METH-induced CPP at the extinction and reinstatement phases. Notably, the predicted gene functions of short-chain fatty acid metabolism, which were correlated with the abundance of <i>Prevotella</i>, <i>Bacteroides</i>, and <i>Lactobacillus</i>, were found differentially enriched among phases of METH-induced CPP. Our findings highlight a potential association between perturbations of the gut microbiome and different phases of METH use.</p>

<p>The differential effects of osteopontin on major functions of primary resting and activated astrocytes.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The glycoprotein osteopontin is highly upregulated in central nervous system (CNS) disorders such as ischemic stroke. Osteopontin regulates cell growth, cell adhesion, homeostasis, migration, and survival of various cell types. Accordingly, osteopontin is considered an essential regulator of regeneration and repair in the ischemic milieu. Astrocytes are the most abundant cells in the CNS and play significant roles in health and disease. Astrocytes are involved in homeostasis, promote neuroprotection, and regulate synaptic plasticity. Upon activation, astrocytes may adopt different phenotypes, termed A1 and A2. The direct effects of osteopontin on astrocytes, especially in distinct activation states, are yet unknown. The current study aimed to elucidate the impact of osteopontin on resting and active astrocytes. We established an inflammatory <i>in vitro</i> model of activated (A1) primary astrocytes derived from neonatal wistar rats by exposure to a distinct combination of proinflammatory cytokines. To model ischemic stroke <i>in vitro</i>, astrocytes were subjected to oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) in the presence or absence of osteopontin. Osteopontin modulated the activation phenotype by attenuating A1- and restoring A2-marker expression without compromising the active astrocytes’ immunocompetence. Osteopontin promoted the proliferation of active and the migration of resting astrocytes. Following transient OGD, osteopontin mitigated the delayed ongoing death of primary astrocytes, promoting their survival. Data suggest that osteopontin differentially regulates essential functions of resting and active astrocytes and confirm a significant regulatory role of osteopontin in an <i>in vitro</i> ischemia model. Furthermore, the data suggest that osteopontin constitutes a promising target for experimental therapies modulating neuroregeneration and repair.</p>

<p>Stochastic and sinusoidal stimuli shown to increase neuronal discharge irregularity and gain in Type A and B medial vestibular nucleus (MVN) neurons. Potentially via antagonism of voltage-sensitive channels expressed on MVN neuronal membranes such as the large conductance K<sup>+</sup> channels (<i>black</i>) and associated N-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, and the T-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels associated with slow conductance K<sup>+</sup> channels (<i>gray</i>).</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Galvanic vestibular stimulation (GVS) has been shown to improve vestibular function potentially via stochastic resonance, however, it remains unknown how central vestibular nuclei process these signals. <i>In vivo</i> work applying electrical stimuli to the vestibular apparatus of animals has shown changes in neuronal discharge at the level of the primary vestibular afferents and hair cells. This study aimed to determine the cellular impacts of stochastic, sinusoidal, and stochastic + sinusoidal stimuli on individual medial vestibular nucleus (MVN) neurons of male and female C57BL/6 mice. All stimuli increased the irregularity of MVN neuronal discharge, while differentially affecting neuronal gain. This suggests that the heterogeneous MVN neuronal population (marked by differential expression of ion channels), may influence the impact of electrical stimuli on neuronal discharge. Neuronal subtypes showed increased variability of neuronal firing, where Type A and B neurons experienced the largest gain changes in response to stochastic and sinusoidal stimuli. Type C neurons were the least affected regarding neuronal firing variability and gain changes. The membrane potential (MP) of neurons was altered by sinusoidal and stochastic + sinusoidal stimuli, with Type B and C neuronal MP significantly affected. These results indicate that GVS-like electrical stimuli impact MVN neuronal discharge differentially, likely as a result of heterogeneous ion channel expression.</p>

<p>Overexpression of WT α-syn and the mutant α-syn A30P promotes the increase of Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels in mitochondria and the reduction in contact sites between the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria, disrupting the IP3R-GRP75 interaction. Disruption of mitochondria-associated ER membranes causes a reduction in calcium transfer from endoplasmic reticulum to mitochondria.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Mitochondria-associated ER membranes (MAMs) are formed by close and specific components in the contact sites between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria, which participate in several cell functions, including lipid metabolism, autophagy, and Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling. Particularly, the presence of α-synuclein (α-syn) in MAMs was previously demonstrated, indicating a physical interaction among some proteins in this region and a potential involvement in cell dysfunctions. MAMs alterations are associated with neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease (PD) and contribute to the pathogenesis features. Here, we investigated the effects of α-syn on MAMs and Ca<sup>2+</sup> transfer from the ER to mitochondria in WT- and A30P α-syn-overexpressing SH-SY5Y or HEK293 cells. We observed that α-syn potentiates the mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψ<sub>m</sub>) loss induced by rotenone, increases mitophagy and mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> overload. Additionally, in α-syn-overexpressing cells, we found a reduction in ER–mitochondria contact sites through the impairment of the GRP75–IP3R interaction, however, with no alteration in VDAC1–GRP75 interaction. Consequently, after Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from the ER, α-syn-overexpressing cells demonstrated a reduction in Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffering by mitochondria, suggesting a deregulation in MAM activity. Taken together, our data highlight the importance of the α-syn/MAMs/Ca<sup>2+</sup> axis that potentially affects cell functions in PD.</p>

<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Cognitive impairments are characteristics of patients with white matter hyperintensities (WMHs), and hypoperfusion is currently a relatively recognized mechanism of WMHs. Brain activity is closely coupled to the regulation of local blood flow. This study aimed to investigate the abnormal local brain activity of patients with WMHs from the viewpoint of the static amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (sALFF) and dynamic amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (dALFF). Seventy-four patients with WMHs and 35 healthy controls (HCs) were included. Based on the Fazekas scale, patients with WMHs were further divided into a mild WMH group (<i>n</i> = 33, Fazekas score 1–2) and moderate-severe WMH group (<i>n</i> = 41, Fazekas score 3–6). The sALFF and dALFF values were calculated separately and neuropsychological tests including the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Auditory Verbal Learning Test (AVLT), Trail Making Test (TMT), and Boston Naming Test (BNT) were completed by all participants. Patients with WMHs showed increased sALFF and dALFF values in the bilateral thalamus and decreased performance in the MoCA test, AVLT-immediate, AVLT-delay, AVLT-recognition, TMT-A, and BNT. The dALFF values in the bilateral thalamus was correlated with the MoCA in HCs. The sALFF values in the bilateral thalamus correlated with TMT-B in patients with WMHs. Patients with WMHs showed abnormal brain activity and decreased functional stability of the bilateral thalamus, which may be a potential mechanism of decreased executive function.</p>

<p>Spatial memory impairments in people with Huntington's disease (HD) were related to volumes of the caudate nucleus, putamen, and hippocampus. We suggest that spatial memory impairments should be included in the cognitive phenotype of HD.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Spatial memory impairments are observed in people with Huntington's disease (HD), however, the domain of spatial memory has received little focus when characterizing the cognitive phenotype of HD. Spatial memory is traditionally thought to be a hippocampal-dependent function, while the neuropathology of HD centers on the striatum. Alongside spatial memory deficits in HD, recent neurocognitive theories suggest that a larger brain network is involved, including the striatum. We examined the relationship between hippocampal and striatal volumes and spatial memory in 36 HD gene expansion carriers, including premanifest (<i>n</i> = 24) and early manifest HD (<i>n</i> = 12), and 32 matched healthy controls. We assessed spatial memory with Paired Associates Learning, Rey–Osterrieth Complex Figure Test, and the Virtual House task, which assesses three components of spatial memory: navigation, object location, and plan drawing. Caudate nucleus, putamen, and hippocampal volumes were manually segmented on T1-weighted MR images. As expected, caudate nucleus and putamen volumes were significantly smaller in the HD group compared to controls, with manifest HD having more severe atrophy than the premanifest HD group. Hippocampal volumes did not differ significantly between HD and control groups. Nonetheless, on average, the HD group performed significantly worse than controls across all spatial memory tasks. The spatial memory components of object location and recall of figural and topographical drawings were associated with striatal and hippocampal volumes in the HD cohort. We provide a case to include spatial memory impairments in the cognitive phenotype of HD, and extend the neurocognitive picture of HD beyond its primary pathology within the striatum.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Myelination is crucial for the development and maintenance of axonal integrity, especially fast axonal action potential conduction. There is increasing evidence that glutamate signaling and release through neuronal activity modulates the myelination process. In this study, we examine the effect of manipulating glutamate signaling on myelination of oligodendrocyte (OL) lineage cells and their development in zebrafish (zf). We use the “intensity-based glutamate-sensing fluorescent reporter” (iGluSnFR) in the zf model (both sexes) to address the hypothesis that glutamate is implicated in regulation of myelinating OLs. Our results show that glial iGluSnFR expression significantly reduces OL lineage cell number and the expression of myelin markers in larvae (zfl) and adult brains. The specific glutamate receptor agonist, L-AP4, rescues this iGluSnFR effect by significantly increasing the expression of the myelin-related genes, <i>plp1b</i> and <i>mbpa</i>, and enhances myelination in L-AP4-injected zfl compared to controls. Furthermore, we demonstrate that degrading glutamate using Glutamat-Pyruvate Transaminase (GPT) or the blockade of glutamate reuptake by L-trans-pyrrolidine-2,4-dicarboxylate (PDC) significantly decreases myelin-related genes and drastically declines myelination in brain ventricle-injected zfl. Moreover, we found that myelin-specific ClaudinK (CldnK) and 36K protein expression is significantly decreased in iGluSnFR-expressing zfl and adult brains compared to controls. Taken together, this study confirms that glutamate signaling is directly required for the preservation of myelinating OLs and for the myelination process itself. These findings further suggest that glutamate signaling may provide novel targets to therapeutically boost remyelination in several demyelinating diseases of the CNS.</p>

<p>Brain stem is one of the earliest affected regions in synucleinopathies. The present study demonstrated that pontine mean diffusivity values would be a useful neurodegeneration marker in synucleinopathies.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The pons is one of the earliest affected regions in patients with synucleinopathies. We aimed to investigate the diagnostic value of measuring pontine damage using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in these patients. We enrolled 49 patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), 16 patients with idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (iRBD), 23 patients with multiple system atrophy (MSA), and 39 healthy controls in this study. All the participants underwent high-resolution T1-weighted imaging and DTI. Mean diffusivity (MD) and fraction anisotropy (FA) values in the pons were calculated to characterize structural damage. The discriminatory power of pontine MD and FA values to differentiate patients with synucleinopathies from healthy controls was examined using receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analyses. Compared to healthy controls, patients with PD, iRBD, and MSA had increased MD values and decreased FA values in the pons, although no correlation was observed between these DTI measures and disease severity. The ROC analyses showed that MD values in the pons had a fair discriminatory power to differentiate healthy controls from patients with PD (area under the curve [AUC], 0.813), iRBD (AUC, 0.779), and MSA (AUC, 0.951). The AUC for pontine FA values was smaller than that for pontine MD values when differentiating healthy controls from patients with PD (AUC, 0.713; <i>p</i> = 0.054) and iRBD (AUC, 0.686; <i>p</i> = 0.045). Our results suggest that MD values in the pons may be a useful marker of brain stem neurodegeneration in patients with synucleinopathies.</p>

<p>Loss of <i>Cx3cr1</i> function compromises cochlear defense mechanisms against noise-induced neutrophil infiltration and potentiates functional loss of the cochlea. This study provides new insights into the molecular control of cochlear neutrophil activities after noise damage.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The cochlea, the sensory organ for hearing, has a protected immune environment, segregated from the systemic immune system by the blood-labyrinth barrier. Previous studies have revealed that acute acoustic injury causes the infiltration of circulating leukocytes into the cochlea. However, the molecular mechanisms controlling immune cell trafficking are poorly understood. Here, we report the role of CX3CR1 in regulating the entry of neutrophils into the cochlea after acoustic trauma. We employed B6.129P-<i>Cx3cr1<sup>tm1Litt</sup>
</i>/J mice, a transgenic strain that lacks the gene, <i>Cx3cr1</i>, for coding the fractalkine receptor. Our results demonstrate that lack of <i>Cx3cr1</i> results in the augmentation of neutrophil infiltration into cochlear tissues after exposure to an intense noise of 120 dB SPL for 1 hr. Neutrophil distribution in the cochlea is site specific, and the infiltration level is positively associated with noise intensity. Moreover, neutrophils are short lived and macrophage phagocytosis plays a role in neutrophil clearance, consistent with typical neutrophil dynamics in inflamed non-cochlear tissues. Importantly, our study reveals the potentiation of noise-induced hearing loss and sensory cell loss in <i>Cx3cr1<sup>−/−</sup>
</i> mice. In wild-type control mice (<i>Cx3cr1<sup>+/+</sup>
</i>) exposed to the same noise, we also found neutrophils. However, neutrophils were present primarily inside the microvessels of the cochlea, with only a few in the cochlear tissues. Collectively, our data implicate CX3CR1-mediated signaling in controlling neutrophil migration from the circulation into cochlear tissues and provide a better understanding of the impacts of neutrophils on cochlear responses to acoustic injury.</p>

     alt="Characterization of specific spatial functional connectivity difference in depression during sleep"/>
<p>Based on sleep functional connectivity (FC) analysis, the higher inter-hemispheric FC and lower intra-hemispherical FC were found in patients with depression, and cross-within variation was constructed to characterize the unbalanced functional network, the potential of which as a biomarker was further verified. Additionally, the inter-hemispheric temporal lobe connections in theta band also displayed high discriminative power.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Depression is a common mental illness and a large number of researchers have been still devoted to exploring effective biomarkers for the identification of depression. Few researches have been conducted on functional connectivity (FC) during sleep in depression. In this paper, a novel depression characterization is proposed using specific spatial FC features of sleep electroencephalography (EEG). Overnight polysomnography recordings were obtained from 26 healthy individuals and 25 patients with depression. The weighted phase lag indexes (WPLIs) of four frequency bands and five sleep periods were obtained from 16 EEG channels. The high discriminative connections extracted via feature evaluation and the cross-within variation (CW)—the spatial feature constructed to characterize the different performances in inter- and intra-hemispheric FC based on WPLIs, were utilized to classify patients and normal controls. The results showed that enhanced average FC and spatial differences, higher inter-hemispheric FC and lower intra-hemispheric FC, were found in patients. Furthermore, abnormalities in the inter-hemispheric connections of the temporal lobe in the theta band should be important indicators of depression. Finally, both CW and high discriminative WPLI features performed well in depression screening and CW was more specific for characterizing abnormal cortical EEG performance of depression. Our work investigated and characterized the abnormalities in sleep cortical activity in patients with depression, and may provide potential biomarkers for assisting with depression identification and new insights into the understanding of pathological mechanisms in depression.</p>

                Microglia are resident immune cells of the central nervous system (CNS) with multiple functions in health and disease. Their response during encephalitis depends on whether inflammation is triggered in a sterile or infectious manner, and in the latter case on the type of the infecting pathogen. Even though recent technological innovations advanced the understanding of the broad spectrum of microglia responses during viral encephalitis (VE), it is not entirely clear which microglia gene expression profiles are associated with antiviral and detrimental activities.

                Individual sensory neurons can be tuned to many stimuli, each driving unique, stimulus-relevant behaviors, and the ability of multimodal nociceptor neurons to discriminate between potentially harmful and innocuous stimuli is broadly important for organismal survival. Moreover, disruptions in the capacity to differentiate between noxious and innocuous stimuli can result in neuropathic pain. Drosophila larval Class III (CIII) neurons are peripheral noxious cold nociceptors and gentle touch mechanosensors; high levels of activation drive cold-evoked contraction (CT) behavior, while low levels of activation result in a suite of touch-associated behaviors. However, it is unknown what molecular factors underlie CIII multimodality. Here, we show that the TMEM16/anoctamins subdued and white walker (wwk; CG15270) are required for cold-evoked CT, but not for touch-associated behavior, indicating a conserved role for anoctamins in nociception. We also evidence that CIII neurons make use of atypical depolarizing chloride currents to encode cold, and that overexpression of ncc69 - a fly homologue of NKCC1 - results in phenotypes consistent with neuropathic sensitization, including behavioral hypersensitization and spontaneous nociceptor activity, making Drosophila CIII neurons a candidate system for future studies of the basic mechanisms underlying neuropathic pain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Leptin-mediated suppression of food intake by conserved Glp1r-expressing neurons prevents obesity</a></h4>

              
                The adipose-derived hormone leptin acts via its receptor (LepRb) in the brain to control energy balance. A previously unidentified population of GABAergic hypothalamic LepRb neurons plays key roles in the restraint of food intake and body weight by leptin. To identify markers for candidate populations of LepRb neurons in an unbiased manner, we performed single-nucleus RNA-sequencing of enriched mouse hypothalamic LepRb cells, as well as with total hypothalamic cells from multiple mammalian species. In addition to identifying known LepRb neuron types, this analysis identified several previously unrecognized populations of hypothalamic LepRb neurons. Many of these populations display strong conservation across species, including GABAergic Glp1r-expressing LepRb (LepRbGlp1r) neurons that express more Lepr and respond more robustly to exogenous leptin than other LepRb populations. Ablating LepRb from these cells provoked hyperphagic obesity without impairing energy expenditure. Conversely, reactivating LepRb in Glp1r-expressing cells decreased food intake and body weight in otherwise LepRb-null mice. Furthermore, LepRb reactivation in GABA neurons improved energy balance in LepRb-null mice, and this effect required the expression of LepRb in GABAergic Glp1r-expressing neurons. Thus, the conserved GABAergic LepRbGlp1r neuron population plays crucial roles in the control of food intake and body weight by leptin.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cerebrospinal fluid formation is controlled by membrane transporters to modulate intracranial pressure</a></h4>

              
                Disturbances in the brain fluid balance can lead to life-threatening elevation in the intracranial pressure (ICP), which represents a vast clinical challenge. Nevertheless, the molecular mechanisms governing cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) secretion are largely unresolved, thus preventing targeted and efficient pharmaceutical therapy of cerebral pathologies involving elevated ICP. Here, we employed experimental rats to demonstrate low osmotic water permeability of the choroid plexus, lack of an osmotic gradient across this tissue, and robust CSF secretion against osmotic gradients. Together, these results illustrate that CSF secretion occurs independently of conventional osmosis, which challenges the existing assumption that CSF production is driven entirely by bulk osmotic forces across the CSF-secreting choroid plexus. Instead, we reveal that the choroidal Na+/K+/Cl- cotransporter NKCC1, Na+/HCO3- cotransporter NBCe2, and Na+/K+-ATPase are actively involved in CSF production and propose a molecular mode of water transport supporting CSF production in this secretory tissue. Further, we demonstrate that inhibition of NKCC1 directly reduces the ICP, illustrating that altered CSF secretion may be employed as a strategy to modulate ICP. These insights identify new promising therapeutic targets against brain pathologies associated with elevated ICP.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Transcriptomic heterogeneity of Sox2-expressing pituitary cells</a></h4>

              
                The mammalian pituitary gland is a complex organ consisting of hormone-producing cells (HPC), nonhormonal folliculostellate cells (FSC) and pituicytes, vascular pericytes and endothelial cells, and putative Sox2-expressing stem cells. Here, we used scRNAseq analysis of adult female rat pituitary cells to study the heterogeneity of pituitary cells with a focus on evaluating the transcriptomic profile of the Sox2-expressing population. Samples containing whole pituitary and separated anterior and posterior lobe cells allowed the identification of all expected pituitary resident cell types and lobe-specific subpopulations of vascular cells. Sox2 was expressed uniformly in all FSC, pituicytes, and a fraction of HPC. FSC comprised two subclusters; FSC1 contained more cells but expressed less genetic diversity compared to FSC2. The latter contained proliferative cells, expressed genes consistent with stem cell niche formation, including tight junctions, and shared genes with HPC. The FSC2 transcriptome profile was also consistent with the activity of pathways regulating cell proliferation and stem cell pluripotency, including the Hippo and Wnt pathways. The expression of other stem cell marker genes was common for FSC and pituicytes (Sox9, Cd9, Hes1, Vim, S100b) or cell type-specific (FSC: Prop1, Prrx1, Pitx1, Pitx2, Lhx3; pituicytes: Fgf10, Tbx3, Lhx2, Nkx2-1, Rax). FSC and pituicytes also expressed other astroglial marker genes, some common and other distinct, consistent with their identities as astroglial cells of the pituitary. These data suggest functional heterogeneity of FSC, with a larger fraction representing classical FSC, and a smaller fraction containing active stem-like cells and HPC-committed progenitors.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Develop an efficient and specific AAV-based labeling system for Muller glia in mice</a></h4>

              
                Cell degeneration in the retina leads to several ocular diseases and vision loss. Considerable research efforts focus on reprogramming Muller glia (MG) into functional cells to rescue vision as a promising therapeutic strategy, although whether MG can convert into functional amacrine cells, bipolar cells, retinal ganglia cells (RGCs), rods or cones in mammals remains controversial. The broad applicability of tracking MG differentiation thus presents a need for improved labeling efficiency and specificity. Here, we compared AAV-based labeling strategies with conventional lineage-tracking by crossing transgenic mouse lines. We found that reporter expression was weak and not MG-specific in mGFAP-Cre transgenic mice. Different AAV serotypes showed a range of efficiency and specificity in labeling MG, leading us to optimize a human GFAP-Cre reporter system packaged in the AAV9 serotype with the WPRE (WPRE, woodchuck hepatitis virus post-transcriptional regulatory element) removed. The hGFAP-Cre- {Delta}WPRE reporter could label 20-73.8% MGs, with non-specific RGC labeling rates ranging from 0-0.08% at doses of 1 X 108 to 1010 vector genomes (vg) per eye, an approximate 40-fold reduction compared with the AAV9-hGFAP-Cre-WPRE labeling system. The AAV9-hGFAP- Cre-{Delta}WPRE system thus represents a highly efficient and specific labeling system for Muller glia, providing a valuable tool for tracking cell fate in vivo.

                In the striatum, acetylcholine (ACh) neuron activity is modulated co-incident with dopamine (DA) release in response to unpredicted rewards and reward predicting cues and both neuromodulators are thought to regulate each other. While this co-regulation has been studied using stimulation studies, the existence of this mutual regulation in vivo during natural behavior is still largely unexplored. One long-standing controversy has been whether striatal DA is responsible for the induction of the cholinergic pause or whether D2R modulate a pause that is induced by other mechanisms. Here, we used genetically encoded sensors in combination with pharmacological and genetic inactivation of D2Rs from cholinergic interneurons (CINs) to simultaneously measure ACh and DA levels after CIN D2R inactivation. We found that CIN D2Rs are not necessary for the induction of cue induced dips in ACh levels but regulate dip lengths and rebound ACh levels. Importantly, D2R inactivation strongly decreased the temporal correlation between DA and Ach signals not only at cue presentation but also during the intertrial interval. This points to a general mechanism by which D2Rs coordinate both signals. At the behavioral level D2R antagonism increased the latency to lever press, which was not observed in CIN-selective D2R knock out mice. This latency correlated with the cue evoked dip length supporting a role of the ACh dip and its regulation by D2Rs in motivated behavior. Overall, our data indicate that striatal DA coordinate phasic ACh and DA signals via CIN D2Rs which is important for the regulation of motivated behavior.

                The brain continuously coordinates skeletomuscular movements with internal physiological states like arousal, but how is this coordination achieved? One possibility is that brain simply reacts to changes in external and/or internal signals. Another possibility is that it is actively coordinating both external and internal activities. We used functional ultrasound imaging to capture a large medial section of the brain, including multiple cortical and subcortical areas, in marmoset monkeys while monitoring their spontaneous movements and cardiac activity. By analyzing the causal ordering of these different time-series, we found that information flowing from the brain to movements and heart rate fluctuations were significantly greater than in the opposite direction. The brain areas involved in this external versus internal coordination were spatially distinct but also extensively interconnected. Temporally, the brain alternated between network states for this regulation. These findings suggest that the brain's dynamics actively and efficiently coordinate motor behavior with internal physiology.

                A number of studies implicate the loss of function (LoF) mutations affecting the histone methyl transferase SETD1A in the aetiology of a range of neurodevelopmental disorders including schizophrenia. Here, we examined the behavioural consequences of haploinsufficiency of Setd1a in a mouse model. We find evidence for changes in a number of phenotypes of relevance to schizophrenia, including increased anxiety-related behaviour, enhanced acoustic startle response, and decreased pre-pulse inhibition of acoustic startle. The sensorimotor gating deficits in Setd1a+/- mice could not be rescued by haloperidol or risperidone, suggesting that these antipsychotics are ineffective for ameliorating schizophrenia-relevant phenotypes in Setd1a+/- mice and point to deficits in neural systems other than the monoamine system. These phenotypes are emerging as key features of a number of other mouse models of rare neurodevelopmental disorders caused by LoF mutations in genes encoding epigenome modifiers suggesting they may act in a network to modulate brain development. Taken together these data strengthen the support for the use of Setd1a haploinsufficient mice as a model for the biological basis of schizophrenia, and point towards possible underpinning neural mechanisms.

                We interrogated prefrontal circuit function in mice lacking Disrupted-in-schizophrenia-1 (Disc1-mutant mice), a risk factor for psychiatric disorders. Single-unit recordings in awake mice revealed reduced average firing rates of fast-spiking interneurons (INTs), including optogenetically identified parvalbumin-positive cells, and a lower proportion of INTs phase-coupled to ongoing gamma oscillations. Moreover, we observed decreased spike transmission efficacy at local pyramidal cell (PYR)-INT connections in vivo, suggesting a reduced excitatory effect of local glutamatergic inputs as a potential mechanism of lower INT rates. On the network level, impaired INT function resulted in altered activation of PYR assemblies: While assembly activations were observed equally often, the expression strength of individual assembly patterns was significantly higher in Disc1-mutant mice. Our data thus reveal a role of Disc1 in shaping the properties of prefrontal assembly patterns by setting prefrontal INT responsiveness to glutamatergic drive.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Robust regulatory architecture of pan-neuronal gene expression</a></h4>

              
                Pan-neuronally expressed genes, such as genes involved in the synaptic vesicle release cycle or in neuropeptide maturation, are critical for proper function of all neurons, but the transcriptional control mechanisms that direct such genes to all neurons of a nervous system remain poorly understood. We show here that six members of the CUT family of homeobox genes control pan-neuronal identity specification in C. elegans. Single CUT mutants show barely any effects on pan-neuronal gene expression or global nervous system function, but such effects become apparent and progressively worsen upon removal of additional CUT family members, indicating a critical role of gene dosage. Overexpression of each individual CUT gene rescued the phenotype of compound mutants, corroborating that gene dosage, rather than the activity of specific members of the gene family, is critical for CUT gene function. Genome-wide binding profiles as well as mutation of CUT binding sites by CRISPR/Cas9 genome engineering show that CUT genes directly control the expression of pan-neuronal features. Moreover, CUT genes act in conjunction with neuron-type specific transcription factors to control pan-neuronal gene expression. Our study, therefore, provides a previously missing key insight into how neuronal gene expression programs are specified and reveals a highly buffered and robust mechanism that controls the most critical functional features of all neuronal cell types.

	<p>The human brain is constantly active, even at rest. Alpha coherence is an electroencephalography (EEG) rhythm that regulates functional connectivity between different brain regions. However, the relationships between resting-state alpha coherence and N2/P3 components associated with response inhibition and cognitive processes have not been investigated in addictive disorders. The present study investigated the relationships between alpha coherence during the resting state and N2/P3 components of event-related potentials during the Go/Nogo task in healthy controls (HCs) and patients with Internet gaming disorder (IGD). A total of 64 young adults (HC: n = 31; IGD: n = 33) participated in this study. Alpha coherence values at left fronto-central and bilateral centro-temporal electrode sites were significantly correlated with P3 latency in HCs, whereas inverse correlations were observed in patients with IGD. Furthermore, significant differences were observed in the correlation values between the groups. Our results suggest that patients with IGD lack dynamic interactions of functional connectivity between the fronto-centro-temporal regions during the resting state and the event-related potential (ERP) index during cognitive tasks. The findings of this study may have important implications for understanding the neurophysiological mechanisms linking resting-state EEG and task-related ERPs underlying IGD.</p>

	<p>Aggressive behaviors and disruptive/conduct disorders are some of the commonest reasons for referral to youth mental health services; nevertheless, the efficacy of therapeutic interventions in real-world clinical practice remains unclear. In order to define more appropriate targets for innovative pharmacological therapies for disruptive/conduct disorders, the European Commission within the Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) funded the MATRICS project (Multidisciplinary Approaches to Translational Research in Conduct Syndromes) to identify neural, genetic, and molecular factors underpinning the pathogenesis of aggression/antisocial behavior in preclinical models and clinical samples. Within the program, a multicentre case-control study, followed by a single-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over, randomized acute single-dose medication challenge, was conducted at two Italian sites. Aggressive children and adolescents with conduct disorder (CD) or oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) were compared to the same age (10&amp;amp;ndash;17 y) typically developing controls (TDC) on a neuropsychological tasks battery that included both &amp;amp;ldquo;cold&amp;amp;rdquo; (e.g., inhibitory control, decision making) and &amp;amp;ldquo;hot&amp;amp;rdquo; executive functions (e.g., moral judgment, emotion processing, risk assessment). Selected autonomic measures (heart rate variability, skin conductance, salivary cortisol) were recorded before/during/after neuropsychological testing sessions. The acute response to different drugs (methylphenidate/atomoxetine, risperidone/aripiprazole, or placebo) was also examined in the ODD/CD cohort in order to identify potential neuropsychological/physiological mechanisms underlying aggression.

	<p>The aim of the study was to find the association between SIRT1 concentration, SIRT1 rs3758391, rs3818292, rs7895833 polymorphisms and clinical manifestations of pituitary adenoma (PA). The study included 108 patients with PA and 216 healthy individuals. Using commercial kits, DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes. To determine the PA and control group subjects&#039; genotypes was used real-time PCR method, for SIRT concentration measurement we used ELISA method. The statistical data analysis was completed using the &amp;quot;IBM SPSS Statistics 20.0&amp;quot; software. Results: We performed statistical analysis of SNPs in the patient and healthy controls and patients&#039; subgroups and found statistically significant differences in rs7895833 genotype (A/A, A/G, G/G) distributions between the active PA and control groups (67.9%, 24.6%, 5.7% vs. 72.2%, 27.3%, 0.5%; p = 0.02) Also, the results showed that the rs7895833 G/G genotype is associated with about 13-fold increased odds of active PA development compared to the A/A (OR = 13.95% CI: 1.314&amp;amp;ndash;128.632; p = 0.028) and both A/A and A/G genotypes (OR = 12.9; 95% CI: 1.314&amp;amp;ndash;126.624; p = 0.028). There is ample evidence that SIRT1 in the pituitary and other target organs modifies the synthesis, secretion, and activity of hormones to trigger adaptive responses, thus we decided to include this in our study. When determining the serum concentration of SIRT1, we did not find a statistically significant difference between the PA group and the control group. SIRT1 serum level was statistically significantly higher in women with PA than in healthy control women (1.115 (3.748) vs. 136 (0.211); p = 0.008). To conclude - SIRT1 rs7895833 G/G genotype is associated with about 13-fold increased odds of active PA development compared to the A/A and both A/A and A/G genotypes. SIRT1 serum levels are higher in women with PA than in healthy women.</p>

	<p>There is increasing interest in identifying biological and imaging markers for the early detection of neurocognitive decline. In addition, non-pharmacological strategies, including physical exercise and cognitive interventions, may be beneficial for those developing cognitive impairment. The Feuerstein Instrumental Enrichment (FIE) Program is a cognitive intervention based on structural cognitive modifiability and the mediated learning experience (MLE) and aims to promote problem-solving strategies and metacognitive abilities. The FIE program uses a variety of instruments to enhance the cognitive capacity of the individual as a result of mediation. A specific version of the FIE program was developed for the cognitive enhancement of older adults, focusing on strengthening orientation skills, categorization skills, deductive reasoning, and memory. We performed a prospective interventional pilot observational study on older subjects with MCI who participated in 30 mediated FIE sessions (two sessions weekly for 15 weeks). Of the 23 subjects who completed the study, there was a significant improvement in memory on the NeuroTrax cognitive assessment battery. Complete sets of anatomical MRI data for voxel-based morphometry, taken at the beginning and the end of the study, were obtained from 16 participants (mean age 83.5 years). Voxel-based morphometry showed an interesting and unexpected increase in grey matter (GM) in the anterolateral occipital border and the middle cingulate cortex. These initial findings of our pilot study support the design of randomized trials to evaluate the effect of cognitive training using the FIE program on brain volumes and cognitive function.</p>

	<p>Craniotomy involves procedures with high incidences of postoperative pain. Dexmedetomidine, a highly selective a2-adrenoreceptor agonist, has been shown to be beneficial in neuroanaesthesia. The purpose of this narrative review was to assess the effect and safety of dexmedetomidine given intraoperatively during anaesthesia compared to placebo and demonstrate the effect on acute postoperative pain in adult patients undergoing craniotomy. Literature published from 1996 until 2021 were analysed through a search of PubMed, Medline and Embase. Randomised controlled trials investigating intraoperative administration of Dexmedetomidine with evaluation of postoperative pain were included. Medical Subject Headings terms and free-text words were used to identify articles related to the intraoperative use of Dexmedetomidine and postcraniotomy pain. Thirteen distinct randomized controlled trials with 882 recruited patients undergoing craniotomy were identified as eligible for final inclusion. Intraoperative administration of dexmedetomidine is associated with decreased postoperative pain and opioid consumption, and it assures haemodynamic stability. Dexmedetomidine is an efficacious adjunct in craniotomy in adults, showing benefits in reduction of postoperative pain and analgesic consumption. Dexmedetomidine also offers haemodynamic stability. However, widespread methodological heterogeneity of the papers prohibits a valid meta-analysis.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Previous research has indicated that reward-paired cues can enhance disadvantageous risky choice in both humans and rodents. Systemic administration of a serotonin 2C receptor antagonist can attenuate this cue-induced risk preference in rats. However, the neurocognitive mechanisms mediating this effect are currently unknown. We therefore assessed whether the serotonin 2C receptor antagonist RS 102221 is able to attenuate cue-enhanced risk preference via its actions in the lateral orbitofrontal cortex (lOFC) or prelimbic (PrL) area of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). A total of 32 male Long&ndash;Evans rats were trained on the cued version of the rat gambling task (rGT), a rodent analog of the human Iowa gambling task, and bilateral guide cannulae were implanted into the lOFC or PrL. Intra-lOFC infusions of the 5-HT<SUB>2C</SUB> antagonist RS 102221 reduced risky choice in animals that showed a preference for the risky options of the rGT at baseline. This effect was not observed in optimal decision-makers, nor those that received infusions targeting the PrL. Given prior data showing that 5-HT<SUB>2C</SUB> antagonists also improve reversal learning through the same neural locus, we hypothesized that reward-concurrent cues may amplify risky decision-making through cognitive inflexibility. We therefore devalued the sugar pellet rewards used in the cued rGT (crGT) through satiation and observed that decision-making patterns did not shift unless animals also received intra-lOFC RS 102221. Collectively, these data suggest that the lOFC is one critical site through which reward-concurrent cues promote risky choice patterns that are insensitive to reinforcer devaluation, and that 5-HT<SUB>2C</SUB> antagonism may optimize choice by facilitating exploration.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Excitatory amino acid transporters (EAATs) remove glutamate from the synaptic cleft. In the retina, EAAT1 and EAAT2 are considered the major glutamate transporters. However, it has not yet been possible to determine how EAAT5 shapes the retinal light responses because of the lack of a selective EAAT5 blocker or EAAT5 knock-out (KO) animal model. In this study, EAAT5 was found to be expressed in a punctate manner close to release sites of glutamatergic synapses in the mouse retina. Light responses from retinae of wild-type (WT) and of a newly generated model with a targeted deletion of EAAT5 (EAAT5<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup>) were recorded <I>in vitro</I> using multielectrode arrays (MEAs). Flicker resolution was considerably lower in EAAT5<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> retinae than in WT retinae. The close proximity to the glutamate release site makes EAAT5 an ideal tool to improve temporal information processing in the retina by controlling information transfer at glutamatergic synapses.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">GCAEMDA: Predicting miRNA-disease associations via graph convolutional autoencoder</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Lei Li, Yu-Tian Wang, Cun-Mei Ji, Chun-Hou Zheng, Jian-Cheng Ni, Yan-Sen Su</p>

microRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs related to a number of complicated biological processes. A growing body of studies have suggested that miRNAs are closely associated with many human diseases. It is meaningful to consider disease-related miRNAs as potential biomarkers, which could greatly contribute to understanding the mechanisms of complex diseases and benefit the prevention, detection, diagnosis and treatment of extraordinary diseases. In this study, we presented a novel model named Graph Convolutional Autoencoder for miRNA-Disease Association Prediction (GCAEMDA). In the proposed model, we utilized miRNA-miRNA similarities, disease-disease similarities and verified miRNA-disease associations to construct a heterogeneous network, which is applied to learn the embeddings of miRNAs and diseases. In addition, we separately constructed miRNA-based and disease-based sub-networks. Combining the embeddings of miRNAs and diseases, graph convolution autoencoder (GCAE) is utilized to calculate association scores of miRNA-disease on two sub-networks, respectively. Furthermore, we obtained final prediction scores between miRNAs and diseases by adopting an average ensemble way to integrate the prediction scores from two types of subnetworks. To indicate the accuracy of GCAEMDA, we applied different cross validation methods to evaluate our model whose performance were better than the state-of-the-art models. Case studies on a common human diseases were also implemented to prove the effectiveness of GCAEMDA. The results demonstrated that GCAEMDA were beneficial to infer potential associations of miRNA-disease.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Noise increases the correspondence between artificial and human vision</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jessica A. F. Thompson</p>

The best performing computer vision systems are based on deep neural networks (DNNs). A study in this issue of PLOS Biology shows that DNNs trained on noisy stimuli are better than standard DNNs at mirroring both human behavioral and neural visual responses.

This Primer explores the implications of a recent PLOS Biology study, arguing that noise-robustness, a property of human vision that standard computer vision models fail to mimic, provides an opportunity to probe the neural mechanisms underlying visual object recognition and refine computational models of the ventral visual stream.

                Background: Most patients with COVID-19 experience mild illness which can be managed in a home environment. This study was done to assess the perception, awareness and practices regarding home-based management of COVID-19 among the general population in India. Methods: This cross-sectional study was done in May and June 2021. Data were collected using a Google Form. Results: Mean age of the 294 participants was 36.6 ± 12.1 years. Of these participants, 45 (15.3%) were diagnosed with COVID-19 anytime in the past. Among them, 37 (82.2%) underwent home-based management for COVID-19. Monitoring of body temperature and oxygen saturation was performed just once a day by 15.2% and 5.9% of COVID-19 patients respectively. Self-medication was practiced by 11 (29.7%) patients. Disposable face masks were worn by 23 (62.2%) patients beyond eight hours of continuous usage. The disposable type of face mask was not discarded despite becoming wet and cloth masks were worn by eight (21.6%) patients. Disposable gloves were only worn by 14 (37.8%) care providers of COVID-19 patients. As many as 10 (27%) patients were tested for COVID-19 after completion of home isolation. Awareness of all mild symptoms and signs of the disease were known to only 19 (6.5%) participants. Normal oxygen saturation in the blood was known to 40 (13.6%) participants. Just six (2%) participants were aware of the correct duration of home isolation in a symptomatic patient with COVID-19. The recommended duration of hand washing with soap and water was known to 102 (34.7%) participants. As many as 17.4% and 32.7% participants were not confident in using thermometer and pulse oximeter respectively. Conclusion: Practices, awareness and perception regarding certain essential measures in COVID-19 home management were found lacking among a number of participants. These need to be addressed by suitable training programs among the general population.

                Background: Unmarried women who experience unintended pregnancy tend to hide their pregnancy and not attend pregnancy care services. The study analyzed the effect of unintended pregnancy on antenatal care (ANC) visits among unmarried women in Indonesia. Methods: The study employed secondary data from the Indonesian Demographic and Health Survey (IDHS) 2017. This cross-sectional study involved unmarried women aged 15-49 years old who gave birth in the last five years. The 2017 IDHS used stratification and multistage random sampling, and the task obtained 508 respondents as samples. The variables analyzed included ANC visits, unintended pregnancy, residence, age, marital status, education, employment, wealth, and health insurance ownership. The study used the binary logistic regression test at the final stage. Results: The results show that unmarried women who had an unintended pregnancy were 0.588 times more likely than those who did not have an unintended pregnancy to have ANC visits ≥ four times (AOR 0.588; 95% CI 0.587-0.588). The analysis indicates that unmarried women who have an unintended pregnancy in Indonesia are less likely to complete ANC visits. Apart from unintended pregnancy, the study found seven other independent variables as significant determinants of ANC visit performance: type of residence, age group, marital status, education level, employment status, wealth status, and health insurance ownership. Conclusion: The study concluded that unmarried women who experienced an unintended pregnancy in Indonesia were less likely to complete ANC visits.

                Aortic to right ventricular fistula formation after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is a rare complication. We describe the first case of an aorto-RV fistula after TAVR, conservatively managed, in a patient with concomitant aortic stenosis and wild-type transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis. Given that the underlying pathology may have implications, transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis screening in patients undergoing TAVR is warranted.

                Mortality from triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is significantly higher in African American (AA) women compared to White American (WA) women emphasizing ethnicity as a major risk factor; however, the molecular determinants that drive aggressive progression of AA-TNBC remain elusive. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that AA-TNBC cells are inherently aggressive, exhibiting elevated growth, migration, and cancer stem-like phenotype compared to WA-TNBC cells. Meta-analysis of RNA-sequencing data of multiple AA- and WA-TNBC cell lines shows enrichment of GLI1 and Notch1 pathways in AA-TNBC cells. Enrichment of GLI1 and Notch1 pathway genes was observed in AA-TNBC. In line with this observation, analysis of TCGA dataset reveals a positive correlation between GLI1 and Notch1 in AA-TNBC and a negative correlation in WA-TNBC. Increased nuclear localization and interaction between GLI1 and Notch1 is observed in AA-TNBC cells. Of importance, inhibition of GLI1 and Notch1 synergistically improves the efficacy of chemotherapy in AA-TNBC cells. Combined treatment of AA-TNBC-derived tumors with GANT61, DAPT, and doxorubicin/carboplatin results in significant tumor regression, and tumor-dissociated cells show mitigated migration, invasion, mammosphere formation, and CD44<sup>+</sup>/CD24<sup>-</sup> population. Indeed, secondary tumors derived from triple-therapy-treated AA-TNBC tumors show diminished stem-like phenotype. Finally, we show that TNBC tumors from AA women express significantly higher level of GLI1 and Notch1 expression in comparison to TNBC tumors from WA women. This work sheds light on the racial disparity in TNBC, implicates the GLI1 and Notch1 axis as its functional mediators, and proposes a triple-combination therapy that can prove beneficial for AA-TNBC.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Combined effect of cell geometry and polarity domains determines the orientation of unequal division</a></h4>

              
                Cell division orientation is thought to result from a competition between cell geometry and polarity domains controlling the position of the mitotic spindle during mitosis. Depending on the level of cell shape anisotropy or the strength of the polarity domain, one dominates the other and determines the orientation of the spindle. Whether and how such competition is also at work to determine unequal cell division (UCD), producing daughter cells of different size, remains unclear. Here, we show that cell geometry and polarity domains cooperate, rather than compete, in positioning the cleavage plane during UCDs in early ascidian embryos. We found that the UCDs and their orientation at the ascidian third cleavage rely on the spindle tilting in an anisotropic cell shape, and cortical polarity domains exerting different effects on spindle astral microtubules. By systematically varying mitotic cell shape, we could modulate the effect of attractive and repulsive polarity domains and consequently generate predicted daughter cell size asymmetries and position. We therefore propose that the spindle position during UCD is set by the combined activities of cell geometry and polarity domains, where cell geometry modulates the effect of cortical polarity domain(s).

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The population genetics of collateral resistance and sensitivity</a></h4>

              
                Resistance mutations against one drug can elicit collateral sensitivity against other drugs. Multi-drug treatments exploiting such trade-offs can help slow down the evolution of resistance. However, if mutations with diverse collateral effects are available, a treated population may evolve either collateral sensitivity or collateral resistance. How to design treatments robust to such uncertainty is unclear. We show that many resistance mutations in Escherichia coli against various antibiotics indeed have diverse collateral effects. We propose to characterize such diversity with a joint distribution of fitness effects (JDFE) and develop a theory for describing and predicting collateral evolution based on simple statistics of the JDFE. We show how to robustly rank drug pairs to minimize the risk of collateral resistance and how to estimate JDFEs. In addition to practical applications, these results have implications for our understanding of evolution in variable environments.

                Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) are regarded as two ends of a pathogenetic spectrum, termed ALS-frontotemporal spectrum disorder (ALS-FTSD). However, it is currently difficult to predict where on the spectrum an individual will lie, especially for patients with C9orf72 hexanucleotide repeat expansions (HRE), a mutation associated with both ALS and FTD. It has been shown that both inflammation and protein misfolding influence aspects of ALS and ALS-FTSD disease pathogenesis, such as the manifestation or severity of motor or cognitive symptoms. Previous studies have highlighted markers which may influence C9orf72-associated disease presentation in a targeted fashion, though there has yet to be a systematic and quantitative assessment of common immunohistochemical markers to investigate the significance of these pathways in an unbiased manner. Here we report the first extensive digital pathological assessment with random forest modelling of pathological markers often used in neuropathology practice. This study profiles glial activation and protein misfolding in a cohort of deeply clinically profiled post-mortem tissue from patients with a C9orf72 HRE, who either met the criteria for a diagnosis of ALS or ALS-FTSD. We show that microglial immunohistochemical staining features, both morphological and spatial, are the best independent classifiers of disease status and that clinicopathological associations exist between microglial activation status and cognitive dysfunction in ALS-FTSD patients with C9orf72 HRE. Furthermore, we show that spatially resolved changes in FUS staining are also an accurate predictor of disease status, implying that liquid-liquid phase shift of this aggregation-prone RNA-binding protein may be important in ALS caused by a C9orf72 HRE. Our findings provide further support to the hypothesis of dysfunctional immune regulation and proteostasis in the pathogenesis of C9orf72 ALS and provide a framework for digital analysis of commonly used neuropathological stains as a tool to enrich our understanding of clinicopathological associations between cohorts.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neuronal activity-driven oligodendrogenesis in selected brain regions is required for episodic memories</a></h4>

              
                The formation of long-term episodic memories requires the activation of molecular mechanisms in several regions of the medial temporal lobe, including the hippocampus and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). The extent to which these regions engage distinct mechanisms and cell types to support memory formation is not well understood. Recent studies reported that oligodendrogenesis is essential for learning and long-term memory; however, whether these mechanisms are required only in selected brain regions is still unclear. Also still unknown are the temporal kinetics of engagement of learning-induced oligodendrogenesis and whether this oligodendrogenesis occurs in response to neuronal activity. Here we show that in rats and mice, episodic learning rapidly increases the oligodendrogenesis and myelin biogenesis transcripts olig2, myrf, mbp, and plp1, as well as oligodendrogenesis, in the ACC but not in the dorsal hippocampus (dHC). Region-specific knockdown and knockout of Myrf, a master regulator of oligodendrocyte maturation, revealed that oligodendrogenesis is required for memory formation in the ACC but not the dHC. Chemogenetic neuronal silencing in the ACC showed that neuronal activity is critical for learning-induced oligodendrogenesis. Hence, an activity-dependent increase in oligodendrogenesis in selected brain regions, specifically in the ACC but not dHC, is critical for the formation of episodic memories.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Benchmarking GE-BOLD, SE-BOLD, and SS-SI-VASO sequences for depth-dependent separation of feedforward and feedback signals in high-field MRI</a></h4>

              
                Recent advances in high-field fMRI have allowed differentiating feedforward and feedback information in the grey matter of the human brain. For continued progress in this endeavor, it is critical to understand how MRI data acquisition parameters impact the read-out of information from laminar response profiles. Here, we benchmarked three different MR-sequences at 7T - gradient-echo (GE), spin-echo (SE) and vascular space occupancy imaging (VASO) - in differentiating feedforward and feedback signals in human early visual cortex (V1). The experiment (N=4) consisted of two complementary tasks: a perception task that predominantly evokes feedforward signals and a working memory task that relies on feedback signals. In the perception task, participants saw flickering oriented gratings while detecting orthogonal color-changes. In the working memory task, participants memorized the precise orientation of a grating. We used multivariate pattern analysis to read out the perceived (feedforward) and memorized (feedback) grating orientation from neural signals across cortical depth. Analyses across all the MR-sequences revealed perception signals predominantly in the middle cortical compartment of area V1 and working memory signals in the deep compartment. Despite an overall consistency across sequences, SE-EPI was the only sequence where both feedforward and feedback information were differently pronounced across cortical depth in a statistically robust way. We therefore suggest that in the context of a typical cognitive neuroscience experiment as the one benchmarked here, SE-EPI may provide a favorable trade-off between spatial specificity and signal sensitivity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Detection of Motor-Evoked Potentials Below the Noise Floor: Rethinking the Motor Threshold</a></h4>

              
                Background: Motor-evoked potentials (MEP) are one of the most prominent responses to brain stimulation, such as supra-threshold transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and electrical stimulation. Understanding of the neurophysiology and the determination of the lowest stimulation strength that evokes responses requires the detection of even smaller responses, e.g., from single motor units. However, available detection and quantization methods suffer from a large noise floor. Objective: This paper develops a detection method that extracts MEPs hidden below the noise floor. With this method, we aim to estimate excitatory activations of the corticospinal pathways well below the conventional detection level. Methods: The presented MEP detection method presents a self-learning matched-filter approach for improved robustness against noise. The filter is adaptively generated per subject through iterative learning. For responses that are reliably detected by conventional detection, the new approach is fully compatible with established peak-to-peak readings and provides the same results but extends the dynamic range below the conventional noise floor. Results: In contrast to the conventional peak-to-peak measure, the proposed method increases the signal-to-noise ratio by more than a factor of 5. The first detectable responses appear to be substantially lower than the conventional threshold definition of 50 V median peak-to-peak amplitude. Conclusion: The proposed method shows that stimuli well below the conventional 50 V threshold definition can consistently and repeatably evoke muscular responses and thus activate excitable neuron populations in the brain. As a consequence, the IO curve is extended at the lower end, and the noise cut-off is shifted. Importantly, the IO curve extends so far that the 50 V point turns out to be closer to the center of the logarithmic sigmoid curve rather than close to the first detectable responses. The underlying method is applicable to a wide range of evoked potentials and other biosignals, such as in electroencephalography.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Commanding or being a simple intermediary: how does it affect moral behavior and related brain mechanisms?</a></h4>

              
                History has shown that fractioning operations between several individuals along a hierarchical chain allows diffusing responsibility between components of the chain, which has the potential to disinhibit antisocial actions. Here, we present two studies, one using fMRI (Study 1) and one using EEG (Study 2), designed to help understand how commanding or being in an intermediary position impacts the sense of agency and empathy for pain. In the age of military drones, we also explored whether commanding a human or robot agent influences these measures. This was done within a single behavioral paradigm in which participants could freely decide whether or not to send painful shocks to another participant in exchange for money. In Study 1, fMRI reveals that activation in social cognition and empathy-related brain regions was equally low when witnessing a victim receive a painful shock while participants were either commander or simple intermediary transmitting an order, compared to being the agent directly delivering the shock. In Study 2, results indicated that the sense of agency did not differ between commanders and intermediary, no matter if the executing agent was a robot or a human. However, we observed that the neural response over P3 was higher when the executing agent was a robot compared to a human. Source reconstruction of the EEG signal revealed that this effect was mediated by areas including the insula and ACC. Results are discussed regarding the interplay between the sense of agency and empathy for pain for decision-making.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cognitive experience alters cortical involvement in navigation decisions</a></h4>

              
                The neural correlates of decision-making have been investigated extensively, and recent work aims to identify under what conditions cortex is actually necessary for making accurate decisions. We discovered that mice with distinct cognitive experiences, beyond sensory and motor learning, use different cortical areas and neural activity patterns to solve the same task, revealing past learning as a critical determinant of whether cortex is necessary for decision-making. We used optogenetics and calcium imaging to study the necessity and neural activity of multiple cortical areas in mice with different training histories. Posterior parietal cortex and retrosplenial cortex were mostly dispensable for accurate decision-making in mice performing a simple navigation-based decision task. In contrast, these areas were essential for the same simple task when mice were previously trained on complex tasks with delay periods or association switches. Multi-area calcium imaging showed that, in mice with complex-task experience, single-neuron activity had higher selectivity and neuron-neuron correlations were weaker, leading to codes with higher task information. Therefore, past experience sets the landscape for how future tasks are solved by the brain and is a key factor in determining whether cortical areas have a causal role in decision-making.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Rule-based and stimulus-based cues bias auditory decisions via different computational and physiological mechanisms</a></h4>

              
                The varied effects of expectations on auditory perception are not well understood. For example, both top-down rules and bottom-up stimulus regularities generate expectations that can bias subsequent perceptual judgments. However, it is unknown whether these different sources of bias use the same or different computational and physiological mechanisms. We examined how rule-based and stimulus-based expectations influenced human subjects' behavior and pupil-linked arousal, a marker of certain forms of expectation-based processing, during an auditory frequency-discrimination task. Rule-based cues biased choice and response times (RTs) toward the more-probable stimulus. In contrast, stimulus-based cues had a complex combination of effects, including choice and RT biases toward and away from the frequency of recently heard stimuli. These different behavioral patterns also had distinct computational signatures, including different modulations of key components of a novel form of a drift-diffusion model, and distinct physiological signatures, including substantial bias-dependent modulations of pupil size in response to rule-based but not stimulus-based cues. These results imply that different sources of expectations can modulate auditory perception via distinct mechanisms: one that uses arousal-linked, rule-based information and another that uses arousal-independent, stimulus-based information to bias the speed and accuracy of auditory perceptual decisions.

                Although optical microscopy has allowed us to study the entire brain in early developmental stages, access to the brains of live, adult vertebrates has been limited. Danionella, a genus of miniature, transparent fish closely related to zebrafish has been introduced as a neuroscience model to study the entire adult vertebrate brain. However, the extent of optically accessible depth in these animals has not been quantitatively characterized. Here, we show that two- and three-photon microscopy can be used to access the entire depth of the adult wild type Danionella dracula brain without any modifications to the animal other than mechanical stabilization. Three-photon microscopy provides high signal to background ratio and optical sectioning through the deepest part of the brain. While vasculature can be observed with two-photon microscopy, the deeper regions have low contrast. We show that multiphoton microscopy is ideal for readily penetrating the entire adult brain within the geometry of these animals' head structures and without the need for pigment removal. With multiphoton microscopy enabling optical access to the entire adult brain and a repertoire of methods that allow observation of the larval brain, Danionella provides a model system for readily studying the entire brain over the lifetime of a vertebrate.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Towards Biophysical Markers of Depression Vulnerability</a></h4>

              
                A major difficulty with treating psychiatric disorders is their heterogeneity: different neural causes can lead to the same phenotype. To address this, we propose describing the underlying pathophysiology in terms of interpretable, biophysical parameters of a neural model derived from the electroencephalogram. We analyzed data from a small patient cohort of patients with depression and controls. We constructed biophysical models that describe neural dynamics in a cortical network activated during a task that is used to assess depression state. We show that biophysical model parameters are biomarkers, that is, variables that allow subtyping of depression at a biological level. They yield a low dimensional, interpretable feature space that allowed description of differences between individual patients with depressive symptoms. They capture internal heterogeneity/variance of depression state and achieve significantly better classification than commonly used EEG features. Our work is a proof of concept that a combination of biophysical models and machine learning may outperform earlier approaches based on classical statistics and raw brain data.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">D-amphetamine maintenance therapy reduces cocaine use in female rats</a></h4>

              
                Currently, there are no approved medications to treat cocaine addiction. In this context, d-amphetamine maintenance therapy is a promising pharmacological strategy to reduce cocaine use. In both male rats and human cocaine users, d-amphetamine treatment reduces cocaine taking and seeking. However, this has not been examined systematically in female animals, even though cocaine addiction afflicts both women and men, and the sexes can differ in their response to cocaine. Here, we determined how d-amphetamine maintenance therapy during cocaine self-administration influences cocaine use in female rats. In experiment 1, two groups of female rats received 14 intermittent access (IntA) cocaine self-administration sessions. One group received concomitant d-amphetamine maintenance treatment (COC + A rats; 5 mg/kg/day, via minipump), the other group did not (COC rats) After discontinuing d-amphetamine treatment, we measured responding for cocaine under a progressive ratio schedule, responding under extinction and cocaine-primed reinstatement of drug seeking. In experiment 2, we assessed the effects of d-amphetamine maintenance on these measures in already cocaine-experienced rats. To this end, rats first received 14 IntA cocaine self-administration sessions without d-amphetamine. They then received 14 more sessions now either with (COC/COC + A rats) or without (COC/COC rats) concomitant d-amphetamine treatment. In both experiments, d-amphetamine-treated rats showed reduced motivation to take and seek cocaine, responding less for cocaine both under progressive ratio and extinction conditions. In contrast, d-amphetamine treatment did not influence cocaine-primed reinstatement of cocaine seeking. Thus, d-amphetamine treatment reduces both the development and expression of addiction-relevant patterns of cocaine use in female animals.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">People with nicotine dependence use-disorder exhibit more prefrontal activity during preparatory control but reduced anterior cingulate activity during reactive control</a></h4>

              
                Reduced inhibitory control and a hypersensitivity to reward are key deficits in drug-dependents, however, they tend to be studied in isolation. Here we seek to understand the neural processes underlying control over reward and how this is different in people with a nicotine use disorder (pNUD). A novel variant of the monetary incentive delay task was performed by pNUD (n = 20) and non-smokers (n = 20), where we added a stop-signal component such that participants had to inhibit prepotent responses to earn a larger monetary reward. Brain activity was recorded using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We estimated stop signal reaction times (SSRT), an indicator of impulsivity, and correlated these with brain activity. Inhibitory accuracy scores did not differ between the control group and pNUD. However, pNUD had slower SSRTs, suggesting that they may find it harder to inhibit responses. Brain data revealed that pNUD had greater preparatory control activity in the middle frontal gyrus and inferior frontal gyrus prior to successful inhibitions over reward. In contrast, non-smokers had greater reactive control associated with more activity in the anterior cingulate cortex during these successful inhibitions. SSRT-brain activity correlations revealed that pNUD engaged more control related prefrontal brain regions when SSRTs are slower. Overall, whilst the inhibition accuracy scores were similar between groups, differential neural processes and strategies were used to successfully inhibit a prepotent response. The findings suggest that increasing preparatory control in pNUD may be one possible treatment target in order to increase inhibitory control over reward.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Performance During Whole Body Reaching Movements Is Impaired In Hypergravity While Preserved In Microgravity</a></h4>

              
                While recent findings demonstrated the importance of initial state estimates about gravity for optimized motor control, it remains unclear whether novel initial states are rapidly implemented movement planning (and control) in the same way when gravity is removed or increased. Here, we investigated the effect of microgravity and hypergravity exposure on whole-body reaching movements performed by standing subjects during parabolic flights. Reaching movements were analyzed regarding spatial accuracy (finger endpoint deviation), arm kinematics (arm angular displacement), whole-body kinematics (body bending) and EMG activity (muscular activation and synergies) of eight muscles. Results showed that kinematics and muscular activity are adjusted in microgravity allowing accurate whole-body reaching, thus confirming the perfectly scaled sensorimotor reorganization reported in previous recent studies. Contrasting with these observations, participants hardly reached the targets in 1.8g (systematic undershot). Strikingly, whole-body kinematics remained unchanged in hypergravity compared to 1g observations. Finally, while the analysis of synergies highlighted a comparable muscular organization in all gravitational contexts, our main findings revealed local muscular adjustments leading to accurate motor responses in microgravity, but not in hypergravity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Integration of visual motion and pursuit signals in areas V3A and V6+ across cortical depth using 9.4T fMRI</a></h4>

              
                Neural mechanisms underlying a stable perception of the world during pursuit eye movements are not fully understood. Both, perceptual stability as well as perception of real (i.e. objective) motion are the product of integration between motion signals on the retina and efference copies of eye movements. Human areas V3A and V6 have previously been shown to have strong objective ('real') motion responses. Here we used high-resolution laminar fMRI at ultra-high magnetic field (9.4T) in human subjects to examine motion integration across cortical depths in these areas. We found an increased preference for objective motion in areas V3A and V6+ i.e. V6 and possibly V6A towards the upper layers. When laminar responses were detrended to remove the upper-layer bias present in all responses, we found a unique, condition-specific laminar profile in V6+, showing reduced mid-layer responses for retinal motion only. The results provide evidence for differential, motion-type dependent laminar processing in area V6+. Mechanistically, the mid-layer dip suggests a special contribution of retinal motion to integration, either in the form of a subtractive (inhibitory) mid-layer input, or in the form of feedback into extragranular or infragranular layers. The results show that differential laminar signals can be measured in high-level motion areas in human occipitoparietal cortex, opening the prospect of new mechanistic insights using non-invasive brain imaging.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Engineered biological neural networks on high density CMOS micro electrode arrays</a></h4>

              
                In bottom-up neuroscience, questions on neural information processing are addressed by engineering small but reproducible biological neural networks of defined network topology textit{in vitro}. The network topology can be controlled by culturing neurons within polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) microstructures that are combined with microelectrode arrays (MEAs) for electric access to the network. However, currently used glass MEAs are limited to 256 electrodes and pose a limitation to the spatial resolution as well as the design of more complex microstructures. The use of high density complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) MEAs greatly increases the spatiotemporal resolution, enabling sub-cellular readout and stimulation of neurons in defined neural networks. Unfortunately, the non-planar surface of CMOS MEAs complicates the attachment of PDMS microstructures. To overcome the problem of axons escaping the microstructures through the ridges of the CMOS MEA, we stamp-transferred a thin film of hexane-diluted PDMS onto the array such that the PDMS filled the ridges at the contact surface of the microstructures without clogging the axon guidance channels. Moreover, we provide an impedance-based method to visualize the exact location of the microstructures on the MEA and show that our method can confine axonal growth within the PDMS microstructures. Finally, the high spatiotemporal resolution of the CMOS MEA enabled us to show that we can guide action potentials using the unidirectional topology of our circular multi-node microstructure.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Rewarded extinction increases amygdalar connectivity and stabilizes long-term memory traces in the vmPFC</a></h4>

              
                Neurobiological evidence in rodents indicates that threat extinction incorporates reward neurocircuitry. Consequently, incorporating reward associations with an extinction memory may be an effective strategy to persistently attenuate threat responses. Moreover, while there is considerable research on the short-term effects of extinction strategies in humans, the long-term effects of extinction are rarely considered. In a within-subjects fMRI study, we compared counterconditioning (a form of rewarded-extinction) to standard extinction, at recent (24 hours) and remote (~1 month) retrieval tests. Relative to standard extinction, counterconditioning diminished 24-hour relapse of arousal and threat expectancy, and reduced activity in brain regions associated with the appraisal and expression of threat (e.g., thalamus, insula, periaqueductal gray). The retrieval of reward-associated extinction memory was accompanied by functional connectivity between the amygdala and the ventral striatum, whereas the retrieval of standard-extinction memories was associated with connectivity between the amygdala and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC). One-month later, the retrieval of both standard- and rewarded-extinction was associated with amygdala-vmPFC connectivity. However, only rewarded extinction created a stable memory trace in the vmPFC, identified through overlapping multivariate patterns of fMRI activity from extinction to 24-hour and 1-month retrieval. These findings provide new evidence that reward may generate a more stable and enduring memory trace of attenuated threat in humans.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Seeing the future: predictive control in neural models of ocular accommodation</a></h4>

              
                Ocular accommodation is the process of adjusting the eye's crystalline lens so as to bring the retinal image into sharp focus. The major stimulus to accommodation is therefore retinal defocus, and in essence, the job of accommodative control is to send a signal to the ciliary muscle which will minimise the magnitude of defocus. In this paper, we first provide a tutorial introduction to control theory to aid vision scientists without this background. We then present a unified model of accommodative control that explains properties of the accommodative response for a wide range of accommodative stimuli. Following previous work, we conclude that most aspects of accommodation are well explained by dual integral control, with a "fast" or "phasic" integrator enabling response to rapid changes in demand, which hands over control to a "slow" or "tonic" integrator which maintains the response to steady demand. Control is complicated by the sensorimotor latencies within the system, which delay both information about defocus and the accommodation changes made in response, and by the sluggish response of the motor plant. These can be overcome by incorporating a Smith predictor, whereby the system predicts the delayed sensory consequences of its own motor actions. For the first time, we show that critically-damped dual integral control with a Smith predictor accounts for adaptation effects as well as for the gain and phase for sinusoidal oscillations in demand. In addition, we propose a novel proportional-control signal to account for the power spectrum of accommodative microfluctuations during steady fixation, which may be important in hunting for optimal focus, and for the nonlinear resonance observed for low-amplitude, high-frequency input. Complete Matlab/Simulink code implementing the model is provided at https://doi.org/10.25405/data.ncl.14945550

                The objective of this research was to explore the efficacy of integrating 1) using multi-task learning, 2) neuroimaging data and common risk factors to predict the ADAS-cog 11 score in Alzheimer's patients. We studied the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of 798 participants ranging between 0 and 96 months from the initial diagnosis. This enabled us to exploit the benefits of the U-Net architecture, a structure historically known to perform well on medical imaging tasks using limited data with heavy image augmentations. The multi-task model simultaneously performed segmentation of white matter, gray matter, and cerebrospinal fluid on the MRI input and regression to predict the ADAS-cog 11 score. There is a body of literature highlighting the independent relationships between gray and white matter volumes and dementia severity; the trajectory was to explore if the multi-task model structure for these interrelated tasks would boost performance for each individual task. The final model integrates the deep learning results with a Gradient Boosting model trained on demographic data. A considerable performance improvement from the initial multi-task U-Net on the ADAS-cog 11 prediction task was achieved across our experiments.

                Are leaders made or born? Leader-follower roles have been well characterized in social science, but they remain somewhat obscure in sensory-motor coordination. Furthermore, it is unknown how and why leader-follower relationships are acquired, including innate versus acquired controversies. We developed a novel asymmetrical coordination task in which two participants (dyad) need to collaborate in transporting a simulated beam while maintaining its horizontal attitude. This experimental paradigm was implemented by twin robotic manipulanda, simulated beam dynamics, haptic interactions, and a projection screen. Clear leader-follower relationships were learned despite participants not being informed that they were interacting with each other, but only when strong haptic feedback was introduced. For the first time, we demonstrate the emergence of consistent leader-follower relationships in sensory-motor coordination, and further show that haptic interaction is essential for dyadic co-adaptation. These results provide insights into neural mechanisms responsible for the formation of leader-follower relationships in our society.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Targeting targeted memory reactivation: characteristics of cued reactivation in sleep</a></h4>

              
                Targeted memory reactivation (TMR) is a technique in which sensory cues associated with memories during wake are used to trigger memory reactivation during subsequent sleep. The characteristics of such cued reactivation, and the optimal placement of TMR cues, remain to be determined. We built an EEG classification pipeline that discriminated reactivation of right- and left-handed movements and found that cues which fall on the up-going transition of the slow oscillation (SO) are more likely to elicit a classifiable reactivation. We also used a novel machine learning pipeline to predict the likelihood of eliciting a classifiable reactivation after each TMR cue using the presence of spindles and features of SOs. Finally, we found that reactivations occurred either immediately after the cue or one second later. These findings greatly extend our understanding of memory reactivation and pave the way for development of wearable technologies to efficiently enhance memory through cueing in sleep.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Systematic analysis of C. elegans embryo behavior reveals a stereotyped developmental progression and a rhythmic pattern of behavioral quiescence</a></h4>

              
                Systematic analysis of rich behavioral recordings is being used to uncover how circuits encode complex behaviors. Here we apply the approach to embryos. What are the first embryonic behaviors and how do they evolve as early neurodevelopment ensues? To address these questions, we present a systematic description of behavioral maturation for Caenorhabditis elegans embryos. Posture libraries were derived from a genetically encoded motion capture suit imaged with light-sheet microscopy and annotated using custom semi-automated tracking software (Multiple Hypothesis Hypergraph Tracking; MHHT). Analysis of cell trajectories, postures, and behavioral motifs revealed a stereotyped developmental progression. Early movement is dominated by flipping between dorsal and ventral coiling, which gradually slows into a period of reduced motility. Late-stage embryos exhibit sinusoidal waves of dorsoventral bends, prolonged bouts of directed motion, and a rhythmic pattern of pausing, which we designate slow wave twitch (SWT). Synaptic transmission is required for late-stage motion but not for early flipping or the intervening inactive phase. A high-throughput behavioral assay and calcium imaging revealed that SWT is elicited by the rhythmic activity of a quiescence-promoting neuron (RIS). Similar periodic quiescent states are seen prenatally in divergent animals and may play an important role in promoting normal developmental outcomes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Speech Sound Discrimination by Mongolian Gerbils</a></h4>

              
                The present study establishes the Mongolian gerbil (Meriones unguiculatus) as a model for investigating the perception of human speech sounds. We report data on the discrimination of logatomes (CVCs - consonant-vowel-consonant combinations with outer consonants /b/, /d/, /s/ and /t/ and central vowels /a/, /a[tricolon]/, /{varepsilon}/, /e[tricolon]/, /O_SCPLOWIC_SCPLOW/, /i[tricolon]/, /[o]/, /o[tricolon]/, /{upsilon}/ and /u[tricolon]/, VCVs - vowel-consonant-vowel combinations with outer vowels /a/, /O_SCPLOWIC_SCPLOW/ and /{upsilon}/ and central consonants /b/, /d/, /f/, /g/, /k/, /l/, /m/, /n/, /p/, /s/, /t/ and /v/) by young gerbils. Four young gerbils were trained to perform an oddball target detection paradigm in which they were required to discriminate a deviant CVC or VCV in a sequence of CVC or VCV standards, respectively. The experiments were performed with an ICRA-1 noise masker with speech-like spectral properties, and logatomes of multiple speakers were presented at various signal-to-noise ratios. Response latencies were measured to generate perceptual maps employing multidimensional scaling, which visualize the gerbils' internal representations of the sounds. The dimensions of the perceptual maps were correlated to multiple phonetic features of the speech sounds for evaluating which features of vowels and consonants are most important for the discrimination. The perceptual representation of vowels and consonants in gerbils was similar to that of humans, although gerbils needed higher signal-to-noise ratios for the discrimination of speech sounds than humans. The gerbils' discrimination of vowels depended on differences in the frequencies of the first and second formant determined by tongue height and position. Consonants were discriminated based on differences in combinations of their articulatory features. The similarities in the perception of logatomes by gerbils and humans renders the gerbil a suitable model for human speech sound discrimination.

                Bottom-up neuroscience, which consists of building and studying controlled networks of neurons in vitro, is a promising method to investigate information processing at the neuronal level. However, in vitro studies tend to use cells of animal origin rather than human neurons, leading to conclusions that might not be generalizable to humans and limiting the possibilities for relevant studies on neurological disorders. Here we present a method to build arrays of topologically controlled circuits of human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons. The circuits consist of 4 to 50 neurons with mostly unidirectional connections, confined by microfabricated polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) membranes. Such circuits were characterized using optical imaging and microelectrode arrays (MEAs). Electrophysiology recordings were performed on circuits of human iPSC-derived neurons for at least 4.5 months. We believe that the capacity to build small and controlled circuits of human iPSC-derived neurons holds great promise to better understand the fundamental principles of information processing and storing in the brain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Probing the segregation of evoked and spontaneous neurotransmission via photobleaching and recovery of a fluorescent glutamate sensor</a></h4>

              
                Synapses maintain both action potential-evoked and spontaneous neurotransmitter release, however, organization of these two forms of release within an individual synapse remains unclear. Here, we used photobleaching properties of iGluSnFR, a fluorescent probe that detects glutamate, to investigate the subsynaptic organization of evoked and spontaneous release. In non-neuronal cells and neuronal dendrites, iGluSnFR fluorescence is intensely photobleached and recovers via diffusion of non-photobleached probes within 10-seconds. After photobleaching, while evoked iGluSnFR events could be rapidly suppressed, their recovery required several hours. In contrast, iGluSnFR responses to spontaneous release were comparatively resilient to photobleaching, unless the complete pool of iGluSnFR was activated by glutamate perfusion. This differential effect of photobleaching on different modes of neurotransmission is consistent with a subsynaptic organization where sites of evoked glutamate release are clustered and corresponding iGluSnFR probes are diffusion restricted, while spontaneous release sites are broadly spread across a synapse with readily diffusible iGluSnFR probes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">4-phenylbutyrate restored GABA uptake and reduced seizures in SLC6A1 variants-mediated disorders</a></h4>

              
                We have previously studied the molecular mechanisms of solute carrier family 6 member 1 (SLC6A1) associated with a continuum of neurodevelopmental disorders, including various epilepsy syndromes, autism, and intellectual disability. Based on functional assays of variants in a large cohort with heterogenous clinical phenotypes, we conclude that partial or complete loss of GABA uptake function in the mutant GAT-1 is the primary etiology as identified in GABAA receptor mutation-mediated epilepsy and in cystic fibrosis. Importantly, we identified that there are common patterns of the mutant protein trafficking from biogenesis, oligomerization, glycosylation, and translocation to the cell membrane across variants with the conservation of this process across cell types. Conversely any approach to facilitate membrane trafficking would increase presence of the functional protein in the targeted destination in all involved cells. PBA is an FDA-approved drug for pediatric use and is orally bioavailable so it can be quickly translated to patient use. It has been demonstrated that PBA can correct protein misfolding, reduce ER stress, and attenuate unfolded protein response in neurodegenerative diseases, it has also showed promise in treatment of cystic fibrosis. The common cellular mechanisms shared by the mutant GAT-1 and the mutant cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator led us to test if PBA and other pharmaco-chaperones could be a potential treatment option for SLC6A1 mutations. We examined the impact of PBA and other small molecules in a library of variants and in cell and knockin mouse models. Because of the critical role of astrocytic GAT-1 deficit in seizures, we focused on astrocytes, and demonstrated that the existence of the mutant GAT-1 retained the wildtype GAT-1, suggesting aberrant protein oligomerization and trafficking caused by the mutant GAT-1. PBA increased GABA uptake in both mouse and human astrocytes bearing the mutations. Importantly, PBA increased GAT-1 expression and suppressed spike wave discharges (SWDS) in the heterozygous knockin mice. Although the detailed mechanisms of action for PBA are ambiguous, it is likely that PBA can facilitate the forward trafficking of the wildtype GAT-1 favoring over the mutant GAT-1, thus increasing GABA uptake. Since all patients with SLC6A1 mutations are heterozygous and carry one wildtype functional allele, this suggests a great opportunity for treatment development by leveraging the endogenous protein trafficking pathway to promote forward trafficking of the wildtype in combination with enhancing the disposal of the mutant allele as treatment mode. The study opens a novel avenue of treatment development for genetic epilepsy via drug repurposing.

                Leucine-rich Glioma Inactivated protein 1 (LGI1) is expressed in the central nervous and genetic loss of function is associated with epileptic disorders. Also, patients with LGI1-directed autoantibodies have frequent focal seizures as a key feature of their disease. LGI1 is composed of a Leucine Rich Repeat (LRR) and an Epitempin (EPTP) domain. These domains are reported to interact with different aspects of the transsynaptic complex formed by LGI1 at excitatory synapses, including presynaptic Kv1 potassium channels. Patient-derived monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are ideal reagents to study whether domain-specific LGI1-autoantibodies induce epileptiform activities in neurons, and their downstream mechanisms. To address this question, we measured the intrinsic excitability of CA3 pyramidal neurons in organotypic cultures from rat hippocampus treated with either a LRR- or an EPTP- reactive patient-derived mAb. The antibodies induced changes in neuronal intrinsic excitability which led us to measure their effects on Kv1-type potassium currents. We found an increase of intrinsic excitability correlated with a reduction of the sensitivity to a selective Kv1.1-channel blocker in neurons treated with the LRR mAb compared to the control, but not in neurons treated with the EPTP mAb. Our findings suggest LRR mAbs are able to modulate neuronal excitability that could account for epileptiform activities observed in patients.

                Age-related changes in cognition, brain morphology, and behavior are exhibited in several primate species. Baboons, like humans, naturally develop Alzheimer's disease-like pathology and cognitive declines with age and are an underutilized model for studies of aging. To determine age-related differences in gray matter covariation of 89 olive baboons (Papio anubis), we used source-based morphometry (SBM) to analyze data from magnetic resonance images. We hypothesized that we would find significant age effects in one or more SBM components, particularly those which include regions influenced by age in humans and other nonhuman primates (NHPs). A multivariate analysis of variance revealed that individual weighted gray matter covariation scores differed across the age classes. Elderly baboons contributed significantly less to gray matter covariation components including the brainstem, superior parietal cortex, thalamus, and pallidum compared to juveniles, and middle and superior frontal cortex compared to juveniles and young adults (p<0.05). Future studies should the relationship between the changes in gray matter covariation reported here and age-related cognitive decline.

                Serotonin is implicated in the valuation of aversive costs, such as delay or physical effort. However, its role in governing sensitivity to cognitive effort, for example deliberation costs during information gathering, is unclear. We show that week-long treatment with a serotonergic antidepressant enhances a willingness to gather information when trying to maximize reward. Using computational modelling, we show this arises from a diminished sensitivity to subjective deliberation costs during the sampling process. This result is consistent with the notion that serotonin alleviates sensitivity to aversive costs in a domain-general fashion, with implications for its potential contribution to a positive impact on motivational deficits in psychiatric disorders.

                Which part of the brain contributes to our complex cognitive processes? Studies have revealed contributions of the cerebellum and subcortex to higher-order cognitive functions; however it is unclear whether such functional representations are preserved across the cortex, cerebellum, and subcortex. In this study, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging data with 103 cognitive tasks and constructed three voxel-wise encoding and decoding models independently using cortical, cerebellar, and subcortical voxels. Representational similarity analysis revealed that the structure of task representations is preserved across the three brain parts. Principal component analysis visualized distinct organizations of abstract cognitive functions in each part of the cerebellum and subcortex. More than 90% of the cognitive tasks were decodable from the cerebellum and subcortical activities, even for the novel tasks not included in model training. Furthermore, we discovered that the cerebellum and subcortex have sufficient information to reconstruct activity in the cerebral cortex.

                Songbirds and humans share the ability to adaptively modify their vocalizations based on sensory feedback. Prior studies have focused primarily on the role that auditory feedback plays in shaping vocal output throughout life. In contrast, it is unclear whether and how non-auditory information drives vocal plasticity. Here, we first used a reinforcement learning paradigm to establish that non-auditory feedback can drive vocal learning in adult songbirds. We then assessed the role of a songbird basal ganglia-thalamocortical pathway critical to auditory vocal learning in this novel form of vocal plasticity. We found that both this circuit and its dopaminergic inputs are necessary for non-auditory vocal learning, demonstrating that this pathway is not specialized exclusively for auditory-driven vocal learning. The ability of this circuit to use both auditory and non-auditory information to guide vocal learning may reflect a general principle for the neural systems that support vocal plasticity across species.

                The human brain is a complex, integrative and segregative network that exhibits dynamic fluctuations in activity across space and time. A canonical set of large-scale networks has been historically identified from resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI), including the default mode, visual, somatomotor, salience, attention, and executive control. However, the methods used in identification of these networks have relied on assumptions that may inadvertently constrain their properties and consequently our understanding of the human connectome. Here we define a brain "network" as a functional component that jointly describes its spatial distribution and temporal dynamics, where neither domain suffers from unrealistic constraints. Using our recently developed BrainSync algorithm and the Nadam-Accelerated SCAlable and Robust (NASCAR) tensor decomposition, we identified twenty-three brain networks using rs-fMRI data from a large group of healthy subjects acquired by the Human Connectome Project. These networks are spatially overlapped, temporally correlated, and highly reproducible across two independent groups and sessions. We show that these networks can be clustered into six distinct functional categories and naturally form a representative functional network atlas for a healthy population. Using this atlas, we demonstrate that individuals with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder display disproportionate brain activity increases, relative to neurotypical subjects, in visual, auditory, and somatomotor networks concurrent with decreases in the default mode and higher-order cognitive networks. Thus, this work not only yields a highly reproducible set of spatiotemporally overlapped functional brain networks, but also provides convergent evidence that individual differences in these networks can be used to explain individual differences in neurocognitive functioning.

	<p>Aggression is highly prevalent in borderline personality disorder (BPD). Previous studies have identified specific biobehavioral mechanisms underlying aggression in BPD, threat sensitivity being among them. We composited the mechanism-based anti-aggression psychotherapy (MAAP) in order to target these specific mechanisms, and MAAP was found to be superior to non-specific supportive psychotherapy (NSSP) in reducing aggressive behavior. In the present study, we investigated whether underlying brain mechanisms expected to be involved were affected by MAAP. To this end, n = 33 patients with BPD and overt aggressive behavior (n = 20 in MAAP, n = 13 in NSSP) and n = 25 healthy participants took part in a functional magnetic resonance imaging emotional face-matching task before and after treatment, or at a similar time interval for controls. Overt aggressive behavior was assessed using the overt aggression scale, modified. Results showed a decrease in amygdala activation in response to facial stimuli after MAAP, whereas an increase in amygdala activation was found after NSSP. Furthermore, in the MAAP group, connectivity between amygdala and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex increased from pre- to post-treatment compared to the NSSP group. Hence, the results suggest an impact of MAAP on brain mechanisms underlying the salience circuit in response to threat cues.</p>

	<p>Depression is one of the leading causes of disability, and, if left unmanaged, it can increase the risk for suicide. The evidence base on the determinants of depression is fragmented, which makes the interpretation of the results across studies difficult. The objective of this study is to conduct a thorough synthesis of the literature assessing the biological, psychological, and social determinants of depression in order to piece together the puzzle of the key factors that are related to this condition. Titles and abstracts published between 2017 and 2020 were identified in PubMed, as well as Medline, Scopus, and PsycInfo. Key words relating to biological, social, and psychological determinants as well as depression were applied to the databases, and the screening and data charting of the documents took place. We included 470 documents in this literature review. The findings showed that there are a plethora of risk and protective factors (relating to biological, psychological, and social determinants) that are related to depression; these determinants are interlinked and influence depression outcomes through a web of causation. In this paper, we describe and present the vast, fragmented, and complex literature related to this topic. This review may be used to guide practice, public health efforts, policy, and research related to mental health and, specifically, depression.</p>

	<p>The upper extremities limitation represents one of the essential functional impairments in patients with cervical spinal cord injury. Electromechanics assisted devices and robots are increasingly used in neurorehabilitation to help functional improvement in patients with neurological diseases. This review aimed to systematically report the evidence-based, state-of-art on clinical applications and robotic-assisted arm training (RAT) in motor and functional recovery in subjects affected by cervical spinal cord injury. The present study has been carried out within the framework of the Italian Consensus Conference on &amp;amp;ldquo;Rehabilitation assisted by robotic and electromechanical devices for persons with disability of neurological origin&amp;amp;rdquo; (CICERONE). PubMed/MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, and Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) databases were systematically searched from inception to September 2021. The 10-item PEDro scale assessed the study quality for the RCT and the AMSTAR-2 for the systematic review. Two different authors rated the studies included in this review. If consensus was not achieved after discussion, a third reviewer was interrogated. The five-item Oxford CEBM scale was used to rate the level of evidence. A total of 11 studies were included. The selected studies were: two systematic reviews, two RCTs, one parallel-group controlled trial, one longitudinal intervention study and five case series. One RCT was scored as a high-quality study, while the systematic review was of low quality. RAT was reported as feasible and safe. Initial positive effects of RAT were found for arm function and quality of movement in addition to conventional therapy. The high clinical heterogeneity of treatment programs and the variety of robot devices could severely affect the generalizability of the study results. Therefore, future studies are warranted to standardize the type of intervention and evaluate the role of robotic-assisted training in subjects affected by cervical spinal cord injury.</p>

	<p>Neurocognitive deficits and negative symptoms (NS) have a pivotal role in subjects with schizophrenia (SCZ) due to their impact on patients’ functioning in everyday life and their influence on goal-directed behavior and decision-making. P3b is considered an optimal electrophysiological candidate biomarker of neurocognitive impairment for its association with the allocation of attentional resources to task-relevant stimuli, an important factor for efficient decision-making, as well as for motivation-related processes. Furthermore, associations between P3b deficits and NS have been reported. The current research aims to fill the lack of studies investigating, in the same subjects, the associations of P3b with multiple cognitive domains and the expressive and motivation-related domains of NS, evaluated with state-of-the-art instruments. One hundred and fourteen SCZ and 63 healthy controls (HCs) were included in the study. P3b amplitude was significantly reduced and P3b latency prolonged in SCZ as compared to HCs. In SCZ, a positive correlation was found between P3b latency and age and between P3b amplitude and the Attention-vigilance domain, while no significant correlations were found between P3b and the two NS domains. Our results indicate that the effortful allocation of attention to task-relevant stimuli, an important component of decision-making, is compromised in SCZ, independently of motivation deficits or other NS.</p>

	<p>Recent studies have shown that people make more utilitarian decisions when dealing with a moral dilemma in a foreign language than in their native language. Emotion, cognitive load, and psychological distance have been put forward as explanations for this foreign language effect. The question that arises is whether a similar effect would be observed when processing a dilemma in one&amp;amp;rsquo;s own language but spoken by a foreign-accented speaker. Indeed, foreign-accented speech has been shown to modulate emotion processing, to disrupt processing fluency and to increase psychological distance due to social categorisation. We tested this hypothesis by presenting 435 participants with two moral dilemmas, the trolley dilemma and the footbridge dilemma online, either in a native accent or a foreign accent. In Experiment 1, 184 native Spanish speakers listened to the dilemmas in Spanish recorded by a native speaker, a British English or a Cameroonian native speaker. In Experiment 2, 251 Dutch native speakers listened to the dilemmas in Dutch in their native accent, in a British English, a Turkish, or in a French accent. Results showed an increase in utilitarian decisions for the Cameroonian- and French-accented speech compared to the Spanish or Dutch native accent, respectively. When collapsing all the speakers from the two experiments, a similar increase in the foreign accent condition compared with the native accent condition was observed. This study is the first demonstration of a foreign accent effect on moral judgements, and despite the variability in the effect across accents, the findings suggest that a foreign accent, like a foreign language, is a linguistic context that modulates (neuro)cognitive mechanisms, and consequently, impacts our behaviour. More research is needed to follow up on this exploratory study and to understand the influence of factors such as emotion reduction, cognitive load, psychological distance, and speaker&amp;amp;rsquo;s idiosyncratic features on moral judgments.</p>

	<p>Orexin-A (OX-A) and orexin-B (OX-B) are neuropeptides produced in the hypothalamus. Preclinical and clinical studies suggest that depression and anxiety are associated with the orexin system. In the current study, we used the learned helplessness (LH) animal model of depression to identify rats displaying LH behaviors (LH rats) and those that did not (No-LH rats). We compared the number of orexin-containing neurons in the hypothalamus of LH, No-LH, and control rats. Orexin peptides, orexin receptor 1 (OXR1) and 2 (OXR2) in brain areas involved in major depression and serum OX-A and corticosterone (CORT) concentrations were quantified and compared between rat groups. We found that LH and No-LH rats displayed higher serum OX-A concentrations compared with control rats. Comparison between LH and No-LH rats revealed that No-LH rats had significantly higher OX-A levels in the brain, more OX-A neurons, and more OX-A neuron activation. LH rats had more OX-B neurons and more OX-B neuron activation. Orexin peptides and receptors in the brain areas involved in major depression exhibited different patterns in LH and NoLH rats. Our findings revealed that activation of OX-A neurons could promote resilient behaviors under stressful situations and OX-A and OX-B neuropeptides exhibit dissimilar functions in LH behaviors.</p>

	<p>For persons with Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease, the loss of autonomy in daily life leads to a high level of dependency on relatives&amp;amp;rsquo; support. Such dependency strongly correlates with high levels of perceived stress and psychosocial burden in informal caregivers. Global developments, such as demographic change and the associated thinning infrastructure in rural areas cause a continuously growing need for medical and nursing care. However, this need is not being adequately met. The resulting care gap is being made up by unpaid or underpaid work of informal caregivers. The double burden of care work and gainful employment creates enormous health-related impairments of the informal caregivers, so that they eventually become invisible patients themselves. Expectedly, those invisible patients do not receive the best care, leading to a decrease in quality of life and, in the end, to worse care for PD patients. Suggested solutions to relieve relatives, such as moving the person affected by Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s to a nursing home, often do not meet the wishes of patients and informal caregivers, nor does it appear as a structural solution in the light of demographic change against an economic background. Rather, it requires the development, implementation and evaluation of new, holistic approaches to care that make invisible patients visible.</p>

	<p>Cognitive network science is an emerging approach that uses the mathematical tools of network science to map the relationships among representations stored in memory to examine how that structure might influence processing. In the present study, we used computer simulations to compare the ability of a well-known model of spoken word recognition, TRACE, to the ability of a cognitive network model with a spreading activation-like process to account for the findings from several previously published behavioral studies of language processing. In all four simulations, the TRACE model failed to retrieve a sufficient number of words to assess if it could replicate the behavioral findings. The cognitive network model successfully replicated the behavioral findings in Simulations 1 and 2. However, in Simulation 3a, the cognitive network did not replicate the behavioral findings, perhaps because an additional mechanism was not implemented in the model. However, in Simulation 3b, when the decay parameter in spreadr was manipulated to model this mechanism the cognitive network model successfully replicated the behavioral findings. The results suggest that models of cognition need to take into account the multi-scale structure that exists among representations in memory, and how that structure can influence processing.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Internal affective states produce external manifestations such as facial expressions. In humans, the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) is widely used to objectively quantify the elemental facial action units (AUs) that build complex facial expressions. A similar system has been developed for macaque monkeys&mdash;the Macaque FACS (MaqFACS); yet, unlike the human counterpart, which is already partially replaced by automatic algorithms, this system still requires labor-intensive coding. Here, we developed and implemented the first prototype for automatic MaqFACS coding. We applied the approach to the analysis of behavioral and neural data recorded from freely interacting macaque monkeys. The method achieved high performance in the recognition of six dominant AUs, generalizing between conspecific individuals (<I>Macaca mulatta</I>) and even between species (<I>Macaca fascicularis</I>). The study lays the foundation for fully automated detection of facial expressions in animals, which is crucial for investigating the neural substrates of social and affective states.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>The local circuitry within olfactory bulb (OB) glomeruli filters, transforms, and facilitates information transfer from olfactory sensory neurons to bulb output neurons. Two key elements of this circuit are glutamatergic tufted cells (TCs) and GABAergic periglomerular (PG) cells, both of which actively shape mitral cell activity and bulb output. A subtype of TCs, the external TCs (eTCs), can synaptically excite PG cells, but there are unresolved questions about other aspects of the glomerular connections, including the extent of connectivity between eTCs and the precise nature of reciprocal interactions between TCs and PG cells. We combined patch-clamp recordings in OB slices and optophysiological tools to investigate local functional connections within glomeruli of mice and rats. When TCs that express cholecystokinin (CCK) were optically suppressed, excitatory inputs to "uniglomerular" PG cells that extend dendrites to one glomerulus were decreased, consistent with TC activation being required for most excitation of these PG cells. However, TC suppression had no effect on EPSCs in eTCs, arguing that TCs make few, if any, direct glutamatergic synaptic connections with eTCs. The absence of synaptic connections among eTCs was also supported by recordings in eTC pairs. Last, we show using similar optical suppression methods that GAD65-expressing PG cells, mainly uniglomerular cells, provide strong inhibition in eTCs. Our results imply that the local network of CCK-expressing TCs form potent reciprocal chemical synaptic connections with GAD65-expressing uniglomerular PG cells but not eTCs. This configuration favors local inhibition over recurrent excitation within a glomerulus, limiting its output.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Endothelial cells (ECs) are key players in the development and maintenance of the vascular tree, the establishment of the blood–brain barrier and control of blood flow. Disruption in ECs is an early and active component of vascular pathogenesis. However, our ability to selectively target ECs in the CNS for identification and manipulation is limited. Here, in the mouse retina, a tractable model of the CNS, we utilized a recently developed AAV-BR1 system to identify distinct classes of ECs along the vascular tree using a GFP reporter. We then developed an inducible EC-specific ectopic Connexin 43 (Cx43) expression system using AAV-BR1-CAG-DIO-Cx43-P2A-DsRed2 in combination with a mouse line carrying inducible CreERT2 in ECs. We targeted Cx43 because its loss has been implicated in microvascular impairment in numerous diseases such as diabetic retinopathy and vascular edema. GFP-labeled ECs were numerous, evenly distributed along the vascular tree and their morphology was polarized with respect to the direction of blood flow. After tamoxifen induction, ectopic Cx43 was specifically expressed in ECs. Similarly to endogenous Cx43, ectopic Cx43 was localized at the membrane contacts of ECs and it did not affect tight junction proteins. The ability to enhance gap junctions in ECs provides a precise and potentially powerful tool to treat microcirculation deficits, an early pathology in numerous diseases.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Cannabis use during pregnancy has increased over the past few decades, with recent data indicating that, in youth and young adults especially, up to 22% of people report using cannabis during pregnancy. Animal models provide the ability to study prenatal cannabis exposure (PCE) with control over timing and dosage; however, these studies utilize both injection and inhalation approaches. While it is known that Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC; primary psychoactive component of cannabis) can cross the placenta, examination of the transmission and concentration of THC and its metabolites from maternal blood into the placenta and fetal brain remains relatively unknown, and the influence of route of administration has never been examined. Pregnant female rats were exposed to either vaporized THC-dominant cannabis extract for pulmonary consumption or subcutaneous injection of THC repeatedly during the gestational period. Maternal blood, placenta, and fetal brains were collected following the final administration of THC for analysis of THC and its metabolites, as well as endocannabinoid concentrations, through mass spectrometry. Both routes of administration resulted in the transmission of THC and its metabolites in placenta and fetal brain. Repeated exposure to inhaled THC vapor resulted in fetal brain THC concentrations that were about 30% of those seen in maternal blood, whereas repeated injections resulted in roughly equivalent concentrations of THC in maternal blood and fetal brain. Neither inhalation nor injection of THC during pregnancy altered fetal brain endocannabinoid concentrations. Our data provide the first characterization of maternal-fetal transmission of THC and its metabolites following both vaporized delivery and injection routes of administration. These data are important to establish the maternal-fetal transmission in preclinical injection and inhalation models of PCE and may provide insight into predicting fetal exposure in human studies.</p>

<p>Normal brain aging is associated with decreased anti-inflammatory cytokine levels IL-10 and FGF-2, whereas several cytokines are elevated in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and MND. In particular, fibroblast growth factor-2 is elevated almost 10-fold in AD compared to controls and MND.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The role of increased brain inflammation in the development of neurodegenerative diseases is unclear. Here, we have compared cytokine changes in normal aging, motor neurone disease (MND), and Alzheimer's disease (AD). After an initial analysis, six candidate cytokines, interleukin (IL)- 4, 5, 6, 10, macrophage inhibitory protein (MIP)-1α, and fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-2, showing greatest changes were assayed in postmortem frozen human superior frontal gyri (<i>n</i> = 12) of AD patients, aging and young adult controls along with the precentral gyrus (<i>n</i> = 12) of MND patients. Healthy aging was associated with decreased anti-inflammatory IL-10 and FGF-2 levels. AD prefrontal cortex was associated with increased levels of IL-4, IL-5, and FGF-2, with the largest increase seen for FGF-2. Notwithstanding differences in the specific frontal lobe gyrus sampled, MND patients’ primary motor cortex (precentral gyrus) was associated with increased levels of IL-5, IL-6, IL-10, and FGF-2 compared to the aging prefrontal cortex (superior frontal gyrus). Immunocytochemistry showed that FGF-2 is expressed in neurons, astrocytes, and microglia in normal aging prefrontal cortex, AD prefrontal cortex, and MND motor cortex. We report that healthy aging and age-related neurodegenerative diseases have different cortical inflammatory signatures that are characterized by increased levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines and call into question the view that increased inflammation underlies the development of age-related neurodegenerative diseases.</p>

<p>The study provides evidence that long-term donepezil exposure is associated with greater regional amyloid and tau burden and worse cognitive performance among individuals with mild cognitive impairment by the <sup>18</sup>F-AV-1451 tau or <sup>18</sup>F-AV-45 amyloid PET images.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>This study aims to investigate the association between long-term donepezil treatment and brain neuropathological burden and cognitive function in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients. Preprocessed <sup>18</sup>F-AV-45 amyloid and <sup>18</sup>F-AV-1451 tau positron emission tomography (PET) images, magnetic resonance imaging images (MRIs), demographic information, and donepezil use status were downloaded from 255 MCI participants enrolled in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database. Partial volume correction was applied to all PET images. Structural MRIs were used for PET spatial normalization. Regions of interest (ROIs) were defined in standard space, and standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) images relative to the cerebellum were computed. Multiple linear regression with the least absolute shrinkage selector operator was performed to analyze the effect of long-term donepezil treatment on (a) the SUVR of each <sup>18</sup>F-AV-45 or <sup>18</sup>F-AV-1451 brain PET ROI after adjusting for age, sex, education, ApoE ε4 status, and AD-associated disease risk factors; and (b) cognitive performance after adjusting for age, sex education, ApoE ε4 status, AD-associated disease risk factors, and regional amyloid or tau burden. In adjusted models, long-term donepezil treatment was associated with greater amyloid load in the orbital frontal, superior frontal, parietal, posterior precuneus, posterior cingulate, lateral temporal, inferior temporal and fusiform regions, and tau burden in the posterior cingulate, entorhinal and parahippocampal gyrus. Long-term donepezil treatment was also associated with worse performance on the 13-item Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive subscale after adjusting for AD-related risk factors and regional brain amyloid or tau load. These results indicate that long-term donepezil treatment is associated with increased regional amyloid and tau burden and worse cognitive performance among individuals with MCI. Our study highlights the importance of using noninvasive and quantitative <sup>18</sup>F-AV-45 and <sup>18</sup>F-AV-1451 PET to elucidate the consequences of drug administration in AD studies.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Transcranial direct current stimulation of cerebellum alters spiking precision in cerebellar cortex: A modeling study of cellular responses</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Xu Zhang, Roeland Hancock, Sabato Santaniello</p>

Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) of the cerebellum has rapidly raised interest but the effects of tDCS on cerebellar neurons remain unclear. Assessing the cellular response to tDCS is challenging because of the uneven, highly stratified cytoarchitecture of the cerebellum, within which cellular morphologies, physiological properties, and function vary largely across several types of neurons. In this study, we combine MRI-based segmentation of the cerebellum and a finite element model of the tDCS-induced electric field (EF) inside the cerebellum to determine the field imposed on the cerebellar neurons throughout the region. We then pair the EF with multicompartment models of the Purkinje cell (PC), deep cerebellar neuron (DCN), and granule cell (GrC) and quantify the acute response of these neurons under various orientations, physiological conditions, and sequences of presynaptic stimuli. We show that cerebellar tDCS significantly modulates the postsynaptic spiking precision of the PC, which is expressed as a change in the spike count and timing in response to presynaptic stimuli. tDCS has modest effects, instead, on the PC tonic firing at rest and on the postsynaptic activity of DCN and GrC. In Purkinje cells, anodal tDCS shortens the repolarization phase following complex spikes (-14.7 ± 6.5% of baseline value, mean ± S.D.; max: -22.7%) and promotes burstiness with longer bursts compared to resting conditions. Cathodal tDCS, instead, promotes irregular spiking by enhancing somatic excitability and significantly prolongs the repolarization after complex spikes compared to baseline (+37.0 ± 28.9%, mean ± S.D.; max: +84.3%). tDCS-induced changes to the repolarization phase and firing pattern exceed 10% of the baseline values in Purkinje cells covering up to 20% of the cerebellar cortex, with the effects being distributed along the EF direction and concentrated in the area under the electrode over the cerebellum. Altogether, the acute effects of tDCS on cerebellum mainly focus on Purkinje cells and modulate the precision of the response to synaptic stimuli, thus having the largest impact when the cerebellar cortex is active. Since the spatiotemporal precision of the PC spiking is critical to learning and coordination, our results suggest cerebellar tDCS as a viable therapeutic option for disorders involving cerebellar hyperactivity such as ataxia.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Ten simple rules for creating a scientific web application</a></h4>

The use of scientific web applications (SWApps) across biological and environmental sciences has grown exponentially over the past decade or so. Although quantitative evidence for such increased use in practice is scant, collectively, we have observed that these tools become more commonplace in teaching, outreach, and in science coproduction (e.g., as decision support tools). Despite the increased popularity of SWApps, researchers often receive little or no training in creating such tools. Although rolling out SWApps can be a relatively simple and quick process using modern, popular platforms like R shiny apps or Tableau dashboards, making them useful, usable, and sustainable is not. These 10 simple rules for creating a SWApp provide a foundation upon which researchers with little to no experience in web application design and development can consider, plan, and carry out SWApp projects.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Noise-trained deep neural networks effectively predict human vision and its neural responses to challenging images</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Hojin Jang, Devin McCormack, Frank Tong</p>

Deep neural networks (DNNs) for object classification have been argued to provide the most promising model of the visual system, accompanied by claims that they have attained or even surpassed human-level performance. Here, we evaluated whether DNNs provide a viable model of human vision when tested with challenging noisy images of objects, sometimes presented at the very limits of visibility. We show that popular state-of-the-art DNNs perform in a qualitatively different manner than humans—they are unusually susceptible to spatially uncorrelated white noise and less impaired by spatially correlated noise. We implemented a noise training procedure to determine whether noise-trained DNNs exhibit more robust responses that better match human behavioral and neural performance. We found that noise-trained DNNs provide a better qualitative match to human performance; moreover, they reliably predict human recognition thresholds on an image-by-image basis. Functional neuroimaging revealed that noise-trained DNNs provide a better correspondence to the pattern-specific neural representations found in both early visual areas and high-level object areas. A layer-specific analysis of the DNNs indicated that noise training led to broad-ranging modifications throughout the network, with greater benefits of noise robustness accruing in progressively higher layers. Our findings demonstrate that noise-trained DNNs provide a viable model to account for human behavioral and neural responses to objects in challenging noisy viewing conditions. Further, they suggest that robustness to noise may be acquired through a process of visual learning.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Quantitative image analysis in COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome: a cohort observational study. [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a severe form of acute lung injury commonly associated with pneumonia, including coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19). The resultant effect can be persistent lung damage, but its extent is not known. We used quantitative high resolution computed tomography (QHR-CT) lung scans to radiographically characterize the lung damage in COVID-19 ARDS (CARDS) survivors. Methods Patients with CARDS (N=20) underwent QHR-CT lung scans 60 to 90 days after initial diagnosis, while hospitalized at a long-term acute care hospital (LTACH). QHR-CT assessed for mixed disease (QMD), ground glass opacities (QGGO), consolidation (QCON) and normal lung tissue (QNL). QMD was correlated with respiratory support on admission, tracheostomy decannulation and supplementary oxygen need on discharge. Results Sixteen patients arrived with tracheostomy requiring invasive mechanical ventilation. Four patients arrived on nasal oxygen support. Of the patients included in this study 10 had the tracheostomy cannula removed, four remained on invasive ventilation, and two died. QHR-CT showed 45% QMD, 28.1% QGGO, 3.0% QCON and QNL=23.9%. Patients with mandatory mechanical ventilation had the highest proportion of QMD when compared to no mechanical ventilation. There was no correlation between QMD and tracheostomy decannulation or need for supplementary oxygen at discharge. Conclusions Our data shows severe ongoing lung injury in patients with CARDS, beyond what is usually expected in ARDS. In this severely ill population, the extent of mixed disease correlates with mechanical ventilation, signaling formation of interstitial lung disease. QHR-CT analysis can be useful in the post-acute setting to evaluate for interstitial changes in ARDS.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Simulation framework for connected vehicles: a scoping review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: V2V (Vehicle-to-Vehicle) is a booming research field with a diverse set of services and applications. Most researchers rely on vehicular simulation tools to model traffic and road conditions and evaluate the performance of network protocols. We conducted a scoping review to consider simulators that have been reported in the literature based on successful implementation of V2V systems, tutorials, documentation, examples, and/or discussion groups. Methods: Simulators that have limited information were not included. The selected simulators are described individually and compared based on their requirements and features, i.e., origin, traffic model, scalability, and traffic features. This scoping review was reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR). The review considered only research published in English (in journals and conference papers) completed after 2015. Further, three reviewers initiated the data extraction phase to retrieve information from the published papers. Results: Most simulators can simulate system behaviour by modelling the events according to pre-defined scenarios. However, the main challenge faced is integrating the three components to simulate a road environment in either microscopic, macroscopic or mesoscopic models. These components include mobility generators, VANET simulators and network simulators. These simulators require the integration and synchronisation of the transportation domain and the communication domain. Simulation modelling can be run using a different types of simulators that are cost-effective and scalable for evaluating the performance of V2V systems in urban environments. In addition, we also considered the ability of the vehicular simulation tools to support wireless sensors. Conclusions: The outcome of this study may reduce the time required for other researchers to work on other applications involving V2V systems and as a reference for the study and development of new traffic simulators.

                Background: Since adsorption is a complex process, numerous models and theories have been devised to gain general understanding of its underlying mechanisms. The interaction between the adsorbates and adsorbents can be identified via modelling of the adsorption data with different adsorption isotherms as well as kinetic models. Many studies are also focused on developing predictive modelling techniques to facilitate accurate prediction of future adsorption trends. Methods: In this study, a predictive model was developed based on a multiple linear regression technique using existing data of As(V) adsorption onto several coated and uncoated magnetite samples. To understand the mechanisms and interactions involved, the data was first modelled using either Temkin or Freundlich linear isotherms.  The predicted value is a single data point extension from the training data set. Subsequently, the predicted outcome and the experimental values were compared using multiple error functions to assess the predictive model’s performance. Results: In addition, certain values were compared to that obtained from the literature, and the results were found to have low error margins. Conclusion: To further gauge the effectiveness of the proposed model in accurately predicting future adsorption trends, it should be further tested on different adsorbent and adsorbate combinations.

                Background: Lockdown due to Covid-19 pandemic brought deep changes to the daily lives of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), greatly increasing their amount of time spent at home. Methods: A cohort of 243 parents of children with ASD (2-15 years old) completed an original online survey regarding the child’s screen time and the modification of the ASD symptomatology during lockdown to investigate the relationship between them. Results: The data show that high solitary screen time is related with the worsening of ASD core symptoms. Conclusions: This study may help to increase awareness in the excessive use of screen in children with ASD during the lockdown, both during the pandemic as well as after it ends.

                Background: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a global public health problem. To avoid disease complications, diabetic patients have to control their blood glucose and maintain a healthy lifestyle including a healthy diet, weight control, moderate exercise, and smoking cessation. Methods: This study aimed to survey sleep, eating, and exercise behaviors of diabetic patients in Bang Rakam district, a rural community in Phitsanulok province, Thailand. The data on sleep and other health behaviors were taken from 1,385 T2DM patients and 1,394 non-T2DM controls, who were aged 30 - 85 years and were free from other chronic diseases. The data were collected using a structured questionnaire. Results: Compared to the control group, the diabetes group had a significantly higher body mass index (BMI).  However, fewer of them were found to smoke cigarettes and drink alcohol. Most of the participants were ‘morning people’ who slept 7-9 hours per day. It was found that sleep ≥8 hours increased the risk of diabetes among women (OR = 1.27, 95% CI 1.03 - 1.56). The diabetes group reported eating chicken and vegetables more than the control group. They also avoided eating beef and eating more than a cup of rice per meal. However, the T2DM group did fewer physical activities, such as walking, biking, or playing sports, during their leisure time. Conclusions: Compared to the control group, diabetic patients in a rural community of Thailand had healthier sleep, lifestyle, and eating behaviors but not healthier exercise behaviors, especially among obese women. Diabetes prevention programs should emphasize and promote weight control and increasing levels of exercise.

                Zutshi et al. perform simultaneous silencing of major afferents into the hippocampal CA1 to address whether CA1 spiking can be sustained by local computations. These manipulations reveal that coordinated CA1 place cell assemblies persist with minimal input but that each input has distinct effects on spatial tuning and field potentials.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A helicase-tethered ORC flip enables bidirectional helicase loading</a></h4>

              
                Replication origins are licensed by loading two Mcm2‑7 helicases around DNA in a head-to-head conformation poised to initiate bidirectional replication. This process requires ORC, Cdc6, and Cdt1. Although different Cdc6 and Cdt1 molecules load each helicase, whether two ORC proteins are required is unclear. Using colocalization single-molecule spectroscopy combined with FRET, we investigated interactions between ORC and Mcm2‑7 during helicase loading. In the large majority of events, we observed a single ORC molecule recruiting both Mcm2‑7/Cdt1 complexes via similar interactions that end upon Cdt1 release. Between first and second helicase recruitment, a rapid change in interactions between ORC and the first Mcm2-7 occurs. Within seconds, ORC breaks the interactions mediating first Mcm2-7 recruitment, releases from its initial DNA-binding site, and forms a new interaction with the opposite face of the first Mcm2-7. This rearrangement requires release of the first Cdt1 and tethers ORC as it flips over the first Mcm2-7 to form an inverted Mcm2‑7-ORC-DNA complex required for second-helicase recruitment. To ensure correct licensing, this complex is maintained until head-to-head interactions between the two helicases are formed. Our findings reconcile previous observations and reveal a highly-coordinated series of events through which a single ORC molecule can load two oppositely-oriented helicases.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Dopamine enhances model-free credit assignment through boosting of retrospective model-based inference</a></h4>

              
                Dopamine is implicated in representing model-free (MF) reward prediction errors a as well as influencing model-based (MB) credit assignment and choice. Putative cooperative interactions between MB and MF systems include a guidance of MF credit assignment by MB inference. Here, we used a double-blind, placebo-controlled, within-subjects design to test an hypothesis that enhancing dopamine levels boosts the guidance of MF credit assignment by MB inference. In line with this, we found that levodopa enhanced guidance of MF credit assignment by MB inference, without impacting MF and MB influences directly. This drug effect correlated negatively with a dopamine-dependent change in purely MB credit assignment, possibly reflecting a trade-off between these two MB components of behavioural control. Our findings of a dopamine boost in MB inference guidance of MF learning highlights a novel DA influence on MB-MF cooperative interactions.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">How the insect central complex could coordinate multimodal navigation</a></h4>

              
                The central complex of the insect midbrain is thought to coordinate insect guidance strategies. Computational models can account for specific behaviours but their applicability across sensory and task domains remains untested. Here we assess the capacity of our previous model (Sun et al., 2020) of visual navigation to generalise to olfactory navigation and its coordination with other guidance in flies and ants. We show that fundamental to this capacity is the use of a biologically-plausible neural copy-and-shift mechanism that ensures sensory information is presented in a format compatible with the insect steering circuit regardless of its source. Moreover, the same mechanism is shown to allow the transfer cues from unstable/egocentric to stable/geocentric frames of reference providing a first account of the mechanism by which foraging insects robustly recover from environmental disturbances. We propose that these circuits can be flexibly repurposed by different insect navigators to address their unique ecological needs.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Cytoplasmic dynein-1 cargo diversity is mediated by the combinatorial assembly of FTS-Hook-FHIP complexes</a></h4>

              
                In eukaryotic cells, intracellular components are organized by the microtubule motors cytoplasmic dynein-1 (dynein) and kinesins, which are linked to cargos via adaptor proteins. While ~40 kinesins transport cargo toward the plus end of microtubules, a single dynein moves cargo in the opposite direction. How dynein transports a wide variety of cargos remains an open question. The FTS-Hook-FHIP ('FHF') cargo adaptor complex links dynein to cargo in mammals and fungi. As human cells have three Hooks and four FHIP proteins, we hypothesized that the combinatorial assembly of different Hook and FHIP proteins could underlie dynein cargo diversity. Using proteomic approaches, we determine the protein 'interactome' of each FHIP protein. Live-cell imaging and biochemical approaches show that different FHF complexes associate with distinct motile cargos. These complexes also move with dynein and its cofactor dynactin in single-molecule in vitro reconstitution assays. Complexes composed of FTS, FHIP1B, and Hook1/Hook3 co-localize with Rab5-tagged early endosomes via a direct interaction between FHIP1B and GTP-bound Rab5. In contrast, complexes composed of FTS, FHIP2A and Hook2 colocalize with Rab1A-tagged ER-to-Golgi cargos and FHIP2A is involved in the motility of Rab1A tubules. Our findings suggest that combinatorial assembly of different FTS-Hook-FHIP complexes is one mechanism dynein uses to achieve cargo specificity.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">ZAF, the first open source fully automated feeder for aquatic facilities</a></h4>

              
                In the past few decades, aquatic animals have become popular model organisms in biology, spurring a growing need for establishing aquatic facilities. Zebrafish are widely studied and relatively easy to culture using commercial systems. However, a challenging aspect of maintaining aquatic facilities is animal feeding, which is both time- and resourceconsuming. We have developed an open-source fully automatic daily feeding system, Zebrafish Automatic Feeder (ZAF). ZAF is reliable, provides a standardized amount of food to every tank, is cost-efficient and easy to build. The advanced version, ZAF+, allows for the precise control of food distribution as a function of fish density per tank, and has a user-friendly interface. Both ZAF and ZAF+ are adaptable to any laboratory environment and facilitate the implementation of aquatic colonies. Here we provide all blueprints and instructions for building the mechanics, electronics, fluidics, as well as to setup the control software and its user-friendly graphical interface. Importantly, the design is modular and can be scaled to meet different user needs. Furthermore, our results show that ZAF and ZAF+ do not adversely affect zebrafish culture, enabling fully automatic feeding for any aquatic facility.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Bidirectional synaptic plasticity rapidly modifies hippocampal representations</a></h4>

              
                Learning requires neural adaptations thought to be mediated by activity-dependent synaptic plasticity. A relatively non-standard form of synaptic plasticity driven by dendritic calcium spikes, or plateau potentials, has been reported to underlie place field formation in rodent hippocampal CA1 neurons. Here we found that this behavioral timescale synaptic plasticity (BTSP) can also reshape existing place fields via bidirectional synaptic weight changes that depend on the temporal proximity of plateau potentials to pre-existing place fields. When evoked near an existing place field, plateau potentials induced less synaptic potentiation and more depression, suggesting BTSP might depend inversely on postsynaptic activation. However, manipulations of place cell membrane potential and computational modeling indicated that this anti-correlation actually results from a dependence on current synaptic weight such that weak inputs potentiate and strong inputs depress. A network model implementing this bidirectional synaptic learning rule suggested that BTSP enables population activity, rather than pairwise neuronal correlations, to drive neural adaptations to experience.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Reverting the mode of action of the mitochondrial FOF1-ATPase by Legionella pneumophila preserves its replication niche</a></h4>

              
                <i>Legionella pneumophila</i>, the causative agent of Legionnaires'; disease, a severe pneumonia, injects <i>via</i> a type-IV-secretion-system (T4SS) more than 300 proteins into macrophages, its main host cell in humans. Certain of these proteins are implicated in reprogramming the metabolism of infected cells by reducing mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) early after infection. Here we show that despite reduced OXPHOS, the mitochondrial membrane potential (Δ<i>ψ</i><sub>m</sub>) is maintained during infection of primary human monocyte-derived macrophages (hMDMs). We reveal that <i>L. pneumophila</i> reverses the ATP-synthase activity of the mitochondrial F<sub>O</sub>F<sub>1</sub>-ATPase to ATP-hydrolase activity in a T4SS-dependent manner, which leads to a conservation of the Δ<i>ψ</i><sub>m</sub>, preserves mitochondrial polarization and prevents macrophage cell death. Analyses of T4SS effectors known to target mitochondrial functions revealed that <i>Lp</i>Spl is partially involved in conserving the Δ<i>ψ</i><sub>m</sub>, but not LncP and MitF. The inhibition of the <i>L. pneumophila</i>-induced 'reverse mode' of the F<sub>O</sub>F<sub>1</sub>-ATPase collapsed the Δ<i>ψ</i><sub>m</sub> and caused cell death in infected cells. Single-cell analyses suggested that bacterial replication occurs preferentially in hMDMs that conserved the Δ<i>ψ</i><sub>m</sub> and showed delayed cell death. This direct manipulation of the mode of activity of the F<sub>O</sub>F<sub>1</sub>-ATPase is a newly identified feature of <i>L. pneumophila</i> allowing to delay host cell death and thereby to preserve the bacterial replication niche during infection.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Task Demands Change Motion Information Coding in Area MT of the Macaque</a></h4>

              
                Neurons in the primate Middle Temporal (MT) area signal information about visual motion and work together with the lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) to support memory-guided comparisons of visual motion direction. These areas are reciprocally connected and both contain neurons that signal visual motion direction in the strength of their responses. Previously, LPFC was shown to display marked changes in stimulus coding with altered task demands. Since MT and LPFC work together, we sought to determine if MT neurons display similar changes with heightened task demands. We hypothesized that heightened working-memory task demands would improve the task-relevant information and precipitate memory-related signals in MT. Here we show that engagement in a motion direction comparison task altered non-sensory activity and improved stimulus encoding by MT neurons. We found that this improvement in stimulus information transmission was largely due to preferential reduction in trial-to-trial variability within a sub-population of highly direction-selective neurons. We also found that a divisive normalization mechanism accounted for seemingly contradictory effects of task-demands on a heterogeneous population of neurons.

                Human cellular models of neurodegeneration require reproducibility and longevity, which is necessary for simulating these age-dependent diseases. Such systems are particularly needed for TDP-43 proteinopathies, which involve human-specific mechanisms that cannot be directly studied in animal models. To explore the emergence and consequences of TDP-43 pathologies, we generated iPSC-derived, colony morphology neural stem cells (iCoMoNSCs) via manual selection of neural precursors. Single-cell transcriptomics (scRNA-seq) and comparison to independent NSCs, showed that iCoMoNSCs are uniquely homogenous and self-renewing. Differentiated iCoMoNSCs formed a self-organized multicellular system consisting of synaptically connected and electrophysiologically active neurons, which matured into long-lived functional networks. Neuronal and glial maturation in iCoMoNSC-derived cultures was similar to that of cortical organoids. Overexpression of wild-type TDP-43 in a minority of iCoMoNSC-derived neurons led to progressive fragmentation and aggregation, resulting in loss of function and neurotoxicity. scRNA-seq revealed a novel set of misregulated RNA targets coinciding in both TDP-43 overexpressing neurons and patient brains exhibiting loss of nuclear TDP-43. The strongest misregulated target encoded for the synaptic protein NPTX2, which was consistently misaccumulated in ALS and FTLD patient neurons with TDP-43 pathology. Our work directly links TDP-43 misregulation and NPTX2 accumulation, thereby highlighting a new pathway of neurotoxicity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Directional Tuning of Phase Precession Properties in the Hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                Running direction in the hippocampus is encoded by rate modulations of place field activity but also by spike timing correlations known as theta sequences. Whether directional rate codes and the directionality of place field correlations are related, however, has so far not been explored and therefore the nature of how directional information is encoded in the cornu ammonis remains unresolved. Here, using a previously published dataset that contains the spike activity of rat hippocampal place cells in the CA1, CA2 and CA3 subregions during free foraging of male Long-Evans rats in a 2D environment, we found that rate and spike timing codes are related. Opposite to a place field's preferred firing rate direction spikes are more likely to undergo theta phase precession and, hence, more strongly impact paired correlations. Furthermore, we identified a subset of field pairs whose theta correlations are intrinsic in that they maintain the same firing order when the running direction is reversed. Both effects are associated with differences in theta phase distributions, and are more prominent in CA3 than CA1. We thus hypothesize that intrinsic spiking is most prominent when the directionally modulated sensory-motor drive of hippocampal firing rates is minimal, suggesting that extrinsic and intrinsic sequences contribute to phase precession as two distinct mechanisms.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Early neural activity changes associated with visual conscious perception</a></h4>

              
                The neural mechanisms of visual conscious perception have been investigated for decades. However, the spatiotemporal dynamics associated with the earliest neural responses following consciously perceived stimuli are still poorly understood. Using a dataset of intracranial EEG recordings, the current study aims to investigate the neural activity changes associated with the earliest stages of visual conscious perception. Subjects (N=10, 1,693 grey matter electrode contacts) completed a continuous performance task in which individual letters were presented in series and subjects were asked to press a button when they saw a target letter. Broadband gamma power (40-115Hz) dynamics were analyzed in comparison to baseline prior to stimulus and contrasted for target trials with button presses and non-target trials without button presses. Regardless of event type, we observed early gamma power changes within 30-150 ms from stimulus onset in a network including increases in bilateral occipital, fusiform, frontal (including frontal eye fields), and medial temporal cortex, increases in left lateral parietal-temporal cortex, and decreases in the right anterior medial occipital cortex. No significant differences were observed between target and non-target stimuli until >150 ms post-stimulus, when we saw greater gamma power increases in left motor and premotor areas, suggesting a possible role of these later signals in perceptual decision making and/or motor responses with the right hand. The early gamma power findings suggest a broadly distributed cortical visual detection network that is engaged at early times tens of milliseconds after signal transduction from the retina.

                Bayesian models of autism suggest that disruptions in context-sensitive prediction error weighting may underpin sensory perceptual alterations, such as hypersensitivities. We used an auditory oddball paradigm with pure tones arising from high or low uncertainity contexts to determine whether autistic individuals display differences in context adjustment relative to neurotypicals. We did not find group differences in early prediction error responses indexed by mismatch negativity. However, the autism group had larger evoked responses to outliers, at 300ms latency suggesting a greater reorienting of attention to surprising sounds. A dimensional approach revealed a positive correlation between context-dependent prediction errors and auditory sensitivities, but not with autistic traits. These findings suggest that autism studies may benefit from accounting for sensory sensitivities in group comparisons.

                Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are lipid bilayer enclosed structures that not only represent a newly discovered means for cell-to-cell communication but may also serve as promising disease biomarkers and therapeutic tools. Apart from proteins, lipids, and metabolites, EVs can deliver genetic information such as mRNA eliciting a response in the recipient cells. In the present study, we have analyzed the mRNA content of brain-derived EVs (BDEVs) isolated 72 hours after experimental stroke in mice and compared them to controls (shams) using the nCounter(R) Nanostring panels, with or without prior RNA isolation from BDEVs. We found that both panels show similar results when comparing upregulated mRNA in stroke. Notably, the higher upregulated mRNAs were related to processes of stress and immune system responses, but also to anatomical structure development, cell differentiation, and extracellular matrix organization, indicating that regenerative mechanisms are already taking place at this time-point. The five top overexpressed mRNAs in stroke mice compared to shams were confirmed by RT-qPCR and, interestingly, were found to be present as full-length open-reading frame in BDEVs. We could reveal that the majority of the mRNA cargo in BDEVs was of microglial origin and probably predominantly present in small BDEVs ([&le;]200 nm in diameter). However, the EV population with the highest increase in the total BDEVs pool at 72 h after stroke was of oligodendrocytic origin. Our study shows that nCounter(R) panels are a good tool to study mRNA content in tissue-derived EVs as they can be carried out even without previous mRNA isolation and that the mRNA cargo of BDEVs indicates their participation in inflammatory but also recovery processes after stroke.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Novel and known transcriptional targets of ALS/FTD protein TDP-43: Meta-analysis and interactive graphical databases</a></h4>

              
                TDP-43 proteinopathy is the major pathological hallmark of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and tau-negative frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Mounting evidence implicates a loss of normal TDP-43 function in neurodegeneration, either resultant from or independent of TDP-43 aggregation. TDP-43 knockdown is therefore a common paradigm for modelling ALS and FTD. However, because TDP-43 can interact directly with thousands of mRNA targets and regulate the function of other RNA binding proteins, the phenotype of TDP-43 depletion is likely to differ depending on the proteomic and transcriptomic profile of the model cell type. Here, we conducted a meta-analysis of publicly available RNA-sequencing datasets that utilized TDP-43 knockdown to model ALS or FTD, and validated these against RNA-sequencing data from TDP-43-immunonegative neuronal nuclei from ALS/FTD brain. We present these analyses as easy-to-use interactive graphical databases. Of 9 TDP-43-knockdown datasets identified, 4 showed significant depletion of TARDBP (human HeLa and SH-SY5Y cell lines, induced human motor neurons, and mouse striatal tissue). There was little overlap in differentially expressed genes between TDP-43-knockdown model cell types, but PFKP, RANBP1, KIAA1324, ELAVL3, and STMN2 were among the common TDP-43 targets. Of these, only STMN2 was validated as a differentially expressed gene in TDP-43-immunonegative neuronal nuclei in ALS/FTD brain. Similarly, there were few genes that showed common patterns of differential exon usage between cell types and which validated in TDP-43-immunonegative neurons, but these included well-known targets POLDIP3, RANBP1, STMN2, and UNC13A, and novel targets EXD3, CEP290, KPNA4, and MMAB. Enrichment analysis showed that TDP-43 knockdown in different cell types affected a unique range of biological pathways. Together, these data identify novel TDP-43 targets, validate known TDP-43 targets, and show that TDP-43 plays both conserved and cell-type-specific roles in the regulation of gene expression and splicing. Identification of cell-type-specific TDP-43 targets will enable sensitive mapping of cell-autonomous TDP-43 dysfunction beyond just neurons, while shared TDP-43 targets are likely to have therapeutic value across myriad cell types.

                2-arachidonoyl-glycerol (2-AG), the most abundant endocannabinoid (eCB) in the brain, regulates diverse neural functions. However, whether 2-AG deficiency contributes to Parkinson's disease (PD) and nigral dopaminergic neurons (DANs) dysfunction is unclear. Diacylglycerol lipase A and B (DAGLA and DAGLB) mediate the biosynthesis of 2-AG. Using homozygosity mapping and whole-exome sequencing, we linked multiple homozygous loss-of-function mutations in DAGLB to a form of early-onset autosomal recessive PD. We then used RNA sequencing and fiber photometry with genetically encoded eCB sensors to demonstrate that DAGLB is the main 2-AG synthase in nigral DANs. Genetic knockdown of Daglb by CRISPR/Cas9 in mouse nigral DANs substantially reduces 2-AG levels in the substantia nigra (SN). The SN 2-AG levels are markedly correlated with the vigor of movement during the acquisition of motor skills, while Daglb-deficiency impairs motor learning. Conversely, pharmacological enhancement of 2-AG levels increases nigral DAN activity and dopamine release and improves motor learning. Together, we demonstrate that DAGLB-deficiency contributes to the etiopathogenesis of PD, reveal the importance of DAGLB-mediated 2-AG biosynthesis in nigral DANs in regulating neural activity and dopamine release, and provide preclinical evidence for the beneficial effects of 2-AG augmentation in PD treatment.

                Dopamine facilitates approach to reward via its actions on dopamine receptors in the nucleus accumbens. For example, blocking either D1 or D2 dopamine receptors in the accumbens reduces the proportion of reward-predictive cues to which rats respond with cued approach. Recent evidence indicates that accumbens dopamine also promotes wakefulness and arousal, but the relationship between dopamine's roles in arousal and reward seeking remains unexplored. Here, we show that the ability of systemic or intra-accumbens injections of the D1 antagonist SCH23390 to reduce cued approach to reward depends on the animal's state of arousal. Handling the animal, a manipulation known to increase arousal, was sufficient to reverse the behavioral effects of the antagonist. In addition, SCH23390 reduced spontaneous locomotion and increased time spent in sleep postures, both consistent with reduced arousal, but also increased time spent immobile in postures inconsistent with sleep. In contrast, the ability of the D2 antagonist haloperidol to reduce cued approach was not reversible by handling. Haloperidol reduced spontaneous locomotion but did not increase sleep postures, instead increasing immobility in non-sleep postures. We place these results in the context of the extensive literature on dopamine's contributions to behavior, and propose the arousal-motor hypothesis, a novel synthesis that accounts both for our findings and many previous results that have drawn disparate and conflicting conclusions.

                Serotonin (5-Hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) 2A receptor (5-HT2AR) signaling is essential for the actions of classical psychedelic drugs. In this study, we examined whether random sequence variations in the gene (single nucleotide polymorphisms, SNPs) encoding the 5-HT2AR affect the signaling of four commonly used psychedelic drugs. We examined the in vitro pharmacology of seven non-synonymous SNPs, which give rise to S12N, T25N, D48N, I197V, A230T, A447V, and H452Y variant 5-HT2A serotonin receptors. We found that these non-synonymous SNPs exert statistically significant, although modest, effects on the efficacy and potency of four therapeutically relevant hallucinogens. Significantly, the in vitro pharmacological effects of the SNPs drug actions at 5-HT2AR are drug specific.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Escape Steering by Cholecystokinin Peptidergic Signaling</a></h4>

              
                Escape is an evolutionarily conserved and essential avoidance response. Considered to be innate, most studies on escape responses focused on hard-wired circuits. We report here that peptidergic signaling is an integral and necessary component of the Caenorhabditis elegans escape circuit. Combining genetic screening, electrophysiology, and calcium imaging, we reveal that a neuropeptide NLP-18 and its cholecystokinin receptor CKR-1 enable the escape circuit to execute a full omega turn, the last motor step where the animal robustly steers away from its original trajectory. We demonstrate in vivo and in vitro that CKR-1 is a Gq protein-coupled receptor for NLP-18. in vivo, NLP-18 is mainly secreted by the gustatory sensory neuron (ASI) to activate CKR-1 in the head motor neuron (SMD) and the turn-initiating interneuron (AIB). Removal of NLP-18, removal of CKR-1, or specific knockdown of CKR-1 in SMD or AIB neurons lead to shallower turns hence less robust escape steering. Consistently, the Ca2+ transients elevation of head motor neuron SMD during escape steering is attenuated upon the removal of NLP-18 or CKR-1. in vitro, synthetic NLP-18 directly evokes CKR-1-dependent currents in oocytes and CKR-1-dependent Ca2+ transients in SMD. Thus, cholecystokinin signaling modulates an escape circuit to generate robust escape steering.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A striatal circuit balances learned fear in the presence and absence of sensory cues</a></h4>

              
                During fear learning, defensive behaviors need to be finely balanced, to allow animals to return to normal behaviors after the termination of threat-indicating sensory cues. Nevertheless, the circuits underlying such balancing are largely unknown. Here, we investigate the role of direct (D1R+) - and indirect (Adora+) pathway neurons of the amygdala-striatal transition zone (AStria) in fear learning. In-vivo Ca2+ imaging revealed that fear learning increased the responses of D1R+ AStria neurons to an auditory CS, given that the animal moved. In Adora+ neurons, fear learning also induced a differential activity during freezing and movement, albeit with little influence of the CS. In-vivo optogenetic silencing during the training day showed that plasticity in D1R+ AStria neurons contributes to auditory-cued fear memories, whereas Adora+ neurons suppressed learned freezing when no CS was present. Circuit tracing experiments identified cortical input structures to the AStria, and recording of optogenetically-evoked EPSCs at the corresponding projection revealed different forms of long-term plasticity at synapses onto D1R+ and Adora+ AStria neurons. Taken together, direct- and indirect pathways neurons of the AStria show differential signs of in-vivo and ex-vivo plasticity after fear learning, and balance defensive behaviors in the presence and absence of aversively motivated sensory cues.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Drosulfakinin signaling modulates female sexual receptivity in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Female sexual behavior as an innate behavior is of prominent biological importance for survival and reproduction. However, molecular and circuit mechanisms underlying female sexual behavior is not well understood. Here, we identify the Cholecystokinin-like peptide Drosulfakinin (DSK) promotes female sexual behavior in Drosophila. Manipulation both Dsk and DSK neuronal activity impact female sexual receptivity. In addition, we reveal that Dsk-expressing neurons receive input signal from R71G01GAL4 neurons to promote female sexual receptivity. Based on intersectional technique, we further found the regulation of female sexual behavior relies mainly on medial DSK neurons rather than lateral DSK neurons, and medial DSK neurons modulate female sexual behavior by acting on its receptor CCKLR-17D3. Thus, we characterized DSK/CCKLR-17D3 as R71G01GAL4 neurons downstream signaling to regulate female sexual behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Drosophila gustatory projections are segregated by taste modality and connectivity</a></h4>

              
                Gustatory sensory neurons detect caloric and harmful compounds in potential food and convey this information to the brain to inform feeding decisions. To examine the signals that gustatory neurons transmit and receive, we reconstructed gustatory axons and their synaptic sites in the adult Drosophila melanogaster brain, utilizing a whole-brain electron microscopy volume. We reconstructed 87 gustatory projections from the proboscis labellum in the right hemisphere and 57 in the left, representing the majority of labellar gustatory axons. Morphology- and connectivity-based clustering revealed six distinct clusters, likely representing neurons recognizing different taste modalities. Gustatory neurons contain a nearly equal number of interspersed pre-and post-synaptic sites, with extensive synaptic connectivity among gustatory axons. The vast majority of synaptic connections are between morphologically similar neurons, although connections also exist between distinct neuronal subpopulations. This study resolves the anatomy of labellar gustatory projections, reveals that gustatory projections are likely segregated based on taste modality, and uncovers synaptic connections that may alter the transmission of gustatory signals.
