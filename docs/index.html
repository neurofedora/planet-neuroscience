              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Nr2f1-dependent shaping of mitochondrial architecture in newborn mouse hippocampal neurons unravels novel insights into the neurodevelopmental disorder BBSOAS</a></h4>

              
                The nuclear receptor Nr2f1, also known as COUP-TFI, plays a key role during cortical development by acting as a strong transcriptional regulator in embryonic and adult neural cells. In humans, NR2F1 mutations cause the Bosch-Boonstra-Schaaf optic atrophy-intellectual syndrome (BBSOAS), a rare neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by multiple clinical features including optic nerve atrophy, cerebral visual impairment, seizures, intellectual disability, and autistic traits. Moreover, alterations in mitochondrial energy supply have been recently reported in some BBSOAS patients. Although mitochondrial dysfunction is increasingly implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders, whether and how Nr2f1 can regulate mitochondria function in neural cells is still completely unknown. To address these questions, we have combined genome-wide and in silico analyses with mouse genetics, neuroanatomical and imaging approaches. First, we found that key factors for mitochondrial function and dynamics represent potential genomic targets under direct Nr2f1 transcriptional control in neurons. To genetically manipulate Nr2f1 function in a restricted neuronal population, we focused on the adult mouse hippocampal dentate gyrus, a site of persistent neurogenesis in rodents and where Nr2f1 is highly expressed. We showed that both loss- and gain-of-function of Nr2f1 within the hippocampal neurogenic niche led to altered mitochondrial architecture in newborn neurons likely reflecting alteration in mitochondrial dynamics. Lastly, we identified the fusion factor Mfn2 as a putative Nr2f1 target and demonstrated its downregulation following both Nr2f1 adult depletion and embryonic haploinsufficiency in mice. Overall, our study provides the first evidence of a significant role of Nr2f1 in shaping mitochondrial architecture in neurons and opens a promising avenue for the identification of new mechanisms implicated in BBSOAS pathogenesis involving mitochondrial dysfunction.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Fast-synaptic axo-axonal transmission from striatal cholinergic interneurons onto dopamine fibers.</a></h4>

              
                Transmission from striatal cholinergic interneurons (CINs) controls dopamine release through nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) on dopaminergic axons. Anatomical studies suggest that cholinergic terminals signal predominantly through non-synaptic volume transmission. However, the influence of cholinergic transmission on electrical signaling in axons remains unclear. We examined axo-axonal transmission from CINs onto dopaminergic axons using perforated-patch recordings which revealed rapid spontaneous EPSPs with properties characteristic of fast synapses. Pharmacology showed that axonal EPSPs (axEPSPs) were mediated primarily by high-affinity 6-containing receptors. Remarkably, axEPSPs triggered spontaneous action potentials locally in dopaminergic axons, suggesting these axons perform integration to convert synaptic input into spiking, a function associated with somatodendritic compartments. We investigated cross-species validity of cholinergic axo-axonal transmission by recording dopaminergic axons in macaque putamen and found similar axEPSPs. Thus, we reveal that fast synaptic-like neurotransmission underlies cholinergic signaling onto dopaminergic axons, providing insight into how nicotinic receptors shape electrical signaling directly in axon terminals.

	<p>Cognitive difficulties are well documented in developmental dyslexia but they present a challenge to dyslexia theory. In this paper, the Model of the Control of Action is proposed as a theoretical explanation of how and why deficits in both automaticity and executive abilities are apparent in the cognitive profiles of dyslexia and how these deficits might relate to literacy difficulties. This theoretical perspective is used to consider evidence from different cognitive domains. The neuroanatomical underpinnings of automaticity and executive abilities are then discussed in relation to the understanding of dyslexia. Links between reading, writing, and executive function are considered. The reviewed evidence suggests that dyslexia theory should consider an interaction between procedural learned behaviour (automaticity) and higher-order (executive) abilities. The capacity to handle environmental interference, develop and engage adaptive strategies accordingly, and plan actions all require interactions between the cerebellum and the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Difficulties in these areas might explain both impairments in the cumulative development of literacy skills in childhood and general task management in everyday life in adulthood. It is suggested that improved measures are required to assess this cerebellar&amp;amp;ndash;PFC interaction and to allow early identification of future literacy difficulties, allowing implementation of timely interventions and reasonable adjustments.</p>

     alt="Molecular cell identities in the mediodorsal thalamus of infant mice and marmoset"/>
<p>The mediodorsal thalamus (MD) can be divided into three distinctive regions, which project to the different cortical areas. Here we searched for subdivision-specific molecular markers in developing mouse MD thalamus. We made an MD region-specific Cre mouse line based on this search, which clearly shows specific projections to PrL/IL and AID in PFC. Further, we showed molecular organization in developing common marmoset, which showed dynamic expression differences compared to mouse MD, suggesting diverse MD function and connectivity in different species.
</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The mediodorsal thalamus (MD) is a higher-order nucleus located within the central thalamus in many mammalian species. Emerging evidence from MD lesions and tracer injections suggests that the MD is reciprocally connected to the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and plays an essential role in specific cognitive processes and tasks. MD subdivisions (medial, central, and lateral) are poorly segregated at the molecular level in rodents, leading to a lack of MD subdivision-specific <i>Cre</i> driver mice. Moreover, this lack of molecular identifiers hinders MD subdivision- and cell-type-specific circuit formation and function analysis. Therefore, using publicly available databases, we explored molecules separately expressed in MD subdivisions. In addition to MD subdivision markers, we identified several genes expressed in a subdivision-specific combination and classified them. Furthermore, after developing medial MD (MDm) or central MD (MDc) region-specific <i>Cre</i> mouse lines, we identified diverse region- and layer-specific PFC projection patterns. Comparison between classified MD marker genes in mice and common marmosets, a nonhuman primate model, revealed diverging gene expression patterns. These results highlight the species-specific organization of cell types and their projections in the MD thalamus.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Attention promotes the selection of behaviorally relevant sensory signals from the barrage of sensory information available. Visual attention modulates the gain of neuronal activity in all visual brain areas examined, although magnitudes of gain modulations vary across areas. For example, attention gain magnitudes in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and primary visual cortex (V1) vary tremendously across fMRI measurements in humans and electrophysiological recordings in behaving monkeys. We sought to determine whether these discrepancies are due simply to differences in species or measurement, or more nuanced properties unique to each visual brain area. We also explored whether robust and consistent attention effects, comparable to those measured in humans with fMRI, are observable in the LGN or V1 of monkeys. We measured attentional modulation of multiunit activity in the LGN and V1 of macaque monkeys engaged in a contrast change detection task requiring shifts in covert visual spatial attention. Rigorous analyses of LGN and V1 multiunit activity revealed robust and consistent attentional facilitation throughout V1, with magnitudes comparable to those observed with fMRI. Interestingly, attentional modulation in the LGN was consistently negligible. These findings demonstrate that discrepancies in attention effects are not simply due to species or measurement differences. We also examined whether attention effects correlated with the feature selectivity of recorded multiunits. Distinct relationships suggest that attentional modulation of multiunit activity depends upon the unique structure and function of visual brain areas.</p>

<p>We used retrograde and anterograde tracing techniques, along with immunocytochemistry, to delineate the sources of cholinergic brainstem projections to the dorsal thalamus of the mouse. Shown are the pattern of cholinergic projections from the parabigeminal nucleus (PBG; red), pedunculopontine tegmentum (PPTg; blue), and laterodorsal tegmentum (LDTg; brown) to contralateral and ipsilateral dorsal thalamic nuclei, including dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN), pulvinar (PUL), ventral lateral geniculate nucleus (vLGN), ventrobasal complex (VB), and posterior nucleus (Po). Brainstem nuclei are depicted as boxes and indicate immunoreactivity to choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT), and brain nitric oxide synthase (BNOS).

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Cholinergic projections from the brainstem serve as important modulators of activity in visual thalamic nuclei such as the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN). While these projections have been studied in several mammals, a comprehensive examination of their organization in the mouse is lacking. We used the retrograde transport of viruses or cholera toxin subunit B (CTB) injected in the dLGN, immunocytochemical labeling with antibodies against choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), brain nitric oxide synthase (BNOS), and vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT), ChAT-Cre mice crossed with a reporter line (Ai9), as well as brainstem virus injections in ChAT-Cre mice to examine the pattern of thalamic innervation from cholinergic neurons in the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus (PPTg), laterodorsal tegmental nucleus (LDTg), and the parabigeminal nucleus (PBG). Retrograde tracing demonstrated that the dLGN receives input from the PPTg, LDTg, and PBG. Viral tracing in ChAT-Cre mice and retrograde tracing combined with immunocytochemistry revealed that many of these inputs originate from cholinergic neurons in the PBG and PPTg. Most notable was an extensive cholinergic projection from the PBG which innervated most of the contralateral dLGN, with an especially dense concentration in the dorsolateral shell, as well as a small region in the dorsomedial pole of the ipsilateral dLGN. The PPTg was found to provide a sparse somewhat diffuse innervation of the ipsilateral dLGN. Neurons in the PPTg co-expressed ChAT, BNOS, and VAChT, whereas PBG neurons expressed ChAT, but not BNOS or VAChT. These results highlight the presence of distinct cholinergic populations that innervate the mouse dLGN.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10969861/most-recent">Distributions of vesicular glutamate transporters 1 and 2 in the visual thalamus and associated areas of the cat</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Glutamate is packaged in vesicles via two main vesicular transporter (VGLUT) proteins, VGLUT1 and VGLUT2, which regulate its storage and release from synapses of excitatory neurons. Studies in rodents, primates, <i>ferrets</i>, and tree shrews suggest that these transporters may identify distinct subsets of excitatory projections in visual structures, particularly in thalamocortical pathways where they tend to correlate with modulatory and driver projections, respectively. Despite being a well-studied model of thalamocortical connectivity, little is known about their expression pattern in the cat visual system. To expand current knowledge on their distribution and how they correlated with known driver and modulator projecting sites, we examined the protein expression patterns of VGLUT1 and VGLUT2 in the visual thalamus of the cat (lateral geniculate nucleus and the pulvinar complex). We also studied their expression pattern in relevant visual structures projecting to or receiving significant thalamic projections, such <i>as</i> the primary visual cortex and the superior colliculus. Our results indicate that both VGLUTs are consistently present throughout the cat visual system and show laminar or nuclei specificity in their distribution, which suggests, as in other species, that VGLUT1 and VGLUT2 represent distinct populations of glutamatergic projections.</p>

<p>This study characterizes the temporal and spatial expression pattern of genetically encoded reporters following Cre-mediated recombination from three Cre drivers selective for the nuclei of the dorsal thalamus: <i>Oligodendrocyte transcription factor 3</i> (<i>Olig3)-Cre</i>, <i>histidine decarboxylase (HDC)-Cre</i>, and <i>corticotropin-releasing hormone</i> (<i>CRH)-Cre</i>. Cre-dependent expression of tdTomato reveals that <i>Olig3-Cre</i> expresses broadly within the thalamus, including thalamocortical (TC) neurons and interneurons, while <i>HDC-Cre</i> and <i>CRH-Cre</i> each have unique patterns of expression restricted to TC neurons within and across the sensory relay nuclei of the dorsal thalamus.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Subpopulations of neurons and associated neural circuits can be targeted in mice with genetic tools in a highly selective manner for visualization and manipulation. However, there are not well-defined Cre “driver” lines that target the expression of Cre recombinase to thalamocortical (TC) neurons. Here, we characterize three Cre driver lines for the nuclei of the dorsal thalamus: <i>Oligodendrocyte transcription factor 3</i> (<i>Olig3)-Cre</i>, <i>histidine decarboxylase (HDC)-Cre</i>, and <i>corticotropin-releasing hormone</i> (<i>CRH)-Cre</i>. We examined the postnatal distribution of Cre expression for each of these lines with the Cre-dependent reporter <i>CAG-tdTomato</i> (<i>Ai9)</i>. Cre-dependent expression of tdTomato reveals that <i>Olig3-Cre</i> expresses broadly within the thalamus, including TC neurons and interneurons, while <i>HDC-Cre</i> and <i>CRH-Cre</i> each have unique patterns of expression restricted to TC neurons within and across the sensory relay nuclei of the dorsal thalamus. Cre expression is present by the time of natural birth in all three lines, underscoring their utility for developmental studies. To demonstrate the utility of these Cre drivers for studying sensory TC circuitry, we targeted the expression of channelrhodopsin-2 to thalamus from the <i>CAG-COP4*H134R/EYFP (Ai32)</i> allele with either <i>HDC-Cre</i> or <i>CRH-Cre</i>. Optogenetic activation of TC afferents in primary visual cortex was sufficient to measure frequency-dependent depression. Thus, these Cre drivers provide selective Cre-dependent gene expression in thalamus suitable for both anatomical and functional studies.</p>

     alt="Characterization and manipulation of Corticothalamic neurons in associative cortices using Syt6-Cre transgenic mice"/>
<p>Our work highlights the potential of the Syt6-Cre transgenic mouse line to effectively target Corticothalamic neurons in the associative cortices. This detailed study describes and tests the utility of the system, laying the foundation for its implementation as a new tool to study corticothalamic interactions between frontal and medial associative areas, thalamic nuclei, and the contribution of these interactions to higher cognitive functions.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Corticothalamic interactions between associative cortices and higher order thalamic nuclei are involved in high-cognitive functions such as decision-making and working memory. Corticothalamic neurons (CTn) in the prefrontal cortex and other associative areas have been much less studied than their counterparts in the primary sensory areas. The availability of characterized transgenic tools to study CTn in associative areas will facilitate their study and contribute to overcome the scarcity of data about their properties, network dynamics, and contribution to cognitive functions.</p>
<p>Here, we characterized the Syt6-Cre (KI148Gsat/Mmud) transgenic mouse line, by tracking expression of a Cre-mediated reporter. In this line, Cre-reporter is strongly expressed in the prefrontal, motor, cingulate, and retrosplenial cortices, as well as in other brain areas including the cerebellum and the olfactory tubercle. Cortical expression starts embryonically and reaches the adult expression pattern by postnatal day 15. In the cortex, Cre-reporter is expressed by layer 6-CTn and by layer 5-CTn to a lesser extent. We quantified Syt6-Cre<sup>+</sup> CTn axon varicosities to estimate the distribution and density of putative corticothalamic driver and modulator inputs to thalamic nuclei in the medial, midline, intralaminar, anterior, and motor groups. Also, we characterized the effect of optogenetic stimulation of Syt6-Cre<sup>+</sup> neurons in the activity of the prefrontal cortex. CTn stimulation in the prefrontal cortex induces an oscillatory activity in the local field potential that resembles the cortical downstates typically observed during slow-wave sleep or quiet wake.</p>

<p>Morphological and functional development of astrocytes in the visual thalamus: In the present study, we show that by eye-opening, astrocytes not only possess adult-like morphology but also completely enwrap retinogeniculate synapses and efficiently uptake extracellular glutamate.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The rodent visual thalamus has served as a powerful model to elucidate the cellular and molecular mechanisms that underlie sensory circuit formation and function. Despite significant advances in our understanding of the role of axon-target interactions and neural activity in orchestrating circuit formation in visual thalamus, the role of non-neuronal cells, such as astrocytes, is less clear. In fact, we know little about the transcriptional identity and development of astrocytes in mouse visual thalamus. To address this gap in knowledge, we studied the expression of canonical astrocyte molecules in visual thalamus using immunostaining, in situ hybridization, and reporter lines. While our data suggests some level of heterogeneity of astrocytes in different nuclei of the visual thalamus, the majority of thalamic astrocytes appeared to be labeled in <i>Aldh1l1-EGFP</i> mice. This led us to use this transgenic line to characterize the neonatal and postnatal development of these cells in visual thalamus. Our data show that not only have the entire cohort of astrocytes migrated into visual thalamus by eye-opening but they also have acquired their adult-like morphology, even while retinogeniculate synapses are still maturing. Furthermore, ultrastructural, immunohistochemical, and functional approaches revealed that by eye-opening, thalamic astrocytes ensheathe retinogeniculate synapses and are capable of efficient uptake of glutamate. Taken together, our results reveal that the morphological, anatomical, and functional development of astrocytes in visual thalamus occurs prior to eye-opening and the emergence of experience-dependent visual activity.</p>

     alt="Secondary thalamic neuroinflammation after focal cortical stroke and traumatic injury mirrors corticothalamic functional connectivity"/>
<p>Focal cortical TBI or stroke in various cortical areas leads to gliosis in the functionally connected thalamocortical nuclei and of the <i>nucleus reticularis thalami</i> (nRT). The dotted line in the prefrontal cortex-injured section indicates that the top and bottom halves of the brain are sourced from different bregma positions in order to display cortical injury and relevant thalamic nuclei together.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>While cortical injuries, such as traumatic brain injury (TBI) and neocortical stroke, acutely disrupt the neocortex, most of their consequent disabilities reflect secondary injuries that develop over time. Thalamic neuroinflammation has been proposed to be a biomarker of cortical injury and of the long-term cognitive and neurological deficits that follow. However, the extent to which thalamic neuroinflammation depends on the type of cortical injury or its location remains unknown. Using two mouse models of focal neocortical injury that do not directly damage subcortical structures—controlled cortical impact and photothrombotic ischemic stroke—we found that chronic neuroinflammation in the thalamic region mirrors the functional connections with the injured cortex, and that sensory corticothalamic regions may be more likely to sustain long-term damage than nonsensory circuits. Currently, heterogeneous clinical outcomes complicate treatment. Understanding how thalamic inflammation depends on the injury site can aid in predicting features of subsequent deficits and lead to more effective, customized therapies.</p>

     alt="Ultrastructure of ipsilateral and contralateral tectopulvinar projections in the mouse"/>
<p>The confocal image of a coronal section through the left mouse pulvinar nucleus (PUL) illustrates the distribution of projections from the left (Ipsi, magenta) and right (Contra, green) superior colliculus (SC). This study examined the ultrastructure of ipsi and contra SC to PUL projections using viruses that induce the expression of peroxidase in synaptic vesicles (example electron micrographs circled, black arrows indicate synapses). Synaptic terminals originating from the ipsi SC were found to be significantly larger than synaptic terminals originating from the contra SC (left graph), and both populations of SC terminals were found to be significantly larger than synaptic terminals in the PUL that do not originate from the SC (right graph).

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Visual pathways of the brain are organized into parallel channels that code different features of the external environment. In the current study, we investigated the anatomical organization of parallel pathways from the superior colliculus (SC) to the pulvinar nucleus in the mouse. Virus injections placed in the ipsilateral and contralateral SC to induce the expression of different fluorescent proteins define two pulvinar zones. The lateral pulvinar (Pl) receives ipsilateral SC input and the caudal medial pulvinar (Pcm) receives bilateral SC input. To examine the ultrastructure of these projections using transmission electron microscopy, we injected the SC with viruses to induce peroxidase expression within synaptic vesicles or mitochondria. We quantitatively compared the sizes of ipsilateral and contralateral tectopulvinar terminals and their postsynaptic dendrites, as well as the sizes of the overall population of synaptic terminals and their postsynaptic dendrites in the Pl and Pcm. Our ultrastructural analysis revealed that ipsilateral tectopulvinar terminals are significantly larger than contralateral tectopulvinar terminals. In particular, the ipsilateral tectopulvinar projection includes a subset of large terminals (≥ 1 μm<sup>2</sup>) that envelop dendritic protrusions of postsynaptic dendrites. We also found that both ipsilateral and contralateral tectopulvinar terminals are significantly larger than the overall population of synaptic terminals in both the Pl and Pcm. Thus, the ipsilateral tectopulvinar projection is structurally distinct from the bilateral tectopulvinar pathway, but both tectopulvinar channels may be considered the primary or “driving” input to the Pl and Pcm.</p>

     alt="Cross-hierarchical plasticity of corticofugal projections to dLGN after neonatal monocular enucleation"/>
<p>In this study, the effect of monocular enucleation (MoE) in the development of the first-order visual thalamic nucleus, dLGN, was examined. We reported by microarray analysis a transcriptionally immature dLGN after early MoE. Additionally, focusing on layer 5 axonal projections, we demonstrated by viral tracing that layer 5 fibers in the enucleated dLGN originate from the primary visual cortex and not from the primary somatosensory cortex. Finally, we showed that layer 5 axons reorganize while innervating the enucleated dLGN and form aberrant synapses that persist until adulthood, indicating the presence of a permanent cross-hierarchical cortico-thalamic plasticity.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Perception is the result of interactions between the sensory periphery, thalamus, and cerebral cortex. Inputs from the retina project to the first-order dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN), which projects to the primary visual cortex (V1). In return, the cortex innervates the thalamus. While layer 6 projections innervate all thalamic nuclei, cortical layer 5 neurons selectively project to the higher order lateral posterior nucleus (LP) and not to dLGN. It has been demonstrated that a subpopulation of layer 5 (Rbp4-Cre+) projections rewires to dLGN after monocular or binocular enucleation in young postnatal mice. However, the exact cortical regional origin of these projections was not fully determined, and it remained unclear whether these changes persisted into adulthood. In this study, we report gene expression changes observed in the dLGN after monocular enucleation at birth using microarray, qPCR at P6, and in situ hybridization at P8. We report that genes that are normally enriched in dLGN, but not LP during development are preferentially downregulated in dLGN following monocular enucleation. Comparisons with developmental gene expression patters in dLGN suggest more immature and delayed gene expression in enucleated dLGN. Combined tracing and immuno-histochemical analysis revealed that the induced layer 5 fibers that innervate enucleated dLGN originate from putative primary visual cortex and they retain increased VGluT1+ synapse formation into adulthood. Our results indicate a new form of plasticity when layer 5 driver input takes over the innervation of an originally first-order thalamic nucleus after early sensory deficit.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">SCAMPR: Single-Cell Automated Multiplex Pipeline for RNA Quantification and Spatial Mapping</a></h4>

              
                Spatial gene expression, achieved classically through in situ hybridization, is a fundamental tool for topographic phenotyping of cell types in the nervous system. Newly developed techniques allow for the visualization of multiple mRNAs at single-cell resolution, greatly expanding the ability to link gene expression to tissue topography. Yet, methods for efficient and accurate quantification and analysis of high dimensional in situ- hybridization are limited. To this end, the Single-Cell Automated Multiplex Pipeline for RNA (SCAMPR) was developed, facilitating rapid and accurate segmentation of neuronal cell bodies using a dual immunohistochemistry-RNAscope protocol and quantification of low and high abundance mRNA signals using open-source image processing and automated segmentation tools. Proof of principle using SCAMPR focused on spatial mapping of gene expression by peripheral (vagal nodose) and central (visual cortex) neurons. The analytical effectiveness of SCAMPR is demonstrated by identifying the impact of early life stress on differential gene expression by vagal neuron subtypes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Coregistration of heading to visual cues in retrosplenial cortex</a></h4>

              
                Spatial cognition depends on an accurate representation of orientation within an environment. Head direction cells in distributed brain regions receive a range of sensory inputs, but visual input is particularly important for aligning their responses to environmental landmarks. To investigate how population-level heading responses are aligned to visual input, we recorded from retrosplenial cortex (RSC) of head-fixed mice in a moving environment using two-photon calcium imaging. We show that RSC neurons are tuned to the animal's relative orientation in the environment, even in the absence of head movement. Next, we found that RSC receives functionally distinct projections from visual and thalamic areas, and contains several functional classes of neurons. While some functional classes mirror RSC inputs, a newly discovered class coregisters visual and thalamic signals. Finally, decoding analyses reveal unique contributions to heading from each class. Our results suggest an RSC circuit for anchoring heading representations to environmental visual landmarks.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">GASEOUS TRANSMITTER MODULATION OF HYPOGLOSSAL MOTONEURON ACTIVITY</a></h4>

              
                Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is characterized by periodic disruption of breathing due to sporadic collapse of upper airway. Mice with targeted deletion of the gene Hmox2, encoding the enzyme heme oxygenase-2 (HO-2), exhibit severe OSA. Upper airway patency is governed by genioglossal nerve activity originating from the hypoglossal motor nucleus. We tested the hypothesis that disrupted HO 2 signaling weakens hypoglossal motoneuron activity using a combination of genetic, biochemical and electrophysiological approaches. Hypoglossal neurons are positive for HO-2. Disrupting HO-2 function caused transmission failure of inspiratory rhythm from preBotzinger complex (preBotC) to the hypoglossal nucleus. Failed transmission coincided with smaller inspiratory drive currents and a reduced intrinsic excitability among hypoglossal neurons. Hypoglossal neurons also expressed cystathionine {Upsilon}-lyase (CSE), a H2S producing enzyme. H2S abundance was higher in hypoglossal neurons of HO-2 null mice than wild-type controls. Disrupting CSE function normalized transmission from preBotC to hypoglossal neurons in HO-2 null mice. A H2S donor mimicked the effects of disrupted HO-2 function in wild type mice. These findings demonstrate a hitherto uncharacterized modulation of XII motoneurons by HO-2 and CSE-derived H2S.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">EPHierStats: a statistical tool to model the hierarchical relationships in electrophysiological data</a></h4>

              
                Electrophysiological datasets are typically analyzed under the assumption that repeated measurements of the same unit of analysis (i.e. neuron or animal) can be treated as statistically independent. Recently, this assumption has been questioned and our data confirms and quantifies this skepticism using ex vivo slice recordings of synaptic currents in D1R+ medium spiny neurons in the nucleus accumbens. We therefore present EPHierStats as a statistical framework to analyze electrophysiological datasets with large numbers of measurements (>100) per unit of analysis. This novel analysis framework enables encoding of the full hierarchical relationships between measurements in a mixed-effects general linear model while also analyzing the distribution of values in assessed variables. Our method can easily be adapted to analyze a wide range of repeated-measures electrophysiological experiments. Implementation of the EPHierStats tool will aid the adaption of modern statistical approaches that prevent pseudoreplication and its associated false discovery rate while enabling statistical assessments of the complex relationships inherent to the field of neuroscience.

                Airway cholinergic nerves play a key role in airway physiology and disease. In asthma and other diseases of the respiratory tract, airway cholinergic neurons undergo plasticity and contribute to airway hyperresponsiveness and mucus secretion. We currently lack mechanistic understanding of airway cholinergic neuroplasticity due to the absence of human in vitro models. Here, we developed the first human in vitro model for airway cholinergic neurons using human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC) technology. hPSCs were differentiated towards mature and functional airway cholinergic neurons via a vagal precursor. Airway cholinergic neurons were characterized by ChAT and VAChT expression, and responded to chemical stimulation with changes in Ca2+ mobilization. Co-culture of hPSC-derived airway cholinergic neurons with airway smooth muscle cells enhanced phenotypic and functional characteristics of these neurons. The differentiation protocol we developed for human airway cholinergic neurons from hPSCs allows for studies into airway neurobiology and airway neuroplasticity in disease.

                Importin Importin {beta}1 (KPNB1) is a nucleocytoplasmic transport factor with critical roles in both cytoplasmic and nucleocytoplasmic transport, hence there is keen interest in the characterization of its subcellular interactomes. We found limited efficiency of BioID in detection of importin complex cargos, and therefore generated a highly specific and sensitive anti-KPNB1 monoclonal antibody to enable Biotinylation by Antibody Recognition (BAR) analysis of importin {beta}1 interactomes. The monoclonal antibody recognizes an epitope comprising residues 301-320 of human KPBN1, and strikingly is highly specific for cytoplasmic KPNB1 in diverse applications, with little or no reaction with KPNB1 in the nucleus. BAR with this novel antibody revealed numerous new interactors of importin {beta}1, expanding the KPNB1 interactome to cytoplasmic and signaling complexes that highlight potential new functions for the importins complex beyond nucleocytoplasmic transport. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD032728.

                Language is fundamentally predictable, both on a higher schematic level as well as low-level lexical items. Regarding predictability on a lexical level, collocations are frequent co-occurrences of words that are often characterized by high strength of association. So far, psycho- and neurolinguistic studies have mostly employed highly artificial experimental paradigms in the investigation of collocations by focusing on the processing of single words or isolated sentences. In contrast, here we analyze EEG brain responses recorded during stimulation with continuous speech, i.e. audio books. We find that the N400 response to collocations is significantly different from that of non-collocations, whereas the effect varies with respect to cortical region (anterior/ posterior) and laterality (left/right). Our results are in line with studies using continuous speech, and they mostly contradict those using artificial paradigms and stimuli. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first neurolinguistic study on collocations using continuous speech stimulation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Successor-like representation guides the prediction of future events in human visual cortex and hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                Human agents build models of their environment, which enable them to anticipate and plan upcoming events. However, little is known about the properties of such predictive models. Recently, it has been proposed that hippocampal representations take the form of a predictive map-like structure, the so-called successor representation. Here we used human fMRI to probe whether activity in the early visual cortex (V1) and hippocampus adhere to the postulated properties of the successor representation after visual sequence learning. Participants were exposed to an arbitrary spatiotemporal sequence consisting of four items (A-B-C-D). We found that after repeated exposure to the sequence, merely presenting single sequence items (e.g., - B - -) resulted in V1 activation at the successor locations of the full sequence (e.g., C-D), but not at the predecessor locations (e.g., A). This highlights that visual representations are skewed toward future states, in line with the successor representation. Similar results were also found in the hippocampus. Moreover, the hippocampus developed a tuning profile that showed sensitivity to the temporal distance in sequence-space, with fading representations for sequence events in the more distant past and future. V1, in contrast, showed a tuning profile that was only sensitive to spatial distance in stimulus-space. Together, these results provide empirical evidence for the proposition that both visual and hippocampal cortex represent a predictive map of the visual world akin to the successor representation.

                It is widely assumed that our actions shape our brains and that the resulting connections determine who we are. To test this idea in a reductionist setting, in which genes and envi-ronment are controlled, we investigated differences in neuroanatomy and structural co-variance by ex vivo structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in mice whose behav-ioral activity was continuously tracked for 3 months in a large, enriched environment. We confirmed that environmental enrichment increases mouse hippocampal volumes. Strati-fying the enriched group according to individual longitudinal behavioral trajectories, how-ever, revealed striking differences in mouse brain structural covariance in continuously highly active mice compared to those whose trajectories showed signs of habituating activity. Network-based statistics identified distinct sub-networks of murine structural covariance underlying these differences in behavioral activity. Together, these results reveal that differentiated behavioral trajectories of mice in an enriched environment are associated with differences in brain connectivity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neural responses to biological motion distinguish autistic and schizotypal traits in the general population</a></h4>

              
                Difficulties in social interactions are common to both autism and schizophrenia, and contribute to correlated autistic and schizotypal traits in the neurotypical population. It remains unresolved whether this represents a shared etiology or a superficial phenotypic overlap. Both conditions are associated with atypical neural activity in response to the perception of social stimuli, and also decreased neural synchronization between individuals that may prohibit establishing shared experiences. This study sought to establish if neural activity and neural synchronization associated with biological motion perception are differentially associated with autistic and schizotypal traits in the neurotypical population. Participants watched an audiovisual montage of naturalistic social interactions whilst hemodynamic brain activity was measured with fMRI. A separate sample of participants provided a continuous measure of the extent of biological motion, which was used to predict hemodynamic activity. General Linear Model analysis revealed that biological motion perception was associated with neural activity across the action-observation network. However, inter-subject phase synchronization analysis revealed that neural activity synchronized between individuals in occipital and parietal areas, but de-synchronized in temporal and frontal regions. Autistic traits were associated with a decrease in neural activity (precuneus, middle cingulate gyrus) and schizotypal traits were associated with a decrease in neural synchronization (middle and inferior frontal gyri). Biological motion perception elicits convergent and divergent patterns of neural activity and neural synchronization, and are differentially associated with shared traits related with autism and schizophrenia in the general population, suggesting that they originate from different neural mechanisms.

	<p>Fundamental frequency (F0) provides the primary acoustic cue for lexical tone perception in tonal languages but remains poorly represented in cochlear implant (CI) systems. Currently, there is still a lack of understanding of sensitivity to F0 change in CI users who speak tonal languages. In the present study, just-noticeable differences (JNDs) of F0 contour and F0 level changes in Mandarin-speaking children with CIs were measured and compared with those in their age-matched normal-hearing (NH) peers. Results showed that children with CIs demonstrated significantly larger JND of F0 contour (JND-C) change and F0 level (JND-L) change compared to NH children. Further within-group comparison revealed that the JND-C change was significantly smaller than the JND-L change among children with CIs, whereas the opposite pattern was observed among NH children. No significant correlations were seen between JND-C change/JND-L change and age at implantation /duration of CI use. The contrast between children with CIs and NH children in sensitivity to F0 contour and F0 level change suggests different mechanisms of F0 processing in these two groups as a result of different hearing experiences.</p>

	<p>Research on support for relatives of patients with Parkinsonism has mainly focused on caregivers, while preventive offers for non-caregiving relatives are lacking. Thus, the aim of this multicenter pilot study is to develop and assess the feasibility of a preventive psychosocial support program for relatives of patients with Parkinsonism. It specifically focuses on family members of patients who are in an early phase of the disease, are not currently caregiving, and have not yet developed distress symptoms. It includes a telemedicine-based, 6-week preventive psychological short intervention (PPSI). The main objective of this feasibility mixed-methods study is to specify the demand for an early, low-threshold, and low-cost short intervention and to collect feedback based on qualitative and quantitative data of N = 20 relatives. Secondary objectives are an evaluation of the effects of the intervention and an analysis of the study design. Future directions are to further develop the PPSI using these data. This study can serve as a basis for future randomized controlled studies on this intervention, which might fill an important gap in clinical supply.</p>

	<p>Background: Maladaptive neuroplasticity-related learned response in substance use disorder (SUD) can be ameliorated using noninvasive brain stimulation (NIBS); however, inter-individual variability needs to be addressed for clinical translation. Objective: Our first objective was to develop a hypothesis for NIBS for learned response in SUD based on a competing neurobehavioral decision systems model. The next objective was to develop the theory by conducting a computational simulation of NIBS of the cortico-cerebello-thalamo-cortical (CCTC) loop in cannabis use disorder (CUD)-related dysfunctional &amp;amp;ldquo;cue-reactivity&amp;amp;rdquo;&amp;amp;mdash;a construct closely related to &amp;amp;ldquo;craving&amp;amp;rdquo;&amp;amp;mdash;that is a core symptom. Our third objective was to test the feasibility of a neuroimaging-guided rational NIBS approach in healthy humans. Methods: &amp;amp;ldquo;Cue-reactivity&amp;amp;rdquo; can be measured using behavioral paradigms and portable neuroimaging, including functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and electroencephalogram (EEG) metrics of sensorimotor gating. Therefore, we conducted a computational simulation of NIBS, including transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) of the cerebellar cortex and deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN) of the CCTC loop for its postulated effects on fNIRS and EEG metrics. We also developed a rational neuroimaging-guided NIBS approach for the cerebellar lobule (VII) and prefrontal cortex based on a healthy human study. Results: Simulation of cerebellar tDCS induced gamma oscillations in the cerebral cortex, while transcranial temporal interference stimulation induced a gamma-to-beta frequency shift. A preliminary healthy human study (N = 10) found that 2 mA cerebellar tDCS evoked similar oxyhemoglobin (HbO) response in the range of 5 &amp;amp;times; 10&amp;amp;minus;6 M across the cerebellum and PFC brain regions (&amp;amp;alpha; = 0.01); however, infra-slow (0.01&amp;amp;ndash;0.10 Hz) prefrontal cortex HbO-driven phase&amp;amp;ndash;amplitude-coupled (PAC; 4 Hz, &amp;amp;plusmn;2 mA (max)) cerebellar tACS evoked HbO levels in the range of 10&amp;amp;minus;7 M that were statistically different (&amp;amp;alpha; = 0.01) across these brain regions. Conclusion: Our healthy human study showed the feasibility of fNIRS of cerebellum and PFC and closed-loop fNIRS-driven ctACS at 4 Hz, which may facilitate cerebellar cognitive function via the frontoparietal network. Future work needs to combine fNIRS with EEG for multi-modal imaging for closed-loop NIBS during operant conditioning.</p>

	<p>Introduction/Aim. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of cognitive impairments and their association with sleep patterns in a cohort of patients diagnosed with chronic liver disease (CLD). Material and methods. The present paper is a prospective cohort study, carried out over a period of 12 months, among patients with various stages of CLD. We evaluated the cognitive function through psychometric hepatic encephalopathy score (PHES), while sleep was assessed by actigraphy and two self-reported questionnaires: Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Results. Seventy-four patients with CLD were considered eligible and were enrolled between December 2020&amp;amp;ndash;November 2021. The prevalence of minimal hepatic encephalopathy (MHE) in the entire cohort was 41.9%, and the diagnosis was considered for PHES scores &amp;amp;le; &amp;amp;minus;3. Patients with cirrhosis recorded significantly lower PHES scores compared to patients with other CLDs but without cirrhosis (&amp;amp;minus;3.19 &amp;amp;plusmn; 3.89 vs. 0.19 &amp;amp;plusmn; 2.92, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). Patients who exhibited MHE suffered from poor sleep, daytime somnolence, disturbed nighttime sleep, and low overall sleep efficacy. Patients diagnosed with MHE and undergoing treatment with lactulose and/or rifaximin for prevention of overt hepatic encephalopathy (HE) showed better results in terms of sleep parameters compared to patients diagnosed with MHE but without treatment. Conclusions. This research increases awareness regarding the connection between sleep features and MHE in patients with cirrhosis and other CLDs. A deeper insight into the subclinical stages of HE and associated sleep disturbances is warranted in future studies.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Whole genome sequencing and gene sharing network analysis powered by machine learning identifies antibiotic resistance sharing between animals, humans and environment in livestock farming</a></h4>

Anthropogenic environments such as those created by intensive farming of livestock, have been proposed to provide ideal selection pressure for the emergence of antimicrobial-resistant <i>Escherichia coli</i> bacteria and antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) and spread to humans. Here, we performed a longitudinal study in a large-scale commercial poultry farm in China, collecting <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> isolates from both farm and slaughterhouse; targeting animals, carcasses, workers and their households and environment. By using whole-genome phylogenetic analysis and network analysis based on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), we found highly interrelated non-pathogenic and pathogenic <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> strains with phylogenetic intermixing, and a high prevalence of shared multidrug resistance profiles amongst livestock, human and environment. Through an original data processing pipeline which combines omics, machine learning, gene sharing network and mobile genetic elements analysis, we investigated the resistance to 26 different antimicrobials and identified 361 genes associated to AR phenotypes; 58 of these were known AMR-associated genes and 35 were associated to multidrug resistance. We uncovered an extensive network of genes, correlated to AMR phenotypes, shared among livestock, humans, farm and slaughterhouse environments. We also found several human, livestock and environmental isolates sharing closely related mobile genetic elements carrying AR genes across host species and environments. In a scenario where no consensus exists on how antibiotic use in the livestock may affect antibiotic resistance in the human population, our findings provide novel insights into the broader epidemiology of antimicrobial resistance in livestock farming. Moreover, our original data analysis method has the potential to uncover AR transmission pathways when applied to the study of other pathogens active in other anthropogenic environments characterised by complex interconnections between host species.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Assessing the best time interval between doses in a two-dose vaccination regimen to reduce the number of deaths in an ongoing epidemic of SARS-CoV-2</a></h4>

The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is a major concern all over the world and, as vaccines became available at the end of 2020, optimal vaccination strategies were subjected to intense investigation. Considering their critical role in reducing disease burden, the increasing demand outpacing production, and that most currently approved vaccines follow a two-dose regimen, the cost-effectiveness of delaying the second dose to increment the coverage of the population receiving the first dose is often debated. Finding the best solution is complex due to the trade-off between vaccinating more people with lower level of protection and guaranteeing higher protection to a fewer number of individuals. Here we present a novel extended age-structured SEIR mathematical model that includes a two-dose vaccination schedule with a between-doses delay modelled through delay differential equations and linear optimization of vaccination rates. By maintaining the minimum stock of vaccines under a given production rate, we evaluate the dose interval that minimizes the number of deaths. We found that the best strategy depends on an interplay between the vaccine production rate and the relative efficacy of the first dose. In the scenario of low first-dose efficacy, it is always better to vaccinate the second dose as soon as possible, while for high first-dose efficacy, the best strategy of time window depends on the production rate and also on second-dose efficacy provided by each type of vaccine. We also found that the rate of spread of the infection does not affect significantly the thresholds of the best window, but is an important factor in the absolute number of total deaths. These conclusions point to the need to carefully take into account both vaccine characteristics and roll-out speed to optimize the outcome of vaccination strategies.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Mining folded proteomes in the era of accurate structure prediction</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Charles Bayly-Jones, James C. Whisstock</p>

Protein structure fundamentally underpins the function and processes of numerous biological systems. Fold recognition algorithms offer a sensitive and robust tool to detect structural, and thereby functional, similarities between distantly related homologs. In the era of accurate structure prediction owing to advances in machine learning techniques and a wealth of experimentally determined structures, previously curated sequence databases have become a rich source of biological information. Here, we use bioinformatic fold recognition algorithms to scan the entire AlphaFold structure database to identify novel protein family members, infer function and group predicted protein structures. As an example of the utility of this approach, we identify novel, previously unknown members of various pore-forming protein families, including MACPFs, GSDMs and aerolysin-like proteins.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Minimal cross-trial generalization in learning the representation of an odor-guided choice task</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Mingyu Song, Yuji K. Takahashi, Amanda C. Burton, Matthew R. Roesch, Geoffrey Schoenbaum, Yael Niv, Angela J. Langdon</p>

There is no single way to represent a task. Indeed, despite experiencing the same task events and contingencies, different subjects may form distinct task representations. As experimenters, we often assume that subjects represent the task as we envision it. However, such a representation cannot be taken for granted, especially in animal experiments where we cannot deliver explicit instruction regarding the structure of the task. Here, we tested how rats represent an odor-guided choice task in which two odor cues indicated which of two responses would lead to reward, whereas a third odor indicated free choice among the two responses. A parsimonious task representation would allow animals to learn from the forced trials what is the better option to choose in the free-choice trials. However, animals may not necessarily generalize across odors in this way. We fit reinforcement-learning models that use different task representations to trial-by-trial choice behavior of individual rats performing this task, and quantified the degree to which each animal used the more parsimonious representation, generalizing across trial types. Model comparison revealed that most rats did not acquire this representation despite extensive experience. Our results demonstrate the importance of formally testing possible task representations that can afford the observed behavior, rather than assuming that animals’ task representations abide by the generative task structure that governs the experimental design.

Motile bacteria usually rely on external apparatus like flagella for swimming or pili for twitching. By contrast, gliding bacteria do not rely on obvious surface appendages to move on solid surfaces. <i>Flavobacterium johnsoniae</i> and other bacteria in the Bacteroidetes phylum use adhesins whose movement on the cell surface supports motility. In <i>F</i>. <i>johnsoniae</i>, secretion and helicoidal motion of the main adhesin SprB are intimately linked and depend on the type IX secretion system (T9SS). Both processes necessitate the proton motive force (PMF), which is thought to fuel a molecular motor that comprises the GldL and GldM cytoplasmic membrane proteins. Here, we show that <i>F</i>. <i>johnsoniae</i> gliding motility is powered by the pH gradient component of the PMF. We further delineate the interaction network between the GldLM transmembrane helices (TMHs) and show that conserved glutamate residues in GldL TMH are essential for gliding motility, although having distinct roles in SprB secretion and motion. We then demonstrate that the PMF and GldL trigger conformational changes in the GldM periplasmic domain. We finally show that multiple GldLM complexes are distributed in the membrane, suggesting that a network of motors may be present to move SprB along a helical path on the cell surface. Altogether, our results provide evidence that GldL and GldM assemble dynamic membrane channels that use the proton gradient to power both T9SS-dependent secretion of SprB and its motion at the cell surface.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Boosting targeted genome editing using the hei-tag</a></h4>

              
                Precise, targeted genome editing by CRISPR/Cas9 is key for basic research and translational approaches in model and non-model systems. While active in all species tested so far, editing efficiencies still leave room for improvement. The bacterial Cas9 needs to be efficiently shuttled into the nucleus as attempted by fusion with nuclear localization signals (NLSs). Additional peptide tags such as FLAG- or myc-tags are usually added for immediate detection or straight-forward purification. Immediate activity is usually granted by administration of pre-assembled protein/RNA complexes. We present the 'hei-tag (<span class="underline">h</span>igh <span class="underline">e</span>ff<span class="underline">i</span>ciency-tag)' which boosts the activity of CRISPR/Cas genome editing tools already when supplied as mRNA. The addition of the hei-tag, a myc tag coupled to an optimized NLS via a flexible linker, to Cas9 or a C-to-T base editor dramatically enhances the respective targeting efficiency. This results in an increase in bi-allelic editing, yet reduction of allele variance, indicating an immediate activity even at early developmental stages. The hei-tag boost is active in model systems ranging from fish to mammals, including tissue culture applications. The simple addition of the hei-tag allows to instantly upgrade existing and potentially highly adapted systems as well as to establish novel highly efficient tools immediately applicable at the mRNA level.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">AP-2α and AP-2β cooperatively function in the craniofacial surface ectoderm to regulate chromatin and gene expression dynamics during facial development</a></h4>

              
                The facial surface ectoderm is essential for normal development of the underlying cranial neural crest cell populations, providing signals that direct appropriate growth, patterning, and morphogenesis. Despite the importance of the ectoderm as a signaling center, the molecular cues and genetic programs implemented within this tissue are understudied. Here we show that removal of two members of the AP-2 transcription factor family, AP-2α and AP-2ß, within the early embryonic ectoderm of the mouse leads to major alterations in the craniofacial complex. Significantly, there are clefts in both the upper face and mandible, accompanied by fusion of the upper and lower jaws in the hinge region. Comparison of ATAC-seq and RNA-seq analyses between controls and mutants revealed significant changes in chromatin accessibility and gene expression centered on multiple AP-2 binding motifs associated with enhancer elements within these ectodermal lineages. In particular, loss of these AP-2 proteins affects both skin differentiation as well as multiple signaling pathways, most notably the WNT pathway. We also determined that the mutant clefting phenotypes that correlated with reduced WNT signaling could be rescued by <i>Wnt1</i> ligand overexpression in the ectoderm. Collectively, these findings highlight a conserved ancestral function for AP-2 transcription factors in ectodermal development and signaling, and provide a framework from which to understand the gene regulatory network operating within this tissue that directs vertebrate craniofacial development.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Glutathione binding to the plant AtAtm3 transporter and implications for the conformational coupling of ABC transporters</a></h4>

              
                The ATP Binding Cassette (ABC) transporter of mitochondria (Atm) from <i>Arabidopsis thaliana </i>(<i>At</i>Atm3) has been implicated in the maturation of cytosolic iron-sulfur proteins and heavy metal detoxification, plausibly by exporting glutathione derivatives. Using single-particle cryo-electron microscopy, we have determined four structures of <i>At</i>Atm3 in three different conformational states: two inward-facing conformations (with and without bound oxidized glutathione (GSSG)), together with closed and outward-facing states stabilized by MgADP-VO<sub>4</sub>. These structures not only provide a structural framework for defining the alternating access transport cycle, but also reveal the paucity of cysteine residues in the glutathione binding site that could potentially form inhibitory mixed disulfides with GSSG. Despite extensive efforts, we were unable to prepare the ternary complex of <i>At</i>Atm3 containing both GSSG and MgATP. A survey of structurally characterized type IV ABC transporters that includes <i>At</i>Atm3 establishes that while nucleotides are found associated with all conformational states, they are effectively required to stabilize occluded, closed, and outward-facing conformations. In contrast, transport substrates have only been observed associated with inward-facing conformations. The absence of structures with dimerized nucleotide binding domains containing both nucleotide and transport substrate suggests that this form of the ternary complex exists only transiently during the transport cycle.

                Spike timing-dependent plasticity, related to differential Hebb-rules, has become a leading paradigm in neuronal learning, because weights can grow or shrink depending on the timing of pre- and post-synaptic signals. Here we use this paradigm to reduce unwanted (acoustic) noise. Our system relies on heterosynaptic differential Hebbian learning and we show that it can efficiently eliminate noise by up to -140~dB in multi-microphone setups under various conditions. The system quickly learns, most often within a few seconds, and it is robust with respect to different geometrical microphone configurations, too. Hence, this theoretical study demonstrates that it is possible to successfully transfer differential Hebbian learning, derived from the neurosciences, into a technical domain.

                The myelinated white matter tracts of the central nervous system (CNS) are essential for fast transmission of electrical impulses and are commonly affected in neurodegenerative diseases. However, these often uniquely human diseases differentially affect white matter regions, at various ages and between males and females, and we hypothesised that this is secondary to physiological variation in white matter glia with region, age and sex. Using single nucleus RNA sequencing of healthy human post-mortem samples, we find marked glial heterogeneity with tissue region (primary motor cortex, cerebellum, cervical spinal cord), with tissue-specific cell populations of oligodendrocyte precursor cells and astrocytes, and a spinal cord-enriched oligodendrocyte type that appears human-specific. Spinal cord microglia but not astrocytes show a more activated phenotype compared to brain. These regional effects, with additional differentially expressed genes with age and sex in all glial lineages, help explain pathological patterns of disease, essential knowledge for therapeutic strategies.

                Gap junctions and electrical synapses in the central nervous system are associated with rapid temporal processing and coincidence detection. Using histology, immunohistochemistry, and in situ hybridization, we investigated the distribution of Connexin36 (Cx36), a protein that comprises neuronal gap junctions, throughout the cochlear nucleus complex of the echolocating big brown bat, Eptesicus fuscus, a species exhibiting extreme behavioral sensitivity to minute temporal changes in ultrasonic echoes. For comparison, we visualized Cx36 expression in the cochlear nucleus of transgenic Cx36 reporter mice, species that hear ultrasound but do not echolocate. We observed Cx36 expression in the anteroventral and dorsal cochlear nucleus, with more limited expression in the posteroventral cochlear nucleus, of both species. Several different morphological cell types were labeled, including globular and spherical bushy, octopus, stellate, and fusiform cells. Labeled Cx36 puncta were also observed. Cx36 expression in the bat was spread throughout a relatively smaller area of the cochlear nucleus than in the mouse, even though the bat cochlear nucleus is hypertrophied. In the bat, the anteroventral cochlear nucleus showed higher percent area label than the dorsal cochlear nucleus, with a trend towards the opposite result in the mouse. The presence of gap junctions appears to be a conserved feature of the mammalian cochlear nucleus and thus not uniquely tied to the temporal hyperacuity of echolocation.

                The pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with the extracellular amyloid-{beta}(A{beta}) plaques that perturb the mechanical properties of brain tissue. Microglia sense and integrate biochemical cues in their local microenvironment, intimate linking with AD progress. However, neither the microglial mechanosensing pathway nor its impact on AD pathogenesis is well studied. Here, we showed that the mechanosensitive ion channel Piezo1 is increased in microglia upon stiffness stimuli of A{beta} fibrils. The upregulation of Piezo1 in A{beta} plaque-associated microglia was observed in AD mouse models and human patients. Microglia lacking Piezo1 disturbed microglial clustering, phagocytosis, and compaction of A{beta} plaques, resulting in the exacerbation of A{beta} and neurodegenerative pathologies in AD. Conversely, pharmacological activation of Piezo1 ameliorated brain A{beta} burden and cognitive impairment in the 5xFAD mouse. Together, our results reveal Piezo1, as a mechanosensor of A{beta} fibrils stiffness in microglia, could represent a promising therapeutic target for AD.

                Slow wave activity (SWA) during sleep is associated with synaptic regulation and memory processing functions. Each cycle of non-rapid-eye-movement (NREM) sleep demonstrates a waxing and waning amount of SWA during the transitions between stages N2 and N3 sleep, and the deeper N3 sleep is associated with an increased density of SWA. Further, SWA is an amalgam of different types of slow waves, each identifiable by their temporal coupling to spindle subtypes with distinct physiological features. The objectives of this study were to better understand the neurobiological properties that distinguish different slow wave and spindle subtypes, and to examine the composition of SWA across cycles of NREM sleep. We further sought to explore changes in the composition of NREM cycles that occur among aging adults. To address these goals, we analyzed subsets of data from two well-characterized cohorts of healthy adults: 1) The DREAMS Subjects Database (n=20), and 2) The Cleveland Family Study (n=60). Our analyses indicate that slow wave/spindle coupled events can be characterized as frontal versus central in their relative distribution between electroencephalography (EEG) channels. The frontal predominant slow waves are identifiable by their coupling to late-fast spindles and occur more frequently during stage N3 sleep. Conversely, the central-associated slow waves are identified by coupling to early-fast spindles and favor occurrence during stage N2 sleep. Together, both types of slow wave/spindle coupled events form the composite of SWA, and their relative contribution to the SWA rises and falls across cycles of NREM sleep in accordance with depth of sleep. Exploratory analyses indicated that older adults produce a different composition of SWA, with a shift toward the N3, frontal subtype, which becomes increasingly predominant during cycles of NREM sleep. Overall, these data demonstrate that subtypes of slow wave/spindle events have distinct cortical propagation patterns and differ in their distribution across lighter versus deeper NREM sleep. Future efforts to understand how slow wave sleep and slow wave/spindle coupling impact memory performance and neurological disease may benefit from examining the composition of SWA to avoid potential confounds that may occur when comparing dissimilar neurophysiological events.

                Many social species are embedded on social networks, including our own. The structure of social networks shapes our decisions by constraining what information we learn and from whom. But how does the brain incorporate social network structures into learning and decision-making processes, and how does learning in networked environments differ from learning from isolated partners? Combining a real-time distributed learning task with computational modeling, fMRI, and social network analysis, we investigated the process by which humans learn from observing others' decisions on 7-node networks with varying topological structures. We show that learning on social networks can be realized by means similar to the well-established reinforcement learning algorithm, supported by an action prediction error encoded in the lateral prefrontal cortex. Importantly, learning is flexibly weighted toward well-connected neighbors, according to activity in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, but only insofar as neighbors' actions vary in their informativeness. These data suggest a neurocomputational mechanism of network-dependent filtering on the sources of information, which may give rise to biased learning and the spread of misinformation in an interconnected society.

                Quadripulse stimulation (QPS) is a promising patterned repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation protocol, which allows the modulation of brain activity for over one hour after the stimulation. Recently, Deymed Diagnostic developed a new stimulator specifically designed to deliver QPS (DuoMAG MP-Quad, https://deymed.com/duomag-qps). The properties of the after-effect with this new stimulator were expected to parallel those obtained with another stimulator, the Magstim stimulator, which is currently used in the psychological and clinical research but not commercially available anymore. Nevertheless, experimental validation of DuoMAG MP-Quad was still warranted. We thus studied the QPS after-effect induced by this stimulator. As a result, motor evoked potentials were found to be bidirectionally modulated by the QPS for more than one hour, consistent with previous studies using the Magstim stimulator. Moreover, the degree of the after-effect was comparable to the after-effect induced by the other stimulator. Taken together, we conclude that the newly developed QPS stimulator is as effective as the Magstim stimulator.

                Mixed affective states in bipolar disorder is a common psychiatric condition that occurs when symptoms of the two opposite poles coexist during an episode of mania or depression. There exist many strategies to attempt to model the mood variations of patients with bipolar disorder (BD) as recently reviewed in [14]. A four dimensional model by A. Goldbeter [28, 29] rests upon the notion that manic and depressive symptoms are produced by two competing and auto-inhibited neural networks. Some of the rich dynamics that this model can produce, include complex rhythms formed by both small-amplitude (subthreshold) and large-amplitude (suprathreshold) oscillations and could correspond to mixed bipolar states. These rhythms are commonly referred to as mixed mode oscillations (MMOs) and they have already been studied in different contexts ranging from neurons' electrical activity [7] to oscillatory chemical reactions [51]. In order to accurately explain these dynamics one has to apply a mathematical apparatus that is making full use of the timescale separation between variables. Here we apply this very framework to the model of BD from [28,29] in order to understand the mathematical mechanisms underpinning the observed dynamics of changing mood using multiple-timescale dynamics. We show that the observed complex oscillations can be understood as MMOs due to a so-called folded-node singularity. Moreover we explore the bifurcation structure of the system with respect to two meaningful parameters and we provide possible biological interpretations of our findings. Furthermore, we show the possibility of deterministic chaos in this system and the robustness of the MMOs regime to stochastic noise. Finally, we propose a reduction of the original 4D model to a minimal three-dimensional model which, with the addition of noise, exhibits similar yet purely noise-driven dynamics. The broader significance of this work is to introduce mathematical tools that could be used to analyse and potentially control future, more biologically grounded models of BD.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Two mosquito odorant receptors with reciprocal specificity mediated by a single amino acid residue</a></h4>

              
                Insects perceive the environment with a repertoire of promiscuous and narrowly tuned odorant receptors (ORs). The southern house mosquito, Culex quinquefasciatus, utilizes two ORs, CquiOR10 and CquiOR2, which are narrowly tuned and well conserved among mosquito species. They detect the oviposition attractants skatole and indole, respectively, with reciprocal specificity. We envisioned that by reverting specificity with chimeric receptors, we could gain a better insight into the specificity determinants of insect ORs. We swapped the seven transmembrane (TM) domains of CquiOR10 and CquiOR2 and identified TM2 as a specificity determinant. With additional mutations, we showed that CquiOR10A73L behaved like CquiOR2. Conversely, CquiOR2L74A recapitulated CquiOR10 specificity. Next, we generated structural models of CquiOR10 and CquiOR10A73L using RoseTTAFold and AlphaFold and docked skatole and indole using RosettaLigand. These modeling studies suggested space-filling constraints around A73, although this residue in CquiOR10 did not directly form contacts with skatole or indole. Consistent with this hypothesis, CquiOR10 mutants with a bulkier residue (Ile, Val) were insensitive to skatole and indole, whereas CquiOR10A73G retained the specificity to skatole and showed a higher sensitivity than the wild-type receptor CquiOR10. On the other hand, Leu to Gly mutation of the indole receptor CquiOR2 reverted the specificity to skatole. Lastly, CquiOR10 was insensitive to 3-ethylindole, whereas CquiOR10A73G responded to the three ligands with 3-ethylindole eliciting a slightly higher response than indole. We then concluded that the specificity of these receptors is mediated by a single amino acid substitution leading to dilation or contraction of the binding pocket.

                The goal of this study was to evaluate changes in metabolic homeostasis during the first 12 weeks of recovery in a distal middle cerebral artery occlusion mouse model of stroke. To achieve this goal, we compared the brain metabolomes of ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres from aged male mice up to 12 weeks after stroke to that of age-matched naive and sham operated mice. There were 707 biochemicals detected in each sample by liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy (LC-MS). Mitochondrial fatty acid beta-oxidation, indicated by acyl carnitine levels, was increased in stroked tissue at 1 day and 4 weeks following stroke. Glucose and several glycolytic intermediates were elevated in the ipsilateral hemisphere for 12 weeks compared to the aged naive controls, but pyruvate was decreased. Additionally, itaconate, a glycolysis inhibitor associated with activation of anti-inflammatory mechanisms in myeloid cells, was higher in the same comparisons. These changes correlated with reduced levels of glutamate, dopamine, and adenosine in the ipsilateral hemisphere after stroke. These results indicate that chronic metabolic differences exist between stroked and control tissue, including alterations in fatty acid metabolism and glycolysis for at least 12 weeks after stroke.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Particle-Swarm Based Modelling Reveals Two Distinct Classes of CRHPVN Neurons</a></h4>

              
                Electrophysiological recordings can provide detailed information of single neurons' dynamical features and shed light into their response to stimuli. Unfortunately, rapidly modeling electrophysiological data for inferring network-level behaviours remains challenging. Here, we investigate how modeled single neuron dynamics lead to network-level responses in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN), a critical nucleus for the mammalian stress response. Recordings of corticotropin releasing hormone neurons from the PVN (CRHPVN) were performed using whole-cell current-clamp. These, neurons, which initiate the endocrine response to stress, were rapidly and automatically fit to a modified Adaptive Exponential Integrate and Fire model (AdEx) with Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). All CRHPVN neurons were accurately fit by the AdEx model with PSO. Multiple sets of parameters were found that reliably reproduced current clamp traces for any single neuron. Despite multiple solutions, the dynamical features of the models such as the rheobase current levels, fixed points, and bifurcations, were shown to be stable across fits. We found that CRHPVN neurons can be divided into two sub types according to their bifurcation at the onset of firing: saddles (integrators) and sub-critical Hopf (resonators). We constructed networks of these fit CRHPVN model neurons to investigate the network level responses of CRHPVN neurons. We found that CRHPVN-resonators maintain baseline firing in networks even when all inputs are inhibitory. The dynamics of a small subset of CRHPVN neurons may be critical to maintaining a baseline firing tone in the PVN.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neural activity in the anterior cingulate cortex is required for effort-based decision making</a></h4>

              
                Adaptive decision making requires the evaluation of cost-benefit tradeoffs to guide action selection. Effort-based decision making involves weighing predicted gains against effort costs and is disrupted in several neuropsychiatric disorders. The ACC is postulated to control effort-base choice via its role in encoding the value of overcoming effort costs in rodent effort-based decision making assays. However, temporally precise methods of manipulating neural activity have rarely been applied to effort-based decision making. We developed and validated a mouse version of the barrier T-maze, and used optogenetics to inhibit ACC excitatory neurons at specific times during this task. Bilateral inhibition of ACC rapidly and reversibly impaired preference to exert greater effort for a larger reward when a less rewarded, low effort alternative was available. Equalizing effort for potential choice options led mice to choose the high reward arm of the maze regardless of whether the ACC was inhibited or not. The mechanics of choice behavior were altered during trials where the ACC was inhibited, but there were no effects on overall mobility or tendency to exert effort in an unrelated assay. These findings establish causality between ACC neural activity during a choice trial and effortful action selection during cost-benefit decision making.

                Prenatal opioid exposures lead to extensive cognitive and emotion-regulation problems in children, persisting at least through school-age. Methadone, an opioid typically used for the treatment of opioid use disorder, has been approved for use in pregnant women for several decades. Importantly, however, the impacts of prenatal methadone exposure (PME), particularly on offspring as they progress into adulthood, has not been extensively examined. In recent years, children and young animal models have shown cognitive deficits related to PME, including evidence of hippocampal dysfunction. The present work aims to examine the persistent nature of these deficits, as well as determine how they may differ by sex. Pregnant Sprague Dawley rats either received subcutaneous methadone or water injections twice daily from gestational days 3-20 or were left undisturbed. Following postnatal day 70, male and female offspring were behaviorally tested for impairments in recognition memory using the Novel Object Recognition task and working spatial memory through Spontaneous Alternation. Additionally, using whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology, hippocampal dentate granule cell function was examined in adult offspring. Results indicate that methadone-exposed females showed decreased excitability and increased inhibition of these dentate granule cells, while males did not. These findings were accompanied by impairments in female working spatial memory and impaired recognition memory of both sexes. Overall, this work supports the continued investigation of the long-term effects of PME on adult male and female learning and memory, as well as promotes further exploration of adult hippocampal function as a neural mechanism impacted by this exposure.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cellular Mechanisms Underlying Central Sensitization in a Mouse Model of Chronic Muscle Pain</a></h4>

              
                Chronic pain disorders are often associated with psychiatric symptoms. The central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) has emerged as an integrative hub for nociceptive and affective components during the development of central pain. Although the exact cause for this process remains unknown, prior adverse injuries are precipitating factors and thought to transform nociceptors into a primed state for chronic pain. However, the cellular basis underlying the primed state and the subsequent pain chronification remains unknown. Here, we investigated cellular and synaptic alterations of the CeA in a mouse model of chronic muscle pain. In these mice, local infusion of pregabalin, a clinically approved drug for fibromyalgia and other chronic pain disorders, into the CeA or selective inactivation of somatostatin-expressing CeA (CeA-SST) neurons during the priming phase prevented pain chronification. Further, electrophysiological recording revealed that CeA-SST neurons received increased excitatory transmission and showed enhanced excitability in chronic pain states. In line with the possible role of CeA-SST neurons in central sensitization, chemogenetic inactivation of CeA-SST neurons or pharmacological suppression of nociceptive afferents from the brainstem to CeA-SST neurons by pregabalin after the development of chronic muscle pain alleviated pain and negative emotions.

	<p>Hypersexuality is related to functions of personality and emotion and is a salient symptom of bipolar I disorder especially during manic episode. However, it is uncertain whether bipolar I disorder with (BW) and without (BO) hypersexuality exhibits different cerebral activations under external emotion stimuli. In 54 healthy volunteers, 27 BW and 26 BO patients, we administered the visual oddball event-related potentials (ERPs) under external emotions of Disgust, Erotica, Fear, Happiness, Neutral, and Sadness. Participants&amp;amp;rsquo; concurrent states of mania, hypomania, and depression were also evaluated. The N1 latencies under Erotica and Happiness were prolonged, and the P3b amplitudes under Fear and Sadness were decreased in BW; the P3b amplitudes under Fear were increased in BO. The parietal, frontal, and occipital activations were found in BW, and the frontal and temporal activations in BO under different external emotional stimuli, respectively. Some ERP components were correlated with the concurrent affective states in three groups of participants. The primary perception under Erotica and Happiness, and voluntary attention under Fear and Sadness, were impaired in BW, while the voluntary attention under Fear was impaired in BO. Our study indicates different patterns of visual attentional deficits under different external emotions in BW and BO.</p>

	<p>Sleep and Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) have repeatedly been found to be associated with each other. However, the ecological validity of daily life studies to examine the effect of sleep on ADHD symptoms is rarely made use of. In an ambulatory assessment study with measurement burst design, consisting of three bursts (each 6 months apart) of 18 days each, 70 German schoolchildren aged 10&amp;amp;ndash;12 years reported on their sleep quality each morning and on their subjective ADHD symptom levels as well as their sleepiness three times a day. It was hypothesized that nightly sleep quality is negatively associated with ADHD symptoms on the inter- as well as the intraindividual level. Thus, we expected children who sleep better to report higher attention and self-regulation. Additionally, sleepiness during the day was hypothesized to be positively associated with ADHD symptoms on both levels, meaning that when children are sleepier, they experience more ADHD symptoms. No association of sleep quality and ADHD symptoms between or within participants was found in multilevel analyses; also, no connection was found between ADHD symptoms and daytime sleepiness on the interindividual level. Unexpectedly, a negative association was found on the intraindividual level for ADHD symptoms and daytime sleepiness, indicating that in moments when children are sleepier during the day, they experience less ADHD symptoms. Explorative analyses showed differential links of nightly sleep quality and daytime sleepiness, with the core symptoms of inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity, respectively. Therefore, future analyses should take the factor structure of ADHD symptoms into account.</p>

	<p>More than a decade ago, deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the superolateral medial forebrain bundle (slMFB), as part of the greater MFB system, had been proposed as a putative yet experimental treatment strategy for therapy refractory depression (TRD) and later for obsessive&amp;amp;ndash;compulsive disorders (OCD). Antidepressant and anti-OCD efficacy have been shown in open case series and smaller trials and were independently replicated. The MFB is anato-physiologically confluent with the SEEKING system promoting euphoric drive, reward anticipation and reward; functions realized through the mesocorticolimbic dopaminergic system. Growing clinical experience concerning surgical and stimulation aspects from a larger number of patients shows an MFB functionality beyond SEEKING and now re-informs the scientific rationale concerning the MFB&amp;amp;rsquo;s (patho-) physiology. In this white paper, we combine observations from more than 75 cases of slMFB DBS. We integrate these observations with a selected literature review to provide a new neuroethological view on the MFB. We here formulate a re-interpretation of the MFB as the main structure of an integrated SEEKING/MAINTENANCE circuitry, allowing for individual homeostasis and well-being through emotional arousal, basic and higher affect valence, bodily reactions, motor programing, vigor and flexible behavior, as the basis for the antidepressant and anti-OCD efficacy.</p>

	<p>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and schizophrenia (SZ) are neuropsychiatric disorders that overlap in symptoms associated with social-cognitive impairment. Subcortical structures play a significant role in cognitive and social-emotional behaviors and their abnormalities are associated with neuropsychiatric conditions. This exploratory study utilized ABIDE II/COBRE MRI and corresponding phenotypic datasets to compare subcortical volumes of adults with ASD (n = 29), SZ (n = 51) and age and gender matched neurotypicals (NT). We examined the association between subcortical volumes and select behavioral measures to determine whether core symptomatology of disorders could be explained by subcortical association patterns. We observed volume differences in ASD (viz., left pallidum, left thalamus, left accumbens, right amygdala) but not in SZ compared to their respective NT controls, reflecting morphometric changes specific to one of the disorder groups. However, left hippocampus and amygdala volumes were implicated in both disorders. A disorder-specific negative correlation (r = &amp;amp;minus;0.39, p = 0.038) was found between left-amygdala and scores on the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) Social-Cognition in ASD, and a positive association (r = 0.29, p = 0.039) between full scale IQ (FIQ) and right caudate in SZ. Significant correlations between behavior measures and subcortical volumes were observed in NT groups (ASD-NT range; r = &amp;amp;minus;0.53 to &amp;amp;minus;0.52, p = 0.002 to 0.004, SZ-NT range; r = &amp;amp;minus;0.41 to &amp;amp;minus;0.32, p = 0.007 to 0.021) that were non-significant in the disorder groups. The overlap of subcortical volumes implicated in ASD and SZ may reflect common neurological mechanisms. Furthermore, the difference in correlation patterns between disorder and NT groups may suggest dysfunctional connectivity with cascading effects unique to each disorder and a potential role for IQ in mediating behavior and brain circuits.</p>

	<p>Already in newborns, the locus coeruleus (LC) controls multiple brain functions and may have a complex organization as in adults. Our findings in newborn rat brain slices indicate that LC neurons (i) generate at ~1 Hz a ~0.3 s-lasting local field potential (LFP) comprising summated phase-locked single spike discharge, (ii) express intrinsic &amp;amp;lsquo;pacemaker&amp;amp;rsquo; or &amp;amp;lsquo;burster&amp;amp;rsquo; properties and (iii) receive solely excitatory or initially excitatory&amp;amp;ndash;secondary inhibitory inputs. &amp;amp;mu;-opioid or &amp;amp;#593;2 noradrenaline receptor agonists block LFP rhythm at 100&amp;amp;ndash;250 nM whereas slightly lower doses transform its bell-shaped pattern into slower crescendo-shaped multipeak bursts. GABAA and glycine receptors hyperpolarize LC neurons to abolish rhythm which remains though unaffected by blocking them. Rhythm persists also during ionotropic glutamate receptor (iGluR) inhibition whereas &amp;amp;lt;10 mV depolarization during iGluR agonists accelerates spiking to cause subtype-specific fast (spindle-shaped) LFP oscillations. Similar modest neuronal depolarization causing a cytosolic Ca2+ rise occurs (without effect on neighboring astrocytes) during LFP acceleration by CNQX activating a TARP-AMPA-type iGluR complex. In contrast, noradrenaline lowers neuronal Ca2+ baseline via &amp;amp;#593;2 receptors, but evokes an &amp;amp;#593;1 receptor-mediated &amp;amp;lsquo;concentric&amp;amp;rsquo; astrocytic Ca2+ wave. In summary, the neonatal LC has a complex (possibly modular) organization to enable discharge pattern transformations that might facilitate discrete actions on target circuits.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Fast protein structure comparison through effective representation learning with contrastive graph neural networks</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Chunqiu Xia, Shi-Hao Feng, Ying Xia, Xiaoyong Pan, Hong-Bin Shen</p>

Protein structure alignment algorithms are often time-consuming, resulting in challenges for large-scale protein structure similarity-based retrieval. There is an urgent need for more efficient structure comparison approaches as the number of protein structures increases rapidly. In this paper, we propose an effective graph-based protein structure representation learning method, GraSR, for fast and accurate structure comparison. In GraSR, a graph is constructed based on the intra-residue distance derived from the tertiary structure. Then, deep graph neural networks (GNNs) with a short-cut connection learn graph representations of the tertiary structures under a contrastive learning framework. To further improve GraSR, a novel dynamic training data partition strategy and length-scaling cosine distance are introduced. We objectively evaluate our method GraSR on SCOPe v2.07 and a new released independent test set from PDB database with a designed comprehensive performance metric. Compared with other state-of-the-art methods, GraSR achieves about 7%-10% improvement on two benchmark datasets. GraSR is also much faster than alignment-based methods. We dig into the model and observe that the superiority of GraSR is mainly brought by the learned discriminative residue-level and global descriptors. The web-server and source code of GraSR are freely available at www.csbio.sjtu.edu.cn/bioinf/GraSR/ for academic use.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Oscillator decomposition of infant fNIRS data</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Takeru Matsuda, Fumitaka Homae, Hama Watanabe, Gentaro Taga, Fumiyasu Komaki</p>

The functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) can detect hemodynamic responses in the brain and the data consist of bivariate time series of oxygenated hemoglobin (oxy-Hb) and deoxygenated hemoglobin (deoxy-Hb) on each channel. In this study, we investigate oscillatory changes in infant fNIRS signals by using the oscillator decompisition method (OSC-DECOMP), which is a statistical method for extracting oscillators from time series data based on Gaussian linear state space models. OSC-DECOMP provides a natural decomposition of fNIRS data into oscillation components in a data-driven manner and does not require the arbitrary selection of band-pass filters. We analyzed 18-ch fNIRS data (3 minutes) acquired from 21 sleeping 3-month-old infants. Five to seven oscillators were extracted on most channels, and their frequency distribution had three peaks in the vicinity of 0.01-0.1 Hz, 1.6-2.4 Hz and 3.6-4.4 Hz. The first peak was considered to reflect hemodynamic changes in response to the brain activity, and the phase difference between oxy-Hb and deoxy-Hb for the associated oscillators was at approximately 230 degrees. The second peak was attributed to cardiac pulse waves and mirroring noise. Although these oscillators have close frequencies, OSC-DECOMP can separate them through estimating their different projection patterns on oxy-Hb and deoxy-Hb. The third peak was regarded as the harmonic of the second peak. By comparing the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) of two state space models, we determined that the time series of oxy-Hb and deoxy-Hb on each channel originate from common oscillatory activity. We also utilized the result of OSC-DECOMP to investigate the frequency-specific functional connectivity. Whereas the brain oscillator exhibited functional connectivity, the pulse waves and mirroring noise oscillators showed spatially homogeneous and independent changes. OSC-DECOMP is a promising tool for data-driven extraction of oscillation components from biological time series data.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Transcriptome diversity is a systematic source of variation in RNA-sequencing data</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Pablo E. García-Nieto, Ban Wang, Hunter B. Fraser</p>

RNA sequencing has been widely used as an essential tool to probe gene expression. While standard practices have been established to analyze RNA-seq data, it is still challenging to interpret and remove artifactual signals. Several biological and technical factors such as sex, age, batches, and sequencing technology have been found to bias these estimates. Probabilistic estimation of expression residuals (PEER), which infers broad variance components in gene expression measurements, has been used to account for some systematic effects, but it has remained challenging to interpret these PEER factors. Here we show that transcriptome diversity–a simple metric based on Shannon entropy–explains a large portion of variability in gene expression and is the strongest known factor encoded in PEER factors. We then show that transcriptome diversity has significant associations with multiple technical and biological variables across diverse organisms and datasets. In sum, transcriptome diversity provides a simple explanation for a major source of variation in both gene expression estimates and PEER covariates.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Ten simple rules for finding and selecting R packages</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Caroline J. Wendt, G. Brooke Anderson</p>

R is an increasingly preferred software environment for data analytics and statistical computing among scientists and practitioners. Packages markedly extend R’s utility and ameliorate inefficient solutions to data science problems. We outline 10 simple rules for finding relevant packages and determining which package is best for your desired use. We begin in Rule 1 with tips on how to consider your purpose, which will guide your search to follow, where, in Rule 2, you’ll learn best practices for finding and collecting options. Rules 3 and 4 will help you navigate packages’ profiles and explore the extent of their online resources, so that you can be confident in the quality of the package you choose and assured that you’ll be able to access support. In Rules 5 and 6, you’ll become familiar with how the R Community evaluates packages and learn how to assess the popularity and utility of packages for yourself. Rules 7 and 8 will teach you how to investigate and track package development processes, so you can further evaluate their merit. We end in Rules 9 and 10 with more hands-on approaches, which involve digging into package code.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Isotope-assisted metabolic flux analysis as an equality-constrained nonlinear program for improved scalability and robustness</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Daniel J. Lugar, Ganesh Sriram</p>

Stable isotope-assisted metabolic flux analysis (MFA) is a powerful method to estimate carbon flow and partitioning in metabolic networks. At its core, MFA is a parameter estimation problem wherein the fluxes and metabolite pool sizes are model parameters that are estimated, via optimization, to account for measurements of steady-state or isotopically-nonstationary isotope labeling patterns. As MFA problems advance in scale, they require efficient computational methods for fast and robust convergence. The structure of the MFA problem enables it to be cast as an equality-constrained nonlinear program (NLP), where the equality constraints are constructed from the MFA model equations, and the objective function is defined as the sum of squared residuals (SSR) between the model predictions and a set of labeling measurements. This NLP can be solved by using an algebraic modeling language (AML) that offers state-of-the-art optimization solvers for robust parameter estimation and superior scalability to large networks. When implemented in this manner, the optimization is performed with no distinction between state variables and model parameters. During each iteration of such an optimization, the system state is updated instead of being calculated explicitly from scratch, and this occurs concurrently with improvement in the model parameter estimates. This optimization approach starkly contrasts with traditional “shooting” methods where the state variables and model parameters are kept distinct and the system state is computed afresh during each iteration of a stepwise optimization. Our NLP formulation uses the MFA modeling framework of Wiechert et al. [1], which is amenable to incorporation of the model equations into an NLP. The NLP constraints consist of balances on either elementary metabolite units (EMUs) or cumomers. In this formulation, both the steady-state and isotopically-nonstationary MFA (inst-MFA) problems may be solved as an NLP. For the inst-MFA case, the ordinary differential equation (ODE) system describing the labeling dynamics is transcribed into a system of algebraic constraints for the NLP using collocation. This large-scale NLP may be solved efficiently using an NLP solver implemented on an AML. In our implementation, we used the reduced gradient solver CONOPT, implemented in the General Algebraic Modeling System (GAMS). The NLP framework is particularly advantageous for inst-MFA, scaling well to large networks with many free parameters, and having more robust convergence properties compared to the shooting methods that compute the system state and sensitivities at each iteration. Additionally, this NLP approach supports the use of tandem-MS data for both steady-state and inst-MFA when the cumomer framework is used. We assembled a software, eiFlux, written in Python and GAMS that uses the NLP approach and supports both steady-state and inst-MFA. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the NLP formulation on several examples, including a genome-scale inst-MFA model, to highlight the scalability and robustness of this approach. In addition to typical inst-MFA applications, we expect that this framework and our associated software, eiFlux, will be particularly useful for applying inst-MFA to complex MFA models, such as those developed for eukaryotes (e.g. algae) and co-cultures with multiple cell types.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Cortical oscillations support sampling-based computations in spiking neural networks</a></h4>

Being permanently confronted with an uncertain world, brains have faced evolutionary pressure to represent this uncertainty in order to respond appropriately. Often, this requires visiting multiple interpretations of the available information or multiple solutions to an encountered problem. This gives rise to the so-called mixing problem: since all of these “valid” states represent powerful attractors, but between themselves can be very dissimilar, switching between such states can be difficult. We propose that cortical oscillations can be effectively used to overcome this challenge. By acting as an effective temperature, background spiking activity modulates exploration. Rhythmic changes induced by cortical oscillations can then be interpreted as a form of simulated tempering. We provide a rigorous mathematical discussion of this link and study some of its phenomenological implications in computer simulations. This identifies a new computational role of cortical oscillations and connects them to various phenomena in the brain, such as sampling-based probabilistic inference, memory replay, multisensory cue combination, and place cell flickering.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Cortical softening elicits zygotic contractility during mouse preimplantation development</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Özge Özgüç, Ludmilla de Plater, Varun Kapoor, Anna Francesca Tortorelli, Andrew G. Clark, Jean-Léon Maître</p>

Actomyosin contractility is a major engine of preimplantation morphogenesis, which starts at the 8-cell stage during mouse embryonic development. Contractility becomes first visible with the appearance of periodic cortical waves of contraction (PeCoWaCo), which travel around blastomeres in an oscillatory fashion. How contractility of the mouse embryo becomes active remains unknown. We have taken advantage of PeCoWaCo to study the awakening of contractility during preimplantation development. We find that PeCoWaCo become detectable in most embryos only after the second cleavage and gradually increase their oscillation frequency with each successive cleavage. To test the influence of cell size reduction during cleavage divisions, we use cell fusion and fragmentation to manipulate cell size across a 20- to 60-μm range. We find that the stepwise reduction in cell size caused by cleavage divisions does not explain the presence of PeCoWaCo or their accelerating rhythm. Instead, we discover that blastomeres gradually decrease their surface tensions until the 8-cell stage and that artificially softening cells enhances PeCoWaCo prematurely. We further identify the programmed down-regulation of the formin Fmnl3 as a required event to soften the cortex and expose PeCoWaCo. Therefore, during cleavage stages, cortical softening, mediated by Fmnl3 down-regulation, awakens zygotic contractility before preimplantation morphogenesis.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Structural dynamics of receptor recognition and pH-induced dissociation of full-length Clostridioides difficile Toxin B</a></h4>

<i>Clostridioides difficile</i> secretes Toxin B (TcdB) as one of its major virulence factors, which binds to intestinal epithelial and subepithelial receptors, including frizzled proteins and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan 4 (CSPG4). Here, we present cryo-EM structures of full-length TcdB in complex with the CSPG4 domain 1 fragment (D1<sub>401-560</sub>) at cytosolic pH and the cysteine-rich domain of frizzled-2 (CRD2) at both cytosolic and acidic pHs. CSPG4 specifically binds to the autoprocessing and delivery domains of TcdB via networks of salt bridges, hydrophobic and aromatic/proline interactions, which are disrupted upon acidification eventually leading to CSPG4 drastically dissociating from TcdB. In contrast, FZD2 moderately dissociates from TcdB under acidic pH, most likely due to its partial unfolding. These results reveal structural dynamics of TcdB during its preentry step upon endosomal acidification, which provide a basis for developing therapeutics against <i>C</i>. <i>difficile</i> infections.

The circadian clock is an evolutionarily highly conserved endogenous timing program that structures physiology and behavior according to the time of day. Disruption of circadian rhythms is associated with many common pathologies. The emerging field of circadian medicine aims to exploit the mechanisms of circadian physiology and clock–disease interaction for clinical diagnosis, treatment, and prevention. In this Essay, we outline the principle approaches of circadian medicine, highlight the development of the field in selected areas, and point out open questions and challenges. Circadian medicine has unambiguous health benefits over standard care but is rarely utilized. It is time for clock biology to become an integrated part of translational research.

The aim of this study was to longitudinally evaluate humoral and cellular response to SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine in ocrelizumab-treated pwMS before and following a third vaccine dose. Following the third vaccine dose, patients who are low or nonresponders following initial vaccination did not increase antibody titers. In healthy controls and ocrelizumab-treated pwMS, cellular response decreased 6 months after initial vaccination and increased significantly after the third dose. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

     alt="Secretagogin in the brain and pituitary of the catfish, Clarias batrachus: Molecular characterization and regulation by insulin"/>
<p>Expression and significance of secretagogin (scgn) in the brain of catfish, <i>Clarias batrachus</i>. Three scgn transcript variants were found in the brain of <i>C. batrachus</i>. Two of these transcript variants predicted to encode a putative 272 aa protein, comparable to that found in teleosts and fully capable of Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding. Cells expressing scgn showed wide distribution in the brain and pituitary. None of the hypophysiotropic dopamine neurons but a great majority of the isotocin and vasotocin neurons coexpressed scgn. Distinct scgn neurons/fibers were observed in the entopeduncular nucleus (EN, arrow) in the ventral telencephalon. Intracranial insulin enhanced scgn expression in EN neurons.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Secretagogin (scgn), is a novel hexa EF-hand, phylogenetically conserved calcium-binding protein. It serves as Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor and participates in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-signaling and neuroendocrine regulation in mammals. However, its relevance in the brain of non-mammalian vertebrates has largely remained unexplored. To address this issue, we studied the cDNA encoding scgn, <i>scgn</i> mRNA expression, and distribution of scgn-equipped elements in the brain and pituitary of a teleost, <i>Clarias batrachus</i> (<i>cb</i>). The <i>cbscgn</i> cDNA consists of three transcripts (T) variants: T1 (2185 bp), T2 (2151 bp) and T3 (2060 bp). While 816 bp ORF in T1 and T2 encodes highly conserved six EF-hand 272 aa protein fully capable of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding, 726-bp ORF in T3 encodes 242 aa protein. The T1 showed &gt;90% and &gt;70% identity with scgn of catfishes, and other teleosts and mammals, respectively. The T1-mRNA was widely expressed in the brain and pituitary, while the expression of T3 was restricted to the telencephalon. Application of the anti-scgn antiserum revealed a ∼32 kDa scgn-immunoreactive (scgn-i) band (known molecular weight of scgn) in the forebrain tissue, and immunohistochemically labeled neurons in the olfactory epithelium and bulb, telencephalon, preoptic area, hypothalamus, thalamus, and hindbrain. In the pituitary, scgn-i cells were seen in the pars distalis and intermedia. Insulin is reported to regulate <i>scgn</i> mRNA in the mammalian hippocampus, and feeding-related neuropeptides in the telencephalon of teleost. Intracranial injection of insulin significantly increased T1-mRNA expression and scgn-immunoreactivity in the telencephalon. We suggest that scgn may be an important player in the regulation of olfactory, neuroendocrine system, and energy balance functions in <i>C. batrachus</i>.</p>

                Logistic regressions are the primary method to analyze choice behavior in decision neuroscience studies. In this primer, Padoa-Schioppa describes how logistic analysis can quantify a variety of behavioral traits. He also discusses the assumptions and interpretations of different logistic models.

                Knowledge about the impact of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection of the elderly on mRNA vaccination response is needed to appropriately address the demand for additional vaccinations in this vulnerable population. Here we show that octogenarians, a high-risk population, mount a sustained SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific IgG antibody response for 15 months following infection. This response boosts antibody levels 35-fold upon receiving a single dose of BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine 15 months after recovery from COVID-19.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The enteric nervous system of the C. elegans pharynx is specified by the Sine oculis-like homeobox gene ceh-34</a></h4>

              
                Overarching themes in the terminal differentiation of the enteric nervous system, an autonomously acting unit of animal nervous systems, have so far eluded discovery. We describe here the overall regulatory logic of enteric nervous system differentiation of the nematode <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> that resides within the foregut (pharynx) of the worm. A <i>C. elegans</i> homolog of the <i>Drosophila</i> Sine oculis homeobox gene, <i>ceh-34</i>, is expressed in all 14 classes of interconnected pharyngeal neurons from their birth throughout their life time, but in no other neuron type of the entire animal. Constitutive and temporally controlled <i>ceh-34</i> removal shows that <i>ceh-34</i> is required to initiate and maintain the neuron type-specific terminal differentiation program of all pharyngeal neuron classes, including their circuit assembly. Through additional genetic loss of function analysis, we show that within each pharyngeal neuron class, <i>ceh-34</i> cooperates with different homeodomain transcription factors to individuate distinct pharyngeal neuron classes. Our analysis underscores the critical role of homeobox genes in neuronal identity specification and links them to the control of neuronal circuit assembly of the enteric nervous system. Together with the pharyngeal nervous system simplicity as well as its specification by a Sine oculis homolog, our findings invite speculations about the early evolution of nervous systems.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Conformational dynamics and allosteric modulation of the SARS-CoV-2 spike</a></h4>

              
                Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infects cells through binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). This interaction is mediated by the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the viral spike (S) glycoprotein. Structural and dynamic data have shown that S can adopt multiple conformations, which controls the exposure of the ACE2-binding site in the RBD. Here, using single-molecule Förster resonance energy transfer (smFRET) imaging we report the effects of ACE2 and antibody binding on the conformational dynamics of S from the Wuhan-1 strain and in the presence of the D614G mutation. We find that D614G modulates the energetics of the RBD position in a manner similar to ACE2 binding. We also find that antibodies that target diverse epitopes, including those distal to the RBD, stabilize the RBD in a position competent for ACE2 binding. Parallel solution-based binding experiments using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) indicate antibody-mediated enhancement of ACE2 binding. These findings inform on novel strategies for therapeutic antibody cocktails.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Remodeling of dermal adipose tissue alleviates cutaneous toxicity induced by anti-EGFR therapy</a></h4>

              
                Anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) therapy–associated cutaneous toxicity is a syndrome characterized by papulopustular rash, local inflammation, folliculitis, and microbial infection, resulting in a decrease in quality of life and dose interruption. However, no effective clinical intervention is available for this adverse effect. Here, we report the atrophy of dermal white adipose tissue (dWAT), a highly plastic adipose tissue with various skin-specific functions, correlates with rash occurrence and exacerbation in a murine model of EGFR inhibitor-induced rash. The reduction in dWAT is due to the inhibition of adipogenic differentiation by defects in peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) signaling, and increased lipolysis by the induced expression of the lipolytic cytokine IL6. The activation of PPARγ by rosiglitazone maintains adipogenic differentiation and represses the transcription of IL6, eventually improving skin functions and ameliorating the severity of rash without altering the antitumor effects. Thus, activation of PPARγ represents a promising approach to ameliorate cutaneous toxicity in patients with cancer who receive anti-EGFR therapy.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Beneficial impacts of neuromuscular electrical stimulation on muscle structure and function in the zebrafish model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy</a></h4>

              
                Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) allows activation of muscle fibers in the absence of voluntary force generation. NMES could have the potential to promote muscle homeostasis in the context of muscle disease, but the impacts of NMES on diseased muscle are not well understood. We used the zebrafish Duchenne muscular dystrophy (<i>dmd</i>) mutant and a longitudinal design to elucidate the consequences of NMES on muscle health. We designed four neuromuscular stimulation paradigms loosely based on weightlifting regimens. Each paradigm differentially affected neuromuscular structure, function, and survival. Only endurance neuromuscular stimulation (eNMES) improved all outcome measures. We found that eNMES improves muscle and neuromuscular junction morphology, swimming, and survival. Heme oxygenase and integrin alpha7 are required for eNMES-mediated improvement. Our data indicate that neuromuscular stimulation can be beneficial, suggesting that the right type of activity may benefit patients with muscle disease.

A systemic state of stress characterized by low-grade inflammation and pathological formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) usually manifests in obesity. The transcription factor nuclear factor erythroid-derived 2-like 2 (NRF2) is the master regulator of the redox homeostasis and plays a critical role in the resolution of inflammation. Here, we show that the natural isothiocyanate and potent NRF2 activator sulforaphane reverses diet-induced obesity through a predominantly, but not exclusively, NRF2-dependent mechanism that requires a functional leptin receptor signaling and hyperleptinemia. Sulforaphane does not reduce the body weight or food intake of lean mice but induces an anorectic response when coadministered with exogenous leptin. Leptin-deficient <i>Lep<sup>ob/ob</sup></i> mice and leptin receptor mutant <i>Lepr<sup>db/db</sup></i> mice display resistance to the weight-reducing effect of sulforaphane, supporting the conclusion that the antiobesity effect of sulforaphane requires functional leptin receptor signaling. Furthermore, our results suggest the skeletal muscle as the most notable site of action of sulforaphane whose peripheral NRF2 action signals to alleviate leptin resistance. Transcriptional profiling of six major metabolically relevant tissues highlights that sulforaphane suppresses fatty acid synthesis while promoting ribosome biogenesis, reducing ROS accumulation, and resolving inflammation, therefore representing a unique transcriptional program that leads to protection from obesity. Our findings argue for clinical evaluation of sulforaphane for weight loss and obesity-associated metabolic disorders.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The inherent flexibility of receptor binding domains in SARS-CoV-2 spike protein</a></h4>

              
                Spike (S) protein is the primary antigenic target for neutralization and vaccine development for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It decorates the virus surface and undergoes large motions of its receptor binding domains (RBDs) to enter the host cell. Here, we observe Down, one-Up, one-Open, and two-Up-like structures in enhanced molecular dynamics simulations, and characterize the transition pathways via inter-domain interactions. Transient salt-bridges between RBD<sub>A</sub> and RBD<sub>C</sub> and the interaction with glycan at N343<sub>B</sub> support RBD<sub>A</sub> motions from Down to one-Up. Reduced interactions between RBD<sub>A</sub> and RBD<sub>B</sub> in one-Up induce RBD<sub>B</sub> motions toward two-Up. The simulations overall agree with cryo-EM structure distributions and FRET experiments and provide hidden functional structures, namely, intermediates along Down to one-Up transition with druggable cryptic pockets as well as one-Open with a maximum exposed RBD. The inherent flexibility of S-protein thus provides essential information for antiviral drug rational design or vaccine development.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Lack of Tgfbr1 and Acvr1b synergistically stimulates myofibre hypertrophy and accelerates muscle regeneration</a></h4>

              
                In skeletal muscle, transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) family growth factors, TGF-β1 and myostatin, are involved in atrophy and muscle wasting disorders. Simultaneous interference with their signalling pathways may improve muscle function, however little is known about their individual and combined receptor signalling. Here we show that inhibition of TGF-β signalling by simultaneous muscle-specific knockout of TGF-β type I receptors <i>Tgfbr1</i> and <i>Acvr1b</i> in mice, induces substantial hypertrophy, while such effect does not occur by single receptor knockout. Hypertrophy is induced by increased phosphorylation of Akt and p70S6K and reduced E3 ligases expression, while myonuclear number remains unaltered. Combined knockout of both TGF-β type I receptors increases the number of satellite cells, macrophages and improves regeneration post cardiotoxin-induced injury by stimulating myogenic differentiation. Extra cellular matrix gene expression is exclusively elevated in muscle with combined receptor knockout. <i>Tgfbr1</i> and <i>Acvr1b</i> are synergistically involved in regulation of myofibre size, regeneration and collagen deposition.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Drug targeting Nsp1-ribosomal complex shows antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2</a></h4>

              
                The SARS-CoV-2 non-structural protein 1 (Nsp1) contains an N-terminal domain and C-terminal helices connected by a short linker region. The C-terminal helices of Nsp1 (Nsp1-C-ter) from SARS-CoV-2 bind in the mRNA entry channel of the 40S ribosomal subunit and blocks mRNA entry, thereby shutting down host protein synthesis. Nsp1 suppresses host immune function and is vital for viral replication. Hence, Nsp1 appears to be an attractive target for therapeutics. In this study, we have <i>in silico</i> screened Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs against Nsp1-C-ter. Among the top hits obtained, montelukast sodium hydrate binds to Nsp1 with a binding affinity (K<sub>D</sub>) of 10.8±0.2 µM <i>in vitro</i>. It forms a stable complex with Nsp1-C-ter in simulation runs with -95.8±13.3 kJ/mol binding energy. Montelukast sodium hydrate also rescues the inhibitory effect of Nsp1 in host protein synthesis, as demonstrated by the expression of firefly luciferase reporter gene in cells. Importantly, it shows antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 with reduced viral replication in HEK cells expressing ACE2 and Vero-E6 cells. We, therefore, propose montelukast sodium hydrate can be used as a lead molecule to design potent inhibitors to help combat SARS-CoV-2 infection.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Distinct Neurexin-Cerebellin Complexes Control AMPA-and NMDA-Receptor Responses in a Circuit-Dependent Manner</a></h4>

              
                At mature CA1[-&gt;]subiculum synapses, alternatively spliced SS4+ variants of neurexin-1 (Nrxn1SS4+) and neurexin-3 (Nrxn3SS4+) enhance NMDA- and suppress AMPA-receptors, respectively. Both Nrxn1SS4+ and Nrxn3SS4+ act by binding to secreted cerebellin-2 (Cbln2) that in turn activates postsynaptic GluD1, which is homologous to AMPA- and NMDA-receptors. Whether neurexin-Cbln2-GluD1 signaling complexes have additional functions in synapse formation besides regulating NMDA- and AMPA-receptors, and whether they perform similar roles at other synapses, remains unknown. Using constitutive Cbln2 deletions, we here demonstrate that at CA1[-&gt;]subiculum synapses, Cbln2 performs no additional developmental functions besides regulating AMPA- and NMDA-receptors. Moreover, we show that low-level expression of Cbln1, which is functionally redundant with Cbln2, does not compensate for a synapse-formation function of Cbln2 at CA1[-&gt;]subiculum synapses. In exploring the generality of these findings, we found that in prefrontal cortex, Nrxn1SS4+-Cbln2 signaling selectively regulates NMDA-receptors, whereas Nrxn3SS4+-Cbln2 signaling has no apparent role. In contrast, in the cerebellum Nrxn3SS4+-Cbln1 signaling regulates AMPA-receptors, whereas now Nrxn1SS4+-Cbln1 signaling has no manifest effect. Thus, Nrxn1SS4+- and Nrxn3SS4+-Cbln1/2 signaling complexes generally control NMDA- and AMPA-receptors in different synapses without regulating synapse formation, but these signaling complexes are differentially active in diverse neural circuits.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Dynamic firing patterns of ventral hippocampal neurons govern anxiety-dependent behaviour and predict the extent of exploration of an anxiogenic location</a></h4>

              
                The ventral hippocampus (vH) plays a key role for anxiety-related behaviour and vH neurons increase their firing when animals explore anxiogenic environments. However, if and how such neuronal activity induces or restricts the exploration of an anxiogenic location remains unexplained. Here, we developed a novel behavioural paradigm to motivate rats to explore an anxiogenic location. Rats ran along an elevated linear maze with protective sidewalls, which were temporarily removed in parts of the track to introduce a novel anxiogenic location. We recorded neuronal action potentials during task performance and found that vH neurons exhibited remapping of activity, overrepresenting novel anxiogenic locations. Direction-dependent firing was homogenised by the anxiogenic experience. We further showed that the activity of vH neurons predicted the extent of exploration of the anxiogenic location. Our data suggest that anxiety-related firing does not solely depend on the exploration of anxiogenic environments, but also on intentions to explore them.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neural and cognitive correlates of performance in dynamic multi-modal settings</a></h4>

              
                The endeavour to understand human cognition has largely relied upon investigation of task-related brain activity. However, resting-state brain activity can also offer insights into individual information processing and performance capabilities. Previous research has identified electroencephalographic resting-state characteristics (most prominently: the individual alpha frequency; IAF) that predict cognitive function. However, it has largely overlooked a second component of electrophysiological signals: aperiodic 1/f activity. The current study examined how both oscillatory and aperiodic resting-state EEG measures, alongside traditional cognitive tests, can predict performance in a dynamic and complex, semi-naturalistic cognitive task. Participants resting-state EEG was recorded prior to engaging in a Target Motion Analysis (TMA) task in a simulated submarine control room environment (CRUSE), which required participants to integrate dynamically changing information over time. We demonstrated that the relationship between IAF and cognitive performance extends from simple cognitive tasks (e.g., digit span) to complex, dynamic measures of information processing. Further, our results showed that individual 1/f parameters (slope and intercept) differentially predicted performance across practice and testing sessions, whereby flatter slopes were associated with improved performance during learning, while higher intercepts were linked to better performance during testing. In addition to the EEG predictors, we demonstrate a link between cognitive skills most closely related to the TMA task (i.e., spatial imagery) and subsequent performance. Overall, the current study highlights (1) how resting-state metrics - both oscillatory and aperiodic - have the potential to index higher-order cognitive capacity, while (2) emphasising the importance of examining these electrophysiological components within more dynamic settings and over time.

	<p>Transcranial direct-current stimulation (tDCS) over the prefrontal cortex can improve signs of consciousness in patients in a minimally conscious state. Transcranial pulsed-current stimulation (tPCS) over the mastoids can modulate brain activity and connectivity in healthy controls. This study investigated the feasibility of tPCS as a therapeutic tool in patients with disorders of consciousness (DoC) and compared its neurophysiological and behavioral effects with prefrontal tDCS. This pilot study was a randomized, double-blind sham-controlled clinical trial with three sessions: bi-mastoid tPCS, prefrontal tDCS, and sham. Electroencephalography (EEG) and behavioral assessments were collected before and after each stimulation session. Post minus pre differences were compared using Kruskal&amp;amp;ndash;Wallis and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests. Twelve patients with DoC were included in the study (eight females, four traumatic brain injury, 50.3 &amp;amp;plusmn; 14 y.o., 8.8 &amp;amp;plusmn; 10.5 months post-injury). We did not observe any side-effects following tPCS, nor tDCS, and confirmed their feasibility and safety. We did not find a significant effect of the stimulation on EEG nor behavioral outcomes for tPCS. However, consistent with prior findings, our exploratory analyses suggest that tDCS induces behavioral improvements and an increase in theta frontal functional connectivity.</p>

	<p>Cardiorespiratory or aerobic exercise immediately after practice of an upper-extremity motor skill task can facilitate skill consolidation, as demonstrated by enhanced performances at 24 h and 7-day retention tests. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of acute cardiorespiratory exercise on motor skill consolidation when skill practice involved low and high levels of contextual interference introduced through repetitive and interleaved practice schedules, respectively. Forty-eight young healthy adults were allocated to one of four groups who performed either repetitive or interleaved practice of a pinch grip motor sequence task, followed by either a period of seated rest or a bout of high-intensity interval cycling. At pre- and post-practice and 24 h and 7-day retention tests, we assessed motor skill performance and &amp;amp;beta;-band (15&amp;amp;ndash;35 Hz) intermuscular coherence using surface electromyography (EMG) collected from the abductor pollicis brevis and first dorsal interosseous. At the 7-day retention test, off-line consolidation was enhanced in the cardiorespiratory exercise relative to the rest group, but only among individuals who performed interleaved motor skill practice (p = 0.02). Similarly, at the 7-day retention test, &amp;amp;beta;-band intermuscular coherence increased to a greater extent in the exercise group than in the rest group for those who performed interleaved practice (p = 0.02). Under the present experimental conditions, cardiorespiratory exercise preferentially supported motor skill consolidation and change in intermuscular coherence when motor skill practice involved higher rather than lower levels of contextual interference.</p>

	<p>Myelin in humans is composed of about 80% lipids and 20% protein. Initially, myelin protein composition was considered low, but various recent proteome analyses have identified additional myelin proteins. Although, the myelin proteome is qualitatively and quantitatively identified through complementary proteomic approaches, the corresponding Protein&amp;amp;ndash;Protein Interaction (PPI) network of myelin is not yet available. In the present work, the PPI network was constructed based on available experimentally supported protein interactions of myelin in PPI databases. The network comprised 2017 PPIs between 567 myelin proteins. Interestingly, structure-based in silico analysis revealed that 20% of the myelin proteins that are interconnected in the proposed PPI network are metal-binding proteins/enzymes that construct the main sub-PPI network of myelin proteome. Finally, the PPI networks of the myelin proteome and sub-metalloproteome were analyzed ontologically to identify the biochemical processes of the myelin proteins and the interconnectivity of myelin-associated diseases in the interactomes. The presented PPI dataset could provide a useful resource to the scientific community to further our understanding of human myelin biology and serve as a basis for future studies of myelin-related neurological diseases and particular autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis where myelin epitopes are implicated.</p>

	<p>Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) plays a critical role in the capacity for neuroplastic change. A single nucleotide polymorphism of the BDNF gene is well known to alter the activity-dependent release of the protein and may impact the capacity for neuroplastic change. Numerous studies have shown altered sensorimotor beta event-related desynchronization (ERD) responses in youth with cerebral palsy (CP), which is thought to be directly related to motor planning. The objective of the current investigation was to use magnetoencephalography (MEG) to evaluate whether the BDNF genotype affects the strength of the sensorimotor beta ERD seen in youth with CP while youth with CP performed a leg isometric target matching task. In addition, we collected saliva samples and used polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification to determine the status of the amino acid fragment containing codon 66 of the BDNF gene. Our genotyping results identified that 25% of the youth with CP had a Val66Met or Met66Met polymorphism at codon 66 of the BDNF gene. Furthermore, we identified that the beta ERD was stronger in youth with CP who had the Val66Met or Met66Met polymorphism in comparison to those without the polymorphism (p = 0.042). Overall, these novel findings suggest that a polymorphism at the BDNF gene may alter sensorimotor cortical oscillations in youth with CP.</p>

	<p>Previous research suggests that predictive mechanisms are essential in perceiving social interactions. However, these studies did not isolate action prediction (a priori expectations about how partners in an interaction react to one another) from action integration (a posteriori processing of both partner&amp;amp;rsquo;s actions). This study investigated action prediction during social interactions while controlling for integration confounds. Twenty participants viewed 3D animations depicting an action&amp;amp;ndash;reaction interaction between two actors. At the start of each action&amp;amp;ndash;reaction interaction, one actor performs a social action. Immediately after, instead of presenting the other actor&amp;amp;rsquo;s reaction, a black screen covers the animation for a short time (occlusion duration) until a still frame depicting a precise moment of the reaction is shown (reaction frame). The moment shown in the reaction frame is either temporally aligned with the occlusion duration or deviates by 150 ms or 300 ms. Fifty percent of the action&amp;amp;ndash;reaction trials were semantically congruent, and the remaining were incongruent, e.g., one actor offers to shake hands, and the other reciprocally shakes their hand (congruent action&amp;amp;ndash;reaction) versus one actor offers to shake hands, and the other leans down (incongruent action&amp;amp;ndash;reaction). Participants made fast congruency judgments. We hypothesized that judging the congruency of action&amp;amp;ndash;reaction sequences is aided by temporal predictions. The findings supported this hypothesis; linear speed-accuracy scores showed that congruency judgments were facilitated by a temporally aligned occlusion duration, and reaction frames compared to 300 ms deviations, thus suggesting that observers internally simulate the temporal unfolding of an observed social interction. Furthermore, we explored the link between participants with higher autistic traits and their sensitivity to temporal deviations. Overall, the study offers new evidence of prediction mechanisms underpinning the perception of social interactions in isolation from action integration confounds.</p>

	<p>Quality of life (QoL) for people with Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s Disease (PD) is diminished by speech and communication changes. The impact of PD Check-In, an intervention for supported self-managed maintenance of speech following LSVT LOUD&amp;amp;reg;, on QoL of people with PD was investigated. Sixteen people with PD and dysarthria completed LSVT LOUD followed by PD Check-Ins up until 24 months post-treatment. Self-rated QoL and voice handicap scales were used to determine the psychosocial and perceived impact of PD Check-In on the speech and voice of people with PD. The perceived impact of PD Check-In on speech and voice was also sought from 15 communication partners (CPs). A significant treatment effect for time was identified for the Dysarthria Impact Profile (DIP), Voice Handicap Index (VHI), and Voice Handicap Index-Partner (VHI-P) (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). There was no significant effect for time for the Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-39). Planned comparisons of timepoints for DIP, VHI, and VHI-P showed no significant differences (p &amp;amp;gt; 0.01). Comparison of perceived voice handicap by people with PD and CPs revealed no significant differences (p &amp;amp;gt; 0.01). The impact of PD Check-In on QoL of people with PD and CPs for 24 months post-LSVT-LOUD is unclear. Self-reported outcome measures alone do not fully capture changes in QoL in PD.</p>

	<p>Food intake regulation in humans is a complex process controlled by the dynamic interaction of homeostatic and hedonic systems. Homeostatic regulation is controlled by appetitive signals from the gut, adipose tissue, and the vagus nerve, while conscious and unconscious reward processes orchestrate hedonic regulation. On the one hand, sight, smell, taste, and texture perception deliver potent food-related feedback to the central nervous system (CNS) and influence brain areas related to food reward. On the other hand, macronutrient composition stimulates the release of appetite signals from the gut, which are translated in the CNS into unconscious reward processes. This multi-level regulation process of food intake shapes and regulates human ingestive behavior. Identifying the interface between hormones, neurotransmitters, and brain areas is critical to advance our understanding of conditions like obesity and develop better therapeutical interventions. Neuroimaging studies allow us to take a glance into the central nervous system (CNS) while these processes take place. This review focuses on the available neuroimaging evidence to describe this interaction between the homeostatic and hedonic components in human food intake regulation.</p>

	<p>An altered sense of smell and taste was recognized as one of the most characteristic symptoms of coronavirus infection disease (COVID-19). Despite most patients experiencing a complete functional resolution, there is a 21.3% prevalence of persistent alteration at 12 months after infection. To date, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings in these patients have been variable and not clearly defined. We aimed to clarify radiological alterations of olfactory pathways in patients with long COVID-19 characterized by olfactory dysfunction. A comprehensive review of the English literature was performed by analyzing relevant papers about this topic. A case series was presented: all patients underwent complete otorhinolaryngology evaluation including the Sniffin&amp;amp;rsquo; Sticks battery test. A previous diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed by positive swabs. The MRIs were acquired using a 3.0T MR scanner with a standardized protocol for olfactory tract analysis. Images were first analysed by a dedicated neuroradiologist and subsequently reviewed and compared with the previous available MRIs. The review of the literature retrieved 25 studies; most cases of olfactory dysfunction more than 3 months after SARS-CoV-2 infection showed olfactory bulb (OB) reduction. Patients in the personal case series had asymmetry and a reduction in the volume of the OB. This evidence was strengthened by the comparison with a previous MRI, where the OBs were normal. The results preliminarily confirmed OB reduction in cases of long COVID-19 with an altered sense of smell. Further studies are needed to clarify the epidemiology, pathophysiology and prognosis.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Agmatine Alleviates Cisplatin-Induced Ototoxicity by Activating PI3K/AKT Signaling Pathway</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Cisplatin-induced ototoxicity can be partially attributed to excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and agmatine is well-known for the activation of the phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT) pathway to inhibit ROS production. Whether agmatine could be used to alleviate cisplatin-induced ototoxicity is investigated. Cisplatin-exposed House Ear Institute-Organ of Corti 1 (HEI-OC1) cells and cochlear explants showed increased ROS production detected by 2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) staining and decreased cell viability detected by Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) or Myosin 7a staining, which could be reversed by the agmatine pretreatment. Cisplatin intraperitoneally injected C57BL/6 mice demonstrated damaged auditory function as indicated by distortion products otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) and auditory brainstem response (ABR) assays, and trans-tympanically administrated agmatine in the left ears could partly prevent the auditory function loss. Mechanistically, downregulated B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) expression, upregulated Bcl2-associated x (Bax) expression, and diminished p-PI3K and p-AKT expression were detected in cisplatin-exposed HEI-OC1 cells and cochlear explants, which could be prevented by the pretreatment with agmatine. Our investigation demonstrates that agmatine pretreatment could alleviate cisplatin-induced ototoxicity with the activation of PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Single Calcium Channel Nanodomains Drive Presynaptic Calcium Entry at Lamprey Reticulospinal Presynaptic Terminals</a></h4>

              
                <p>Efficient and reliable neurotransmission requires precise coupling between action potentials (APs), Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry and neurotransmitter release. However, Ca<sup>2+</sup> requirements for release, including the number of channels required, their subtypes, and their location with respect to primed vesicles, remains to be precisely defined for central synapses. Indeed, Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry may occur through small numbers or even single open Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, but these questions remain largely unexplored in simple active zone (AZ) synapses common in the nervous system, and key to addressing Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel and synaptic dysfunction underlying numerous neurologic and neuropsychiatric disorders. Here, we present single channel analysis of evoked AZ Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry, using cell-attached patch clamp and lattice light-sheet microscopy (LLSM), resolving small channel numbers evoking Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry following depolarization, at single AZs in individual central lamprey reticulospinal presynaptic terminals from male and females. We show a small pool (mean of 23) of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels at each terminal, comprising N-(CaV2.2), P/Q-(CaV2.1), and R-(CaV2.3) subtypes, available to gate neurotransmitter release. Significantly, of this pool only one to seven channels (mean of 4) open on depolarization. High temporal fidelity lattice light-sheet imaging reveals AP-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients exhibiting quantal amplitude variations of 0&ndash;6 event sizes between individual APs and stochastic variation of precise locations of Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry within the AZ. Further, total Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel numbers at each AZ correlate to the number of presynaptic primed synaptic vesicles. Dispersion of channel openings across the AZ and the similar number of primed vesicles and channels indicate that Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry via as few as one channel may trigger neurotransmitter release.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry through voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) causes neurotransmitter release. To understand neurotransmission, its modulation, and plasticity, we must quantify Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry and its relationship to vesicle fusion. This requires direct recordings from active zones (AZs), previously possible only at calyceal terminals containing many AZs, where few channels open following action potentials (APs; <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B56">Sheng et al., 2012</cross-ref>), and even single channel openings may trigger release (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B58">Stanley, 1991</cross-ref>, <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B59">1993</cross-ref>). However, recording from more conventional terminals with single AZs commonly found centrally has thus far been impossible. We addressed this by cell-attached recordings from acutely dissociated single lamprey giant axon AZs, and by lattice light sheet microscopy of presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry. We demonstrate nanodomains of presynaptic VGCCs coupling with primed vesicles with 1:1 stoichiometry.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Mu Opioid Receptors Acutely Regulate Adenosine Signaling in Striatal Glutamate Afferents</a></h4>

              
                <p>Endogenous adenosine plays a crucial role in maintaining energy homeostasis, and adenosine levels are tightly regulated across neural circuits. In the dorsal medial striatum (DMS), adenosine inhibits neurotransmitter release, but the source and mechanism underlying its accumulation are largely unknown. Opioids also inhibit neurotransmitter release in the DMS and influence adenosine accumulation after prolonged exposure. However, how these two neurotransmitter systems interact acutely is also largely unknown. This study demonstrates that activation of &micro; opioid receptors, but not  opioid receptors or  opioid receptors, inhibits tonic activation of adenosine A<SUB>1</SUB>Rs via a cAMP-dependent mechanism in both male and female mice. Further, selectively knocking out &micro; opioid receptors from thalamic presynaptic terminals and postsynaptic medium spiny neurons (MSNs) revealed that activation of &micro; opioid receptors on D<SUB>1</SUB>R-positive MSNs, but not D<SUB>2</SUB>R-positive MSNs, is necessary to inhibit tonic adenosine signaling on presynaptic terminals. Given the role of D<SUB>1</SUB>R-positive MSNs in movement and motivated behaviors, these findings reveal a novel mechanism by which these neurons regulate their own synaptic inputs.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Understanding interactions between neuromodulatory systems within brain circuits is a fundamental question in neuroscience. The present work uncovers a novel role of opioids in acutely inhibiting adenosine accumulation and subsequent adenosine receptor signaling in the striatum by inhibiting the production of cAMP. Adenosine receptor signaling regulates striatal neurotransmitters, including glutamate, GABA, dopamine, and acetylcholine. Furthermore, interactions between adenosine<SUB>2A</SUB> receptors and numerous other GPCRs, including D<SUB>2</SUB> dopamine and CB<SUB>1</SUB> cannabinoid receptors, suggest that endogenous adenosine broadly modulates striatal GPCR signaling. Additionally, this work discovered that the source of resting endogenous extracellular adenosine is likely D<SUB>1</SUB>, but not D<SUB>2</SUB> receptor-positive medium spiny neurons, suggesting that opioid signaling and manipulation of D<SUB>1</SUB>R-expressing medium spiny neuron cAMP activity can broadly affect striatal function and behavior.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Repetitive Mild Closed Head Injury in Adolescent Mice Is Associated with Impaired Proteostasis, Neuroinflammation, and Tauopathy</a></h4>

              
                <p>Repetitive mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) in children and adolescents leads to acute and chronic neurologic sequelae and is linked to later life neurodegenerative disease. However, the biological mechanisms connecting early life mTBI to neurodegeneration remain unknown. Using an adolescent mouse repetitive closed head injury model that induces progressive cognitive impairment in males and anxiety in females in the absence of overt histopathology, we examined transcriptional and translational changes in neurons isolated from sham and injured brain in the chronic phase after injury. At 14 months, single-nuclei RNA sequencing of cortical brain tissue identified disruption of genes associated with neuronal proteostasis and evidence for disrupted ligand-receptor signaling networks in injured mice. Western blot analysis of isolated neurons showed evidence of inflammasome activation and downstream IL-1&beta; processing, as previously demonstrated in acute CNS injury models, and accumulation of misfolded, hyperphosphorylated tau, and changes in expression of proteins suggestive of impaired translation in males but not in females. At 6 months, injured IL-1 receptor 1 (<I>IL-1R1</I>) KO mice, which are protected from postinjury cognitive deficits, had decreased accumulation of pro-IL-1&beta; and misfolded tau in cortex and cerebellum, suggesting that IL-1R1 is upstream of inflammasome priming (defined as increase in pro-IL-1&beta;) and abnormal tau phosphorylation. Together, our findings provide evidence for neuronal inflammasome activation and impaired proteostasis as key mechanisms linking repetitive mTBI in adolescence to later life neurologic dysfunction and neurodegeneration.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Repetitive mild closed head injury in adolescent male mice leads to impaired proteostasis, tau phosphorylation, and inflammasome activation in neurons later in adulthood through mechanisms involving IL-1 receptor 1. The data are the first to link repetitive mild traumatic brain injury in adolescence to neurodegeneration and suggest molecular targets and pathways to prevent neurologic sequelae in the chronic period after injuries.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">ADAM17 Regulates p75NTR-Mediated Fibrinolysis and Nerve Remyelination</a></h4>

              
                <p>We previously reported that a-disintegrin and metalloproteinase (ADAM)17 is a key protease regulating myelin formation. We now describe a role for ADAM17 during the Wallerian degeneration (WD) process. Unexpectedly, we observed that glial ADAM17, by regulating p75<sup>NTR</sup> processing, cell autonomously promotes remyelination, while neuronal ADAM17 is dispensable. Accordingly, p75<sup>NTR</sup> abnormally accumulates specifically when ADAM17 is maximally expressed leading to a downregulation of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) expression, excessive fibrin accumulation over time, and delayed remyelination. Mutant mice also present impaired macrophage recruitment and defective nerve conduction velocity (NCV). Thus, ADAM17 expressed in Schwann cells, controls the whole WD process, and its absence hampers effective nerve repair. Collectively, we describe a previously uncharacterized role for glial ADAM17 during nerve regeneration. Based on the results of our study, we posit that, unlike development, glial ADAM17 promotes remyelination through the regulation of p75<sup>NTR</sup>-mediated fibrinolysis.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The &alpha;-secretase a-disintegrin and metalloproteinase (ADAM)17, although relevant for developmental PNS myelination, has never been investigated in Wallerian degeneration (WD). We now unravel a new mechanism of action for this protease and show that ADAM17 cleaves p75<sup>NTR</sup>, regulates fibrin clearance, and eventually fine-tunes remyelination. The results presented in this study provide important insights into the complex regulation of remyelination following nerve injury, identifying in ADAM17 and p75<sup>NTR</sup> a new signaling axis implicated in these events. Modulation of this pathway could have important implications in promoting nerve remyelination, an often-inefficient process, with the aim of restoring a functional axo-glial unit.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">SIPA1L1/SPAR1 Interacts with the Neurabin Family of Proteins and is Involved in GPCR Signaling</a></h4>

              
                <p>Signal-induced proliferation-associated 1 (SIPA1)-like 1 (SIPA1L1; also known as SPAR1) has been proposed to regulate synaptic functions that are important in maintaining normal neuronal activities, such as regulating spine growth and synaptic scaling, as a component of the PSD-95/NMDA-R-complex. However, its physiological role remains poorly understood. Here, we performed expression analyses using super-resolution microscopy (SRM) in mouse brain and demonstrated that SIPA1L1 is mainly localized to general submembranous regions in neurons, but surprisingly, not to PSD. Our screening for physiological interactors of SIPA1L1 in mouse brain identified spinophilin and neurabin-1, regulators of G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling, but rejected PSD-95/NMDA-R-complex components. Furthermore, <I>Sipa1l1</I><sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> mice showed normal spine size distribution and NMDA-R-dependent synaptic plasticity. Nevertheless, <I>Sipa1l1</I><sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> mice showed aberrant responses to &alpha;<SUB>2</SUB>-adrenergic receptor (a spinophilin target) or adenosine A1 receptor (a neurabin-1 target) agonist stimulation, and striking behavioral anomalies, such as hyperactivity, enhanced anxiety, learning impairments, social interaction deficits, and enhanced epileptic seizure susceptibility. Male mice were used for all experiments. Our findings revealed unexpected properties of SIPA1L1, suggesting a possible association of SIPA1L1 deficiency with neuropsychiatric disorders related to dysregulated GPCR signaling, such as epilepsy, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism, or fragile X syndrome (FXS).</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Signal-induced proliferation-associated 1 (SIPA1)-like 1 (SIPA1L1) is thought to regulate essential synaptic functions as a component of the PSD-95/NMDA-R-complex. In our screening for physiological SIPA1L1-interactors, we identified G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR)-signaling regulators. Moreover, SIPA1L1 knock-out (KO) mice showed striking behavioral anomalies, which may be relevant to GPCR signaling. Our findings revealed an unexpected role of SIPA1L1, which may open new avenues for research on neuropsychiatric disorders that involve dysregulated GPCR signaling. Another important aspect of this paper is that we showed effective methods for checking PSD association and identifying native protein interactors that are difficult to solubilize. These results may serve as a caution for future claims about interacting proteins and PSD proteins, which could eventually save time and resources for researchers and avoid confusion in the field.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Motoneuron-Specific PTEN Deletion in Mice Induces Neuronal Hypertrophy and Also Regeneration after Facial Nerve Injury</a></h4>

              
                <p>In postmitotic neurons, several tumor suppressor genes (TSGs), including p53, Rb, and PTEN, modulate the axon regeneration success after injury. Particularly, PTEN inhibition is a key driver of successful CNS axon regeneration after optic nerve or spinal cord injury. In contrast, in peripheral neurons, TSG influence in neuronal morphology, physiology, and pathology has not been investigated to the same depth. In this study, we conditionally deleted PTEN from mouse facial motoneurons (<I>Chat-Cre/Pten<sup>loxP/loxP</sup></I>) and analyzed neuronal responses <I>in vivo</I> with or without peripheral facial nerve injury in male and female mice. In uninjured motoneurons, PTEN loss induced somatic, axonal, and nerve hypertrophy, synaptic terminal enlargement and reduction in physiological whisker movement. Despite these morphologic and physiological changes, PTEN deletion positively regulated facial nerve regeneration and recovery of whisker movement after nerve injury. Regenerating PTEN-deficient motoneurons upregulated P-CREB and a signaling pathway involving P-Akt, P-PRAS40, P-mTOR, and P-4EBP1. In aged mice (12 months), PTEN deletion induced hair loss and facial hyperplasia of the epidermis. This suggests a time window in younger mice with PTEN loss stimulating axon growth after injury, however, at the risk of hyperplasia formation at later time points in the old animal. Overall, our data highlight a dual TSG function with PTEN loss impairing physiological neuron function but furthermore underscoring the positive effects of PTEN ablation in axon regeneration also for the PNS.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) restrict cell proliferation and growth. TSG inhibition, including p53 and PTEN, stimulates axon regeneration after CNS injury. In contrast, in PNS axon regeneration, TSGs have not been analyzed in great depth. Herein we show enhanced peripheral axon regeneration after PTEN deletion from facial motoneurons. This invokes a signaling cascade with novel PTEN partners, including CREB and PRAS40. In adult mice, PTEN loss induces hyperplasia of the skin epidermis, suggesting detrimental consequences when reaching adulthood in contrast to a beneficial TSG role for regeneration in young adult mice. Thus, our data highlight the double-edged sword nature of interfering with TSG function.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Time Course of Activity-Dependent Changes in Auditory Nerve Synapses Reveals Multiple Underlying Cellular Mechanisms</a></h4>

              
                <p>Abnormal levels of acoustic activity can result in hearing problems such as tinnitus and language processing disorders, but the underlying cellular and synaptic changes triggered by abnormal activity are not well understood. To address this issue, we studied the time course of activity-dependent changes that occur at auditory nerve synapses in mice of both sexes after noise exposure and conductive hearing loss. We found that EPSC amplitude and synaptic depression decreased within 2 d of noise exposure through a decrease in the probability of vesicle release (<I>P</I><SUB>r</SUB>). This was followed by a gradual increase in EPSC amplitude through a larger pool of releasable vesicles (<I>N</I>). Occlusion of the ear canal led to a rapid decrease in EPSC amplitude through a decrease in <I>N</I>, which was followed by an increase in EPSC amplitude and synaptic depression through an increase in <I>P</I><SUB>r</SUB>. After returning to normal sound levels, synaptic depression recovered to control levels within 1&ndash;2 d. However, repeated exposure to noise for as little as 8 h/d caused synaptic changes after 7 d, suggesting recovery did not fully offset changes. Thus, there appear to be three activity-dependent mechanisms in auditory nerve synapses&mdash;bidirectional changes in <I>P</I><SUB>r</SUB> in 1&ndash;2 d, slower bidirectional changes in <I>N</I> through synaptic growth or retraction, and rapid downregulation of <I>N</I> with low activity. The dynamic changes indicate that multiple mechanisms are present to fine-tune synaptic fidelity across different acoustic conditions in a simple relay.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Hearing impairments can arise from exposure to noise or conductive hearing loss. This appears to result from changes in the brain, but the mechanisms are not well understood. We study this issue by studying the synapses made by auditory nerve fibers called endbulbs of Held. These synapses undergo bidirectional changes in size and release probability of neurotransmitter in response to increased or decreased activity. Here, we made a close examination of how quickly these synaptic characteristics change, which indicates there are at least three cellular mechanisms underlying changes. Furthermore, repeated exposure to brief periods of noise can produce cumulative effects. These changes could significantly affect hearing, especially because they occur at the start of the central auditory pathway.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Human NREM Sleep Promotes Brain-Wide Vasomotor and Respiratory Pulsations</a></h4>

              
                <p>The physiological underpinnings of the necessity of sleep remain uncertain. Recent evidence suggests that sleep increases the convection of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and promotes the export of interstitial solutes, thus providing a framework to explain why all vertebrate species require sleep. Cardiovascular, respiratory and vasomotor brain pulsations have each been shown to drive CSF flow along perivascular spaces, yet it is unknown how such pulsations may change during sleep in humans. To investigate these pulsation phenomena in relation to sleep, we simultaneously recorded fast fMRI, magnetic resonance encephalography (MREG), and electroencephalography (EEG) signals in a group of healthy volunteers. We quantified sleep-related changes in the signal frequency distributions by spectral entropy analysis and calculated the strength of the physiological (vasomotor, respiratory, and cardiac) brain pulsations by power sum analysis in 15 subjects (age 26.5 &plusmn; 4.2 years, 6 females). Finally, we identified spatial similarities between EEG slow oscillation (0.2&ndash;2 Hz) power and MREG pulsations. Compared with wakefulness, nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep was characterized by reduced spectral entropy and increased brain pulsation intensity. These effects were most pronounced in posterior brain areas for very low-frequency (&le;0.1 Hz) vasomotor pulsations but were also evident brain-wide for respiratory pulsations, and to a lesser extent for cardiac brain pulsations. There was increased EEG slow oscillation power in brain regions spatially overlapping with those showing sleep-related MREG pulsation changes. We suggest that reduced spectral entropy and enhanced pulsation intensity are characteristic of NREM sleep. With our findings of increased power of slow oscillation, the present results support the proposition that sleep promotes fluid transport in human brain.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> We report that the spectral power of physiological brain pulsation mechanisms driven by vasomotor, respiration, and cardiac rhythms in human brain increase during sleep, extending previous observations of their association with glymphatic brain clearance during sleep in rodents. The magnitudes of increased pulsations follow the rank order of vasomotor greater than respiratory greater than cardiac pulsations, with correspondingly declining spatial extents. Spectral entropy, previously known as vigilance and as an anesthesia metric, decreased during NREM sleep compared with the awake state in very low and respiratory frequencies, indicating reduced signal complexity. An EEG slow oscillation power increase occurring in the early sleep phase (NREM 1&ndash;2) spatially overlapped with pulsation changes, indicating reciprocal mechanisms between those measures.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">The Spatiotemporal Link of Temporal Expectations: Contextual Temporal Expectation Is Independent of Spatial Attention</a></h4>

              
                <p>Temporal expectation is the ability to construct predictions regarding the timing of events, based on previously experienced temporal regularities of different types. For example, cue-based expectations are constructed when a cue validly indicates when a target is expected to occur. However, in the absence of such cues, expectations can be constructed based on contextual temporal information, including the onset distribution of the event and recent prior experiences, both providing implicit probabilistic information regarding the timing of the event. It was previously suggested that cue-based temporal expectation is exerted via synchronization of spatially specific neural activity at a predictable time of a target, within receptive fields corresponding to the expected location of the target. Here, we tested whether the same theoretical model holds for contextual temporal effects. Participants (<I>n</I> = 40, 25 females) performed a speeded spatial-cuing detection task with two-thirds valid spatial cues. The hazard-rate function of the target was modulated by varying the foreperiod&mdash;the interval between the spatial cue and the target&mdash;among trials and was manipulated between groups by changing the interval distribution. Reaction times were analyzed using both frequentist and Bayesian generalized linear mixed models, accounting for hazard and sequential effects. Results showed that the effects of contextual temporal structures on reaction times were independent of spatial attention. This suggests that the spatiotemporal mechanisms, thought to account for cue-based expectation, cannot explain other sources of temporal expectations. We conclude that expectations based on contextual structures have different characteristics than cue-based temporal expectation, suggesting reliance on distinct neural mechanisms.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Temporal expectation is the ability to predict an event onset based on temporal regularities. A neurophysiological model suggested that temporal expectation relies on the synchronization of spatially specific neurons whose receptive fields represent the attended location. This model predicts that temporal expectation would be evident solely within the locus of spatial attention. Existing evidence supported this model for expectation based on associations between a temporal cue and a target, but here we show that it cannot account for temporal expectation that is based on contextual information, that is, the distribution of intervals and recent priors. These findings reveal the existence of different predictive mechanisms for cued and contextual temporal predictions, with the former depending on spatial attention and the latter nonspatially specific.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Adaptive Learning through Temporal Dynamics of State Representation</a></h4>

              
                <p>People adjust their learning rate rationally according to local environmental statistics and calibrate such adjustments based on the broader statistical context. To date, no theory has captured the observed range of adaptive learning behaviors or the complexity of its neural correlates. Here, we attempt to do so using a neural network model that learns to map an internal context representation onto a behavioral response via supervised learning. The network shifts its internal context on receiving supervised signals that are mismatched to its output, thereby changing the "state" to which feedback is associated. A key feature of the model is that such state transitions can either increase learning or decrease learning depending on the duration over which the new state is maintained. Sustained state transitions that occur after changepoints facilitate faster learning and mimic network reset phenomena observed in the brain during rapid learning. In contrast, state transitions after one-off outlier events are short lived, thereby limiting the impact of outlying observations on future behavior. State transitions in our model provide the first mechanistic interpretation for bidirectional learning signals, such as the P300, that relate to learning differentially according to the source of surprising events and may also shed light on discrepant observations regarding the relationship between transient pupil dilations and learning. Together, our results demonstrate that dynamic latent state representations can afford normative inference and provide a coherent framework for understanding neural signatures of adaptive learning across different statistical environments.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> How humans adjust their sensitivity to new information in a changing world has remained largely an open question. Bridging insights from normative accounts of adaptive learning and theories of latent state representation, here we propose a feedforward neural network model that adjusts its learning rate online by controlling the speed of transitioning its internal state representations. Our model proposes a mechanistic framework for explaining learning under different statistical contexts, explains previously observed behavior and brain signals, and makes testable predictions for future experimental studies.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Neurons in the Monkey's Subthalamic Nucleus Differentially Encode Motivation and Effort</a></h4>

              
                <p>The understanding of the electrophysiological properties of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) neurons is crucial since it represents the main target of deep brain stimulation for the treatment of Parkinson's disease and obsessive-compulsive disorders. The study of its nonmotor properties could shed light on the cognitive and motivational alterations possibly encountered after stimulation. In this study, we recorded the activity of STN neurons in two male behaving monkeys (<I>Macaca mulatta</I>) while they performed a visuomotor motivational task in which visual cues indicated which amount of force was required to obtain which amount of reward. Our results evidenced force- and reward-modulated neurons. After the occurrence of the visual stimuli, the force-modulated neurons mainly fired when a high effort was required. Differently, the activity of the population of reward-modulated neurons encoded the motivational value of the stimuli. This population consisted of neurons increasing or decreasing their activity according to the motivational ranking of the task conditions. Both populations could play complementary roles, one in the implementation of the difficulty of the action and the other in enhancing or slowing its execution based on the subjective value of each condition.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> An increasing number of studies confers a role to the subthalamic nucleus (STN) in motivational and reward-related processes. However, the electrophysiological bases of such properties at the neuronal level remain unclear. The present study investigated the modulation of STN neuronal activity in monkeys performing a motivational task in which the force to produce and the reward obtained were manipulated. We found two main populations of neurons, one modulated by the effort required and the other integrating the motivational subjective value of the stimuli. This last population could help at improving decision-making to act or not, depending on the subjective value set by the motivational context. This highlights the pivotal role of STN in the valuation of cost/benefit for decision-making processes.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Chronic Behavioral Manipulation via Orally Delivered Chemogenetic Actuator in Macaques</a></h4>

              
                <p>The chemogenetic technology referred to as designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs) offers reversible means to control neuronal activity for investigating its functional correlation with behavioral action. Deschloroclozapine (DCZ), a recently developed highly potent and selective DREADD actuator, displays a capacity to expand the utility of DREADDs for chronic manipulation without side effects in nonhuman primates, which has not yet been validated. Here we investigated the pharmacokinetics and behavioral effects of orally administered DCZ in female and male macaque monkeys. Pharmacokinetic analysis and PET occupancy examination demonstrated that oral administration of DCZ yielded slower and prolonged kinetics, and that its bioavailability was 10%-20% of that in the case of systemic injection. Oral DCZ (300-1000 &mu;g/kg) induced significant working memory impairments for at least 4 h in monkeys with hM4Di expressed in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (Brodmann's area 46). Repeated daily oral doses of DCZ consistently caused similar impairments over two weeks without discernible desensitization. Our results indicate that orally delivered DCZ affords a less invasive strategy for chronic but reversible chemogenetic manipulation of neuronal activity in nonhuman primates, and this has potential for clinical application.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The use of designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs) for chronic manipulation of neuronal activity for days to weeks may be feasible for investigating brain functions and behavior on a long time-scale, and thereby for developing therapeutics for brain disorders, such as epilepsy. Here we performed pharmacokinetics and <I>in vivo</I> occupancy study of orally administered deschloroclozapine to determine a dose range suitable for DREADDs studies. In monkeys expressing hM4Di in the prefrontal cortex, single and repeated daily doses significantly induced working-memory impairments for hours and over two weeks, respectively, without discernible desensitization. These results indicate that orally delivered deschloroclozapine produces long-term stable chemogenetic effects, and holds great promise for the translational use of DREADDs technology.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Dissociating the Neural Correlates of Subjective Visibility from Those of Decision Confidence</a></h4>

              
                <p>A key goal of consciousness science is identifying neural signatures of being aware versus unaware of simple stimuli. This is often investigated in the context of near-threshold detection, with reports of stimulus awareness being linked to heightened activation in a frontoparietal network. However, because of reports of stimulus presence typically being associated with higher confidence than reports of stimulus absence, these results could be explained by frontoparietal regions encoding stimulus visibility, decision confidence, or both. In an exploratory analysis, we leverage fMRI data from 35 human participants (20 females) to disentangle these possibilities. We first show that, whereas stimulus identity was best decoded from the visual cortex, stimulus visibility (presence vs absence) was best decoded from prefrontal regions. To control for effects of confidence, we then selectively sampled trials before decoding to equalize confidence distributions between absence and presence responses. This analysis revealed striking differences in the neural correlates of subjective visibility in PFC ROIs, depending on whether or not differences in confidence were controlled for. We interpret our findings as highlighting the importance of controlling for metacognitive aspects of the decision process in the search for neural correlates of visual awareness.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> While much has been learned over the past two decades about the neural basis of visual awareness, the role of the PFC remains a topic of debate. By applying decoding analyses to functional brain imaging data, we show that prefrontal representations of subjective visibility are contaminated by neural correlates of decision confidence. We propose a new analysis method to control for these metacognitive aspects of awareness reports, and use it to reveal confidence-independent correlates of perceptual judgments in a subset of prefrontal areas.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Behavioral and Neural Dissociation of Social Anxiety and Loneliness</a></h4>

              
                <p>Loneliness is a public health concern with detrimental effects on physical and mental well-being. Given phenotypical overlaps between loneliness and social anxiety (SA), cognitive-behavioral interventions targeting SA might be adopted to reduce loneliness. However, whether SA and loneliness share the same underlying neurocognitive mechanisms is still an elusive question. The current study aimed at investigating to what extent known behavioral and neural correlates of social avoidance in SA are evident in loneliness. We used a prestratified approach involving 42 (21 females) participants with high loneliness (HL) and 40 (20 females) participants with low loneliness (LL) scores. During fMRI, participants completed a social gambling task to measure the subjective value of engaging in social situations and responses to social feedback. Univariate and multivariate analyses of behavioral and neural data replicated known task effects. However, although HL participants showed increased SA, loneliness was associated with a response pattern clearly distinct from SA. Specifically, contrary to expectations based on SA differences, Bayesian analyses revealed moderate evidence for equal subjective values of engaging in social situations and comparable amygdala responses to social decision-making and striatal responses to positive social feedback in both groups. Moreover, while explorative analyses revealed reduced pleasantness ratings, increased striatal activity, and decreased striatal-hippocampal connectivity in response to negative computer feedback in HL participants, these effects were diminished for negative social feedback. Our findings suggest that, unlike SA, loneliness is not associated with withdrawal from social interactions. Thus, established interventions for SA should be adjusted when targeting loneliness.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Loneliness can cause serious health problems. Adapting well-established cognitive-behavioral therapies targeting social anxiety might be promising to reduce chronic loneliness given a close link between both constructs. However, a better understanding of behavioral and neurobiological factors associated with loneliness is needed to identify which specific mechanisms of social anxiety are shared by lonely individuals. We found that lonely individuals show a consistently distinct pattern of behavioral and neural responsiveness to social decision-making and social feedback compared with previous findings for social anxiety. Our results indicate that loneliness is associated with a biased emotional reactivity to negative events rather than social avoidance. Our findings thus emphasize the distinctiveness of loneliness from social anxiety and the need for adjusted psychotherapeutic protocols.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Anastasis Drives Senescence and Non-Cell Autonomous Neurodegeneration in the Astrogliopathy Alexander Disease</a></h4>

              
                <p>Anastasis is a recently described process in which cells recover after late-stage apoptosis activation. The functional consequences of anastasis for cells and tissues are not clearly understood. Using <I>Drosophila</I>, rat and human cells and tissues, including analyses of both males and females, we present evidence that glia undergoing anastasis in the primary astrogliopathy Alexander disease subsequently express hallmarks of senescence. These senescent glia promote non-cell autonomous death of neurons by secreting interleukin family cytokines. Our findings demonstrate that anastasis can be dysfunctional in neurologic disease by inducing a toxic senescent population of astroglia.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Under some conditions cells otherwise destined to die can be rescued just before death in a process called anastasis, or "rising from the dead." The fate and function of cells undergoing a near death experience is not well understood. Here, we find that in models and patient cells from Alexander disease, an important brain disorder in which glial cells promote neuronal dysfunction and death, anastasis of astrocytic glia leads to secretion of toxic signaling molecules and neurodegeneration. These studies demonstrate a previously unexpected deleterious consequence of rescuing cells on the brink of death and suggest therapeutic strategies for Alexander disease and related disorders of glia.</p>
