              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/85694">Collaborative hunting in artificial agents with deep reinforcement learning</a></h4>

              
                Collaborative hunting, in which predators play different and complementary roles to capture prey, has been traditionally believed to be an advanced hunting strategy requiring large brains that involve high-level cognition. However, recent findings that collaborative hunting has also been documented in smaller-brained vertebrates have placed this previous belief under strain. Here, using computational multi-agent simulations based on deep reinforcement learning, we demonstrate that decisions underlying collaborative hunts do not necessarily rely on sophisticated cognitive processes. We found that apparently elaborate coordination can be achieved through a relatively simple decision process of mapping between states and actions related to distance-dependent internal representations formed by prior experience. Furthermore, we confirmed that this decision rule of predators is robust against unknown prey controlled by humans. Our computational ecological results emphasize that collaborative hunting can emerge in various intra- and inter-specific interactions in nature, and provide insights into the evolution of sociality.

	<p>Testing of ChatGPT has recently been performed over a diverse range of topics. However, most of these assessments have been based on broad domains of knowledge. Here, we test ChatGPT&amp;amp;rsquo;s knowledge of tinnitus, an important but specialized aspect of audiology and otolaryngology. Testing involved evaluating ChatGPT&amp;amp;rsquo;s answers to a defined set of 10 questions on tinnitus. Furthermore, given the technology is advancing quickly, we re-evaluated the responses to the same 10 questions 3 and 6 months later. The accuracy of the responses was rated by 6 experts (the authors) using a Likert scale ranging from 1 to 5. Most of ChatGPT&amp;amp;rsquo;s responses were rated as satisfactory or better. However, we did detect a few instances where the responses were not accurate and might be considered somewhat misleading. Over the first 3 months, the ratings generally improved, but there was no more significant improvement at 6 months. In our judgment, ChatGPT provided unexpectedly good responses, given that the questions were quite specific. Although no potentially harmful errors were identified, some mistakes could be seen as somewhat misleading. ChatGPT shows great potential if further developed by experts in specific areas, but for now, it is not yet ready for serious application.</p>

	<p>Orexin/hypocretin terminals innervate the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN), which projects to motor control areas important for spontaneous physical activity (SPA) and energy expenditure (EE). Orexin receptors are expressed in the DRN, and obesity-resistant (OR) rats show higher expression of these receptors in the DRN and elevated SPA/EE. We hypothesized that orexin-A in the DRN enhances SPA/EE and that DRN-GABA modulates the effect of orexin-A on SPA/EE. We manipulated orexin tone in the DRN either through direct injection of orexin-A or through the chemogenetic activation of lateral-hypothalamic (LH) orexin neurons. In the orexin neuron activation experiment, fifteen minutes prior to the chemogenetic activation of orexin neurons, the mice received either the GABA-agonist muscimol or antagonist bicuculline injected into the DRN, and SPA/EE was monitored for 24 h. In a separate experiment, orexin-A was injected into the DRN to study the direct effect of DRN orexin on SPA/EE. We found that the activation of orexin neurons elevates SPA/EE, and manipulation of GABA in the DRN does not alter the SPA response to orexin neuron activation. Similarly, intra-DRN orexin-A enhanced SPA and EE in the mice. These results suggest that orexin-A in the DRN facilitates negative energy balance by increasing physical activity-induced EE, and that modulation of DRN orexin-A is a potential strategy to promote SPA and EE.</p>

                <p>Sleep spindles appear to play an important role in learning new motor skills. Motor skill learning engages several brain regions with two important areas being the motor cortex (M1) and the cerebellum (CB). However, the neurophysiological processes in these areas during sleep, especially how spindle oscillations affect local and cross-region spiking, are not fully understood. We recorded an activity from the M1 and cerebellar cortex in eight rats during spontaneous activity to investigate how sleep spindles in these regions are related to local spiking as well as cross-region spiking. We found that M1 firing was significantly changed during both M1 and CB spindles, and this spiking occurred at a preferred phase of the spindle. On average, M1 and CB neurons showed most spiking at the M1 or CB spindle peaks. These neurons also developed a preferential phase locking to local or cross-area spindles with the greatest phase-locking value at spindle peaks; however, this preferential phase locking was not significant for cerebellar neurons when compared with CB spindles. Additionally, we found that the percentage of task-modulated cells in the M1 and CB that fired with nonuniform spike phase distribution during M1/CB spindle peaks were greater in the rats that learned a reach-to-grasp motor task robustly. Finally, we found that spindle band LFP coherence (for M1 and CB LFPs) showed a positive correlation with success rate in the motor task. These findings support the idea that sleep spindles in both the M1 and CB recruit neurons that participate in the awake task to support motor memory consolidation.</p>

                <p>Resting-state networks (RSNs) are increasingly forwarded as candidate biomarkers for neuropsychiatric disorders. Such biomarkers may provide objective measures for evaluating novel therapeutic interventions in nonhuman primates often used in translational neuroimaging research. This study aimed to characterize the RSNs of awake squirrel monkeys and compare the characteristics of those networks in adolescent and adult subjects. Twenty-seven squirrel monkeys [<I>n </I>= 12 adolescents (6 male/6 female) ~2.5&nbsp;years and <I>n </I>= 15 adults (7 male/8 female) ~9.5&nbsp;years] were gradually acclimated to awake scanning procedures; whole-brain fMRI images were acquired with a 9.4&nbsp;T scanner. Group-level independent component analysis (ICA; 30 ICs) with dual regression was used to detect and compare RSNs. Twenty ICs corresponding to physiologically meaningful networks representing a range of neural functions, including motor, sensory, reward, and cognitive processes, were identified in both adolescent and adult monkeys. The reproducibility of these RSNs was evaluated across several ICA model orders. Adults showed a trend for greater connectivity compared with adolescent subjects in two of the networks of interest: (1) in the right occipital region with the OFC network and (2) in the left temporal cortex, bilateral occipital cortex, and cerebellum with the posterior cingulate network. However, when age was entered into the above model, this trend for significance was lost. These results demonstrate that squirrel monkey RSNs are stable and consistent with RSNs previously identified in humans, rodents, and other nonhuman primate species. These data also identify several networks in adolescence that are conserved and others that may change into adulthood.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26945?af=R">Illusions of Self‐Motion during Magnetic Resonance‐Guided Focused Ultrasound Thalamotomy for Tremor</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Brain networks mediating vestibular perception of self-motion overlap with those mediating balance. A systematic mapping of vestibular perceptual pathways in the thalamus may reveal new brain modulation targets for improving balance in neurological conditions.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Here, we systematically report how magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound surgery of the nucleus ventralis intermedius of the thalamus commonly evokes transient patient-reported illusions of self-motion. In 46 consecutive patients, we linked the descriptions of self-motion to sonication power and 3-dimensional (3D) coordinates of sonication targets. Target coordinates were normalized using a standard atlas, and a 3D model of the nucleus ventralis intermedius and adjacent structures was created to link sonication target to the illusion.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 63% of patients reported illusions of self-motion, which were more likely with increased sonication power and with targets located more inferiorly along the rostrocaudal axis. Higher power and more inferiorly targeted sonications increased the likelihood of experiencing illusions of self-motion by 4 and 2 times, respectively (odds ratios = 4.03 for power, 2.098 for location).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The phenomenon of magnetic vestibular stimulation is the most plausible explanation for these illusions of self-motion. Temporary unilateral modulation of vestibular pathways (via magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound) unveils the central adaptation to the magnetic field-induced peripheral vestibular bias, leading to an explicable illusion of motion. Consequently, systematic mapping of vestibular perceptual pathways via magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound may reveal new intracerebral targets for improving balance in neurological conditions.

                <p>by Udaysankar Chockanathan, Krishnan Padmanabhan</p>

Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is characterized by a range of behavioral alterations, including memory loss and psychiatric symptoms. While there is evidence that molecular pathologies, such as amyloid beta (Aβ), contribute to AD, it remains unclear how this histopathology gives rise to such disparate behavioral deficits. One hypothesis is that Aβ exerts differential effects on neuronal circuits across brain regions, depending on the neurophysiology and connectivity of different areas. To test this, we recorded from large neuronal populations in dorsal CA1 (dCA1) and ventral CA1 (vCA1), two hippocampal areas known to be structurally and functionally diverse, in the APP/PS1 mouse model of amyloidosis. Despite similar levels of Aβ pathology, dCA1 and vCA1 showed distinct disruptions in neuronal population activity as animals navigated a virtual reality environment. In dCA1, pairwise correlations and entropy, a measure of the diversity of activity patterns, were decreased in APP/PS1 mice relative to age-matched C57BL/6 controls. However, in vCA1, APP/PS1 mice had increased pair-wise correlations and entropy as compared to age matched controls. Finally, using maximum entropy models, we connected the microscopic features of population activity (correlations) to the macroscopic features of the population code (entropy). We found that the models’ performance increased in predicting dCA1 activity, but decreased in predicting vCA1 activity, in APP/PS1 mice relative to the controls. Taken together, we found that Aβ exerts distinct effects across different hippocampal regions, suggesting that the various behavioral deficits of AD may reflect underlying heterogeneities in neuronal circuits and the different disruptions that Aβ pathology causes in those circuits.

Chromosome conformation capture (3C) technologies reveal the incredible complexity of genome organization. Maps of increasing size, depth, and resolution are now used to probe genome architecture across cell states, types, and organisms. Larger datasets add challenges at each step of computational analysis, from storage and memory constraints to researchers’ time; however, analysis tools that meet these increased resource demands have not kept pace. Furthermore, existing tools offer limited support for customizing analysis for specific use cases or new biology. Here we introduce <i>cooltools</i> (https://github.com/open2c/cooltools), a suite of computational tools that enables flexible, scalable, and reproducible analysis of high-resolution contact frequency data. <i>Cooltools</i> leverages the widely-adopted cooler format which handles storage and access for high-resolution datasets. <i>Cooltools</i> provides a paired command line interface (CLI) and Python application programming interface (API), which respectively facilitate workflows on high-performance computing clusters and in interactive analysis environments. In short, <i>cooltools</i> enables the effective use of the latest and largest genome folding datasets.

A challenging goal of neural coding is to characterize the neural representations underlying visual perception. To this end, multi-unit activity (MUA) of macaque visual cortex was recorded in a passive fixation task upon presentation of faces and natural images. We analyzed the relationship between MUA and latent representations of state-of-the-art deep generative models, including the conventional and feature-disentangled representations of generative adversarial networks (GANs) (i.e., <i>z</i>- and <i>w</i>-latents of StyleGAN, respectively) and language-contrastive representations of latent diffusion networks (i.e., CLIP-latents of Stable Diffusion). A mass univariate neural encoding analysis of the latent representations showed that feature-disentangled <i>w</i> representations outperform both <i>z</i> and CLIP representations in explaining neural responses. Further, <i>w</i>-latent features were found to be positioned at the higher end of the complexity gradient which indicates that they capture visual information relevant to high-level neural activity. Subsequently, a multivariate neural decoding analysis of the feature-disentangled representations resulted in state-of-the-art spatiotemporal reconstructions of visual perception. Taken together, our results not only highlight the important role of feature-disentanglement in shaping high-level neural representations underlying visual perception but also serve as an important benchmark for the future of neural coding.

                <p>by Benjamin Antin, Masato Sadahiro, Marta Gajowa, Marcus A. Triplett, Hillel Adesnik, Liam Paninski</p>

Monosynaptic connectivity mapping is crucial for building circuit-level models of neural computation. Two-photon optogenetic stimulation, when combined with whole-cell recording, enables large-scale mapping of physiological circuit parameters. In this experimental setup, recorded postsynaptic currents are used to infer the presence and strength of connections. For many cell types, nearby connections are those we expect to be strongest. However, when the postsynaptic cell expresses opsin, optical excitation of nearby cells can induce direct photocurrents in the postsynaptic cell. These photocurrent artifacts contaminate synaptic currents, making it difficult or impossible to probe connectivity for nearby cells. To overcome this problem, we developed a computational tool, Photocurrent Removal with Constraints (PhoRC). Our method is based on a constrained matrix factorization model which leverages the fact that photocurrent kinetics are less variable than those of synaptic currents. We demonstrate on real and simulated data that PhoRC consistently removes photocurrents while preserving synaptic currents, despite variations in photocurrent kinetics across datasets. Our method allows the discovery of synaptic connections which would have been otherwise obscured by photocurrent artifacts, and may thus reveal a more complete picture of synaptic connectivity. PhoRC runs faster than real time and is available as open source software.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012052">On the impact of re-mating and residual fertility on the Sterile Insect Technique efficacy: Case study with the medfly, Ceratitis capitata</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Yves Dumont, Clélia F. Oliva</p>

The sterile insect technique (SIT) can be an efficient solution for reducing or eliminating certain insect pest populations. It is widely used in agriculture against fruit flies, including the Mediterranean fruit fly (medfly), <i>Ceratitis capitata</i>. The re-mating tendency of medfly females and the fact that the released sterile males may have some residual fertility could be a challenge for the successful implementation of the SIT. Obtaining the right balance between sterility level and sterile male quality (competitiveness, longevity, etc) is the key to a cost-efficient program. Since field experimental approaches can be impacted by many environmental variables, it is difficult to get a clear understanding on how specific parameters, alone or in combination, may affect the SIT efficiency. The use of models not only helps to gather knowledge, but it allows the simulation of a wide range of scenarios and can be easily adapted to local populations and sterile male production.
In this study, we consider single- and double-mated females. We first show that SIT can be successful only if the residual fertility is less than a threshold value that depends on the basic offspring number of the targeted pest population, the re-mating rates, and the parameters of double-mated females. Then, we show how the sterile male release rate is affected by the parameters of double-mated females and the male residual fertility. Different scenarios are explored with continuous and periodic sterile male releases, with and without ginger aromatherapy, which is known to enhance sterile male competitiveness, and also taking into account some biological parameters related to females that have been mated twice, either first by a wild (sterile) male and then a sterile (wild) male, or by two wild males only. Parameter values were chosen for peach as host fruit to reflect what could be expected in the Corsican context, where SIT against the medfly is under consideration.
Our results suggest that ginger aromatherapy can be a decisive factor determining the success of SIT against medfly. We also emphasize the importance of estimating the duration of the refractory period between matings depending on whether a wild female has mated with a wild or sterile male. Further, we show the importance of parameters, like the (hatched) eggs deposit rate and the death-rate related to all fertile double-mated females. In general, re-mating is considered to be detrimental to SIT programs. However, our results show that, depending on the parameter values of double-mated females, re-mating may also be beneficial for SIT.
Our model can be easily adapted to different contexts and species, for a broader understanding of release strategies and management options.

                <p>by Héctor M. Sánchez C., David L. Smith, John M. Marshall</p>

Genetic surveillance of mosquito populations is becoming increasingly relevant as genetics-based mosquito control strategies advance from laboratory to field testing. Especially applicable are mosquito gene drive projects, the potential scale of which leads monitoring to be a significant cost driver. For these projects, monitoring will be required to detect unintended spread of gene drive mosquitoes beyond field sites, and the emergence of alternative alleles, such as drive-resistant alleles or non-functional effector genes, within intervention sites. This entails the need to distribute mosquito traps efficiently such that an allele of interest is detected as quickly as possible—ideally when remediation is still viable. Additionally, insecticide-based tools such as bednets are compromised by insecticide-resistance alleles for which there is also a need to detect as quickly as possible. To this end, we present MGSurvE (Mosquito Gene SurveillancE): a computational framework that optimizes trap placement for genetic surveillance of mosquito populations such that the time to detection of an allele of interest is minimized. A key strength of MGSurvE is that it allows important biological features of mosquitoes and the landscapes they inhabit to be accounted for, namely: i) resources required by mosquitoes (e.g., food sources and aquatic breeding sites) can be explicitly distributed through a landscape, ii) movement of mosquitoes may depend on their sex, the current state of their gonotrophic cycle (if female) and resource attractiveness, and iii) traps may differ in their attractiveness profile. Example MGSurvE analyses are presented to demonstrate optimal trap placement for: i) an <i>Aedes aegypti</i> population in a suburban landscape in Queensland, Australia, and ii) an <i>Anopheles gambiae</i> population on the island of São Tomé, São Tomé and Príncipe. Further documentation and use examples are provided in project’s documentation. MGSurvE is intended as a resource for both field and computational researchers interested in mosquito gene surveillance.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, forecasting COVID-19 trends to support planning and response was a priority for scientists and decision makers alike. In the United States, COVID-19 forecasting was coordinated by a large group of universities, companies, and government entities led by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the US COVID-19 Forecast Hub (https://covid19forecasthub.org). We evaluated approximately 9.7 million forecasts of weekly state-level COVID-19 cases for predictions 1–4 weeks into the future submitted by 24 teams from August 2020 to December 2021. We assessed coverage of central prediction intervals and weighted interval scores (WIS), adjusting for missing forecasts relative to a baseline forecast, and used a Gaussian generalized estimating equation (GEE) model to evaluate differences in skill across epidemic phases that were defined by the effective reproduction number. Overall, we found high variation in skill across individual models, with ensemble-based forecasts outperforming other approaches. Forecast skill relative to the baseline was generally higher for larger jurisdictions (e.g., states compared to counties). Over time, forecasts generally performed worst in periods of rapid changes in reported cases (either in increasing or decreasing epidemic phases) with 95% prediction interval coverage dropping below 50% during the growth phases of the winter 2020, Delta, and Omicron waves. Ideally, case forecasts could serve as a leading indicator of changes in transmission dynamics. However, while most COVID-19 case forecasts outperformed a naïve baseline model, even the most accurate case forecasts were unreliable in key phases. Further research could improve forecasts of leading indicators, like COVID-19 cases, by leveraging additional real-time data, addressing performance across phases, improving the characterization of forecast confidence, and ensuring that forecasts were coherent across spatial scales. In the meantime, it is critical for forecast users to appreciate current limitations and use a broad set of indicators to inform pandemic-related decision making.

<p>Pharmacological IDO1 inhibition was administered following the fluid percussion injury model of traumatic brain injury in young adult male rats. IDO1 inhibition prevented the increase in kynurenine pathway activity that was seen in the brain of the vehicle-treated group at 3 days postinjury, as demonstrated by the ratio of kynurenine to tryptophan (A). IDO1 inhibition also resulted in improved outcomes in spatial memory tasks, with treated rats spending more time in the target quadrant of the Barnes maze compared to vehicle controls at 28 days postinjury (B). In addition, IDO1 inhibition resulted in less anxiety-like behaviors, with rats spending a larger percentage of time in the inner field of the open field test compared to vehicle controls at 25 days postinjury (C). These results suggest increased KP activity after FPI may mediate neurological dysfunction, and IDO1 inhibition should be further investigated as a potential therapeutic target to improve recovery.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The enzyme indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) catalyzes the rate-limiting step in the kynurenine pathway (KP) which produces both neuroprotective and neurotoxic metabolites. Neuroinflammatory signals produced as a result of pathological conditions can increase production of IDO1 and boost its enzymatic capacity. IDO1 and the KP have been implicated in behavioral recovery after human traumatic brain injury (TBI), but their roles in experimental models of TBI are for the most part unknown. We hypothesized there is an increase in KP activity in the fluid percussion injury (FPI) model of TBI, and that administration of an IDO1 inhibitor will improve neurological recovery. In this study, adult male Sprague Dawley rats were subjected to FPI or sham injury and received twice-daily oral administration of the IDO1 inhibitor PF-06840003 (100 mg/kg) or vehicle control. FPI resulted in a significant increase in KP activity, as demonstrated by an increased ratio of kynurenine: tryptophan, in the perilesional neocortex and ipsilateral hippocampus 3 days postinjury (DPI), which normalized by 7 DPI. The increase in KP activity was prevented by PF-06840003. IDO1 inhibition also improved memory performance as assessed in the Barnes maze and anxiety behaviors as assessed in open field testing in the first 28 DPI. These results suggest increased KP activity after FPI may mediate neurological dysfunction, and IDO1 inhibition should be further investigated as a potential therapeutic target to improve recovery.</p>

">Psilocybin facilitates fear extinction: importance of dose, context, and serotonin receptors</a></h4>

              
                A variety of classic psychedelics and MDMA have been shown to enhance fear extinction in rodent models. This has translational significance because a standard treatment for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is prolonged exposure therapy. However, few studies have investigated psilocybin's potential effect in fear learning paradigms. More specifically, the extents to which dose, timing of administration, and serotonin receptors may influence psilocybin's effect on fear extinction are not understood. In this study, we used a delay fear conditioning paradigm to determine the effects of psilocybin on fear extinction, extinction retention, and fear renewal in male and female mice. Psilocybin robustly enhances fear extinction when given acutely prior to testing for all doses tested. Psilocybin also exerts long-term effects to elevate extinction retention and suppress fear renewal in a novel context, though these changes were sensitive to dose. Administration of psilocybin prior to fear learning or immediately after extinction yielded no change in behavior, indicating that concurrent extinction experience is necessary for the drug's effects. Co-treatment with a 5-HT2A receptor antagonist blocked psilocybin's effects for extinction, extinction retention and fear renewal, whereas 5-HT1A receptor antagonism attenuated only the effect on fear renewal. Collectively, these results highlight dose, context, and serotonin receptors as crucial factors in psilocybin's ability to facilitate fear extinction. The study provides preclinical evidence to support investigating psilocybin as a pharmacological adjunct for extinction-based therapy for PTSD.

">RealtimeDecoder: A fast software module for online clusterless decoding</a></h4>

              
                Decoding algorithms provide a powerful tool for understanding the firing patterns that underlie cognitive processes such as motor control, learning, and recall. When implemented in the context of a real-time system, decoders also make it possible to deliver feedback based on the representational content of ongoing neural activity. That in turn allows experimenters to test hypotheses about the role of that content in driving downstream activity patterns and behaviors. While multiple real-time systems have been developed, they are typically implemented in C++ and are locked to a specific data acquisition system, making them difficult to adapt to new experiments.Here we present a Python software system that implements online clusterless decoding using state space models in a manner independent of data acquisition systems. The parallelized system processes neural data with temporal resolution of 6 ms and median computational latency <50 ms for medium- to large-scale (32+ tetrodes) rodent hippocampus recordings without the need for spike sorting. It also executes auxiliary functions such as detecting sharp wave ripples from local field potential (LFP) data. Performance is similar to state-of-the-art solutions which use compiled programming languages. We demonstrate this system use in a rat behavior experiment in which the decoder allowed closed loop neurofeedback based on decoded hippocampal spatial representations . This system provides a powerful and easy-to-modify tool for real-time feedback experiments.

">Daily glucocorticoids promote glioblastoma growth and circadian synchrony to the host</a></h4>

              
                Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common primary brain tumor in adults with a poor prognosis despite aggressive therapy. A recent, retrospective clinical study found that administering Temozolomide in the morning increased patient overall survival by 6 months compared to evening. Here, we tested the hypothesis that daily host signaling regulates tumor growth and synchronizes circadian rhythms in GBM. We found daily Dexamethasone promoted or suppressed GBM growth depending on time of day of administration and on the clock gene, Bmal1. Blocking circadian signals, like VIP or glucocorticoids, dramatically slowed GBM growth and disease progression. Finally, mouse and human GBM models have intrinsic circadian rhythms in clock gene expression in vitro and in vivo that entrain to the host through glucocorticoid signaling, regardless of tumor type or host immune status. We conclude that GBM entrains to the circadian circuit of the brain, which modulates its growth through clock-controlled cues, like glucocorticoids.

">Novel clock neuron subtypes regulate temporal aspects of sleep</a></h4>

              
                Circadian neurons within animal brains orchestrate myriad physiological processes and behaviors, But the contribution of these neurons to the regulation of sleep is not well understood. To address this deficiency, we leveraged single cell RNA sequencing to generate a new and now comprehensive census of transcriptomic cell types of Drosophila clock neurons. We focused principally on the enigmatic DN3s, which constitute about half of the 75 pairs of clock neurons in the fly brain and were previously almost completely uncharacterized. These DN3s are organized into 12 clusters with unusual gene expression features compared to the more well-studied clock neurons. We further show that different DN3 subtypes with distinct projection patterns promote sleep at specific times of the day through a common G protein coupled receptor, TrissinR. Our findings indicate an intricate regulation of sleep behavior by clock neurons and highlight their remarkable diversity in gene expression, projection patterns and functional properties.

">DeepLeMiN: Deep-learning-empowered Physics-aware Lensless Miniscope</a></h4>

              
                Mask-based lensless fluorescence microscopy is a compact, portable imaging technique promising for biomedical research. It forms images through a thin optical mask near the camera without bulky optics, enabling snapshot three-dimensional imaging and a scalable field of view (FOV) without increasing device thickness. Lensless microscopy relies on computational algorithms to solve the inverse problem of object reconstruction. However, there has been a lack of efficient reconstruction algorithms for large-scale data. Furthermore, the entire FOV is typically reconstructed as a whole, which demands substantial computational resources and limits the scalability of the FOV. Here, we developed DeepLeMiN, a lensless microscope with a custom designed optical mask and a multi-stage physics-informed deep learning model. This not only enables the reconstruction of localized FOVs, but also significantly reduces the computational resource demands and facilitates real-time reconstruction. Our deep learning algorithm can reconstruct object volumes over 4x6x0.6 mm3, achieving lateral and axial resolution of ~10 m and ~50 m respectively. We demonstrated significant improvement in both reconstruction quality and speed compared to traditional methods, across various fluorescent samples with dense structures. Notably, we achieved high-quality reconstruction of 3D motion of hydra and the neuronal activity with cellular resolution in awake mouse cortex. DeepLeMiN holds great promise for scalable, large FOV, real-time, 3D imaging applications with compact device footprint.

">A Deep Learning-Based Segmentation of Cells and Analysis (DL-SCAN)</a></h4>

              
                With the recent surge in the development of highly selective probes, fluorescence microscopy has become one of the most widely used approaches to study cellular properties and signaling in living cells and tissues. Traditionally, microscopy image analysis heavily relies on manufacturer-supplied software, which often demands extensive training and lacks automation capabilities for handling diverse datasets. A critical challenge arises, if fluorophores employed exhibit low brightness and low Signal-to-Noise ratio (SNR). As a consequence, manual intervention may become a necessity, introducing variability in the analysis outcomes even for identical samples when analyzed by different users. This leads to the incorporation of blinded analysis which ensures that the outcome is free from user bias to a certain extent but is extremely time-consuming. To overcome these issues, we have developed a tool called DL-SCAN that automatically segments and analyzes fluorophore-stained regions of interest such as cell bodies in fluorescence microscopy images using a Deep Learning algorithm called Stardist. We demonstrate its ability to automate cell identification and study cellular ion dynamics using synthetic image stacks with varying SNR. This is followed by its application to experimental Na+ and Ca2+ imaging data from neurons and astrocytes in mouse brain tissue slices exposed to transient chemical ischemia. The results from DL-SCAN are consistent, reproducible, and free from user bias, allowing efficient and rapid analysis of experimental data in an objective manner. The open-source nature of the tool also provides room for modification and extension to analyze other forms of microscopy images specific to the dynamics of different ions in other cell types.

	<p>This study assessed suicidal risk in patients suffering from non-psychotic depressive disorders within various clinical and nosological forms (F31&amp;amp;ndash;F34 mood disorders and F60.31&amp;amp;mdash;emotionally unstable personality disorder). Clinical and psychological features were presented, as well as predictors of suicidal risk in patients of these groups. We performed a comparative analysis of the anxiety and depression level, the level of mental pain, fear of death and the severity of anti-suicidal motives in patients with affective disorders and borderline personality disorder (BPD). Based on the results, 100% of patients in these clinical nosological groups were found to have a high level of suicidal risk. Patients with affective disorders have weak anti-suicidal motives and are not fully aware of the consequences of their own death. Patients with BPD have a higher suicidal risk than patients with affective disorders; they are characterized by less pronounced social orientation, demonstrativeness, self-centeredness, less pronounced levels of anxiety and fear of death.</p>

                Several recent studies have shown decreased sensitivity when stimuli are immobilized on the retina, a procedure known as retinal stabilization. Because of the technical challenges inherent in this procedure, studies have either used fast-phosphor CRT displays or directly updated the stimulus on the retina by means of adaptive optics scanning laser ophthalmoscopes. Both display systems provide brief pulses to the retina, raising the question of whether this flicker contributed to perceptual effects. Here we report the results of retinal stabilization experiments conducted with LCD monitors at high refresh rates. Results replicate previous findings of high-frequency impairments under retinal stabilization. These data provide further support for a functional role of small eye movements during visual fixation.

">Improving Predictability, Test-Retest Reliability and Generalisability of Brain-Wide Associations for Cognitive Abilities via Multimodal Stacking</a></h4>

              
                Brain-wide association studies (BWASs) have attempted to relate cognitive abilities with brain phenotypes, but have been challenged by issues such as predictability, test-retest reliability, and cross-cohort generalisability. To tackle these challenges, we proposed stacking that combines brain magnetic resonance imaging of different modalities, from task-fMRI contrasts and functional connectivity during tasks and rest to structural measures, into one prediction model. We benchmarked the benefits of stacking, using the Human Connectome Projects: Young Adults and Aging and the Dunedin Study. For predictability, stacked models led to out-of-sample r~.5-.6 when predicting cognitive abilities at the time of scanning and 36 years earlier. For test-retest reliability, stacked models reached an excellent level of reliability (ICC>.75), even when we stacked only task-fMRI contrasts together. For generalisability, a stacked model with non-task MRI built from one dataset significantly predicted cognitive abilities in other datasets. Altogether, stacking is a viable approach to undertake the three challenges of BWAS for cognitive abilities.

">Protection of savings by reducing the salience of opposing errors</a></h4>

              
                When humans encounter the same disturbance twice, they adapt to it faster during the second exposure. To examine how subconscious learning systems contribute to this savings process, previous studies have suppressed explicit awareness of the perturbation by gradually increasing its magnitude during initial learning. This has produced mixed effects, with some studies demonstrating faster relearning, and others observing no acceleration during relearning. Here we examined whether these differences might be due to the nature of a de-adaptation period that separates two learning periods. To test this idea, we manipulated the magnitude of washout errors by de-adapting participants abruptly, gradually, or by removing feedback entirely. Empirical analyses indicated that the different classes of washout errors had a profound effect on savings: large washout errors nullified the ability to save, whereas small errors or the absence of error protected savings. Model-based analyses suggested that changes in learning rates were mediated by an increase in sensitivity to error that could be reversed by experience with oppositely-oriented washout errors. This suggests that the experience of error produces both a facilitation of learning for similar errors and a reduction in learning for dissimilar errors. The latter can abolish the expression of savings following gradual adaptation.

">Cortical circuit principles predict patterns of trauma induced tauopathy in humans</a></h4>

              
                Connections in the cortex of diverse mammalian species are predicted reliably by the Structural Model for direction of pathways and signal processing (reviewed in 1,2). The model is rooted in the universal principle of cortical systematic variation in laminar structure and has been supported widely for connection patterns in animals but has not yet been tested for humans. Here, in postmortem brains of individuals neuropathologically diagnosed with chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) we studied whether the hyperphosphorylated tau (p-tau) pathology parallels connection sequence in time by circuit mechanisms. CTE is a progressive p-tau pathology that begins focally in perivascular sites in sulcal depths of the neocortex (stages I-II) and later involves the medial temporal lobe (MTL) in stages III-IV. We provide novel quantitative evidence that the p-tau pathology in MTL A28 and nearby sites in CTE stage III closely follows the graded laminar patterns seen in homologous cortico-cortical connections in non-human primates. The Structural Model successfully predicted the laminar distribution of the p-tau neurofibrillary tangles and neurites and their density, based on the relative laminar (dis)similarity between the cortical origin (seed) and each connection site. The findings were validated for generalizability by a computational progression model. By contrast, the early focal perivascular pathology in the sulcal depths followed local columnar connectivity rules. These findings support the general applicability of a theoretical model to unravel the direction and progression of p-tau pathology in human neurodegeneration via a cortico-cortical mechanism. Cortical pathways converging on medial MTL help explain the progressive spread of p-tau pathology from focal cortical sites in early CTE to widespread lateral MTL areas and beyond in later disease stages.

">Fast, Accurate, and Versatile Data Analysis Platform for the Quantification of Molecular Spatiotemporal Signals</a></h4>

              
                Optical recording of intricate molecular dynamics is becoming an indispensable technique for biological studies, accelerated by the development of new or improved biosensors and microscopy technology. This creates major computational challenges to extract and quantify biologically meaningful patterns embedded within complex and rich data sources. Here, we introduce Activity Quantification and Analysis (AQuA2), a fast, accurate, and versatile data analysis platform built upon advanced machine learning techniques. AQuA2 decomposes complex live imaging-based datasets into elementary signaling events, allowing accurate and unbiased quantification of molecular activities and identification of consensus functional units. We demonstrate applications of AQuA2 across a range of biosensors (calcium, norepinephrine, ATP, acetylcholine, dopamine), cell types (astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, microglia, neurons), organs (brains and spinal cords), animal models (zebrafish and mouse), and imaging modalities (confocal, two-photon, light sheet). As exemplar findings, we show how AQuA2 identified drug-dependent interactions between neurons and astroglia, and distinct sensorimotor signal propagation patterns in the mouse spinal cord.

">Alcohol-induced sleep dysregulation in Drosophila is dependent on the neuropeptide PDF</a></h4>

              
                Alcohol exposure is known to trigger homeostatic adaptations in the brain that lead to the development of tolerance and dependence. These adaptations are also believed to be the root of a series of disturbances in sleep patterns that often manifest during the development of alcoholism and can have significant clinical and economic consequences. Unfortunately, the neuronal and genetic pathways that control the effects of alcohol on sleep are currently unknown, thus limiting our efforts to find effective treatment. In this study, we conduct a mechanistic exploration of the relationships between alcohol and sleep alterations using a Drosophila model system. We show that the genetic manipulation of the ventral lateral neurons (LNv) -a set of neurons known to control sleep in Drosophila- disrupts alcohol sensitivity and tolerance. Moreover, we show that alcohol exposure induces a series of alterations in sleep patterns that last for several days. Our results demonstrate that a single alcohol exposure promotes daytime sleep, alters the structure of sleep during the night, and reduces morning anticipatory behavior. In addition, we show that some of these alterations partially depend on the activity of the neuropeptide PDF, a key element in regulating sleep architecture. We propose that alcohol-induced sleep disruption stems from alterations in the activity of the PDF-releasing LNv neurons and that these alterations are similar to those that produce alcohol tolerance.

">Individual variability in the relationship between physiological and resting-state fMRI metrics</a></h4>

              
                Cerebrovascular Reactivity (CVR), the brain's vascular response to a vasodilatory stimulus, can be measured using fMRI during breathing challenges that modulate arterial CO2 levels. CVR is an important indicator of cerebrovascular health, although its estimation can be challenging due to the extra experimental setup and/or the subject compliance required. To overcome these limitations, summary metrics based on resting state fluctuations (RSF), such as the (fractional) amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (f/ALFF) and the resting state fluctuation amplitude (RSFA), have been proposed as alternative estimates of CVR, as they are frequently associated with vascular and physiological factors. Previous studies have reported a significant relationship between CVR estimates obtained by means of respiratory paradigms and RSF metrics. However, the total sample sizes, considering both subjects and sessions, are typically small, and not all studies agree on the degree of the relationship. Furthermore, to our knowledge, these studies have only reported cross-sectional analyses, whereas intra-subject longitudinal relationships between CVR estimates and RSF metrics are unknown. Leveraging a unique dense sampling dataset in which resting state and breath-hold multi-echo fMRI were collected in 7 subjects with 10 sessions each, we provide evidence of high individual variability in the inter-session (i.e. intra-subject) relationship between RSF metrics and CVR. These results indicate that RSF metrics might not be a suitable proxy of CVR in clinical settings or for BOLD signal calibration as they may not properly account for intra-individual physiological variations in BOLD fMRI data.

">Spontaneous HFO Sequences Reveal Propagation Pathways for Precise Delineation of Epileptogenic Networks</a></h4>

              
                Epilepsy, a neurological disorder affecting millions worldwide, poses great challenges in precisely delineating the epileptogenic zone, the brain region generating seizures, for effective treatment. High-frequency oscillations (HFOs) are emerging as promising biomarkers; however, the clinical utility is hindered by the difficulties in distinguishing pathological HFOs from non-epileptiform activities at single electrode and single patient resolution and understanding their dynamic role in epileptic networks. Here, we introduce an HFO-sequencing approach to analyze spontaneous HFOs traversing cortical regions in 40 drug-resistant epilepsy patients. This data-driven method automatically detected over 8.9 million HFOs, pinpointing pathological HFO-networks, and unveiled intricate millisecond-scale spatiotemporal dynamics, stability, and functional connectivity of HFOs in prolonged intracranial EEG recordings. These HFO sequences demonstrated a significant improvement in localization of epileptic tissue, with an 818.47% increase in concordance with seizure-onset zone (mean error: 2.92 mm), compared to conventional benchmarks. They also accurately predicted seizure outcomes for 90% AUC based on pre-surgical information using generalized linear models. Importantly, this mapping remained reliable even with short recordings (mean standard deviation: 3.23 mm for 30-minute segments). Furthermore, HFO sequences exhibited distinct yet highly repetitive spatiotemporal patterns, characterized by pronounced synchrony and predominant inward information flow from periphery towards areas involved in propagation, suggesting a crucial role for excitation-inhibition balance in HFO initiation and progression. Together, these findings shed light on the intricate organization of epileptic network and highlight the potential of HFO-sequencing as a translational tool for improved diagnosis, surgical targeting, and ultimately, better outcomes for vulnerable patients with drug-resistant epilepsy.

">Arkypallidal neurons in the external globus pallidus can mediate inhibitory control by altering competition in the striatum</a></h4>

              
                Reactive inhibitory control is crucial for survival. Traditionally, this control in mammals was attributed solely to the hyperdirect pathway, with cortical control signals flowing unidirectionally from the subthalamic nucleus (STN) to basal ganglia output regions. Yet recent findings have put this model into question, suggesting that the STN is assisted in stopping actions through ascending control signals to the striatum mediated by the external globus pallidus (GPe). Here we investigate this suggestion by harnessing a biologically-constrained spiking model of the cortico-basal ganglia-thalamic (CBGT) circuit that includes pallidostriatal pathways originating from arkypallidal neurons. Through a series of experiments probing the interaction between three critical inhibitory nodes (the STN, arkypallidal cells, and indirect pathway spiny projection neurons), we find that the GPe acts as a critical mediator of both ascending and descending inhibitory signals in the CBGT circuit. In particular, pallidostriatal pathways regulate this process by weakening the direct pathway dominance of the evidence accumulation process driving decisions, which increases the relative suppressive influence of the indirect pathway on basal ganglia output. These findings delineate how pallidostriatal pathways can facilitate action cancellation by managing the bidirectional flow of information within CBGT circuits.

">Sleep and Activity Patterns in Autism Spectrum Disorder</a></h4>

              
                Background: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a highly heritable and heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by impaired social interactions, repetitive behaviors, and a wide range of comorbidities. Between 44-83% of autistic individuals report sleep disturbances, which may share an underlying neurodevelopmental basis with ASD. Methods: We recruited 382 ASD individuals and 223 of their family members to obtain quantitative ASD-related traits and wearable device-based accelerometer data spanning three consecutive weeks. An unbiased approach identifying traits associated with ASD was achieved by applying the elastic net machine learning algorithm with five-fold cross-validation on 6,878 days of data. The relationship between sleep and physical activity traits was examined through linear mixed-effects regressions using each night of data. Results: This analysis yielded 59 out of 242 actimetry measures associated with ASD status in the training set, which were first validated in a test set (AUC: 0.777). For several of these traits (e.g. total light physical activity), the day-to-day variability, in addition to the mean value, was associated with ASD. Individuals with ASD were found to have a stronger correlation between physical activity and sleep, where less physical activity decreased their sleep more significantly than that of their non-ASD relatives. Conclusions: The average duration of sleep/physical activity and the variation in the average duration of sleep/physicial activity strongly predict ASD status. Physical activity measures were correlated with sleep quality, traits, and regularity, with ASD individuals having stronger correlations. Interventional studies are warranted to investigate whether improvements in both sleep and increased physical activity may improve the core symptoms of ASD.

">Hippocampal ripples mediate motor learning during brief rest breaks in humans</a></h4>

              
                Although research on the hippocampus has largely focused on its role in active learning, critical aspects of learning and memory happen offline, during both wake and sleep. When healthy young people learn a motor sequence task, most of their performance improvement happens not while typing, but offline, during interleaved rest breaks. Although patients with dense amnesia due to hippocampal damage show a normal amount of motor sequence learning, they show a different pattern. They actually lose speed over the breaks and compensate while typing. This indicates that an intact hippocampus is necessary for offline motor learning during wake but does not specify its mechanism. Here, we studied epilepsy patients (n=20) undergoing direct intracranial EEG monitoring of the hippocampus as they learned the same motor sequence task. Like healthy young people, they showed greater speed gains across rest breaks than while typing. They also showed a higher ripple rate during the breaks that predicted offline gains in speed. This suggests that motor learning during brief rest breaks during wake is mediated by hippocampal ripples. These findings complement rodent studies showing memory replay during hippocampal ripples in the wakeful rest that follows learning. Disrupting these ripples impairs memory, consistent with a causal role. The findings also provide a mechanistic explanation of human neuroimaging reports of increased hippocampal activation and sequential motor memory replay during rest breaks that predict performance improvement. Finally, they expand our understanding of the role of hippocampal ripples beyond declarative memory to include enhancing motor procedural memory.

">Viral overexpression of human alpha-synuclein in mouse substantia nigra dopamine neurons results in hyperdopaminergia but no neurodegeneration</a></h4>

              
                Loss of select neuronal populations such as midbrain dopamine (DA) neurons is a pathological hallmark of Parkinson disease (PD). The small neuronal protein alpha-synuclein has been related both genetically and neuropathologically to PD, yet how it contributes to selective vulnerability remains elusive. Here, we describe the generation of a novel adeno-associated viral vector (AAV) for Cre-dependent overexpression of wild-type human alpha-synuclein. Our strategy allows us to restrict alpha-synuclein to select neuronal populations and hence investigate the cell-autonomous effects of elevated alpha-synuclein in genetically-defined cell types. Since DA neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) are particularly vulnerable in PD, we investigated in more detail the effects of increased alpha-synuclein in these cells. AAV-mediated overexpression of wildtype human alpha-synuclein in SNc DA neurons increased the levels of alpha-synuclein within these cells and augmented phosphorylation of alpha-synuclein at serine-129, which is considered a pathological feature of PD and other synucleinopathies. However, despite abundant alpha-synuclein overexpression and hyperphosphorylation we did not observe any DA neurodegeneration up to 90 days post virus infusion. In contrast, we noticed that overexpression of alpha-synuclein resulted in increased locomotor activity and elevated striatal DA levels suggesting that alpha-synuclein enhanced dopaminergic activity. We therefore conclude that cell-autonomous effects of elevated alpha-synuclein are not sufficient to trigger acute DA neurodegeneration.

">Cortical networks responsive to phrase structure and subject island violations</a></h4>

              
                In principle, functional neuroimaging provides uniquely informative data in addressing linguistic questions, because it can indicate distinct processes that are not apparent from behavioral data alone. This could involve adjudicating the source of unacceptability via the different patterns of elicited brain responses to different ungrammatical sentence types. However, it is difficult to interpret brain activations to syntactic violations. Such responses could reflect processes that have nothing intrinsically related to linguistic representations, such as domain-general executive function abilities. In order to facilitate the potential use of functional neuroimaging methods to identify the source of different syntactic violations, we conducted an fMRI experiment to identify the brain activation maps associated with two distinct syntactic violation types: phrase structure (created by inverting the order of two adjacent words within a sentence) and subject islands (created by extracting a wh-phrase out of an embedded subject). The comparison of these violations to control sentences surprisingly showed no indication of a generalized violation response, with almost completely divergent activation patterns. Phrase structure violations seemingly activated regions previously implicated in verbal working memory and structural complexity in sentence processing, whereas the subject islands appeared to activate regions previously implicated in conceptual-semantic processing, broadly defined. We review our findings in the context of previous research on syntactic and semantic violations using event-related potentials. We suggest that functional neuroimaging is a potentially fruitful technique in unpacking the distinct sets of cognitive processes elicited by theoretically-relevant syntactic violations, when interpreted with care and paired with appropriate control conditions.

">Development of the overlapping network modules in the human brain</a></h4>

              
                Developmental connectomic studies have shown that the modular organization of functional networks in the human brain undergoes substantial reorganization with age to support cognitive growth. However, these studies implicitly assume that each brain region belongs to one and only one specific network module, ignoring the potential spatial overlap between functional modules. How the overlapping functional modular architecture develops and whether this development is related to structural signatures remain unknown. Using longitudinal multimodal structural, functional, and diffusion MRI data from 305 children (aged 6-14 years), we investigated the development of the overlapping modular architecture of functional networks, and further explored their structural associations. Specifically, an edge-centric network model was used to identify the overlapping functional modules, and the nodal overlap in module affiliations was quantified using the entropy measure. We showed a remarkable regional inhomogeneity in module overlap in children, with higher entropy in the ventral attention, somatomotor, and subcortical networks and lower entropy in the visual and default-mode networks. Furthermore, the overlapping modules developed in a linear, spatially dissociable manner from childhood to adolescence, with significantly reduced entropy in the prefrontal cortex and putamen and increased entropy in the parietal lobules. Personalized overlapping modular patterns capture individual brain maturity as characterized by brain age. Finally, the overlapping functional modules can be significantly predicted by integrating gray matter morphology and white matter network properties. Our findings highlight the maturation of overlapping network modules and their structural substrates, thereby advancing our understanding of the principles of connectome development.

">Verbal working memory and syntactic comprehension segregate into the dorsal and ventral streams</a></h4>

              
                Syntactic processing and verbal working memory are both essential components to sentence comprehension. Nonetheless, the separability of these systems in the brain remains unclear. To address this issue, we performed causal-inference analyses based on lesion and connectome network mapping using MRI and behavioral testing in 103 individuals with chronic post-stroke aphasia. We employed a rhyme judgment task with heavy working memory load without articulatory confounds, controlling for the overall ability to match auditory words to pictures and to perform a metalinguistic rhyme judgment, isolating the effect of working memory load. We assessed noncanonical sentence comprehension, isolating syntactic processing by incorporating residual rhyme judgment performance as a covariate for working memory load. Voxel-based lesion analyses and structural connectome-based lesion symptom mapping controlling for total lesion volume were performed, with permutation testing to correct for multiple comparisons (4,000 permutations). We observed that effects of working memory load localized to dorsal stream damage: posterior temporal-parietal lesions and frontal-parietal white matter disconnections. These effects were differentiated from syntactic comprehension deficits, which were primarily associated with ventral stream damage: lesions to temporal lobe and temporal-parietal white matter disconnections, particularly when incorporating the residual measure of working memory load as a covariate. Our results support the conclusion that working memory and syntactic processing are associated with distinct brain networks, largely loading onto dorsal and ventral streams, respectively.

">Optimized AAV capsids for diseases of the basal ganglia show robust potency and distribution in adult nonhuman primates</a></h4>

              
                Huntington's disease and other disorders of the basal ganglia create challenges for biomolecule-based medicines given the poor accessibility of these deep brain structures following intracerebral or intravascular delivery. Additionally, for adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) intravascular delivery exposes peripheral tissues to the vast majority of the therapy, increasing the risk of immune responses and the quantity and associated cost of goods required for therapeutically relevant brain penetration levels. Here, we found that low dose, low volume delivery of unbiased AAV libraries into a focused brain region allowed recovery of novel capsids capable of broad access to key deep brain and cortical structures relevant for human therapies at doses orders of magnitude lower than used in current clinical trials. One such capsid, AAV-DB-3, provided transduction of up to 45% of medium spiny neurons in the adult NHP striatum, along with substantial transduction of relevant deep layer neurons in the cortex. Notably, AAV-DB-3 behaved similarly in mice as in NHPs and also potently transduced human neurons derived from induced pluripotent stem cells. Thus, AAV-DB-3 provides a unique AAV for network level brain gene therapies that translates up and down the evolutionary scale for preclinical studies and eventual clinical use.

">Insulin resistance compromises midbrain organoid neural activity and metabolic efficiency predisposing to Parkinsons disease pathology</a></h4>

              
                Growing evidence indicates that Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) is associated with an increased risk of developing Parkinsons disease through shared disease mechanisms. Studies show that insulin resistance, which is the driving pathophysiological mechanism of T2D plays a major role in neurodegeneration by impairing neuronal functionality, metabolism, and survival. To investigate insulin resistance caused pathological changes in the human midbrain, which could predispose a healthy midbrain to PD development, we exposed iPSC-derived human midbrain organoids from healthy individuals to either high insulin concentrations, promoting insulin resistance, or to more physiological insulin concentrations restoring insulin signalling function. We combined experimental methods with metabolic modelling to identify the most insulin resistance-dependent pathogenic processes. We demonstrate that insulin resistance compromises organoid metabolic efficiency, leading to increased levels of oxidative stress. Additionally, insulin-resistant midbrain organoids showed decreased neural activity and reduced amount of dopaminergic neurons, highlighting insulin resistance as a significant target in PD prevention.

">Statistical signature of subtle behavioural changes inlarge-scale behavioural assays</a></h4>

              
                The central nervous system can generate various behaviours, including motor responses, which we can observe through video recordings. Recent advancements in genetics, automated behavioural acquisition at scale, and machine learning enable us to link behaviours to their underlying neural mechanisms causally. Moreover, in some animals, such as the Drosophila larva, this mapping is possible at unprecedented scales of millions of animals and single neurons, allowing us to identify the neural circuits generating particular behaviours. These high-throughput screening efforts are invaluable, linking the activation or suppression of specific neurons to behavioural patterns in millions of animals. This provides a rich dataset to explore how diverse nervous system responses can be to the same stimuli. However, challenges remain in identifying subtle behaviours from these large datasets, including immediate and delayed responses to neural activation or suppression, and understanding these behaviours on a large scale. We introduce several statistically robust methods for analyzing behavioural data in response to these challenges: 1) A generative physical model that regularizes the inference of larval shapes across the entire dataset. 2) An unsupervised kernel-based method for statistical testing in learned behavioural spaces aimed at detecting subtle deviations in behaviour. 3) A generative model for larval behavioural sequences, providing a benchmark for identifying complex behavioural changes. 4) A comprehensive analysis technique using suffix trees to categorize genetic lines into clusters based on common action sequences. We showcase these methodologies through a behavioural screen focused on responses to an air puff, analyzing data from 280,716 larvae across 568 genetic lines.

">Synchrony, oscillations, and phase relationships in collective neuronal activity: a highly comparative overview of methods</a></h4>

              
                Neuronal activity is organized in collective patterns that are critical for information coding, generation, and communication between brain areas. These patterns are often described in terms of synchrony, oscillations, and phase relationships. Many methods have been proposed for the quantification of these collective states of dynamic neuronal organization. However, it is difficult to determine which method is best suited for which experimental setting and research question. This choice is further complicated by the fact that most methods are sensitive to a combination of synchrony, oscillations, and other factors; in addition, some of them display systematic biases that can complicate their interpretation. To address these challenges, we adopt a highly comparative approach, whereby spike trains are represented by a diverse library of measures. This enables unsupervised or supervised classification in the space of measures, or in that of spike trains. We compile a battery of 122 measures of synchrony, oscillations, and phase relationships, complemented with 9 measures of spiking intensity and variability. We first apply them to sets of synthetic spike trains with known statistical properties, and show that all measures are confounded by extraneous factors such as firing rate or population frequency, but to different extents. Then, we analyze spike trains recorded in different species---rat, mouse, and monkey---and brain areas---primary sensory cortices and hippocampus---and show that our highly comparative approach provides a high-dimensional quantification of collective network activity that can be leveraged for both unsupervised and supervised classification of firing patterns. Overall, the highly comparative approach provides a detailed description of the empirical properties of multineuron spike train analysis methods, including practical guidelines for their use in experimental settings, and advances our understanding of neuronal coordination and coding.

">Effects of cognitive load and years of experience on phase-amplitude coupling in simultaneous interpretation</a></h4>

              
                Simultaneous interpretation is a highly cognitively demanding task that requires constant attention switching between languages. Interest continues to grow in the contribution of phase-amplitude coupling (PAC), which involves the cooperative interaction of multiple oscillations and working memory. In this study, we established subjective definitions for cognitive load levels based on the subjective word familiarity of simultaneous interpretation, categorizing them as low, medium, or high. We then compared the changes in the PAC patterns between experienced interpreters and beginners. Experienced interpreters exhibited an increase in PAC, including theta-gamma PAC, which is linked to working memory, as well as theta-beta PAC, alpha-beta PAC and alpha-gamma PAC, with rising cognitive load levels in simultaneous interpreting. This suggests that experienced simultaneous interpreters choose a more adaptive neural processing strategy in response to the cognitive demands of interpretation language. In contrast, beginner interpreters do not show such changes in PACs, indicating either an underdeveloped or a different neurological approach to the cognitive load levels of interpretation language. The difference in PAC responses between the two groups reflects varying cognitive and interpretive strategies in the brain, where experienced interpreters might utilize more advanced neural mechanisms to manage higher levels of difficulty in simultaneous interpretation.

                Balancing plasticity and stability in neural circuits is essential for an animal's ability to learn from its environment while preserving the proper processing and perception of sensory information. However, unlike the mechanisms that drive plasticity in neural circuits, the activity-induced molecular mechanisms that convey functional stability remain poorly understood. Focusing on the visual cortex of adult mice and combining transcriptomics, electrophysiology and 2-photon imaging, we find that the daily appearance of light induces in excitatory neurons a large gene program along with rapid and transient shifts in the ratio of excitation and inhibition (E/I-ratio) and ongoing neural activity. Furthermore, we find that the light-induced transcription factor NPAS4 drives these daily normalizations of E/I-ratio and neural activity rates and that it stabilizes the neurons' response properties. These findings indicate that daily sensory-induced transcription normalizes E/I-ratio and drives downward Firing Rate Homeostasis to maintain proper sensory processing and perception.

                The interplay between slow-wave sleep and cardiovascular health is increasingly recognized. Our prior research showed that auditory-enhanced slow waves can boost cardiac function, yet the mechanisms behind this remain unclear. Advancing these findings, our current analysis dissected the effects of two slow wave types on cardiovascular function, using data from 18 middle-aged men across three nights. We found that the strength of heart rate and blood pressure responses concurrent with slow waves predicts cardiac function post-sleep. Notably, we identified that highly synchronized type I slow waves, as opposed to lower-amplitude type II slow waves, primarily co-occur with these cardiovascular pulsations. While auditory stimulation enhances both types of slow waves, they exhibit distinct temporal dynamics, pointing to different underlying biological mechanisms. This study crucially addresses how distinct slow wave types can affect cardiovascular function, implying that targeted slow wave stimulation could be a strategic approach to improve heart health.

">Insulin evokes release of endozepines from astrocytes of the NTS to modulate glucose metabolism</a></h4>

              
                The central nervous system (CNS) plays a key role in regulating metabolic functions, but conditions like obesity and diabetes can disrupt this balance. Within the CNS, the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) in the dorsal vagal complex (DVC) controls glucose metabolism and feeding behaviour. In rodents, the NTS senses insulin and communicates with the liver to regulate glucose production. Even short term exposure to a high fat diet (HFD) can lead to insulin resistance and impair NTS function. However, we still know little about which cells in the NTS are sensitive to insulin. Our study aimed to identify these insulin sensitive cells and understand how they affect glucose metabolism. We found that insulin receptors in astrocytes are crucial for the NTS ability to regulate glucose production in the liver. Insulin evokes the release of endozepines from astrocytes, and injecting endozepines into the NTS reduces glucose production. The effect of endozepines within the NTS is mimicked by GABAA antagonists and prevented by an agonist, suggesting that insulin prompts astrocytes to release endozepines, which then attenuate GABAA receptor activity, ultimately reducing glucose production in the liver. Our study is the first to show that insulin dependent release of endozepines from NTS astrocytes is fundamental to control blood glucose levels, providing valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying insulin function within this specific region of the CNS.

">Differential control of intestine function by genetically defined enteric neurons</a></h4>

              
                The function of the intestine is regulated by direct innervation from a combination of enteric, sensory, and autonomic neurons. A central question in neurobiology is how these distinct peripheral neuron populations collectively control intestinal function. However, disambiguating the functions of intestine-innervating neuronal populations has been a challenge. Using intersectional genetic approaches in mice, we enable precise manipulations of defined neuronal populations within the intestinal tract. We examined enteric neurons, which represent the majority of intestine-innervating neurons, by genetically isolating neuronal subclasses, identifying their morphological specializations, and defining subclass-specific influences on intestinal functions. We further found that food consumption can be modulated by select enteric neuron populations via the spinal sensory afferent pathway. Taken together, the presented molecular genetic characterization of intestine-innervating neurons establishes a foundation for detailed studies of the enteric nervous system and its interactions with the broader neural networks of the body.

                <p>Elicited upon violation of regularity in stimulus presentation, mismatch negativity (MMN) reflects the brain's ability to perform automatic comparisons between consecutive stimuli and provides an electrophysiological index of sensory error detection whereas P300 is associated with cognitive processes such as updating of the working memory. To date, there has been extensive research on the roles of MMN and P300 individually, because of their potential to be used as clinical markers of consciousness and attention, respectively. Here, we intend to explore with an unsupervised and rigorous source estimation approach, the underlying cortical generators of MMN and P300, in the context of prediction error propagation along the hierarchies of brain information processing in healthy human participants. The existing methods of characterizing the two ERPs involve only approximate estimations of their amplitudes and latencies based on specific sensors of interest. Our objective is twofold: first, we introduce a novel data-driven unsupervised approach to compute latencies and amplitude of ERP components accurately on an individual-subject basis and reconfirm earlier findings. Second, we demonstrate that in multisensory environments, MMN generators seem to reflect a significant overlap of "modality-specific" and "modality-independent" information processing while P300 generators mark a shift toward completely "modality-independent" processing. Advancing earlier understanding that multisensory contexts speed up early sensory processing, our study reveals that temporal facilitation extends to even the later components of prediction error processing, using EEG experiments. Such knowledge can be of value to clinical research for characterizing the key developmental stages of lifespan aging, schizophrenia, and depression.</p>

                <p>Canonically, action potentials of most mammalian neurons initiate at the axon initial segment (AIS) and propagate bidirectionally: orthodromically along the distal axon and retrogradely into the soma and dendrites. Under some circumstances, action potentials may initiate ectopically, at sites distal to the AIS, and propagate antidromically along the axon. These "ectopic action potentials" (EAPs) have been observed in experimental models of seizures and chronic pain, and more rarely in nonpathological forebrain neurons. Here we report that a large majority of parvalbumin-expressing (PV+) interneurons in the upper layers of mouse neocortex, from both orbitofrontal and primary somatosensory areas, fire EAPs after sufficient activation of their somata. Somatostatin-expressing interneurons also fire EAPs, though less robustly. Ectopic firing in PV+ cells occurs in varying temporal patterns and can persist for several seconds. PV+ cells evoke strong synaptic inhibition in pyramidal neurons and interneurons and play critical roles in cortical function. Our results suggest that ectopic spiking of PV+ interneurons is common and may contribute to both normal and pathological network functions of the neocortex.</p>

                Background In this cross-sectional study conducted in Wakiso, Uganda, from May to July 2023, we investigated the interactions among age, sex, education, and heart rate in relation to dementia and Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) among individuals aged 65 years and older. Methods We purposively sampled 106 participants, focusing on those with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias, leveraging collaborations with local health teams. Data collection involved comprehensive questionnaires covering sociodemographic details and health parameters, and employed the Montreal Cognitive Assessment Tool for dementia screening. Results Our findings highlight a nuanced landscape of risk factors; each additional year of age was associated with a 1.19- and 1.22-times increased risk of MCI and dementia, respectively. Gender analysis revealed a protective effect against MCI in males, but no significant impact on dementia risk. Education emerged as a protective factor, with each additional year associated with a 28% reduction in MCI risk, although its effect on dementia risk remains ambiguous. Significantly, an elevated heart rate was strongly linked to an increased risk of both MCI and dementia, underscoring the potential cardiovascular dimension in cognitive health. Conclusions This study contributes to the understanding of the complex interplay of risk factors for dementia, emphasizing the need for further research to elucidate the underlying mechanisms and interventions for healthy cognitive aging in the older adult population.

                A 56-year-old female with a medical history of unspecified hyperthyroidism and a recent thyroid storm presented to the ED with tachycardia, hypertension, and bilateral enlarged parotid glands. During a previous hospitalization, she was diagnosed with unspecified hyperthyroidism and started on methimazole. During hospitalization, laboratory findings suggested Graves’ disease with an acute thyroid storm. The patient also complained of enlarged parotid glands bilaterally. CT tomography of the neck revealed no calculi of the parotid glands but showed extensive fatty replacement, possibly related to methimazole use. Treatment with propranolol and IV hydrocortisone improved thyroid function. Due to the suspicion of methimazole-induced parotitis, she was transitioned to a reduced methimazole dosage for treatment of Graves’ disease, which subsequently improved her parotitis. Methimazole, the standard initial treatment for Graves’ disease, is generally well-tolerated. It can cause adverse reactions; however, parotitis is very rare and has been documented in only a few case reports. Owing to the limited number of reports, its incidence is currently unknown. Here, we present a case of methimazole-induced parotitis as an unusual presentation of thyroid storm. Drug-induced reactions can only be considered once common causes of parotitis such as viral infection, obstruction, and autoimmune diseases are ruled out. Treatment involves dosage adjustments and supportive care. Methimazole-induced parotitis is often misdiagnosed and overlooked because of the lack of reported cases. This necessitates future research into the reaction mechanisms and optimal treatment.

                Background This study investigated the utility of platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) and Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte ratio (NLR) in patients with COVID-19 with respect to age, early (a week) vs. delayed recovery (> a week) and mortality. Methods This was a retrospective study including 1,016 COVID-19 patients. The discriminatory power and multivariate logistic regression analysis were performed. Results The mean age of patients was 45 (± 13.9), and 75.7% were males. Older patients had elevated NLR, PLR, D-dimer, CRP, and Interleukin-6 levels and longer hospital stay than the younger group (p < 0.001). In-hospital mortality was higher in older adults (26.9% vs. 6.6%, p =0.001). On-admission NLR (5.8 vs. 3.2; P= 0.001) and PLR (253.9±221.1 vs. 192.2±158.5; p = 0.004) were higher in the non-survivors than survivors. Both PLR and NLR displayed significant discriminatory ability for mortality. NLR had a higher AUC and specificity, while PLR exhibited slightly higher sensitivity. In individuals aged ≤55, NLR showed superior discrimination (AUC=0.717) compared to PLR (AUC=0.620). Conversely, for older adults, PLR displayed enhanced discrimination (AUC=0.710), while NLR showed AUC=0.693. Conclusion Higher admission NLR and PLR levels were associated with delayed recovery, whereas an enhanced NLR was associated with considerably higher mortality in older COVID-19 patients.

                Background Congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT) are a group of structural abnormalities affecting these vital organs, frequently leading to chronic kidney disease in children. This study aims to comprehensively understand the clinical profile of CAKUT in children in Central India, an area with unique socio-demographic characteristics and limited prior research on this topic. Methods A prospective observational study will be conducted over three years in the pediatric department of AVBRH, a tertiary healthcare center in Central India. Data were collected through interviews with parents or guardians of children up to 18 admitted to the hospital. Clinical symptoms, prenatal history, physical examinations, and diagnostic investigations were meticulously documented. Expected outcome The study is expected to reveal the prevalence and clinical profile of CAKUT in Central Indian children. Anticipated outcomes include insights into anomalies, clinical symptoms, and potential correlations with factors like prenatal care and consanguineous marriages. Diagnostic investigations will help assess the severity of renal impairment. The results may also uncover regional variations and have implications for public health initiatives aimed at early intervention and improved patient care. However, these are preliminary expectations that are subject to confirmation through the completion of the study.

Background <p>Respiratory pathogens inflict a substantial burden on public health and the economy. Although the severity of symptoms caused by these pathogens can vary from asymptomatic to fatal, the factors that determine symptom severity are not fully understood. Correlations in symptoms between infector-infectee pairs, for which evidence is accumulating, can generate large-scale clusters of severe infections that could be devastating to those most at risk, whilst also conceivably leading to chains of mild or asymptomatic infections that generate widespread immunity with minimal cost to public health. Although this effect could be harnessed to amplify the impact of interventions that reduce symptom severity, the mechanistic representation of symptom propagation within mathematical and health economic modelling of respiratory diseases is understudied.</p> Methods and findings <p>We propose a novel framework for incorporating different levels of symptom propagation into models of infectious disease transmission via a single parameter, <i>α</i>. Varying <i>α</i> tunes the model from having no symptom propagation (<i>α</i> = 0, as typically assumed) to one where symptoms always propagate (<i>α</i> = 1). For parameters corresponding to three respiratory pathogens—seasonal influenza, pandemic influenza and SARS-CoV-2—we explored how symptom propagation impacted the relative epidemiological and health-economic performance of three interventions, conceptualised as vaccines with different actions: symptom-attenuating (labelled SA), infection-blocking (IB) and infection-blocking admitting only mild breakthrough infections (IB_MB).In the absence of interventions, with fixed underlying epidemiological parameters, stronger symptom propagation increased the proportion of cases that were severe. For SA and IB_MB, interventions were more effective at reducing prevalence (all infections and severe cases) for higher strengths of symptom propagation. For IB, symptom propagation had no impact on effectiveness, and for seasonal influenza this intervention type was more effective than SA at reducing severe infections for all strengths of symptom propagation. For pandemic influenza and SARS-CoV-2, at low intervention uptake, SA was more effective than IB for all levels of symptom propagation; for high uptake, SA only became more effective under strong symptom propagation. Health economic assessments found that, for SA-type interventions, the amount one could spend on control whilst maintaining a cost-effective intervention (termed threshold unit intervention cost) was very sensitive to the strength of symptom propagation.</p> Conclusions <p>Overall, the preferred intervention type depended on the combination of the strength of symptom propagation and uptake. Given the importance of determining robust public health responses, we highlight the need to gather further data on symptom propagation, with our modelling framework acting as a template for future analysis.</p>

                <p>by Sebastien Benzekry, Michalis Mastri, Chiara Nicolò, John M. L. Ebos</p>

Clinical trials involving systemic neoadjuvant treatments in breast cancer aim to shrink tumors before surgery while simultaneously allowing for controlled evaluation of biomarkers, toxicity, and suppression of distant (occult) metastatic disease. Yet neoadjuvant clinical trials are rarely preceded by preclinical testing involving neoadjuvant treatment, surgery, and post-surgery monitoring of the disease. Here we used a mouse model of spontaneous metastasis occurring after surgical removal of orthotopically implanted primary tumors to develop a predictive mathematical model of neoadjuvant treatment response to sunitinib, a receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (RTKI). Treatment outcomes were used to validate a novel mathematical kinetics-pharmacodynamics model predictive of perioperative disease progression. Longitudinal measurements of presurgical primary tumor size and postsurgical metastatic burden were compiled using 128 mice receiving variable neoadjuvant treatment doses and schedules (released publicly at https://zenodo.org/records/10607753). A non-linear mixed-effects modeling approach quantified inter-animal variabilities in metastatic dynamics and survival, and machine-learning algorithms were applied to investigate the significance of several biomarkers at resection as predictors of individual kinetics. Biomarkers included circulating tumor- and immune-based cells (i.e., circulating tumor cells and myeloid-derived suppressor cells) as well as immunohistochemical tumor proteins (i.e., CD31 and Ki67). Our computational simulations show that neoadjuvant RTKI treatment inhibits primary tumor growth but has little efficacy in preventing (micro)-metastatic disease progression after surgery and treatment cessation. Machine learning algorithms that included support vector machines, random forests, and artificial neural networks, confirmed a lack of definitive biomarkers, which shows the value of preclinical modeling studies to identify potential failures that should be avoided clinically.

                <p>by David Mezey, Dominik Deffner, Ralf H. J. M. Kurvers, Pawel Romanczuk</p>

Collective dynamics emerge from individual-level decisions, yet we still poorly understand the link between individual-level decision-making processes and collective outcomes in realistic physical systems. Using collective foraging to study the key trade-off between personal and social information use, we present a mechanistic, spatially-explicit agent-based model that combines individual-level evidence accumulation of personal and (visual) social cues with particle-based movement. Under idealized conditions without physical constraints, our mechanistic framework reproduces findings from established probabilistic models, but explains how individual-level decision processes generate collective outcomes in a bottom-up way. In clustered environments, groups performed best if agents reacted strongly to social information, while in uniform environments, individualistic search was most beneficial. Incorporating different real-world physical and perceptual constraints profoundly shaped collective performance, and could even buffer maladaptive herding by facilitating self-organized exploration. Our study uncovers the mechanisms linking individual cognition to collective outcomes in human and animal foraging and paves the way for decentralized robotic applications.

                <p>by An Qi Zhang, Martin R. Ralph, Adam R. Stinchcombe</p>

Many self-motivated and goal-directed behaviours display highly flexible, approximately 4 hour ultradian (shorter than a day) oscillations. Despite lacking direct correspondence to physical cycles in the environment, these ultradian rhythms may be involved in optimizing functional interactions with the environment and reflect intrinsic neural dynamics. Current evidence supports a role of mesostriatal dopamine (DA) in the expression and propagation of ultradian rhythmicity, however, the biochemical processes underpinning these oscillations remain to be identified. Here, we use a mathematical model to investigate D2 autoreceptor-dependent DA self-regulation as the source of ultradian behavioural rhythms. DA concentration at the midbrain-striatal synapses is governed through a dual-negative feedback-loop structure, which naturally gives rise to rhythmicity. This model shows the propensity of striatal DA to produce an ultradian oscillation characterized by a flexible period that is highly sensitive to parameter variations. Circadian (approximately 24 hour) regulation consolidates the ultradian oscillations and alters their response to the phase-dependent, rapid-resetting effect of a transient excitatory stimulus. Within a circadian framework, the ultradian rhythm orchestrates behavioural activity and enhances responsiveness to an external stimulus. This suggests a role for the circadian-ultradian timekeeping hierarchy in governing organized behaviour and shaping daily experience through coordinating the motivation to engage in recurring, albeit not highly predictable events, such as social interactions.

To optimize proteins for particular traits holds great promise for industrial and pharmaceutical purposes. Machine Learning is increasingly applied in this field to <i>predict</i> properties of proteins, thereby guiding the experimental optimization process. A natural question is: How much progress are we making with such predictions, and how important is the choice of regressor and representation? In this paper, we demonstrate that different assessment criteria for regressor performance can lead to dramatically different conclusions, depending on the choice of metric, and how one defines generalization. We highlight the fundamental issues of sample bias in typical regression scenarios and how this can lead to misleading conclusions about regressor performance. Finally, we make the case for the importance of calibrated uncertainty in this domain.

                <p>by Paulina Clara Dagnino, Anira Escrichs, Ane López-González, Olivia Gosseries, Jitka Annen, Yonatan Sanz Perl, Morten L. Kringelbach, Steven Laureys, Gustavo Deco</p>

A fundamental challenge in neuroscience is accurately defining brain states and predicting how and where to perturb the brain to force a transition. Here, we investigated resting-state fMRI data of patients suffering from disorders of consciousness (DoC) after coma (minimally conscious and unresponsive wakefulness states) and healthy controls. We applied model-free and model-based approaches to help elucidate the underlying brain mechanisms of patients with DoC. The model-free approach allowed us to characterize brain states in DoC and healthy controls as a probabilistic metastable substate (PMS) space. The PMS of each group was defined by a repertoire of unique patterns (i.e., metastable substates) with different probabilities of occurrence. In the model-based approach, we adjusted the PMS of each DoC group to a causal whole-brain model. This allowed us to explore optimal strategies for promoting transitions by applying off-line <i>in silico</i> probing. Furthermore, this approach enabled us to evaluate the impact of local perturbations in terms of their global effects and sensitivity to stimulation, which is a model-based biomarker providing a deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying DoC. Our results show that transitions were obtained in a synchronous protocol, in which the somatomotor network, thalamus, precuneus and insula were the most sensitive areas to perturbation. This motivates further work to continue understanding brain function and treatments of disorders of consciousness.

                Background Prosthetic joint infection is a serious complication that can arise after total joint replacement surgery. When bacteria colonise an orthopaedic implant, they form biofilms that protect them from their environment, making them difficult to remove. Treatment is further complicated by a global rise of antimicrobial resistance. These protective mechanisms make treatment of prosthetic joint infection increasingly complex. Non-contact induction heating is an upcoming technology that uses heat to eradicate bacteria that are present on the surface of metallic implants. This study aims to provide insight into the feasibility of using non-contact induction heating on metallic implants that are in direct contact with other biomaterials, such as coatings composed of hydroxyapatite and bone cement composed of poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA). Methods Characterisation of hydroxyapatite coatings and adhesion strength tests were conducted according to standards set by the International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO 13779-2). The fixation strength of acrylic bone cement was tested according to an adapted method from ISO. Results It was found that non-contact induction heating did not significantly affect the adhesion strength of hydroxyapatite coatings (p=0.697). In contrast to hydroxyapatite coatings, acrylic bone cement softened temporarily as the temperature exceeded the glass transition temperature (83.38 ± 10.88°C). However, the induction heating temperature had no significant effect on the fixation strength after the cement was allowed to cool down (p=0.535). Conclusion This study shows the feasibility of using non-contact induction heating up to 80°C when bone cement or ceramic coatings are present in contact with infected metallic implants.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Recent work has identified a critical role for the hippocampus in reward-sensitive behaviors, including motivated memory, reinforcement learning, and decision-making. Animal histology and human functional neuroimaging have shown that brain regions involved in reward processing and motivation are more interconnected with the ventral/anterior hippocampus. However, direct evidence examining gradients of structural connectivity between reward regions and the hippocampus in humans is lacking. The present study used diffusion MRI (dMRI) and probabilistic tractography to quantify the structural connectivity of the hippocampus with key reward processing regions in vivo. Using a large sample of subjects (<i>N</i> = 628) from the human connectome dMRI data release, we found that connectivity profiles with the hippocampus varied widely between different regions of the reward circuit. While the dopaminergic midbrain (ventral tegmental area) showed stronger connectivity with the anterior versus posterior hippocampus, the ventromedial prefrontal cortex showed stronger connectivity with the posterior hippocampus. The limbic (ventral) striatum demonstrated a more homogeneous connectivity profile along the hippocampal long axis. This is the first study to generate a probabilistic atlas of the hippocampal structural connectivity with reward-related networks, which is essential to investigating how these circuits contribute to normative adaptive behavior and maladaptive behaviors in psychiatric illness. These findings describe nuanced structural connectivity that sets the foundation to better understand how the hippocampus influences reward-guided behavior in humans.</p>

                Background One central characteristic of schizophrenia is cognitive dysfunction, which typically has modest to severe effects on a variety of cognitive areas. Evidence suggests that cognitive impairment may occur far sooner than the clinical symptoms. The connection between cognitive deficiencies and functional outcome indicators has attracted increasing attention in recent years. Cognitive deficits are widely known to affect overall functioning, In India, few studies have been conducted to determine the profile of cognitive abnormalities in individuals in the chronic phase of schizophrenia as well as those in remission. Research from developing nations is crucial because schizophrenia prevalence in these nations is thought to be lower than that in industrialized nations. The aim of this study will be to assess the prevalence of cognitive dysfunction in individuals with schizophrenia and examine the relationship between cognitive dysfunction with psychopathology and quality of life in individuals with schizophrenia. Protocol This will be a cross sectional hospital-based study. After ethical clearance, all patients in the Psychiatry Department meeting the criteria of Schizophrenia, according to the ICD-10, will be part of the study. The expected number of participants is 228. All participants within the age group of 18 to 65 years who are clinically diagnosed to have schizophrenia using ICD-10 and who are able to give written informed consent will be included in the study. The patient’s sociodemographic data will be collected in Outpatient or inpatient basis and then the following questionnaires will be applied to them: i) Socio-demographic Proforma; ii) The Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS); iii) The World Health Organization Quality of Life-BREF scale (WHOQOL-BREF); and iv) Addenbrooke’s cognitive examination III (ACE). Once the aforementioned questionnaires are completed, the prevalence of cognitive dysfunction in patients with schizophrenia will be assessed, and its relationship with psychopathology and quality of life will be studied.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91034">A dynamic neural resource model bridges sensory and working memory</a></h4>

              
                Probing memory of a complex visual image within a few hundred milliseconds after its disappearance reveals significantly greater fidelity of recall than if the probe is delayed by as little as a second. Classically interpreted, the former taps into a detailed but rapidly decaying visual sensory or ‘iconic’ memory (IM), while the latter relies on capacity-limited but comparatively stable visual working memory (VWM). While iconic decay and VWM capacity have been extensively studied independently, currently no single framework quantitatively accounts for the dynamics of memory fidelity over these time scales. Here, we extend a stationary neural population model of VWM with a temporal dimension, incorporating rapid sensory-driven accumulation of activity encoding each visual feature in memory, and a slower accumulation of internal error that causes memorized features to randomly drift over time. Instead of facilitating read-out from an independent sensory store, an early cue benefits recall by lifting the effective limit on VWM signal strength imposed when multiple items compete for representation, allowing memory for the cued item to be supplemented with information from the decaying sensory trace. Empirical measurements of human recall dynamics validate these predictions while excluding alternative model architectures. A key conclusion is that differences in capacity classically thought to distinguish IM and VWM are in fact contingent upon a single resource-limited WM store.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/89967">The MODY-associated KCNK16 L114P mutation increases islet glucagon secretion and limits insulin secretion resulting in transient neonatal diabetes and glucose dyshomeostasis in adults</a></h4>

              
                The gain-of-function mutation in the TALK-1 K<sup>+</sup> channel (p.L114P) is associated with maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY). TALK-1 is a key regulator of β-cell electrical activity and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. The <i>KCNK16</i> gene encoding TALK-1 is the most abundant and β-cell-restricted K<sup>+</sup> channel transcript. To investigate the impact of <i>KCNK16</i> L114P on glucose homeostasis and confirm its association with MODY, a mouse model containing the <i>Kcnk16</i> L114P mutation was generated. Heterozygous and homozygous <i>Kcnk16</i> L114P mice exhibit increased neonatal lethality in the C57BL/6J and the CD-1 (ICR) genetic background, respectively. Lethality is likely a result of severe hyperglycemia observed in the homozygous <i>Kcnk16</i> L114P neonates due to lack of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and can be reduced with insulin treatment. <i>Kcnk16</i> L114P increased whole-cell β-cell K<sup>+</sup> currents resulting in blunted glucose-stimulated Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry and loss of glucose-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations. Thus, adult <i>Kcnk16</i> L114P mice have reduced glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and plasma insulin levels, which significantly impairs glucose homeostasis. Taken together, this study shows that the MODY-associated <i>Kcnk16</i> L114P mutation disrupts glucose homeostasis in adult mice resembling a MODY phenotype and causes neonatal lethality by inhibiting islet insulin secretion during development. These data suggest that TALK-1 is an islet-restricted target for the treatment for diabetes.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/87529">Therapeutic doses of ketamine acutely attenuate the aversive effect of losses during decision-making</a></h4>

              
                The discovery of rapid-acting antidepressant, ketamine has opened a pathway to a new generation of treatments for depression, and inspired neuroscientific investigation based on a new perspective that non-adaptive changes in the intrinsic excitatory and inhibitory circuitry might underlie the pathophysiology of depression. Nevertheless, it still remains largely unknown how the hypothesized molecular and synaptic levels of changes in the circuitry might mediate behavioral and neuropsychological changes underlying depression, and how ketamine might restore adaptive behavior. Here, we used computational models to analyze behavioral changes induced by therapeutic doses of ketamine, while rhesus macaques were iteratively making decisions based on gains and losses of tokens. When administered intramuscularly or intranasally, ketamine reduced the aversiveness of undesirable outcomes such as losses of tokens without significantly affecting the evaluation of gains, behavioral perseveration, motivation, and other cognitive aspects of learning such as temporal credit assignment and time scales of choice and outcome memory. Ketamine’s potentially antidepressant effect was separable from other side effects such as fixation errors, which unlike outcome evaluation, was readily countered with strong motivation to avoid errors. We discuss how the acute effect of ketamine to reduce the initial impact of negative events could potentially mediate longer-term antidepressant effects through mitigating the cumulative effect of those events produced by slowly decaying memory, and how the disruption-resistant affective memory might pose challenges in treating depression. Our study also invites future investigations on ketamine’s antidepressant action over diverse mood states and with affective events exerting their impacts at diverse time scales.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/88510">Metabolic and neurobehavioral disturbances induced by purine recycling deficiency in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (APRT) and hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT) are two structurally related enzymes involved in purine recycling in humans. Inherited mutations that suppress HGPRT activity are associated with Lesch–Nyhan disease (LND), a rare X-linked metabolic and neurological disorder in children, characterized by hyperuricemia, dystonia, and compulsive self-injury. To date, no treatment is available for these neurological defects and no animal model recapitulates all symptoms of LND patients. Here, we studied LND-related mechanisms in the fruit fly. By combining enzymatic assays and phylogenetic analysis, we confirm that no HGPRT activity is expressed in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>, making the APRT homolog (Aprt) the only purine-recycling enzyme in this organism. Whereas APRT deficiency does not trigger neurological defects in humans, we observed that <i>Drosophila Aprt</i> mutants show both metabolic and neurobehavioral disturbances, including increased uric acid levels, locomotor impairments, sleep alterations, seizure-like behavior, reduced lifespan, and reduction of adenosine signaling and content. Locomotor defects could be rescued by Aprt re-expression in neurons and reproduced by knocking down <i>Aprt</i> selectively in the protocerebral anterior medial (PAM) dopaminergic neurons, the mushroom bodies, or glia subsets. Ingestion of allopurinol rescued uric acid levels in <i>Aprt</i>-deficient mutants but not neurological defects, as is the case in LND patients, while feeding adenosine or <i>N</i><sup>6</sup>-methyladenosine (m<sup>6</sup>A) during development fully rescued the epileptic behavior. Intriguingly, pan-neuronal expression of an LND-associated mutant form of human HGPRT (I42T), but not the wild-type enzyme, resulted in early locomotor defects and seizure in flies, similar to <i>Aprt</i> deficiency. Overall, our results suggest that <i>Drosophila</i> could be used in different ways to better understand LND and seek a cure for this dramatic disease.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/83897">Cholecystokinin facilitates motor skill learning by modulating neuroplasticity in the motor cortex</a></h4>

              
                Cholecystokinin (CCK) is an essential modulator for neuroplasticity in sensory and emotional domains. Here, we investigated the role of CCK in motor learning using a single pellet reaching task in mice. Mice with a knockout of <i>Cck</i> gene (<i>Cck<sup>−/−</sup></i>) or blockade of CCK-B receptor (CCKBR) showed defective motor learning ability; the success rate of retrieving reward remained at the baseline level compared to the wildtype mice with significantly increased success rate. We observed no long-term potentiation upon high-frequency stimulation in the motor cortex of <i>Cck<sup>−/−</sup></i> mice, indicating a possible association between motor learning deficiency and neuroplasticity in the motor cortex. In vivo calcium imaging demonstrated that the deficiency of CCK signaling disrupted the refinement of population neuronal activity in the motor cortex during motor skill training. Anatomical tracing revealed direct projections from CCK-expressing neurons in the rhinal cortex to the motor cortex. Inactivation of the CCK neurons in the rhinal cortex that project to the motor cortex bilaterally using chemogenetic methods significantly suppressed motor learning, and intraperitoneal application of CCK4, a tetrapeptide CCK agonist, rescued the motor learning deficits of <i>Cck<sup>−/−</sup></i> mice. In summary, our results suggest that CCK, which could be provided from the rhinal cortex, may surpport motor skill learning by modulating neuroplasticity in the motor cortex.

	<p>Electroencephalography (EEG) is effectively employed to describe cognitive patterns corresponding to different tasks of motor functions for brain&amp;amp;ndash;computer interface (BCI) implementation. Explicit information processing is necessary to reduce the computational complexity of practical BCI systems. This paper presents an entropy-based approach to select effective EEG channels for motor imagery (MI) classification in brain&amp;amp;ndash;computer interface (BCI) systems. The method identifies channels with higher entropy scores, which is an indication of greater information content. It discards redundant or noisy channels leading to reduced computational complexity and improved classification accuracy. High entropy means a more disordered pattern, whereas low entropy means a less disordered pattern with less information. The entropy of each channel for individual trials is calculated. The weight of each channel is represented by the mean entropy of the channel over all the trials. A set of channels with higher mean entropy are selected as effective channels for MI classification. A limited number of sub-band signals are created by decomposing the selected channels. To extract the spatial features, the common spatial pattern (CSP) is applied to each sub-band space of EEG signals. The CSP-based features are used to classify the right-hand and right-foot MI tasks using a support vector machine (SVM). The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated using two publicly available EEG datasets, known as BCI competition III&amp;amp;ndash;IV(A) and BCI competition IV&amp;amp;ndash;I. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach surpasses cutting-edge techniques.</p>

                The acceptance rate towards COVID-19 vaccination among the global population could be higher due to the need for more education or awareness of prevention strategies to control the COVID-19 outbreak. Thus, there is a dire need to reduce the population’s reluctance towards COVID-19 vaccination across the globe, which will ultimately lead to the implementation of prevention and control strategies against the COVID-19 virus and improving health outcomes across the globe. The following study intends to conduct a systematic review of the literature to evaluate the relationship between COVID-19 vaccination and the current trends related to COVID-19 vaccination faced by the global population. The methodology employed in this study primarily focused on assessing secondary data by conducting a systematic literature review. Internet and electronic databases were used to select research articles to obtain secondary sources. Six articles were selected from ScienceDirect and Google Scholar for a systematic literature review. The keywords used for the selection of articles were “COVID-19,” “Global trends,” Reluctance, “and “vaccination.” The selected articles that were most suitable for the topic consisted of global trends related to COVID-19 vaccination. Six articles relevant to the topic were selected and reviewed. The selected articles showed data collection results from different research journals. The findings of the six research articles depicted common themes, such as each vaccine having a different level of access attitude towards the regional existence, which primarily depends on the variability to determine the vaccine’s effectiveness. Further studies are required to evaluate the factors and strategies that help healthcare organizations and governments reduce the reluctance to use the COVID-19 vaccine among populations worldwide.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-439/v1?src=rss">There is no easy fix to peer review but paying referees and regulating the number of submissions might help [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                The exponential increase in the number of submissions, further accelerated by generative AI, and the decline in the availability of experts are burdening the peer review process. This has led to high unethical desk rejection rates, a growing appeal for the publication of unreviewed preprints, and a worrying proliferation of predatory journals. The idea of monetarily compensating peer reviewers has been around for many years; maybe, it is time to take it seriously as one way to save the peer review process. Here, I argue that paying reviewers, when done in a fair and transparent way, is a viable solution. Like the case of professional language editors, part-time or full-time professional reviewers, managed by universities or for-profit companies, can be an integral part of modern peer review. Being a professional reviewer could be financially attractive to retired senior researchers and to researchers who enjoy evaluating papers but are not motivated to do so for free. Moreover, not all produced research needs to go through peer review, and thus persuading researchers to limit submissions to their most novel and useful research could also help bring submission volumes to manageable levels. Overall, this paper reckons that the problem is not the peer review process per se but rather its function within an academic ecosystem dominated by an unhealthy culture of ‘publish or perish’. Instead of reforming the peer review process, academia has to look for better science dissemination schemes that promote collaboration over competition, engagement over judgement, and research quality and sustainability over quantity.

                Background Dentocraniofacial asymmetry is a common condition that affects many individuals. Accurate diagnosis of this condition is essential for effective treatment planning. Aim This study aimed to compare the diagnosis of dentocraniofacial asymmetry using two-dimensional and three-dimensional methods. Methods A cross-sectional, observational study was conducted at the Orthodontic Specialist Clinic of the Dental Hospital Faculty of Dentistry, University of Indonesia from March to April 2023. The study included 15 patients who had not undergone orthodontic treatment and were diagnosed with dentocraniofacial asymmetry. The study compared the results of diagnosing asymmetry in 15 different facial features, including the anterior nasal spine, upper and lower first incisors, pterygomaxillary fissure, orbita, menton, porion, upper and lower first molars, coronoid process, gonion, zygoma, latero nasale, and jugulare. Results The study found that there was no significant difference in the diagnosis of dentocraniofacial symmetry between the two- and three-dimensional methods across all 15 parameters measured. The researchers used Fisher's Exact Test to compare the proportion between dependent variables and found that the p-value was greater than 0.05, indicating that there was no significant difference in the diagnosis of dentocraniofacial symmetry between the two methods. The study also used Kappa Cohen analysis to measure the strength of agreement between the diagnosis of dentocraniofacial symmetry of the two-dimensional and three-dimensional methods on each parameter. Conclusion The findings of this study suggest that both two-dimensional and three-dimensional methods are equally effective in diagnosing dentocraniofacial asymmetry. This information may be useful for orthodontists in deciding which method to use when diagnosing dentocraniofacial asymmetry.

                Introduction Visual outcomes and quality of life of individuals with proliferative diabetic retinopathy following pan-retinal photocoagulation (PRP) have only been briefly documented in a few publications. Improved quality of life experienced by patients as a result of PRP is directly associated with a positive impact on visual outcomes. Aim To determine whether visual outcomes and quality of life after PRP in diabetic patients would result in a better predictive image of the patient as a whole, thus boosting the success rates and efficacy of this treatment method. Methods P.R.P. was performed under topical anesthesia as defined by the early treatment diabetic retinopathy study (E.T.D.R.S.) guidelines. Conclusion This evidence-based analytical observational prospective study could aid in exploring the prognostic value of pan-retinal photocoagulation in proliferative diabetic retinopathy.

                Introduction It is essential to improve global public health and to achieve sustainable developmental goals. Mental health problems are common during menstruation in adolescent girls. Menstrual problems affect academic performance, personal lives, and social lives. Menstrual problems are both affective and somatic. This study is undertaken to study the Impact of Menstruation on the Mental Health of young adolescent girls. The participants ‘ ages range from 15 to 19 years. Adolescent coping method ds Mental health, psychological well-being, and spiritual well-being were assessed. Menstrual-phase respondents exhibited increased psychological traits as a measure of adolescent girls’ coping with mental difficulties. Objectives To evaluate menstruation-related knowledge, attitude, sources of information, and psychological well-being To determine the mental health problems during the menstrual cycle. To find out the association between sociodemographic variables and mental health problems during menstrual cycle Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted in a rural area of the Wardha district. This study used a descriptive cross-sectional research design. A sample of 364 individuals was selected using random sampling. The inclusion criteria were adolescent girls aged 15–19 years who attained menstruation. Exclusion criteria: Girls younger than 15 years and above 19 years, as well as those who were hesitant and uncomfortable asking for information to participate in the study, were excluded. Outcomes Adolescent girls experienced menstruation-related psychosocial issues that are not uncommon. Menstrual distress, burden, stigma, lack of counselling services, lack of preparation menarche, lack of easy access to clean resources, vacy concerns when changing pads are necessary, lack of facilities for disposing sanitary napkins, and inadequate psychological and social support. Most girls experienced stress, mood swings, and restlessness during their menstrual cycle. These findings are consistent with past studies that found that the majority of girls were agitated during menstruation. Approximately 25% of them felt ashamed and guilty about their pubertal changes, and experienced menarche in fear, shyness, and sadness. On the first day of menstruation, girls report psychological problems such as anxiety, trouble concentrating, sadness, irritability, and excitement7. Approximately two-thirds of teenagers in the current study were unaware that menarche occurred earlier.

                Background The primary goal of this research is to underscore the significance of molecular docking in the context of malaria drug discovery. Molecular docking plays a crucial role in comprehending the interactions between prospective drugs and the target proteins found in Plasmodium parasites. The study delves into the docking interactions of various compounds, emphasizing the necessity of stabilizing the active site to formulate potent and selective drugs. Methods The research focuses on highlighting compound-specific interactions with residues, stressing the importance of stabilizing the active site to design drugs tailored to specific target proteins. Inhibiting the function of these target proteins disrupts the life cycle of the malaria parasite. Quantum Similarity Analysis, utilizing Overlap and Coulomb operators, is employed to identify electronic similarities. The resulting quantum similarity values guide subsequent chemical reactivity analysis. Global reactivity indices such as chemical potential, hardness, softness, and electrophilicity contribute to drug design by showcasing compound-specific indices that underscore the significance of stability and electrophilicity. Fukui functions are utilized to visualize regions for stabilization, providing insights crucial for potential malaria treatment. Results The enhancement of drug-target binding affinity is observed through stabilizing interactions in the active site. Understanding electrophilicity at the active site emerges as a critical factor in drug design and selectivity. The rational manipulation of electrophilic interactions holds promise for developing potent and selective drugs against malaria. Consequently, the integration of molecular docking, quantum similarity analysis, and chemical reactivity indices offers a comprehensive approach to malaria drug discovery. Conclusions The study identifies potential lead compounds, emphasizing the crucial role of stabilizing the active site. Additionally, it sheds light on electronic considerations vital for the design of effective and resistance-resistant drugs. The insights provided by Fukui functions into regions susceptible to -H bond formation make these compounds promising candidates for malaria treatment.

                <p>by Valdemar Kargård Olsen, Jonathan R. Whitlock, Yasser Roudi</p>

We investigate the ability of the pairwise maximum entropy (PME) model to describe the spiking activity of large populations of neurons recorded from the visual, auditory, motor, and somatosensory cortices. To quantify this performance, we use (1) Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergences, (2) the extent to which the pairwise model predicts third-order correlations, and (3) its ability to predict the probability that multiple neurons are simultaneously active. We compare these with the performance of a model with independent neurons and study the relationship between the different performance measures, while varying the population size, mean firing rate of the chosen population, and the bin size used for binarizing the data. We confirm the previously reported excellent performance of the PME model for small population sizes <i>N</i> < 20. But we also find that larger mean firing rates and bin sizes generally decreases performance. The performance for larger populations were generally not as good. For large populations, pairwise models may be good in terms of predicting third-order correlations and the probability of multiple neurons being active, but still significantly worse than small populations in terms of their improvement over the independent model in KL-divergence. We show that these results are independent of the cortical area and of whether approximate methods or Boltzmann learning are used for inferring the pairwise couplings. We compared the scaling of the inferred couplings with <i>N</i> and find it to be well explained by the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) model, whose strong coupling regime shows a complex phase with many metastable states. We find that, up to the maximum population size studied here, the fitted PME model remains outside its complex phase. However, the standard deviation of the couplings compared to their mean increases, and the model gets closer to the boundary of the complex phase as the population size grows.

                <p>by Zheng Yuan, Mark F. van Delft, Mark Xiang Li, Fransisca Sumardy, Brian J. Smith, David C. S. Huang, Guillaume Lessene, Yelena Khakam, Ruitao Jin, Sitong He, Nicholas A. Smith, Richard W. Birkinshaw, Peter E. Czabotar, Grant Dewson</p>

BAK and BAX execute intrinsic apoptosis by permeabilising the mitochondrial outer membrane. Their activity is regulated through interactions with pro-survival BCL-2 family proteins and with non-BCL-2 proteins including the mitochondrial porin VDAC2. VDAC2 is important for bringing both BAK and BAX to mitochondria where they execute their apoptotic function. Despite this important function in apoptosis, while interactions with pro-survival family members are well characterised and have culminated in the development of drugs that target these interfaces to induce cancer cell apoptosis, the interaction between BAK and VDAC2 remains largely undefined. Deep scanning mutagenesis coupled with cysteine linkage identified key residues in the interaction between BAK and VDAC2. Obstructive labelling of specific residues in the BH3 domain or hydrophobic groove of BAK disrupted this interaction. Conversely, mutating specific residues in a cytosol-exposed region of VDAC2 stabilised the interaction with BAK and inhibited BAK apoptotic activity. Thus, this VDAC2–BAK interaction site can potentially be targeted to either inhibit BAK-mediated apoptosis in scenarios where excessive apoptosis contributes to disease or to promote BAK-mediated apoptosis for cancer therapy.

                Background Antimalarial drug resistance is a major challenge hampering malaria control and elimination. About three-quarters of Eritrea’s population resides in the malaria-endemic western lowlands of the country. Plasmodium falciparum, the leading causative parasite species, has developed resistance to basically all antimalarials. Continued surveillance of drug resistance using genetic markers provides important molecular data for treatment policies which complements clinical studies, and strengthens control efforts. This study sought to genotype point mutations associated with P. falciparum resistance to sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine and artemisinin, in dried-blood spots from three hospitals in the western lowlands of Eritrea. Methods Dried-blood spot samples were collected from patients visiting Adi Quala, Keren and Gash Barka Hospitals, between July and October, 2014. The patients were followed up after treatment with first line artesunate-amodiaquine, and dried-blood spots were collected on day three after treatment. Nested polymerase chain reaction and Sanger sequencing techniques were employed to genotype point mutations in the Pfdhfr (PF3D7_0417200), Pfdhps (PF3D7_0810800) and PfK13 (PF3D7_1343700) partial gene regions. Results Sequence data analyses of PCR-positive isolates found wild-type artemisinin haplotypes associated with resistance (Y493Y, R539R, I543I) in three isolates, whereas four mutant antifolate haplotypes associated with resistance were observed in six isolates. These included the triple-mutant Pfdhfr (S108N, C59R, N51I) haplotype, the double-mutant Pfdhfr (N51I, S108N) haplotype, the single-mutant Pfdhfr (K540E) haplotype, and the mixed-mutant Pfdhfr-Pfdhps (S108N, N51I + K540E) haplotype. Other findings observed were, a rare non-synonymous Pfdhfr V45A mutation in four isolates, and a synonymous Pfdhps R449R in one isolate. Conclusions The mutant antifolate haplotypes observed indicate a likely existence of full SP resistance. Further studies can be carried out to estimate the prevalence of SP resistance. The wild-type artemisinin haplotypes observed suggest artemisinin is still an effective treatment. Continuous monitoring of point mutations associated with delayed parasite clearance in ART clinical studies is recommended.

                The reconstruction of complete microbial metabolic pathways using ‘omics data from environmental samples remains challenging. Computational pipelines for pathway reconstruction that utilize machine learning methods to predict the presence or absence of KEGG modules in incomplete genomes are lacking. Here, we present MetaPathPredict, a software tool that incorporates machine learning models to predict the presence of complete KEGG modules within bacterial genomic datasets. Using gene annotation data and information from the KEGG module database, MetaPathPredict employs deep learning models to predict the presence of KEGG modules in a genome. MetaPathPredict can be used as a command line tool or as a Python module, and both options are designed to be run locally or on a compute cluster. Benchmarks show that MetaPathPredict makes robust predictions of KEGG module presence within highly incomplete genomes.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/90996">The substrate-binding domains of the osmoregulatory ABC importer OpuA transiently interact</a></h4>

              
                Bacteria utilize various strategies to prevent internal dehydration during hypertonic stress. A common approach to countering the effects of the stress is to import compatible solutes such as glycine betaine, leading to simultaneous passive water fluxes following the osmotic gradient. OpuA from <i>Lactococcus lactis</i> is a type I ABC-importer that uses two substrate-binding domains (SBDs) to capture extracellular glycine betaine and deliver the substrate to the transmembrane domains for subsequent transport. OpuA senses osmotic stress via changes in the internal ionic strength and is furthermore regulated by the 2nd messenger cyclic-di-AMP. We now show, by means of solution-based single-molecule FRET and analysis with multi-parameter photon-by-photon hidden Markov modeling, that the SBDs transiently interact in an ionic strength-dependent manner. The smFRET data are in accordance with the apparent cooperativity in transport and supported by new cryo-EM data of OpuA. We propose that the physical interactions between SBDs and cooperativity in substrate delivery are part of the transport mechanism.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/89424">Septin 7 interacts with Numb to preserve sarcomere structural organization and muscle contractile function</a></h4>

              
                Here, we investigated the mechanisms by which aging-related reductions of the levels of <i>Numb</i> in skeletal muscle fibers contribute to loss of muscle strength and power, two critical features of sarcopenia. Numb is an adaptor protein best known for its critical roles in development, including asymmetric cell division, cell-type specification, and termination of intracellular signaling. <i>Numb</i> expression is reduced in old humans and mice. We previously showed that, in mouse skeletal muscle fibers, Numb is localized to sarcomeres where it is concentrated near triads; conditional inactivation of <i>Numb</i> and a closely related protein <i>Numb</i>-like (<i>Numbl</i>) in mouse myofibers caused weakness, disorganization of sarcomeres, and smaller mitochondria with impaired function. Here, we found that a single knockout of <i>Numb</i> in myofibers causes reduction in tetanic force comparable to a double <i>Numb</i>, <i>Numbl</i> knockout. We found by proteomics analysis of protein complexes isolated from C2C12 myotubes by immunoprecipitation using antibodies against Numb that Septin 7 is a potential Numb-binding partner. Septin 7 is a member of the family of GTP-binding proteins that organize into filaments, sheets, and rings, and is considered part of the cytoskeleton. Immunofluorescence evaluation revealed a partial overlap of staining for Numb and Septin 7 in myofibers. Conditional, inducible knockouts of <i>Numb</i> led to disorganization of Septin 7 staining in myofibers. These findings indicate that Septin 7 is a Numb-binding partner and suggest that interactions between Numb and Septin 7 are critical for structural organization of the sarcomere and muscle contractile function.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/90069">Representational drift as a result of implicit regularization</a></h4>

              
                Recent studies show that, even in constant environments, the tuning of single neurons changes over time in a variety of brain regions. This representational drift has been suggested to be a consequence of continuous learning under noise, but its properties are still not fully understood. To investigate the underlying mechanism, we trained an artificial network on a simplified navigational task. The network quickly reached a state of high performance, and many units exhibited spatial tuning. We then continued training the network and noticed that the activity became sparser with time. Initial learning was orders of magnitude faster than ensuing sparsification. This sparsification is consistent with recent results in machine learning, in which networks slowly move within their solution space until they reach a flat area of the loss function. We analyzed four datasets from different labs, all demonstrating that CA1 neurons become sparser and more spatially informative with exposure to the same environment. We conclude that learning is divided into three overlapping phases: (i) Fast familiarity with the environment; (ii) slow implicit regularization; and (iii) a steady state of null drift. The variability in drift dynamics opens the possibility of inferring learning algorithms from observations of drift statistics.

	<p>Background: Theory of Mind (ToM) impairment has repeatedly been found in paranoid schizophrenia. The current study aims at investigating whether this is related to a deficit in ToM (undermentalizing) or an increased ToM ability to hyperattribute others&amp;amp;rsquo; mental states (overmentalizing). Methods: Mental state attribution was examined in 24 patients diagnosed with schizophrenia (12 acute paranoid (APS) and 12 post-acute paranoid (PPS)) with regard to positive symptoms as well as matched healthy persons using a moving shapes paradigm. We used 3-T-functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to provide insights into the neural underpinnings of ToM due to attributional processes in different states of paranoid schizophrenia. Results: In the condition that makes demands on theory of mind skills (ToM condition), in patients with diagnosed schizophrenia less appropriate mental state descriptions have been used, and they attributed mental states less often to the moving shapes than healthy persons. On a neural level, patients suffering from schizophrenia exhibited within the ToM network hypoactivity in the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) and hyperactivity in the temporo-parietal junction (TPJ) as compared to the healthy sample. Conclusions: Our results indicate both undermentalizing and hypoactivity in the MPFC and increased overattribution related to hyperactivity in the TPJ in paranoid schizophrenia, providing new implications for understanding ToM in paranoid schizophrenia.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/18/e2220232024?rss=1">Dissociable Contributions of the Medial Parietal Cortex to Recognition Memory</a></h4>

              
                <p>Human neuroimaging studies of episodic memory retrieval routinely observe the engagement of specific cortical regions beyond the medial temporal lobe. Of these, medial parietal cortex (MPC) is of particular interest given its distinct functional characteristics during different retrieval tasks. Specifically, while recognition and autobiographical recall tasks are both used to probe episodic retrieval, these paradigms consistently drive distinct spatial patterns of response within MPC. However, other studies have emphasized alternate MPC functional dissociations in terms of brain network connectivity profiles or stimulus category selectivity. As the unique contributions of MPC to episodic memory remain unclear, adjudicating between these different accounts can provide better consensus regarding MPC function. Therefore, we used a precision-neuroimaging dataset (7T functional magnetic resonance imaging) to examine how MPC regions are differentially engaged during recognition memory and how these task-related dissociations may also reflect distinct connectivity and stimulus category functional profiles. We observed interleaved, though spatially distinct, subregions of MPC where responses were sensitive to either recognition decisions or the semantic representation of stimuli. In addition, this dissociation was further accentuated by functional subregions displaying distinct profiles of connectivity with the hippocampus during task and rest. Finally, we show that recent observations of dissociable person and place selectivity within the MPC reflect category-specific responses from within identified semantic regions that are sensitive to mnemonic demands. Together, by examining precision functional mapping within individuals, these data suggest that previously distinct observations of functional dissociation within MPC conform to a common principle of organization throughout hippocampal&ndash;neocortical memory systems.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/18/e0389232024?rss=1">Tob Regulates the Timing of Sleep Onset at Night in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                <p>Sleep is regulated by homeostatic sleep drive and the circadian clock. While tremendous progress has been made in elucidating the molecular components of the core circadian oscillator, the output mechanisms by which this robust oscillator generates rhythmic sleep behavior remain poorly understood. At the cellular level, growing evidence suggests that subcircuits in the master circadian pacemaker suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) in mammals and in the clock network in <I>Drosophila</I> regulate distinct aspects of sleep. Thus, to identify novel molecules regulating the circadian timing of sleep, we conducted a large-scale screen of mouse SCN-enriched genes in <I>Drosophila</I>. Here, we show that Tob (Transducer of ERB-B2) regulates the timing of sleep onset at night in female fruit flies. Knockdown of Tob pan-neuronally, either constitutively or conditionally, advances sleep onset at night. We show that Tob is specifically required in "evening neurons" (the LNds and the fifth s-LNv) of the clock network for proper timing of sleep onset. Tob levels cycle in a clock-dependent manner in these neurons. Silencing of these "evening" clock neurons results in an advanced sleep onset at night, similar to that seen with Tob knockdown. Finally, sharp intracellular recordings demonstrate that the amplitude and kinetics of LNd postsynaptic potentials (PSPs) cycle between day and night, and this cycling is attenuated with Tob knockdown in these cells. Our data suggest that Tob acts as a clock output molecule in a subset of clock neurons to potentiate their activity in the evening and enable the proper timing of sleep onset at night.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/18/e0453232024?rss=1">Pre-acquired Functional Connectivity Predicts Choice Inconsistency</a></h4>

              
                <p>Economic choice theories usually assume that humans maximize utility in their choices. However, studies have shown that humans make inconsistent choices, leading to suboptimal behavior, even without context-dependent manipulations. Previous studies showed that activation in value and motor networks are associated with inconsistent choices at the moment of choice. Here, we investigated if the neural predispositions, measured before a choice task, can predict choice inconsistency in a later risky choice task. Using functional connectivity (FC) measures from resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI), derived before any choice was made, we aimed to predict subjects&rsquo; inconsistency levels in a later-performed choice task. We hypothesized that rsfMRI FC measures extracted from value and motor brain areas would predict inconsistency. Forty subjects (21 females) completed a rsfMRI scan before performing a risky choice task. We compared models that were trained on FC that included only hypothesized value and motor regions with models trained on whole-brain FC. We found that both model types significantly predicted inconsistency levels. Moreover, even the whole-brain models relied mostly on FC between value and motor areas. For external validation, we used a neural network pretrained on FC matrices of 37,000 subjects and fine-tuned it on our data and again showed significant predictions. Together, this shows that the tendency for choice inconsistency is predicted by predispositions of the nervous system and that synchrony between the motor and value networks plays a crucial role in this tendency.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/18/e0538232024?rss=1">Fixel-Based Analysis Reveals Tau-Related White Matter Changes in Early Stages of Alzheimer's Disease</a></h4>

              
                <p>Several studies have shown white matter (WM) abnormalities in Alzheimer's disease (AD) using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Nonetheless, robust characterization of WM changes has been challenging due to the methodological limitations of DTI. We applied fixel-based analyses (FBA) to examine microscopic differences in fiber density (FD) and macroscopic changes in fiber cross-section (FC) in early stages of AD (<I>N</I> = 393, 212 females). FBA was also compared with DTI, free-water corrected (FW)-DTI and diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI). We further investigated the correlation of FBA and tensor-derived metrics with AD pathology and cognition. FBA metrics were decreased in the entire cingulum bundle, uncinate fasciculus and anterior thalamic radiations in A&beta;-positive patients with mild cognitive impairment compared to control groups. Metrics derived from DKI, and FW-DTI showed similar alterations whereas WM degeneration detected by DTI was more widespread. Tau-PET uptake in medial temporal regions was only correlated with reduced FC mainly in the parahippocampal cingulum in A&beta;-positive individuals. This tau-related WM alteration was also associated with impaired memory. Despite the spatially extensive between-group differences in DTI-metrics, the link between WM and tau aggregation was only revealed using FBA metrics implying high sensitivity but low specificity of DTI-based measures in identifying subtle tau-related WM degeneration. No relationship was found between amyloid load and any diffusion-MRI measures. Our results indicate that early tau-related WM alterations in AD are due to macrostructural changes specifically captured by FBA metrics. Thus, future studies assessing the effects of AD pathology in WM tracts should consider using FBA metrics.</p>

                <p>Repetitive firing of granule cells (GCs) in the dentate gyrus (DG) facilitates synaptic transmission to the CA3 region. This facilitation can gate and amplify the flow of information through the hippocampus. High-frequency bursts in the DG are linked to behavior and plasticity, but GCs do not readily burst. Under normal conditions, a single shock to the perforant path in a hippocampal slice typically drives a GC to fire a single spike, and only occasionally more than one spike is seen. Repetitive spiking in GCs is not robust, and the mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, we used a hybrid genetically encoded voltage sensor to image voltage changes evoked by cortical inputs in many mature GCs simultaneously in hippocampal slices from male and female mice. This enabled us to study relatively infrequent double and triple spikes. We found GCs are relatively homogeneous and their double spiking behavior is cell autonomous. Blockade of GABA type A receptors increased multiple spikes and prolonged the interspike interval, indicating inhibitory interneurons limit repetitive spiking and set the time window for successive spikes. Inhibiting synaptic glutamate release showed that recurrent excitation mediated by hilar mossy cells contributes to, but is not necessary for, multiple spiking. Blockade of T-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels did not reduce multiple spiking but prolonged interspike intervals. Imaging voltage changes in different GC compartments revealed that second spikes can be initiated in either dendrites or somata. Thus, pharmacological and biophysical experiments reveal roles for both synaptic circuitry and intrinsic excitability in GC repetitive spiking.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/18/e1253232024?rss=1">Frequency of Spontaneous Neurotransmission at Individual Boutons Corresponds to the Size of the Readily Releasable Pool of Vesicles</a></h4>

              
                <p>Synapses maintain two forms of neurotransmitter release to support communication in the brain. First, evoked neurotransmitter release is triggered by the invasion of an action potential (AP) across en passant boutons that form along axons. The probability of evoked release (<I>Pr</I>) varies substantially across boutons, even within a single axon. Such heterogeneity is the result of differences in the probability of a single synaptic vesicle (SV) fusing (Pv) and in the number of vesicles available for immediate release, known as the readily releasable pool (RRP). Spontaneous release (also known as a mini) is an important form of neurotransmission that occurs in the absence of APs. Because it cannot be triggered with electrical stimulation, much less is known about potential heterogeneity in the frequency of spontaneous release between boutons. We utilized a photostable and bright fluorescent indicator of glutamate release (iGluSnFR3) to quantify both spontaneous and evoked release at individual glutamatergic boutons. We found that the rate of spontaneous release is quite heterogenous at the level of individual boutons. Interestingly, when measuring both evoked and spontaneous release at single synapses, we found that boutons with the highest rates of spontaneous release also displayed the largest evoked responses. Using a new optical method to measure RRP at individual boutons, we found that this heterogeneity in spontaneous release was strongly correlated with the size of the RRP, but not related to Pv. We conclude that the RRP is a critical and dynamic aspect of synaptic strength that contributes to both evoked and spontaneous vesicle release.</p>

                <p>Drugs of abuse induce neuroadaptations, including synaptic plasticity, that are critical for transition to addiction, and genes and pathways that regulate these neuroadaptations are potential therapeutic targets. <I>Tropomodulin 2</I> (<I>Tmod2</I>) is an actin-regulating gene that plays an important role in synapse maturation and dendritic arborization and has been implicated in substance abuse and intellectual disability in humans. Here, we mine the KOMP2 data and find that <I>Tmod</I>2 knock-out mice show emotionality phenotypes that are predictive of addiction vulnerability. Detailed addiction phenotyping shows that <I>Tmod2</I> deletion does not affect the acute locomotor response to cocaine administration. However, sensitized locomotor responses are highly attenuated in these knock-outs, indicating perturbed drug-induced plasticity. In addition, <I>Tmod2</I> mutant animals do not self-administer cocaine indicating lack of hedonic responses to cocaine. Whole-brain MR imaging shows differences in brain volume across multiple regions, although transcriptomic experiments did not reveal perturbations in gene coexpression networks. Detailed electrophysiological characterization of <I>Tmod2</I> KO neurons showed increased spontaneous firing rate of early postnatal and adult cortical and striatal neurons. Cocaine-induced synaptic plasticity that is critical for sensitization is either missing or reciprocal in <I>Tmod2</I> KO nucleus accumbens shell medium spiny neurons, providing a mechanistic explanation of the cocaine response phenotypes. Combined, these data, collected from both males and females, provide compelling evidence that <I>Tmod2</I> is a major regulator of plasticity in the mesolimbic system and regulates the reinforcing and addictive properties of cocaine.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/18/e1461232024?rss=1">Differential Expression Analysis Identifies Candidate Synaptogenic Molecules for Wiring Direction-Selective Circuits in the Retina</a></h4>

              
                <p>An organizational feature of neural circuits is the specificity of synaptic connections. A striking example is the direction-selective (DS) circuit of the retina. There are multiple subtypes of DS retinal ganglion cells (DSGCs) that prefer motion along one of four preferred directions. This computation is mediated by selective wiring of a single inhibitory interneuron, the starburst amacrine cell (SAC), with each DSGC subtype preferentially receiving input from a subset of SAC processes. We hypothesize that the molecular basis of this wiring is mediated in part by unique expression profiles of DSGC subtypes. To test this, we first performed paired recordings from isolated mouse retinas of both sexes to determine that postnatal day 10 (P10) represents the age at which asymmetric synapses form. Second, we performed RNA sequencing and differential expression analysis on isolated P10 ON&ndash;OFF DSGCs tuned for either nasal or ventral motion and identified candidates which may promote direction-specific wiring. We then used a conditional knock-out strategy to test the role of one candidate, the secreted synaptic organizer cerebellin-4 (Cbln4), in the development of DS tuning. Using two-photon calcium imaging, we observed a small deficit in directional tuning among ventral-preferring DSGCs lacking Cbln4, though whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings did not identify a significant change in inhibitory inputs. This suggests that Cbln4 does not function primarily via a cell-autonomous mechanism to instruct wiring of DS circuits. Nevertheless, our transcriptomic analysis identified unique candidate factors for gaining insights into the molecular mechanisms that instruct wiring specificity in the DS circuit.</p>

                <p>The ventral pallidum (VP) is a central hub in the reward circuitry with diverse projections that have different behavioral roles attributed mostly to the connectivity with the downstream target. However, different VP projections may represent, as in the striatum, separate neuronal populations that differ in more than just connectivity. In this study, we performed in mice of both sexes a multimodal dissection of four major projections of the VP&mdash;to the lateral hypothalamus (VP<SUB>-&gt;LH</SUB>), ventral tegmental area (VP<SUB>-&gt;VTA</SUB>), lateral habenula (VP<SUB>-&gt;LHb</SUB>), and mediodorsal thalamus (VP<SUB>-&gt;MDT</SUB>)&mdash;with physiological, anatomical, genetic, and behavioral tools. We also tested for physiological differences between VP neurons receiving input from nucleus accumbens medium spiny neurons (MSNs) that express either the D1 (D1-MSNs) or the D2 (D2-MSNs) dopamine receptor. We show that each VP projection (1) when inhibited during a cocaine conditioned place preference (CPP) test affects performance differently, (2) receives a different pattern of inputs using rabies retrograde labeling, (3) shows differentially expressed genes using RNA sequencing, and (4) has projection-specific characteristics in excitability and synaptic input characteristics using whole-cell patch clamp. VP<SUB>-&gt;LH</SUB> and VP<SUB>-&gt;VTA</SUB> projections have different effects on CPP and show low overlap in circuit tracing experiments, as VP<SUB>-&gt;VTA</SUB> neurons receive more striatal input, while VP<SUB>-&gt;LH</SUB> neurons receive more olfactory input. Additionally, VP<SUB>-&gt;VTA</SUB> neurons are less excitable, while VP<SUB>-&gt;LH</SUB> neurons are more excitable than the average VP neuron, a difference driven mainly by D2-MSN-responding neurons. Thus, VP<SUB>-&gt;VTA</SUB> and VP<SUB>-&gt;LH</SUB> neurons may represent largely distinct populations of VP neurons.</p>

                <p>Locomotion allows us to move and interact with our surroundings. Spinal networks that control locomotion produce rhythm and left&ndash;right and flexor&ndash;extensor coordination. Several glutamatergic populations, Shox2 non-V2a, Hb9-derived interneurons, and, recently, spinocerebellar neurons have been proposed to be involved in the mouse rhythm generating networks. These cells make up only a smaller fraction of the excitatory cells in the ventral spinal cord. Here, we set out to identify additional populations of excitatory spinal neurons that may be involved in rhythm generation or other functions in the locomotor network. We use RNA sequencing from glutamatergic, non-glutamatergic, and Shox2 cells in the neonatal mice from both sexes followed by differential gene expression analyses. These analyses identified transcription factors that are highly expressed by glutamatergic spinal neurons and differentially expressed between Shox2 neurons and glutamatergic neurons. From this latter category, we identified the Lhx9-derived neurons as having a restricted spinal expression pattern with no Shox2 neuron overlap. They are purely glutamatergic and ipsilaterally projecting. Ablation of the glutamatergic transmission or acute inactivation of the neuronal activity of Lhx9-derived neurons leads to a decrease in the frequency of locomotor-like activity without change in coordination pattern. Optogenetic activation of Lhx9-derived neurons promotes locomotor-like activity and modulates the frequency of the locomotor activity. Calcium activities of Lhx9-derived neurons show strong left&ndash;right out-of-phase rhythmicity during locomotor-like activity. Our study identifies a distinct population of spinal excitatory neurons that regulates the frequency of locomotor output with a suggested role in rhythm-generation in the mouse alongside other spinal populations.</p>

                <p>A long-standing question in vision science is how the three cone photoreceptor types&mdash;long (L), medium (M), and short (S) wavelength sensitive&mdash;combine to generate our perception of color. Hue perception can be described along two opponent axes: red&ndash;green and blue&ndash;yellow. Psychophysical measurements of color appearance indicate that the cone inputs to the red&ndash;green and blue&ndash;yellow opponent axes are M vs. L + S and L vs. M + S, respectively. However, the "cardinal directions of color space" revealed by psychophysical measurements of color detection thresholds following adaptation are L vs. M and S vs. L + M. These cardinal directions match the most common cone-opponent retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) in the primate retina. Accordingly, the cone opponency necessary for color appearance is thought to be established in the cortex. While neurons with the appropriate M vs. L + S and L vs. M + S opponency have been reported in the retina and lateral geniculate nucleus, their existence continues to be debated. Resolving this long-standing debate is necessary because a complete account of the cone opponency in the retinal output is critical for understanding how downstream neural circuits process color. Here, we performed adaptive optics calcium imaging to noninvasively measure foveal RGC light responses in the living <I>Macaca fascicularis</I> eye. We confirm the presence of L vs. M + S and M vs. L + S neurons with noncardinal cone opponency and demonstrate that cone-opponent signals in the retinal output are more diverse than classically thought.</p>

                <p>Episodic memory retrieval is associated with the holistic neocortical reinstatement of all event information, an effect driven by hippocampal pattern completion. However, whether holistic reinstatement occurs, and whether hippocampal pattern completion continues to drive reinstatement, after a period of consolidation is unclear. Theories of systems consolidation predict either a time-variant or time-invariant role of the hippocampus in the holistic retrieval of episodic events. Here, we assessed whether episodic events continue to be reinstated holistically and whether hippocampal pattern completion continues to facilitate holistic reinstatement following a period of consolidation. Female and male human participants learned "events" that comprised multiple overlapping pairs of event elements (e.g., person&ndash;location, object&ndash;location, location&ndash;person). Importantly, encoding occurred either immediately before or 24&nbsp;h before retrieval. Using fMRI during the retrieval of events, we show evidence for holistic reinstatement, as well as a correlation between reinstatement and hippocampal pattern completion, regardless of whether retrieval occurred immediately or 24&nbsp;h after encoding. Thus, hippocampal pattern completion continues to contribute to holistic reinstatement after a delay. However, our results also revealed that some holistic reinstatement can occur without evidence for a corresponding signature of hippocampal pattern completion after a delay (but not immediately after encoding). We therefore show that hippocampal pattern completion, in addition to a nonhippocampal process, has a role in holistic reinstatement following a period of consolidation. Our results point to a consolidation process where the hippocampus and neocortex may work in an additive, rather than compensatory, manner to support episodic memory retrieval.</p>

                <p>Associative learning involves complex interactions of multiple cognitive factors. While adult subjects can articulate these factors verbally, for model animals such as macaques, we rely on behavioral outputs. In our study, we used pupillary responses as an alternative measure to capture these underlying cognitive changes. We recorded the dynamic changes in the pupils of three male macaques when they learned the associations between visual stimuli and reward sizes under the classical Pavlovian experimental paradigm. We found that during the long-term learning process, the gradual changes in the pupillary response reflect the changes in the cognitive state of the animals. The pupillary response can be explained by a linear combination of components corresponding to multiple cognitive factors. These components reflect the impact of visual stimuli on the pupils, the prediction of reward values associated with the visual stimuli, and the macaques' understanding of the current experimental reward rules. The changing patterns of these factors during interday and intraday learning clearly demonstrate the enhancement of current reward-stimulus association and the weakening of previous reward-stimulus association. Our study shows that the dynamic response of pupils can serve as an objective indicator to characterize the psychological changes of animals, understand their learning process, and provide important tools for exploring animal behavior during the learning process.</p>

                <p>Accurately decoding external variables from observations of neural activity is a major challenge in systems neuroscience. Bayesian decoders, which provide probabilistic estimates, are some of the most widely used. Here we show how, in many common settings, the probabilistic predictions made by traditional Bayesian decoders are overconfident. That is, the estimates for the decoded stimulus or movement variables are more certain than they should be. We then show how Bayesian decoding with latent variables, taking account of low-dimensional shared variability in the observations, can improve calibration, although additional correction for overconfidence is still needed. Using data from males, we examine (1) decoding the direction of grating stimuli from spike recordings in the primary visual cortex in monkeys, (2) decoding movement direction from recordings in the primary motor cortex in monkeys, (3) decoding natural images from multiregion recordings in mice, and (4) decoding position from hippocampal recordings in rats. For each setting, we characterize the overconfidence, and we describe a possible method to correct miscalibration post hoc. Properly calibrated Bayesian decoders may alter theoretical results on probabilistic population coding and lead to brain&ndash;machine interfaces that more accurately reflect confidence levels when identifying external variables.</p>

                <p>Hearing loss is a major disability in everyday life and therapeutic interventions to protect hearing would benefit a large portion of the world population. Here we found that mice devoid of the protein kinase suppressor of RAS 1 (KSR1) in their tissues (germline KO mice) exhibit resistance to both cisplatin- and noise-induced permanent hearing loss compared with their wild-type KSR1 littermates. KSR1 is a scaffold protein that brings in proximity the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) proteins BRAF, MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 and assists in their activation through a phosphorylation cascade induced by both cisplatin and noise insults in the cochlear cells. KSR1, BRAF, MEK1/2, and ERK1/2 are all ubiquitously expressed in the cochlea. Deleting the KSR1 protein tempered down the MAPK phosphorylation cascade in the cochlear cells following both cisplatin and noise insults and conferred hearing protection of up to 30&nbsp;dB SPL in three tested frequencies in male and female mice. Treatment with dabrafenib, an FDA-approved oral BRAF inhibitor, protected male and female KSR1 wild-type mice from both cisplatin- and noise-induced hearing loss. Dabrafenib treatment did not enhance the protection of KO KSR1 mice, providing evidence dabrafenib works primarily through the MAPK pathway. Thus, either elimination of the KSR1 gene expression or drug inhibition of the MAPK cellular pathway in mice resulted in profound protection from both cisplatin- and noise-induced hearing loss. Inhibition of the MAPK pathway, a cellular pathway that responds to damage in the cochlear cells, can prove a valuable strategy to protect and treat hearing loss.</p>

                Background Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) and insulin resistance have individually been associated with increased cardiovascular risk, and their potential interplay in the context of Acute Ischemic Stroke remains a subject of investigation. This study aims to elucidate the association between NAFLD, insulin resistance, and Acute Ischemic Stroke, exploring risk factors, etiology, and potential implications for patient management. Methods This prospective observational cross-sectional study will be conducted at Acharya Vinoba Bhave Rural Hospital, enrolling patients aged 40-79 diagnosed with acute ischemic stroke between 2022 and 2025. Diagnostic confirmation will involve brain imaging, and abdominal ultrasonography will assess NAFLD severity. Biochemical parameters will be measured for insulin resistance evaluation, including blood glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), and fasting insulin levels. The Homeostatic Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) will be calculated. Statistical analyses, including descriptive statistics and bivariate and multivariate analyses, will be applied to explore associations and potential risk factors. Expected Outcome Anticipated findings include insights into the prevalence and severity of NAFLD in Acute Ischemic Stroke patients, the association between insulin resistance and stroke incidence, and potential risk factors contributing to this association. The study provides a foundation for understanding the complex relationship between NAFLD, insulin resistance, and Acute Ischemic Stroke, offering valuable implications for risk stratification and patient management in clinical practice. Identifying modifiable risk factors may guide targeted interventions, contributing to improved outcomes in this patient population.

                An array of congenital cardiac disorders known as partial anomalous pulmonary venous connections (PAPVC) occur when pulmonary veins, abnormally drain into the right atrium. This can happen directly into the right atrium or via draining into systemic veins. A 10 year old female patient had chief complaints of difficulty in breathing and frequent fever hence she visited rural hospital where 2D echo was done which reviled PAPVC associated with 16 mm ASD (Atrial Septal Defect). She underwent ASD closure along with pulmonary valvotomy as a part of surgical management after which a well-planned cardiac rehabilitation has been ingrained through several breathing methods such as breathing exercises, respiratory muscle strength and home exercise program, helping the patient to carry out her activities of daily living. The Visual Analog Scale (VAS), Respiratory Muscle Strength using MicroRPM device, 6 Minute Walk Distance (MWD), Borg Scale and Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS). In this present instance, carefully thought-out physical therapy rehabilitation has been shown to be successful in enhancing functional capacity, respiratory muscle strength, optimizing functional capacity, and lowering fatigue.

                Background Dietary supplements (DS) use among Lebanese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) increased widely due to the country’s economic and financial situation. This study was conducted (1) to estimate the prevalence of DS use among persons with T2DM amid the escalating economic crisis in Lebanon; (2) to explore the knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) of DS use; and (3) to determine any significant association between socio-economic and socio-demographic factors and the use of DS modality Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted during the worst episode of the economic crisis between October and April 2022 on 460 adult patients with T2DM of both sexes. Patients were interviewed using a pre-tested questionnaire. Results Almost 4 out of 10 patients with T2DM in our study were found to be using DS, where 27.6% take multivitamins frequently. One-third of the participants agreed that nutritional supplements are necessary to control diabetes symptoms and complications. Around 41.1% of the participants complained about hypoglycemia and used DS to control their blood sugar levels (56.4%), while the rest used it to improve their health (35.5%) and control their diet (2.2%). The predictors of DS usage were the patient’s level of education [OR=3.9, CI=1.5-10, p=0.003), self-monitoring of blood sugars (OR=4.9, CI=1.68-14.6; p=0.004) and reading the nutrition label [OR=59.3, CI=6.3-55.8, p=0.000]. Conclusion This study estimated the prevalence of DS use and abuse, among persons with diabetes type II and found three significant predictors of DS use among patients with T2DM. Public health experts should encourage healthy discussions and awareness with their patients to comprehend their views regarding DS use.

                <p>by Keiji Ota, Laurence T. Maloney</p>

Bayesian decision theory (BDT) is frequently used to model normative performance in perceptual, motor, and cognitive decision tasks where the possible outcomes of actions are associated with rewards or penalties. The resulting normative models specify how decision makers should encode and combine information about uncertainty and value–step by step–in order to maximize their expected reward. When prior, likelihood, and posterior are probabilities, the Bayesian computation requires only simple arithmetic operations: addition, etc. We focus on visual cognitive tasks where Bayesian computations are carried out not on probabilities but on (1) <i>probability density functions</i> and (2) these probability density functions are derived from <i>samples</i>. We break the BDT model into a series of computations and test human ability to carry out each of these computations in isolation. We test three necessary properties of normative use of pdf information derived from a sample–<i>accuracy</i>, <i>additivity</i> and <i>influence</i>. Influence measures allow us to assess how much weight <i>each point</i> in the sample is assigned in making decisions and allow us to compare normative use (weighting) of samples to actual, point by point. We find that human decision makers violate accuracy and additivity systematically but that the cost of failure in accuracy or additivity would be minor in common decision tasks. However, a comparison of measured influence for each sample point with normative influence measures demonstrates that the individual’s use of sample information is markedly different from the predictions of BDT. We will show that the normative BDT model takes into account the geometric symmetries of the pdf while the human decision maker does not. An alternative model basing decisions on a single extreme sample point provided a better account for participants’ data than the normative BDT model.

                <p>by Xiao Gan, Palanivelu Sengottaiyan, Kyu Hyong Park, Sarah M. Assmann, Réka Albert</p>

Stomata are pores on plant aerial surfaces, each bordered by a pair of guard cells. They control gas exchange vital for plant survival. Understanding how guard cells respond to environmental signals such as atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) levels is not only insightful to fundamental biology but also relevant to real-world issues of crop productivity under global climate change. In the past decade, multiple important signaling elements for stomatal closure induced by elevated CO<sub>2</sub> have been identified. Yet, there is no comprehensive understanding of high CO<sub>2</sub>-induced stomatal closure. In this work, we assemble a cellular signaling network underlying high CO<sub>2</sub>-induced stomatal closure by integrating evidence from a comprehensive literature analysis. We further construct a Boolean dynamic model of the network, which allows in silico simulation of the stomatal closure response to high CO<sub>2</sub> in wild-type <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> plants and in cases of pharmacological or genetic manipulation of network nodes. Our model has a 91% accuracy in capturing known experimental observations. We perform network-based logical analysis and reveal a feedback core of the network, which dictates cellular decisions in closure response to high CO<sub>2</sub>. Based on these analyses, we predict and experimentally confirm that applying nitric oxide (NO) induces stomatal closure in ambient CO<sub>2</sub> and causes hypersensitivity to elevated CO<sub>2</sub>. Moreover, we predict a negative regulatory relationship between NO and the protein phosphatase ABI2 and find experimentally that NO inhibits ABI2 phosphatase activity. The experimental validation of these model predictions demonstrates the effectiveness of network-based modeling and highlights the decision-making role of the feedback core of the network in signal transduction. We further explore the model’s potential in predicting targets of signaling elements not yet connected to the CO<sub>2</sub> network. Our combination of network science, in silico model simulation, and experimental assays demonstrates an effective interdisciplinary approach to understanding system-level biology.

                Background Non-publication, incomplete publication and excessively slow publication of clinical trial outcomes contribute to research waste and can harm patients. While research waste in German academic trials is well documented, research waste in Germany related to a specific disease area across non-commercial and commercial sponsors has not previously been assessed. Methods In this cohort study, we used public records from three clinical trial registries to identify 70 completed or terminated clinical trials involving women with metastatic breast cancer with trial sites in Germany. We then searched registries and the literature for trial outcomes and contacted sponsors about unreported studies. Results We found that 66/70 trials (94.3%) had made their results public. Only 13/70 (18.6%) trials had reported results within one year of completion as recommended by the World Health Organisation (WHO). The outcomes of 4/70 trials (5.7%) had not been made public at all, but only one of those trials had recruited a significant number of patients. Conclusions Discussions about research waste in clinical trials commonly focus on weakly designed or unreported trials. We believe that late reporting of results is another important form of research waste. In addition, a discussion regarding the appropriate ethical and legal rules for reporting the results of terminated trials might add value. German legislation now requires sponsors to upload the results of some clinical trials onto a trial registry within one year of trial completion, but these laws only cover around half of all trials. Our findings highlight the potential benefits of extending the scope of national legislation to cover all interventional clinical trials involving German patients.
