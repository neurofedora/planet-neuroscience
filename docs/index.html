              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27247?af=R">Effectiveness of Autologous Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation versus Alemtuzumab and Ocrelizumab in Relapsing Multiple Sclerosis: A Single Center Cohort Study</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To compare clinical and radiological outcomes among relapsing multiple sclerosis patients treated with autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (AHSCT), alemtuzumab (ATZ), and ocrelizumab (OCR).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>From a London (UK) hospital-based observational cohort, modeled data were obtained from 621 relapsing–remitting multiple sclerosis patients, who were treated with AHSCT (n = 103), ATZ (n = 204), and OCR (n = 314), and were followed up for 43, 43, and 32 median months, respectively. The annualized relapse rate, new magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) lesions, and disability progression on Expanded Disability Status Scale were assessed.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>AHSCT showed superior efficacy compared with ATZ and OCR. After 5-year follow up, the mean annualized relapse rate (0.026 vs 0.087; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), the risk of relapses (HR 0.29, 95% CI 0.13–0.63; <i>p</i> = 0.002), and of MRI activity (HR 0.33, 95% CI 0.15–0.72; <i>p</i> = 0.006) were significantly lower in AHSCT versus ATZ group. Compared with OCR, after 3-year follow-up AHSCT showed a significantly lower annualized relapse rate (0.028 vs 0.073; <i>p</i> = 0.02) and a trend to reduced risk of relapse (HR 0.45, 95% CI 0.18–1.14; <i>p</i> = 0.09), but similar low rates (6%) of new MRI activity (HR 0.86, 95% CI 0.28–2.67; <i>p</i> = 0.80). In addition, there was a similar risk of Expanded Disability Status Scale progression in AHSCT, and both ATZ (HR 1.19, 95% CI 0.71–2.00; <i>p</i> = 0.50) and OCR (HR 1.08, 95% CI 0.57–2.04; <i>p</i> = 0.82) groups.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>AHSCT was followed by greater prevention of relapses compared with ATZ and OCR, and suppressed more profoundly MRI activity than ATZ, but similarly to OCR, albeit with shorter follow up. The risk of accumulating disability was similar among the treated groups. Studies with larger sample sizes and longer follow up may enable confirmation of these findings or detection of any additional differential effects. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                Bresesti et al. show that the overexpression of miR-342-3p promotes a pro-inflammatory phenotype in macrophages, partially linked to the downregulation of Slc7a11, a cysteine-glutamate antiporter targeted by miR-342-3p. Systemic delivery of lentiviral vectors enforcing miR-342-3p expression to tumor-bearing mice induces a pro-inflammatory phenotype in liver macrophages, reducing liver metastasis growth.

                Metabolic reprogramming and telomere maintenance are hallmarks of cancer. Udutha et al. demonstrate that TERT, which drives telomere maintenance, also upregulates glutathione synthesis in glioblastoma. Targeting glutathione synthesis, however, rewires metabolism to augment nucleotide biosynthesis. Importantly, combined inhibition of glutathione and nucleotide synthesis is synthetically lethal in preclinical glioblastoma models.

                Wang et al. report a diagnostic marker KIF26B for bladder cancer. Mechanistically, KIF26B activates Wnt/β-catenin pathway through maintaining TRAF2 protein stability via OTUB2 and enabling its translocation into nucleus via IPO11. Then, TRAF2 facilitates TCF4/β-catenin complex formation and induces pd-l1 transcription.

                Ku et al. reveal the amplification of antiviral signaling by SLIRP. The innate immune activation results in increased expression and mitochondrial localization of SLIRP. It then stabilizes mt-dsRNAs, which serve as non-self signatures to activate antiviral signaling further. Such regulation is involved in autoimmune disease and defense against viral infection.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247(25)00369-9?rss=yes">Error signals in the parvocellular division of the red nucleus, not the magnocellular division, drive adaptation in reaching</a></h4>

              
                Adaptation in reaching is a fundamental topic in motor neuroscience, yet the origins of error signals driving this process remain unclear. In this study, Inoue and Kitazawa demonstrate that error signals encoded by the parvocellular division of the red nucleus are crucial for driving reaching adaptation.

">Contralateral Prefrontal and Network Engagement during Left DLPFC 10 Hz rTMS: An Interleaved TMS-fMRI Study in Healthy Adults</a></h4>

              
                Background: High-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) serves as an effective treatment for major depression and other psychiatric disorders. Despite its growing clinical application, the neural mechanisms by which prefrontal rTMS exerts its therapeutic effects remain incompletely understood. To address this gap, we investigated the immediate blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) activity during 600 stimuli of left DLPFC 10 Hz rTMS in healthy individuals using interleaved TMS-fMRI. Methods: In a crossover design, 17 healthy subjects received 10 Hz rTMS (60 trains with 9-second intertrain intervals) over the left DLPFC at 40% and 80% of their resting motor threshold (rMT) inside the MR scanner. Results: 10 Hz rTMS over the left DLPFC elicited BOLD responses in prefrontal regions, cingulate cortex, insula, striatum, thalamus, as well as auditory and somatosensory areas. Notably, our findings revealed that 10 Hz rTMS effects were lateralized towards the contralateral (right) DLPFC. Dose-response effects (40% vs. 80% rTMS) were exclusively observed in contralateral subcortical regions, whereas dose-responses within the DLPFC showed substantial inter-individual variability. Conclusions: The 10 Hz rTMS protocol used in this study induced distinct target engagement and propagation patterns in the prefrontal cortex. These patterns differ from our previous interleaved TMS-fMRI findings using 600 stimuli of left DLPFC intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) at the same intensities. Thus, interleaved TMS-fMRI emerges as a valuable method for comparing clinical prefrontal rTMS protocols regarding their immediate effect on brain circuits in order to differentiate their action mechanisms and to potentially inform clinical applications.

">Rapid Eye Movement Sleep Displays Distinct Fractal Dynamics Between Phasic and Tonic States</a></h4>

              
                Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep consists of phasic and tonic microstates with unique neurophysiological properties, yet their fractal characteristics remain underexplored. Using Higuchi's fractal dimension (HFD) analysis of electroencephalographic (EEG) data from healthy adults, this study investigated complexity differences between REM microstates. The results showed that both phasic and tonic REM exhibited significantly lower global HFD values compared to wakefulness, while displaying similar overall complexity levels between microstates. Importantly, phasic REM demonstrated regionally specific reductions in fractal dimensionality, with pronounced decreases observed in frontocentral areas. These localized reductions exhibited a negative association with theta band power, yet remained statistically unrelated to Lempel-Ziv complexity (LZC) measures, indicating that HFD and LZC capture distinct aspects of neural signal organization. The findings reveal that although phasic and tonic REM maintain comparable global complexity, they differ in their spatiotemporal fractal patterns. The association between increased theta power and reduced fractal dimensionality suggests that phasic REM represents a neurophysiological state favoring rhythmic regularity, potentially optimized for internal information processing. These results position HFD as a valuable complementary approach for characterizing REM microstates, with potential applications in understanding sleep disorder pathophysiology.

">Predictive distractor processing relies on integrated proactive and reactive attentional mechanisms</a></h4>

              
                Visual attention is shaped by statistical regularities in the environment, with spatially predictable distractors being proactively suppressed. The neural mechanisms underpinning this suppression remain poorly understood. In this study, we employed magnetoencephalography (MEG) and multivariate decoding analysis to investigate how predicted distractor locations are proactively processed in the human brain. Male and female human participants engaged in a statistical learning visual search task that required them to identify a target stimulus while ignoring a colour-singleton distractor. Critically, the distractor appeared more frequently on one side of the visual field, creating an implicit spatial prediction. Our results revealed that distractor locations were encoded in temporo-occipital brain regions prior to the presentation of the search array, supporting the hypothesis that proactive suppression guides visual attention away from predictable distractors. The neural activity patterns corresponding to this pre-search distractor processing extended to post-search activity during late attentional stages (~200 ms), suggesting an integrated suppressive mechanism. Notably, this generalization from pre- to post-search phases was absent in the early sensory processing stages (~100 ms), suggesting that post-search distractor processing is not merely a continuation of sustained proactive processing, but involves re-engagement of the same mechanism at distinct stages. These findings establish a mechanistic link between proactive and reactive processing of predictable distractors, demonstrating both shared and unique contributions to attentional selection.

">Spatially convergent fMRI signatures of diabetes and male sex identify genetic vulnerabilities to accelerated brain aging</a></h4>

              
                Age-related cognitive decline results from complex interactions between neuroendocrine and neurometabolic processes that undergo lifelong degradation, yet the mechanisms underlying these interactions remain poorly understood. This study examined the effects of diabetes and sex on functional brain networks across aging through analysis of two large cohorts (N=1,621 total) using both 3T and 7T functional MRI, complemented by spatial transcriptomic data from over 14,000 genes from six post-mortem brains. Four networks - cingulo-opercular, default mode, salience, and lateral somatomotor - exhibited significant functional decline in both individuals with diabetes and independently in males. Gene expression analysis of vulnerable networks revealed significant overexpression of insulin-dependent glucose transporters, dopaminergic and GABAergic synaptic genes, and VEGFA-VEGFR2 pathway components. These findings suggest functionally-specific circuit vulnerability to metabolic and hormonal dysregulation, potentially offering targets for early intervention before irreversible neurodegeneration occurs.

">The cerebellar components of the human language network</a></h4>

              
                The cerebellum's capacity for neural computation is arguably unmatched. Yet despite evidence of cerebellar contributions to cognition, including language, its precise role remains debated. Here, we systematically evaluate cerebellar language-responsive regions using precision fMRI. We identify four cerebellar regions that respond to language across modalities (Experiments 1a-b, n=754). One region--spanning Crus I/II/lobule VIIb--is selective for language relative to diverse non-linguistic tasks (Experiments 2a-f, n=732), and the rest exhibit mixed-selective profiles. Like the neocortical language system, the language-selective region is engaged by sentence-level meanings during comprehension and production (Experiments 3a-c, n=105), but it is less sensitive than the neocortex to individual word meanings and grammatical structure. Finally, all four regions, but especially Crus I/II/VIIb, are functionally connected to the neocortical language system (Experiment 4, n=85). We propose that these cerebellar regions constitute components of the extended language network, with one region supporting semantic processing, and the other three plausibly integrating information from diverse neocortical regions.

">Hypertension-Induced Neurovascular and Cognitive Dysfunction at Single-Cell Resolution</a></h4>

              
                Arterial hypertension is a leading cause of cognitive impairment, attributed to hemodynamic insufficiency, blood-brain barrier disruption, and white matter damage. However, the molecular mechanisms by which hypertension affects brain cells remain unclear. Using scRNA-seq in a mouse model of hypertension induced by angiotensin II, we mapped neocortical transcriptomic changes before (3 days) and after (42 days) onset of neurovascular and cognitive deficits. Surprisingly, evidence of endothelial transport disruption and senescence, stalled oligodendrocyte differentiation, interneuronal hypofunction and network imbalance emerged after just 3 days. By 42 days, when cognitive impairment becomes apparent, deficits in myelination and axonal conduction, as well as neuronal mitochondrial dysfunction developed. These findings reveal a previously unrecognized early vulnerability of endothelial cells, interneurons, and oligodendrocytes, and provide the molecular bases for the subsequent neurovascular dysfunction and cognitive impairment in hypertension. In addition, the data constitute a valuable resource for future mechanistic studies and therapeutic target validation.

">Rapid learning and integration of artificial sensation</a></h4>

              
                Prosthetic limbs lack proprioceptive feedback, which is essential for complex movements. Intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) elicits sensory perceptions that could serve as an artificial proprioceptive signal. However, movements guided by ICMS are slower and less accurate than those with natural sensation. Here, we developed a freely-moving mouse behavioral task to improve ICMS encoding of artificial sensation. Mice implanted with 16-channel microwire arrays in primary somatosensory cortex were trained to navigate to targets upon the floor of a custom behavioral training cage. Target location was encoded with visual and/or ICMS feedback. Mice quickly learned to use the ICMS signal to locate invisible targets, achieving 75% proficiency on ICMS-only trials by the first three sessions of testing. Furthermore, performance on multimodal trials significantly exceeded unimodal performance, demonstrating that animals integrated natural vision with artificial sensation. This protocol can be applied to efficiently develop and test algorithms to encode artificial proprioception for neural prostheses.

                Damage to the peripheral nerve impairs quality of life. Despite the advances in surgery to facilitate nerve regeneration, complete recovery remains elusive. Human olfactory ecto-mesenchymal stem cells (OEMSC) have potential for the treatment of peripheral nerve injury through the release of extracellular vesicles (EV). The current research investigates the therapeutic effects of a venous bridge, filled with freshly purified or cryoconserved OEMSC-derived EVs after a peroneal nerve loss of substance. Injured peroneal nerve was bridged with a vein into which freshly purified or cryoconserved EVs were injected or not. Nerve repair was analyzed by measuring locomotor function, muscle mechanical properties, muscle mass, axon number, and myelination. The EVs significantly increased locomotor recovery, maintained the contractile phenotype of the target muscle, and augmented the number of growing axons. These results demonstrate that EVs display a positive effect on peripheral nerve regeneration, representing an alternative to cellular therapies for peripheral nerve repair.

">Online HD-tRNS over the right temporoparietal junction modulates social inference but not motor coordination</a></h4>

              
                Social interactions are fundamental to human cognition, with the right temporoparietal junction (rTPJ) playing a key role in integrating motor coordination and social inference. Transcranial random noise stimulation (tRNS) is a promising technique for modulating cortical excitability, yet its effect on dynamic social processes remains unexplored. This study aimed to establish a causal link between rTPJ and real-time social interaction by applying high-definition transcranial random noise stimulation (HD-tRNS) during the Human Dynamic Clamp (HDC) paradigm. Specifically, we investigated whether online HD-tRNS modulates motor coordination and social inference when interacting with an adaptive virtual partner (VP). Eighty right-handed participants were assigned to one of two experiments: (Exp1) a block design with active HD-tRNS and sham blocks or (Exp2) a trial-by-trial design with intermixed active and sham conditions. Participants engaged in an interactive coordination task with a covert VP that could behave cooperatively or competitively. Kinematic data and self-reported measures of perceived cooperativeness and humanness were analyzed. HD-tRNS over the rTPJ did not influence motor coordination or task performance. However, in Exp1, participants receiving active stimulation progressively attributed lower cooperativeness and humanness to the competitive VP, suggesting improved detection of competitive intent. This effect was absent in Exp2, indicating that repeated stimulation was necessary for cumulative neuromodulatory effects. Online HD-tRNS over the rTPJ does not acutely impact motor coordination but progressively modulates social inference, particularly in competitive interactions. The findings highlight the rTPJ's role in self-other distinction and suggest that repeated short neuromodulation sessions can shape social perception.

">Embodied Singing: Dual Role of Interoception in Vocal Expertise and Musical Competence</a></h4>

              
                Musical expertise is often associated with heightened perceptual sensitivity to external sensory stimuli, yet its relationship with internal bodily awareness (interoception) remains elusive. This study examined whether interoceptive ability relates differentially to varying levels of singing expertise and explored if interoception could predispose individuals to musical skills. Professional singers, amateur singers, and non-singers completed a heartbeat discrimination task (interoceptive accuracy; IAcc), self-reported interoceptive sensibility assessment, and comprehensive musical competence measures. Results demonstrated a significant positive association between singing expertise and IAcc, which notably emerged only in professional singers, who significantly outperformed both amateur singers and non-singers. Regression analyses indicated a moderate predictive role of accumulated singing practice for IAcc among trained singers, though emotional awareness partially mediated the relationship between expertise and IAcc. Critically, higher IAcc in non-singers significantly correlated with superior singing accuracy, suggesting enhanced interoception may facilitate singing competence independently of formal vocal training. Altogether, these findings highlight a dual role of interoception, linking it to expert-level singing--partially mediated by emotional awareness--and independently to musical competence in non-singers. These results reconcile prior inconsistencies by highlighting the embodied nature of singing and the distinct role of musical expertise, while underscoring inherent musically relevant mechanisms beyond practice alone.

">Hippocampal Representational Drift Persists in a Stable Multisensory Virtual Environment</a></h4>

              
                Experiments tracking hippocampal place cells in mice navigating the same real environment have found significant changes in neural representations over days. However, there is currently a debate over whether such representational drift serves an intrinsic function, such as distinguishing similar experiences occurring at different times, or is instead observed due to subtle differences in the sensory environment or behavior. Here, we used the experimental control offered by a multisensory virtual reality (VR) system to determine that differences in sensory environment or behavior do not detectably change drift rate. We also found that the excitability of individual place cells was most predictive of their representational drift over subsequent days, with more excitable cells exhibiting less drift. These findings establish that representational drift occurs in mice even with highly reproducible environments and behavior and highlight neuronal excitability as a key factor of long-term representational stability.

">Mechanical environment afforded by engineered polymer hydrogel critically regulates survival of neural stem cells transplanted in the injured spinal cord via Piezo1-mediated mechanotransduction</a></h4>

              
                Neural stem cell (NSC) transplantation is a promising therapeutic approach for spinal cord repair, but poor graft survival remains a critical challenge. Here, we demonstrate that the mechanical properties of the transplantation microenvironment play a crucial role in NSC survival in the injured spinal cord. While our previously engineered imidazole-poly(organophosphazene) (I-5) hydrogel effectively prevented cavity formation by promoting extracellular matrix remodeling, NSCs transplanted with 10% hydrogel exhibited poor survival. Remarkably, increasing the hydrogel concentration to 16%, which created a 5-fold stiffer matrix, significantly enhanced NSC graft survival and synaptic integration. Using in vitro models with controlled substrate stiffness, we found that NSCs on stiffer substrates displayed enhanced adhesion, complex morphology, and increased viability. Importantly, we identified the mechanosensitive ion channel Piezo1 as the key molecular mediator of these stiffness-dependent behaviors. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated Piezo1 gene editing in NSCs significantly reduced graft survival in vivo when transplanted with 16% hydrogel, confirming that Piezo1-mediated mechanotransduction is essential for NSC survival in the injured spinal cord. Our findings reveal a previously unrecognized mechanism governing graft survival in the injured spinal cord and suggest that optimizing the mechanical properties of biomaterial scaffolds or targeting Piezo1-dependent mechanotransduction could substantially improve outcomes of cell-based therapies for neurological disorders.

">Mapping the spatiotemporal dynamics of de novo protein synthesis during long-term memory formation</a></h4>

              
                The formation of new associative long-term memory (LTM) following Pavlovian conditioning is dependent upon multiple, temporally distinct windows of mRNA translation. Current methods for labelling newly synthesized proteins lack the temporal specificity to robustly characterize the dynamics of throughout the rodent brain following conditioning. Here we resolve these technological limitations and demonstrate that in awake mice, the retro-orbital (RO) injection of azidohomoalanine (AHA) enables the labelling and subsequent visualization of the brain de novo proteome, with labelling periods as short as 30 minutes. By combining this technical advancement with tissue , we were able to identify brain region, cell-type, and neuronal sub-population specific changes in de novo protein synthesis in mice following an auditory threat conditioning paradigm. The added temporal specificity of our approach allowed us to track the changes in de novo protein synthesis over time, revealing that conditioning-induced changes in mRNA translation exhibit remarkable temporal specificity in brain regions such as the somatosensory cortex. Taken together, our findings highlight how this novel labelling technique can be used to map the highly intricate temporal and spatial dynamics of mRNA translation during complex rodent behavior.

">Three cortical streams for somatosensory information processing</a></h4>

              
                The somatosensory cortex processes information hierarchically, transforming sensory input into appropriate responses. This hierarchy, in turn, provides a fundamental principle for the organization of anatomical and functional properties across the somatosensory cortex. While the local somatosensory hierarchy has been studied, a comprehensive model that fully illustrates somatosensory information transmission in fine detail remains lacking. In this study, we examine multimodal connectivity patterns of the entire macaque somatosensory cortex by integrating the information from receptor covariance (RC) and structural (SC) or functional connectivity (FC). Our findings not only reveal the hierarchical relationships but also propose a model of somatosensory processing streams. In this model, area 3bl serves as the initial cortical stage for somatosensory signals, projecting to areas 3al, 1, and 2. From there, somatosensory signals follow three major pathways: ventrally to the SII complex, medially to the medial SI and TSA, and posteriorly to somatosensory association areas in the parietal lobe. Further analysis shows that RC is not only closely linked to SC and FC but in addition displays unique characteristics that likely relate to the hierarchical processing across sensory modalities. This study deepens our understanding of brain connectivity patterns across different modalities and links the structural, chemoarchitectonic, and functional organization of the macaque somatosensory cortex.

">Newly trained navigation and verbal memory skills elicit changes in task-related networks but not brain structure</a></h4>

              
                Training cognitive skills, such as remembering a list of words or navigating a new city, has important implications for both health and disease. Yet, understanding what brain changes underlie the acquisition of complex cognitive skills remains unresolved. Here, we developed and validated intensive multiweek interventions in which participants were randomly assigned training in either navigation or verbal memory. Healthy young participants (N=75) underwent structural and functional imaging prior to and following the training. Based on pre-registered and exploratory analyses, we did not find any evidence for changes to hippocampal volume, hippocampal subfields, cortical brain volume, or white matter connectivity due to the training. In contrast, network-based analyses suggested changes in task-related informational connectivity, which occurred primarily between cortical areas and mostly involved putative cognitive control networks. These results suggest that cognitive interventions target more transient configurations in network connectivity rather than more durable structural changes.

">A neural circuit targeting technique for investigating functional input-output organization in the nervous system</a></h4>

              
                Neurons communicate information across circuits and the function of cells in these circuits is determined by both the afferent inputs they receive and the efferent outputs they send to other brain regions. To study the activity and function of specific neuronal populations, transneuronal anterograde and retrograde viral approaches have been employed to define neural circuit elements by inputs or outputs, respectively. However, what is missing is a way to study the function of neurons based on both their inputs and outputs. Applying a combination of multiple recombinases and transneuronal anterograde/retrograde viruses, we developed a technique called input-output Projection-based INtersectional Circuit-tagging Enabled by Recombinases (PINCER) to target specific neuronal cell types and investigate functional input-output organization in neural circuits. We show the logic and application of this technique with in vivo calcium imaging and optogenetic approaches to reveal the distinct functions and neural dynamics of connectivity defined neuronal populations in the amygdala for emotional processing. Specifically, PINCER allowed the parsing of valence and salience functions of the amygdala to reveal an input-output cell type selectively mediating aversive memory formation. This technique allows neuroscientists to identify novel subclasses of cells based on their combinatorial input-output anatomical connectivity, providing a tool for fine dissection of the functional properties of neural circuits.

">Cardio-respiratory interactions in interoceptive perception: The role of heartbeat-modulated cortical oscillations</a></h4>

              
                The cardiovascular and respiratory systems are anatomically and functionally integrated within the cardio-respiratory system. This close connection suggests that breathing continuously shapes cardiac interoceptive perception. Previously, we demonstrated cardio-respiratory interoceptive interactions in the heartbeat-evoked potential, a neural marker of cortical processing of cardiac signals. Specifically, we observed enhanced late heartbeat-evoked potential positivity and greater interoceptive accuracy during exhalation compared to inhalation in participants engaged in cardiac interoceptive tasks. Here, we extended these findings to the time-frequency domain by reanalysing our previous dataset. We investigated heartbeat-modulated cortical oscillations, examining power, inter-trial coherence, and functional connectivity across the respiratory cycle at rest, during a cardiac interoceptive task (heartbeat counting), and an exteroceptive control task (cardiac-tone counting). Results revealed that during the heartbeat counting task, late heartbeat-related power, inter-trial coherence, and functional connectivity increased during exhalation compared to inhalation, particularly in the alpha and theta frequency bands. These effects were primarily localized to right fronto-centro-parietal electrodes. Furthermore, we identified interactive relationships between heartbeat-evoked potential and heartbeat-modulated cortical oscillations in the alpha band that predicted interoceptive accuracy. These relationships were independent of cardiac physiology and were absent in the exteroceptive task. We proposed a model of cardio-respiratory interactions within the framework of interoceptive predictive coding, suggesting that these interactions occur at multiple levels of the interoceptive hierarchy: peripheral, brainstem, and cortical. Our interpretation highlights the role of heartbeat-related alpha-band modulations in enhancing the precision-weighting of cardiac prediction errors, thereby facilitating attentional allocation to interoceptive signals and the suppression of task-irrelevant distractors, particularly during exhalation.

">OpenIrisDPI: An Open-Source Digital Dual Purkinje Image Eye Tracker for Visual Neuroscience</a></h4>

              
                Video-based eye trackers are widely used in vision science, psychology, clinical assessment, and studies of human-computer interaction. Most of these eye trackers use the pupil center and corneal reflection (P-CR) to estimate the direction of gaze. However, P-CR eye trackers are often too imprecise to be used in applications with stringent requirements on eye tracking quality. To address this limitation, we present OpenIrisDPI, an open-source plugin for the OpenIris framework that implements dual Purkinje image (DPI) tracking. The system simultaneously tracks both P-CR and DPI signals, enabling a direct comparison between them. We leveraged this fact to demonstrate that the P-CR method overestimates the amount of eye movement during fixation compared to DPI. We further validated the accuracy of our DPI signals by simultaneously recording from neurons in the macaque lateral geniculate nucleus. These data revealed that reconstructing visual inputs using DPI produced tighter correlations between stimuli and neural responses than using P-CR. Through open-source implementation and detailed documentation, OpenIrisDPI makes high-precision eye tracking readily available to the research community.

Methods: A novel few-shot learning-based reconstruction framework is proposed, featuring a 3D variational network specifically designed for 3D TOF-MRA that is pre-trained on simulated complex-valued, multi-coil raw k-space datasets synthesized from diverse open-source magnitude images and fine-tuned using only two single-slab experimentally acquired datasets. The proposed approach was evaluated against existing methods on acquired retrospectively undersampled in vivo k-space data from five healthy volunteers and on prospectively undersampled data from two additional subjects. Results: The proposed method achieved superior reconstruction performance on experimentally acquired in vivo data over comparison methods, preserving most fine vessels with minimal artifacts with up to 8-fold acceleration. Compared to other simulation techniques, the proposed method generated more realistic raw k-space data for 3D TOF-MRA. Consistently high-quality reconstructions were also observed on prospectively undersampled data. Conclusions: By leveraging few-shot learning, the proposed method enabled highly accelerated 3D TOF-MRA relying on minimal experimentally acquired data, achieving promising results on both retrospective and prospective in vivo data while outperforming existing methods. Given the challenges of acquiring and sharing large raw k-space datasets, this holds significant promise for advancing research and clinical applications in high-resolution, whole-head 3D TOF-MRA imaging.

">White matter geometry confounds Diffusion Tensor Imaging Along Perivascular Space (DTI-ALPS) measures</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: The perivascular space (PVS) is integral to glymphatic function, facilitating fluid exchange and waste clearance in the brain. Diffusion Tensor Imaging Along the Perivascular Space (DTI-ALPS) has been proposed as a non-invasive marker of perivascular diffusion, yet its specificity remains unclear. ALPS measures assume that radial asymmetry in white matter diffusivity predominantly reflects PVS contributions. However, anatomical and microstructural confounds may influence these metrics. Methods: We systematically evaluated potential biases in ALPS-derived measures using high-resolution, multi-shell diffusion MRI from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) and high-field imaging. Specifically, we examined (1) the prevalence of radial asymmetry across white matter, (2) the influence of crossing fibers on ALPS indices, (3) the impact of axonal undulations and dispersion, and (4) the spatial alignment of vasculature with white matter in ALPS-associated regions. Results: Radial asymmetry is widespread across white matter and persists even at high b-values, suggesting a dominant contribution from axonal geometry rather than faster PVS-specific diffusion. Crossing fibers significantly inflate ALPS indices, with greater radial asymmetry observed in regions with a greater prevalence of crossing fibers. Furthermore, anisotropic axonal dispersion and undulations introduce systematic asymmetry independent of perivascular diffusion. Finally, high-resolution vascular imaging reveals substantial heterogeneity in medullary vein orientation, challenging the assumption that PVS consistently aligns with the left-right axis in ALPS regions. Conclusion: ALPS indices are significantly influenced by white matter microstructure, including fiber crossings, undulations, and dispersion. These findings suggest that ALPS-derived metrics may not provide a direct measure of glymphatic function but rather reflect underlying axonal geometry. Interpretations of ALPS-derived metrics as biomarkers of glymphatic function must consider these anatomical complexities, and future studies should integrate advanced modeling approaches to disentangle perivascular contributions from white matter structure.

">Dysregulation of neuronal activity-dependent immediate early genes in a mouse model of Angelman syndrome</a></h4>

              
                Angelman syndrome (AS) is a debilitating neurodevelopmental disorder triggered by impaired function of the maternal UBE3A gene, which codes a protein that functions as a ubiquitin ligase and transcriptional coactivator. Ube3a maternal deficient mice replicate many key behavioral deficits associated with AS; however, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. Using an RT2 Profiler PCR array that summarizes the expression of 84 genes regulating synaptic plasticity, we identified a number of dysregulated genes in the visual cortex of AS mice brains at postnatal day 25 (P25) compared to wild-type animals. In-depth analysis revealed that various immediate early genes (IEGs), like Arc, Egr1-4, and Homer, are dramatically down-regulated in the visual cortex of AS mice with regard to wild-type controls at P25. Moreover, the dark rearing of wild-type mice considerably decreased the levels of these IEGs to nearly the same level as those found in AS mice, along with the down-regulation of Ube3a. Furthermore, a significant reduction in the expression of these IEGs can also be observed in the hippocampus of AS mice. Finally, we demonstrate that the augmented activity of HDAC2 in the AS mice brain might be connected with the down-regulation of various IEGs and other synaptic plasticity-regulating genes. These findings indicate that the deregulated expression of neural activity-dependent IEGs could be linked with abnormal synaptic plasticity and associated behavioral deficits observed in AS mice.

">Hemispheric Asymmetry of Tau Pathology is Related to Asymmetric Amyloid Deposition in Alzheimer's Disease</a></h4>

              
                The distribution of tau pathology in Alzheimer's disease (AD) shows remarkable inter-individual heterogeneity, including hemispheric asymmetry. However, the factors driving this asymmetry remain poorly understood. We explored whether tau asymmetry is linked to i) reduced inter-hemispheric brain connectivity (potentially restricting tau spread), or ii) asymmetry in amyloid-beta (A{beta}) distribution (indicating greater hemisphere-specific vulnerability to AD pathology). 452 participants from the Swedish BioFINDER-2 cohort with evidence of both A{beta} pathology (CSF A{beta}42/40 or neocortical A{beta}-PET) and tau pathology (temporal tau-PET), were categorised as left asymmetric (n=102), symmetric (n=306), or right asymmetric (n=44) based on temporal lobe tau-PET uptake distribution. Edge-wise inter-hemispheric functional (RSfMRI; n=318) and structural connectivity (dMRI; n=352) patterns were examined but no differences in inter-hemispheric functional or structural connectivity were found between groups. However, a strong association was observed between tau and A{beta} laterality patterns based on PET uptake (n=233; {beta}=0.632, p<0.001), which was replicated in three independent cohorts (n=234; {beta}=0.535, p<0.001). In a longitudinal A{beta}-positive sample, baseline A{beta} asymmetry predicted the progression of tau laterality over time (n=289; {beta}=0.025, p=0.028). These findings suggest that tau asymmetry is not associated with a weaker inter-hemispheric connectivity but might reflect hemispheric differences in vulnerability to A{beta} pathology, underscoring the role of regional vulnerability in determining the distribution of AD pathology.

">Bestrophin1-mediated GABA release activates large chloride currents to generate epileptiform events in the entorhinal cortex</a></h4>

              
                The mechanisms that lead to the onset of a focal seizure are still not understood. We used the well-established 4-aminopyridine (4AP) ictogenesis model to analyze epileptiform discharges in the entorhinal cortex of rodents maintained in vitro. Simultaneous field potential and patch-clamp recordings demonstrated that 100 micro molar 4AP elicited periodic and large chloride currents in both principal neurons and GABAergic interneurons that steadily matched with population spikes. These population spike-associated chloride currents (PSACCs) survived glutamate and glycine receptor blockade and were abolished by GABAA antagonists and by blocking synaptic neurotransmitters release. Antagonist of astrocyte bestrophin-1 channels inhibited PSACCs and prevented the occurrence of seizure-like events in both entorhinal cortex mouse slices and in the isolated guinea pig brain. We propose that bestrophin-1-induced GABA release likely triggered by astrocytes promotes in all neurons subtypes a large chloride current that is responsible for interictal spikes and establishes the conditions for the generation of seizure-like events.

">Comprehensive Neural Representations of Naturalistic Stimuli through Multimodal Deep Learning</a></h4>

              
                A central challenge in cognitive neuroscience is understanding how the brain represents and predicts complex, multimodal experiences in naturalistic settings. Traditional neural encoding models, often based on unimodal or static features, fall short in capturing the rich, dynamic structure of real-world cognition. Here, we address this challenge by introducing a video-text alignment encoding framework that predicts whole-brain neural responses by integrating visual and linguistic features across time. Using a state-of-the-art deep learning model (VALOR), we achieve more accurate and generalizable encoding than unimodal (AlexNet, WordNet) and static multimodal (CLIP) baselines. Beyond improving prediction, our model automatically maps cortical semantic spaces, aligning with human-annotated dimensions without requiring manual labeling. We further uncover a hierarchical predictive coding gradient, where different brain regions anticipate future events over distinct timescales--an organization that correlates with individual cognitive abilities. These findings provide new evidence that temporal multimodal integration is a core mechanism of real-world brain function. Our results demonstrate that deep learning models aligned with naturalistic stimuli can reveal ecologically valid neural mechanisms, offering a powerful, scalable approach for investigating perception, semantics, and prediction in the human brain. This framework advances naturalistic neuroimaging by bridging computational modeling and real-world cognition.

">Anaesthesia disrupts mesoscale signal propagation in spite of enhanced responsivity in frontal but not in parietal cortex</a></h4>

              
                Understanding the effects of anaesthesia on cortical signal propagation at multiple spatiotemporal scales could provide insights into how cortical integration is disrupted during loss of consciousness. Non-invasive studies indicate reduced complexity of large-scale cortical patterns following perturbation of cortical activity under anaesthesia, compared to wakefulness. However, it is currently unknown how the cortex responds to local electrical microstimulation at the mesoscale during loss of sensory awareness, especially in higher order cortical areas believed to be involved in the emergence of consciousness. Using planar microelectrode arrays implanted in the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC) and posterior parietal cortex (PPC) of macaques, we simultaneously recorded and administered intracortical microstimulation at varying amplitudes during quiet wakefulness, as well as under light and deep sevoflurane anaesthesia. We found that the lateral spread rather than the strength of elicited cortical activity was consistently reduced under light and deep anaesthesia. Suppression of lateral signal propagation in the cortex could underlie a breakdown of mesoscale integrative processes during loss of consciousness, providing a novel mechanism for understanding cortical network effects of anaesthesia.

">EEG Signatures of Auditory Distraction: Neural Responses to Spectral Novelty in Real-World Soundscapes</a></h4>

              
                In everyday life, ambient sounds can disrupt our concentration, interfere with task performance, and contribute to mental fatigue. Even when not actively attended to, salient or changing sounds in the environment can involuntarily divert attention. Understanding how the brain responds to these real-world auditory distractions is essential for evaluating the cognitive consequences of environmental noise. In this study, we recorded electroencephalography (EEG) while participants performed different tasks during prolonged exposure to a complex urban soundscape. We identified naturally occurring, acoustically salient events and analyzed the corresponding event-related potentials (ERPs). Auditory spectral novelty reliably elicited a P3a response (250-350 ms), reflecting robust attentional capture by novel environmental sounds. In contrast, the Reorienting Negativity (RON) window (450-600 ms) showed no consistent modulation, possibly due to the continuous and largely behaviorally irrelevant nature of the soundscape. Performance in a behavioral task was briefly disrupted following novel sounds, underscoring the functional impact of attentional capture. Noise sensitivity, measured via the Weinstein Noise Sensitivity Scale (WNSS; 1978), was not associated with ERP amplitudes. Together, these findings demonstrate that the P3a component provides a stable neural marker of attentional shifts in naturalistic contexts and highlight the utility of spectral novelty detection as a tool for investigating auditory attention outside the laboratory.

">Targeted degradation of α-synuclein prevents PFF-induced aggregation</a></h4>

              
                Accumulation of misfolded -synuclein protein in intracellular inclusion bodies of dopaminergic neurons underlies the pathogenesis of Synucleinopathies, which include Parkinson's Disease (PD), Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB) and Multiple System Atrophy (MSA). Therefore, clearance of misfolded -synuclein from dopaminergic neurons could in principle offer a therapeutic window for Synucleinopathies, which currently remain untreatable. In this study, we employ the Affinity-directed PROtein Missile (AdPROM) system consisting of the substrate receptor of the CUL2-E3 ligase complex VHL and a nanobody selectively recognising the human -synuclein protein and demonstrate targeted degradation of endogenous -synuclein from human cell lines with remarkable selectivity. We further demonstrate that targeted degradation of -synuclein prevents the pre-formed fibril (PFF)-induced aggregation of -synuclein in primary neurons derived from rats expressing human -synuclein. This approach represents the first demonstration of nanobody-guided proteasomal degradation of all clinically relevant -synuclein variants, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic strategy against Synucleinopathies.

">Feature-tuned synaptic inputs to somatostatin interneurons drive context-dependent processing</a></h4>

              
                Mapping neural computation onto the functional microarchitecture of sensory circuits is essential for understanding how brain circuits transform input signals into coherent percepts. Many higher-order perceptual processes emerge in the cortex, yet relatively little is known about how specific connectivity motifs give rise to these computations. To address this challenge, we combined single cell and population-level physiological recordings and perturbation methods to map a context-dependent cortical computation onto the synaptic microarchitecture of the mouse primary visual cortex (V1). We demonstrate a precise, recurrent circuit between cortical pyramidal cells (PCs) and somatostatin (SST) inhibitory interneurons that mediates context-driven figure/ground modulation in V1. Through a like-to-like connectivity rule from PCs and SSTs, this circuit explains SSTs visual encoding properties and their resulting impact on contextual modulation in V1. These findings reveal key synaptic and circuit mechanisms that may underlie the earliest stages of scene segmentation in the visual cortex. Moreover, they raise the notion that feature-specific excitatory-inhibitory microcircuitry from PC to SSTs could be a general strategy that the cortex exploits to give rise to higher level computations.

">Glutamate delta-1 receptors regulate a novel tonic excitatory conductance in the mouse bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and influence neuronal function</a></h4>

              
                The plasticity of ionotropic receptors (mainly AMPARs and NMDARs) within the glutamatergic system has long been investigated as a mechanism for physiological and pathological adaptive learning. The tetrameric delta glutamate receptors ({delta}GluRs, GluD1 and GluD2) are homologs of the AMPARs and NMDARs, however they are insensitive to glutamate. These proteins, especially GluD1, have been implicated in multiple psychiatric conditions and play a functional role in synapses assembly and stability, but recent evidence suggests they also may supply a tonic excitatory conductance, are sensitive to poly-amine blockade, and regulate synaptic plasticity. Here we use whole-cell patch clamp electrophysiology to functionally characterize these receptors in the dorsolateral bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (dlBNST) and investigate their modulation of both synaptic transmission and cell excitability. Our results suggest that {delta}GluRs, and in particular GluD1, carry a tonic conductance, modulate excitatory synapses, and regulate cell excitability in the dlBNST. These results imply that GluD1 functions to regulate the flow of information through the BNST and may play a role in affect, stress, and substance use disorders.

">Neural dynamics in superior colliculus of freely moving mice</a></h4>

              
                Vision is an active process that depends on head and eye movements to explore the visual environment. Superior colliculus (SC) is known for its role in generating these movements, as well as processing visual information, but has not been studied extensively during free movement in complex visual environments. To determine the impact of active vision, we recorded neural activity across the depth of SC during free movement while simultaneously recording eye and head position. We find that superficial SC (sSC) neurons respond to visual input following gaze-shifting saccadic movements, whereas deep SC (dSC) neurons respond to the movements themselves, as demonstrated by their sustained response in darkness. Additionally, we find motor responses in dSC are more correlated to head movements rather than eye movements. Furthermore, we compared sSC gaze shift responses to known gaze shift responses in primary visual cortex (V1), finding similarities in key response types, although the temporal sequences following gaze shifts differ between the regions. Our results demonstrate distinct visual processing differences between SC and V1 as well as highlighting the various roles SC plays during active vision.

     alt="Sex and Strain Differences in Analgesic and Hyperlocomotor Effects of Morphine and μ-Opioid Receptor Expression in Mice"/>
<p>Morphine dose-dependently increased analgesia in both CD-1 and C57BL/6 mice, with no observed sex differences. However, C57BL/6 mice of both sexes exhibited greater morphine-induced locomotor activity compared to CD-1 mice. These behavioral differences were paralleled by strain-specific patterns of μ-opioid receptor (MOR) expression: CD-1 mice showed elevated MOR levels in the spinal cord and periaqueductal gray, whereas C57BL/6 mice had increased MOR expression in the caudoputamen.</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Sex and gender differences in the analgesic efficacy and side effects of opioids have been widely reported, but their underlying neurobiological mechanisms remain poorly understood. Preclinical animal models are essential tools for investigating these differences and providing insights into the neurobiology of opioid effects. Although studies in rats have revealed sex-specific effects of opioids, the sex-dependent behavioral profiles of opioids in mice, particularly across strains, remain largely unexplored. In this study, we characterized sex and strain differences in the antinociceptive and hyperlocomotor effects of morphine in the two most widely used mouse strains—CD1 and C57BL/6—and quantified regional expression of the μ-opioid receptor (MOR) in key brain and spinal cord regions. Both strains exhibited clear, dose-dependent antinociceptive and hyperlocomotor responses to morphine. While no significant sex or strain differences were observed in antinociceptive effects, C57BL/6 mice displayed significantly greater hyperlocomotor activity than CD1 mice. Western blot analyses revealed strain-specific MOR expression, with CD1 mice showing higher spinal cord and periaqueductal gray MOR levels, particularly in females, while C57BL/6 mice exhibited elevated MOR expression in the caudoputamen. Morphine treatment increased spinal MOR expression in CD1 mice but not C57BL/6, suggesting strain-dependent regulation of MOR. These findings highlight strain-specific behavioral and molecular responses to morphine, emphasizing the importance of strain and sex considerations in preclinical opioid research.</p>

                <p>One pending question in social neuroscience is whether interpersonal interactions are processed differently by the brain depending on the bodily characteristics of the interactor, i.e., their physical appearance. To address this issue, we engaged participants in a minimally interactive task with an avatar either showing bodily features or not while recording their brain activity using electroencephalography (EEG) in order to investigate indices of action observation and action monitoring processing. Multivariate results showed that bodily compared with nonbodily appearance modulated parieto-occipital neural patterns throughout the entire duration of the observed movement and that, importantly, such patterns differ from the ones related to initial shape processing. Furthermore, among the electrocortical indices of action monitoring, only the early observational positivity (oPe) was responsive to the bodily appearance of the observed agent under the specific task requirement to predict the partner movement. Taken together, these findings broaden the understanding of how bodily appearance shapes the spatiotemporal processing of an interactor's movements. This holds particular relevance in our modern society, where human&ndash;artificial (virtual or robotic) agent interactions are rapidly becoming ubiquitous.</p>

                Introduction Sharenting involves parents sharing photos, videos, or other information about their children on their social media profiles via online platforms. Research indicated the rising prevalence of parental sharenting behaviour among various countries. Objective The main aim of this article was to explore the role of motivations, perceptions, attitudes, and impression management on parental sharenting behaviours. Methods A systematic review examined empirical studies published from 2019 to 2024 regarding parental motivations, attitudes, perceptions, and impression management associated with sharenting. Relevant studies were identified via Scopus and manual reference searches, with data extraction concentrating on study characteristics, demographics, objectives, design, and principal findings. Findings Parental sharenting is motivated by intrinsic desires, social validation, and impression management, as parents curate content to improve their social image. While children value favourable representations, many object to sharing without consent. Notwithstanding privacy concerns, parents frequently prioritise advantages, raising ethical enquiries regarding children’s autonomy, privacy, and digital identity in digital self-representation. Conclusion Parental sharenting, motivated by emotional satisfaction, social validation, and impression management, frequently neglects privacy risks and ethical considerations. Such practices may compromise children’s autonomy, privacy, and digital identity, resulting in conflicts with their rights. Children’s varied responses underscore these dilemmas, highlighting the necessity of reconciling parental intentions with safeguarding children’s digital futures and overall well-being. Recommendation Parents should engage in mindful sharenting, policymakers must safeguard children’s digital rights, professionals should enhance awareness, and researchers should investigate methods to reconcile parental desires with children’s welfare.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1439/v2?src=rss">Case Report: Macrophage activation syndrome due to multifocal tuberculosis in an immunocompromised patient [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Macrophage Activation Syndrome (MAS) is a serious and life-threatening complication defined by excessive immune activation. While it’s commonly associated with rheumatic diseases, infections can also trigger MAS, with tuberculosis being a rare but significant cause. This case report discusses a rare occurrence of Macrophage Activation Syndrome (MAS) caused by multifocal tuberculosis in an immunocompromised patient with Crohn’s disease receiving immunosuppressive treatment. The patient is a 26-year-old woman with Crohn’s disease who is being treated with azathioprine. She arrived at the hospital battling persistent abdominal pain, overwhelming fatigue, and fever. Upon examination, splenomegaly and ascites were noted. A chest X-ray revealed bilateral pleural effusion consistent with tuberculosis. A CT scan confirmed the presence of pleural, pericardial, and intraperitoneal fluid. Blood tests indicated pancytopenia, hyperferritinemia, and hypofibrinogenemia. The analysis of ascitic fluid suggested an exudate. The PCR test of the bone marrow aspirate was positive for tuberculosis without rifampicin resistance, and the smear showed hemophagocytosis images. The patient was diagnosed with Macrophage Activation Syndrome secondary to multifocal tuberculosis. This report delves into the complex relationship between MAS and tuberculosis, emphasizing the challenges in diagnosing MAS in such cases and the potential link to tuberculosis. The complex diagnostic landscape of multifocal tuberculosis, which can often mimic malignancies, underscores the importance of promptly detecting and starting anti-tuberculosis interventions for improved clinical outcomes and the prevention of associated complications.

                Life support robots that can be fully autonomous clothing wear-support robotic identification control systems are challenging. Robotic-assisted dressing solutions have the potential to provide tremendous support to the elderly, patients with mobility impairments, and their caregivers. In this study, we propose an IoT control system that automatically identifies clothing wearing position boundaries and recognizes actual spatial height information using a stereo camera with computer vision. The location information of the clothes boundary was recognized use the semantic segmentation model and machine learning method. Then, using the depth measurement of the stereo camera, the spatial height position of the actual clothing boundary was calculated using the depth information. Finally, the auxiliary position movement control of the clothes-wearing support robot was carried out using the IoT method. We experimentally verified that the recognition control system can successfully achieve the recognition and control of the auxiliary position movement of the device. We performed practical experiments for the evaluation. The recognition accuracy and control accuracy in multiple situations and environmental conditions were 77.35% and 97.21%.

                Background Bioremediation faces several compounds to recover oil spilled ecosystem. The BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene) are toxic hydrocarbons requiring efficient microbial degradation for bioremediation. Pseudomonas aeruginosa can degrade hydrocarbons through emulsification (rhl genes) and tolerance (mla genes). However, genomic organization of these systems in environmental P. aeruginosa strains remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the rhl and mla systems in six strains isolated from hydrocarbon-contaminated sites in Peru. Methods Six Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains were evaluated in this study. Each strain were able to degrade hydrocarbon and tolerate heavy metals. DNA extraction, sequencing, and quality-controlled assembly, functional genome annotation was performed using BAKTA. Comparative analysis included high-quality Pseudomonas genomes from RefSeq, with ANI metrics. A phylogenetic tree was built from core gene alignment, revealed evolutionary connections and was visualized with iTOL. Results The assembled genomes ranged from 5.6 to 6.0 Mbp with ~66% GC content. All the strains were confirmed as P. aeruginosa by ANI; placing them within Clade 1 alongside environmental and clinical strains. Pangenome analysis identified 3,544 core genes and a diverse accessory genome. All strains had rhlABRI genes in a conserved 3′-5′ orientation. Most of them contained duplicated rhlB gene, except C1BHIC5 strain. However, rhlG varied in position and orientation, it was often near rhlC, with C1BHIC5 also displaying an exception in rhlG orientation.100% of strains presented mla system, associated with toluene tolerance, with two copies of mlaA, mlaFEDC, and mlaEFD genes arranged with high synteny but variable orientations. In comparison to Pseudomonas putida, where mla genes are positioned between murA and ppcD with an additional toluene tolerance gene (ttg2D). Conclusions In conclusion, the presence of the rhlABC genes and the BTEX tolerance genes in all of the analyzed strains allowed us to understand the great ability of P. aeruginosa to survive in polluted environments.

                <p>by Laetitia Grabot, Garance Merholz, Jonathan Winawer, David J. Heeger, Laura Dugué</p>

Brain oscillations might be traveling waves propagating in cortex. Studying their propagation within single cortical areas has mostly been restricted to invasive measurements. Their investigation in healthy humans, however, requires non-invasive recordings, such as MEG or EEG. Identifying traveling waves with these techniques is challenging because source summation, volume conduction, and low signal-to-noise ratios make it difficult to localize cortical activity from sensor responses. The difficulty is compounded by the lack of a known ground truth in traveling wave experiments. Rather than source-localizing cortical responses from sensor activity, we developed a two-part model-based neuroimaging approach: (1) The putative neural sources of a propagating oscillation were modeled within primary visual cortex (V1) via retinotopic mapping from functional MRI recordings (encoding model); and (2) the modeled sources were projected onto MEG and EEG sensors to predict the resulting signal using a biophysical head model. We tested our model by comparing its predictions against the MEG-EEG signal obtained when participants viewed visual stimuli designed to elicit either fovea-to-periphery or periphery-to-fovea traveling waves or standing waves in V1, in which ground truth cortical waves could be reasonably assumed. Correlations on within-sensor phase and amplitude relations between predicted and measured data revealed good model performance. Crucially, the model predicted sensor data more accurately when the input to the model was a traveling wave going in the stimulus direction compared to when the input was a standing wave, or a traveling wave in a different direction. Furthermore, model accuracy peaked at the spatial and temporal frequency parameters of the visual stimulation. Together, our model successfully recovers traveling wave properties in cortex when they are induced by traveling waves in stimuli. This provides a sound basis for using MEG-EEG to study endogenous traveling waves in cortex and test hypotheses related with their role in cognition.

                <p>by Wasim Abbas, Sieun Lee, Sangil Kim</p>
Background <p>In Korea, Hand-foot-and-mouth disease (HFMD) is a recurring illness that presents significant public health challenges, primarily because of its unpredictable epidemic patterns. The accurate prediction of the spread of HFMD plays a vital role in the effective management of the disease.</p> Methods <p>We have devised a dynamic model that accurately represents the transmission dynamics of HFMD. The model includes compartments for susceptible, exposed, inpatients, outpatients, recovered, and deceased individuals. By utilizing monthly inpatient and outpatient data, the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) method was employed to perform a joint estimation of model parameters and state variables. The calibration of model parameters involved using data from the months of January to May, while generating forecasts for the timeframe spanning from June to December.</p> Results <p>The findings reveal a significant alignment between the model and the observed data, as evidenced by root-mean-square error (RMSE) values below 1000 for inpatients and below 10000 for outpatients starting in June. The correlation coefficients surpassed 0.9, except for the year 2015. The implications of our findings suggest a notable shift in transmission and recovery rates, starting in 2015.</p> Discussion <p>The model successfully predicted the peak and magnitude of HFMD outbreaks occurring between June and December, closely matching the observed epidemic patterns. The model’s efficacy in predicting epidemic trends and informing preventive strategies is reinforced by the insights gained from monthly variations in parameter estimates of HFMD transmission dynamics.</p>

                <p>by Jiaxin Hu, Jesse N. Weber, Lauren E. Fuess, Natalie C. Steinel, Daniel I. Bolnick, Miaoyan Wang</p>

Studying the mechanisms underlying the genotype-phenotype association is crucial in genetics. Gene expression studies have deepened our understanding of the genotype  →  expression  →  phenotype mechanisms. However, traditional expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) methods often overlook the critical role of gene co-expression networks in translating genotype into phenotype. This gap highlights the need for more powerful statistical methods to analyze genotype  →  network  →  phenotype mechanism. Here, we develop a network-based method, called spectral network quantitative trait loci analysis (snQTL), to map quantitative trait loci affecting gene co-expression networks. Our approach tests the association between genotypes and joint differential networks of gene co-expression via a tensor-based spectral statistics, thereby overcoming the ubiquitous multiple testing challenges in existing methods. We demonstrate the effectiveness of snQTL in the analysis of three-spined stickleback (<i>Gasterosteus aculeatus</i>) data. Compared to conventional methods, our method snQTL uncovers chromosomal regions affecting gene co-expression networks, including one strong candidate gene that would have been missed by traditional eQTL analyses. Our framework suggests the limitation of current approaches and offers a powerful network-based tool for functional loci discoveries.

Drug-resistant tuberculosis is a pressing global health issue that requires the development of new drugs or the identification of new therapeutic targets. The ESX-3 secretion system is essential for the <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> growth and plays a role in iron/zinc homeostasis and virulence. The aim of this study was to evaluate the quaternary interface of EccD3, a component of the ESX-3 secretion system, and to evaluate the association of an <i>eccD3</i> mutant with drug resistance. The molecular structures of EccD3 protein and other ESX-3 secretion system proteins of the <i>M. tuberculosis</i> were predicted based in homology with the <i>Mycolicibacterium smegmatis</i> tertiary protein structures. According to the <i>in silico</i> results, selamectin, avermectin, ivermectin, and moxidectin were selected as prospective drugs. Selamectin and moxidectin had favorable ΔG values for the EccB3 and EccD3 dimer interfaces, whereas the ESX-3 Protomer 1 interface had the best ΔG + with avermectin, ivermectin, and moxidectin. Furthermore, ivermectin susceptibility increased when the <i>eccD3</i> gene was inhibited using CRISPRi in <i>M. smegmatis</i>. Blockage of EccD3 increased the ivermectin action, but the modest changes observed may be explained by the compensatory mechanisms or other ivermectin targets in absence of this Esx3 component. Further <i>in vitro</i> and preclinical studies are required to validate our findings.

                <p>by Benjamin M. Brisard, Kylie D. Cashwell, Stephanie M. Stewart, Logan M. Harrison, Aidan C. Charles, Chelsea V. Dennis, Ivie R. Henslee, Ethan L. Carrow, Heather A. Belcher, Debajit Bhowmick, Paul W. Vos, Maciej Majka, Martin Bier, David M. Hart, Cameron A. Schmidt</p>

During fertilization, mammalian sperm undergo a winnowing selection process that reduces the candidate pool of potential fertilizers from ~10<sup>6</sup>-10<sup>11</sup> cells to 10<sup>1</sup>-10<sup>2</sup> cells (depending on the species). Classical sperm competition theory addresses the positive or ‘stabilizing’ selection acting on sperm phenotypes within populations of organisms but does not strictly address the developmental consequences of sperm traits among individual organisms that are under purifying selection during fertilization. It is the latter that is of utmost concern for improving assisted reproductive technologies (ART) because low-fitness sperm may be inadvertently used for fertilization during interventions that rely heavily on artificial sperm selection, such as intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). Importantly, some form of sperm selection is used in nearly all forms of ART (e.g., differential centrifugation, swim-up, or hyaluronan binding assays, etc.). To date, there is no unifying quantitative framework (i.e., theory of sperm selection) that synthesizes causal mechanisms of selection with observed natural variation in individual sperm traits. In this report, we reframe the physiological function of sperm as a collective diffusive search process and develop multi-scale computational models to explore the causal dynamics that constrain sperm fitness during fertilization. Several experimentally useful concepts are developed, including a probabilistic measure of sperm fitness as well as an information theoretic measure of the magnitude of sperm selection, each of which are assessed under systematic increases in microenvironmental selective pressure acting on sperm motility patterns.

                <p>by Brittany M. Stewart, Linley R. Pierce, Mikayla C. Olson, Chengyuan Ji, Robert C. Orchard</p>

Norovirus, the leading cause of gastroenteritis worldwide, is a non-enveloped virus whose tropism is determined in part by the expression patterns of entry receptors. However, the contribution of cellular lipids to viral entry is not well understood. Here, we determined that the asymmetrical distribution of lipids within membrane bilayers is required for murine norovirus (MNV) replication. Specifically, TMEM30a, an essential subunit of lipid flippases, is required for MNV replication in vitro. Disruption of TMEM30a in mouse intestinal epithelial cells prevents persistent, enteric infection by MNV in vivo. Mechanistically, TMEM30a facilitates MNV binding and entry. Surprisingly, exoplasmic phosphatidylserine (PS), a typical marker of dying cells, does not inhibit MNV infection. Rather, TMEM30a maintains a lipid-ordered state that impacts membrane fluidity that is necessary for the low affinity, high avidity binding of MNV to cells. Our data provides a new role for lipid asymmetry in promoting non-enveloped virus infection in vitro and norovirus persistence in vivo.

Stem cells have lower facultative heterochromatin as defined by trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27me3) compared to differentiated cells. However, the mechanisms underlying these differential H3K27me3 levels remain elusive. Because H3K27me3 levels are diluted 2-fold in every round of replication and then restored through the rest of the cell cycle, we reasoned that the cell cycle length could be a key regulator of total H3K27me3 levels. Here, we propose that a short G1 phase restricts H3K27me3 levels in stem cells. To test this model, we determined changes to H3K27me3 levels in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) globally and at specific loci upon G1 phase lengthening – accomplished by thymidine block or growth in the absence of serum (with the “2i medium”). H3K27me3 levels in mESCs increase with G1 arrest when grown in serum and in 2i medium. Additionally, we observed via CUT&RUN and ChIP-seq that regions that gain H3K27me3 in G1 arrest and 2i media overlap, supporting our model of G1 length as a critical regulator of the stem cell epigenome. Furthermore, we demonstrate the inverse effect – that G1 shortening in differentiated human HEK293 cells results in a loss of H3K27me3 levels. Finally, in human tumor cells with extreme H3K27me3 loss, lengthening of the G1 phase leads to H3K27me3 recovery despite the presence of the dominant negative, sub-stoichiometric H3.K27M mutation. Our results indicate that G1 length is an essential determinant of H3K27me3 landscapes across diverse cell types.

Self-initiated behavior is accompanied by the experience of intending our actions. Here, we leverage the unique opportunity to examine the full intentional chain—from intention to action to environmental effects—in a tetraplegic person outfitted with a primary motor cortex (M1) brain–machine interface (BMI) generating real hand movements via neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES). This combined BMI-NMES approach allowed us to selectively manipulate each element of the intentional chain (intention, action, effect) while probing subjective experience and performing extra-cellular recordings in human M1. Behaviorally, we reveal a novel form of intentional binding: motor intentions are reflected in a perceived temporal attraction between the onset of intentions and that of actions. Neurally, we demonstrate that evoked spiking activity in M1 largely coincides in time with the onset of the experience of intention and that M1 spike counts and the onset of subjective intention may co-vary on a trial-by-trial basis. Further, population-level dynamics, as indexed by a decoder instantiating movement, reflect intention-action temporal binding. The results fill a significant knowledge gap by relating human spiking activity in M1 with the onset of subjective intention and complement prior human intracranial work examining pre-motor and parietal areas.

                <p>by Khang Ho, Rasika M. Harshey</p>

Chromosomal organization in <i>Escherichia coli</i> as examined by Hi-C methodology indicates that long-range interactions are sparse. Yet, spatial co-localization or “clustering” of 6/7 ribosomal RNA (<i>rrn</i>) operons distributed over half the 4.6 Mbp genome has been captured by two other methodologies—fluorescence microscopy and Mu transposition. Our current understanding of the mechanism of clustering is limited to mapping essential <i>cis</i> elements. To identify <i>trans</i> elements, we resorted to perturbing the system by chemical and physical means and observed that heat shock disrupts clustering. Levels of σ<sup>H</sup> are known to rise as a cellular response to the shock. We show that elevated expression of σ<sup>H</sup> alone is sufficient to disrupt clustering, independent of heat stress. The anti-clustering activity of σ<sup>H</sup> does not depend on its transcriptional activity but requires core-RNAP interaction and DNA-binding activities. This activity of σ<sup>H</sup> is suppressed by ectopic expression of σ<sup>D</sup> suggesting a competition for core-RNAP. A query of the other five known σ factors of <i>E. coli</i> found that elevated expression of FecI, the ECF σ factor that controls iron citrate transport, also perturbs clustering and is also suppressed by σ<sup>D</sup>. We discuss a possible scenario for how these membrane-associated σ factors participate in clustering of distant <i>rrn</i> loci.

                <p>by Hao Xiao, Wenyuan Chen, Hao Pang, Jing Zheng, Li Wang, Hao Feng, Jingdong Song, Lingpeng Cheng, Hongrong Liu</p>

In the assembly pathway of tailed double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) bacteriophages and herpesviruses, a procapsid with a dodecameric portal for DNA delivery at a unique vertex is initially formed. Appropriate procapsid assembly requires the transient presence of multiple copies of a scaffolding protein (SP), which is absent in the mature virion. However, how the SP contributes to dodecameric portal formation, facilitates portal and coat protein incorporation, and is subsequently released remains unclear because of a lack of structural information. Here, we present the structure of the SP–portal complex within the procapsid of bacteriophage P22 at 3–9 Å resolutions. The AlphaFold2-predicted SP model fits well with the density map of the complex. The SP forms trimers and tetramers that interact to yield a dome-like complex on the portal. Two SP domains mediate multimerization. Each trimer interacts with two neighboring portal subunits. The SP has a loop-hook-like structure that aids in coat protein recruitment during viral assembly. The loops of those SP subunits on the portal are positioned in clefts between adjacent portal subunits. Conformational changes in the portal during phage maturation may trigger the disassembly and release of the SP complex. Our findings provide insights into SP-assisted procapsid assembly in bacteriophage P22 and suggest that this strategy is also implemented by other dsDNA viruses, including herpesviruses.

                <p>by Ziwen Huang, Zhenxi Cai, Xin Tao, Xinli Wang, Xiaoxue Tian, Fan Chen, Zhen Li, Anlong Xu, Shaochun Yuan</p>

The discovery of the <i>ProtoRAG</i> transposon in lancelets revealed that V(D)J recombination originates from the <i>Recombination activating gene-like</i> (<i>RAGL</i>) transposon. Analogous to the vertebrate RAG complex, the RAGL transposase nicks host flanking DNA and leads to the formation of hairpin ends. Here, we showed that the Artemis nuclease, which is capable of resolving DNA hairpin ends generated during V(D)J recombination, is also responsible for unraveling <i>ProtoRAG</i>-mediated DNA hairpin ends. Notably, like the <i>RAGL</i> transposon, Artemis originated from the eukaryotic common ancestor. By tracing the evolving function of Artemis from cephalochordates to vertebrates, we revealed the lineage specific allele polymorphism of lancelet <i>Artemis</i> and uncovered an increased activity on hairpin DNA opening in vertebrate Artemis. Additionally, the evolutionarily conserved LYCS motif in Artemis β6, which may be associated with disease, is demonstrated to be crucial for its function. Overall, this study highlights the evolving function of Artemis, identifies novel critical residues, and provides new insights into the evolution of RAG-mediated recombination and the clinical therapy of <i>Artemis</i> deficient disease.

                Background The discoveries of Mulatu’s numbers, better known as Mulatu’s sequence, represent revolutionary contributions to the mathematical world. His best-known work is Mulatu’s sequence, in which each new number is the sum of the two preceding numbers. When various operations and manipulations are performed on the numbers in this sequence, remarkable and intricate patterns begin to emerge. This study aimed to identify novel characterizations of Mulatu’s numbers. Methods This study employed a multi-faceted approach to investigate characterizations of Mulatu’s numbers. Mathematical proof techniques such as principle of mathematical induction, proof by contradiction and direct proof were utilized to substantiate findings. Results In this study, we provided several characterizations of Mulatu’s numbers. We also investigated the properties and patterns of these numbers. Moreover, we have also shown that, similar to Fibonacci’s numbers, Mulatu’s numbers give the so-called golden ratio, which is most applicable in numerical optimization. Furthermore, we formulated a relation among Mulatu’s numbers, Fibonacci numbers, and Lucas numbers. Finally, we provided a generating function for the Mulatu numbers. Conclusions In this study, we uncovered novel characterizations of Mulatu’s numbers and introduced a generating function for them. We investigated relationship between Mulatu’s numbers and the golden ratio. The results discussed offer valuable insights and enhance our understanding of their properties. Furthermore, these findings play a vital role in the boarder context of mathematics and related areas, contributing significantly to the field.

                The study aimed at identifying the prevalence of preterm labor and the associated risk factors. Methods A quantitative approach using a retrospective case-control study was conducted at a tertiary care hospital in Udupi district, Karnataka. The sample consisted of women who delivered in the hospital. Among them, cases (250) were records of women who had delivered before 37 weeks of gestation, and controls (500) were records of women who delivered after 37 weeks 1 of gestation without any complications. Results The study revealed that the prevalence of preterm labor was 356 (14.86%) out of 2402 deliveries. Among these, only 250 were assessed. Preterm labor was significantly correlated with age, place of residence, degree of education, occupation, marital status, gravida, number of deliveries, type of deliveries, gap between births, blood type, and religion. Pregnant women exposed or at risk for preterm labor included those diagnosed with pregnancy-induced hypertension, those who took medication during pregnancy, those with a history of abortion, those engaged in intense physical labor, and those who conceived after the age of 30. Conclusion The prevalence of preterm labor can be minimized if modifiable risk factors are controlled, while non-modifiable risk factors require keen supervision. Health professionals must be alert to all modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors.

                Background Since 1900, the Mediterranean coast has experienced a notable increase in average annual temperatures, rising from 20°C to 24°C.This upward trend in outdoor climate plays a significant role in determining indoor environmental quality (IEQ) particularly in educational buildings. With growing concerns about energy consumption and urban climate change, This paper examines the potential of movable green walls on building facades to improve urban ecosystems. Unlike traditional passive green walls, active green walls offer dynamic aesthetics and provide various benefits, including shading, passive cooling, and opportunities for personal expression in urban environments. The primary aim of this research is to evaluate the shading effectiveness and energy performance of DVGS in hot climates, specifically within educational settings, to enhance their design as an architectural feature. 1 , 2 Methods A comprehensive approach is employed, specifically designed for the local climate of Egypt, utilizing DVGS to achieve comfort in temperatures and natural sunlight while reducing power consumption to enhance energy efficiency & thermal comfort for the occupants. The novelty of this paper lies in its comparative methodology, enhanced by software simulations (DesignBuilder7.0.2.006-Energy Plus plugin),(hyperlink: https://www.openstudio.net) to address design challenges in the existing educational building. Results The paper highlights the benefits of dynamic vertical green systems (DVGS) in educational institutions, revealing a significant reduction in energy efficiency and air quality. Louvers reduced chilling energy usage by 10.95% and heating energy usage by4.8%, while green walls reduced chilling energy and heating energy usage by 19.14% and 12.94% respectively. Louvers also reduced carbon dioxide emissions by 13%, while green walls reduced emissions by 28.43%. The vegetation layer’s thermal properties improved relative humidity by4% and 8%, respectively, in hot arid environments. DVGS installations also reduced electricity costs by 35% and 41.5% during August peak months. Conclusions The implementation of DVGS significantly improves indoor environmental quality by enhancing energy efficiency, thermal comfort and natural daylight.

                Hippocampal place fields emerge during exploration to support navigational learning and memory. The subcellular mechanisms supporting place field formation remain unclear. O’Hare et al. report that distal tuft dendrites are variably recruited during place field formation. The timing and magnitude of their recruitment predict the properties of new hippocampal place fields.

                Fu et al. find that low-dose prexasertib, a CHK1 inhibitor, enhances tumor sensitivity while mitigating on-target toxicity during immunotherapy through mtDNA-mediated STING pathway activation. Mechanistically, prexasertib at therapeutic doses blocks Nek1-mediated phosphorylation of VDAC1 at the threonine 107 residue, showing a phosphorylation-dependent regulatory mechanism of mitochondrial-nuclear crosstalk.

                Chen et al. demonstrate that HAF2 is a histone acetyltransferase that interacts with EIN2-C to regulate H3K14ac and H3K23ac in response to ethylene. HAF2 functions with the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, establishing its role in ethylene-induced chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation.

                Oka et al. show that basal cell carcinoma (BCC) has low immunogenicity due to low HLA-I expression from its inception. Foxc1, a transcription factor associated with BCC cell of origin, inhibits HLA-I expression in BCC cells, which can be reversed by a histone deacetylase inhibitor to enable BCC immunotherapy.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100581">Targeting IRE1α improves insulin sensitivity and thermogenesis and suppresses metabolically active adipose tissue macrophages in male obese mice</a></h4>

              
                Overnutrition engenders the expansion of adipose tissue and the accumulation of immune cells, in particular, macrophages, in the adipose tissue, leading to chronic low-grade inflammation and insulin resistance. In obesity, several proinflammatory subpopulations of adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs) identified hitherto include the conventional ‘M1-like’ CD11C-expressing ATM and the newly discovered metabolically activated CD9-expressing ATM; however, the relationship among ATM subpopulations is unclear. The ER stress sensor inositol-requiring enzyme 1α (IRE1α) is activated in the adipocytes and immune cells under obesity. It is unknown whether targeting IRE1α is capable of reversing insulin resistance and obesity and modulating the metabolically activated ATMs. We report that pharmacological inhibition of IRE1α RNase significantly ameliorates insulin resistance and glucose intolerance in male mice with diet-induced obesity. IRE1α inhibition also increases thermogenesis and energy expenditure, and hence protects against high fat diet-induced obesity. Our study shows that the ‘M1-like’ CD11c<sup>+</sup> ATMs are largely overlapping with but yet non-identical to CD9<sup>+</sup> ATMs in obese white adipose tissue. Notably, IRE1α inhibition diminishes the accumulation of obesity-induced metabolically activated ATMs and ‘M1-like’ ATMs, resulting in the curtailment of adipose inflammation and ensuing reactivation of thermogenesis, without augmentation of the alternatively activated M2 macrophage population. Our findings suggest the potential of targeting IRE1α for the therapeutic treatment of insulin resistance and obesity.

                The question as to whether animals taste cholesterol taste is not resolved. This study investigates whether the fruit fly, <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>, is capable of detecting cholesterol through their gustatory system. We found that flies are indifferent to low levels of cholesterol and avoid higher levels. The avoidance is mediated by gustatory receptor neurons (GRNs), demonstrating that flies can taste cholesterol. The cholesterol-responsive GRNs comprise a subset that also responds to bitter substances. Cholesterol detection depends on five ionotropic receptor (IR) family members, and disrupting any of these genes impairs the flies' ability to avoid cholesterol. Ectopic expressions of these IRs in GRNs reveals two classes of cholesterol receptors, each with three shared IRs and one unique subunit. Additionally, expressing cholesterol receptors in sugar-responsive GRNs confers attraction to cholesterol. This study reveals that flies can taste cholesterol, and that the detection depends on IRs in GRNs.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/106228">Kinetic regulation of kinesin’s two motor domains coordinates its stepping along microtubules</a></h4>

              
                The two identical motor domains (heads) of dimeric kinesin-1 move in a hand-over-hand process along a microtubule, coordinating their ATPase cycles such that each ATP hydrolysis is tightly coupled to a step and enabling the motor to take many steps without dissociating. The neck linker, a structural element that connects the two heads, has been shown to be essential for head–head coordination; however, which kinetic step(s) in the chemomechanical cycle is ‘gated’ by the neck linker remains unresolved. Here, we employed pre-steady-state kinetics and single-molecule assays to investigate how the neck-linker conformation affects kinesin’s motility cycle. We show that the backward-pointing configuration of the neck linker in the front kinesin head confers higher affinity for microtubule, but does not change ATP binding and dissociation rates. In contrast, the forward-pointing configuration of the neck linker in the rear kinesin head decreases the ATP dissociation rate but has little effect on microtubule dissociation. In combination, these conformation-specific effects of the neck linker favor ATP hydrolysis and dissociation of the rear head prior to microtubule detachment of the front head, thereby providing a kinetic explanation for the coordinated walking mechanism of dimeric kinesin.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93496">Apical constriction requires patterned apical surface remodeling to synchronize cellular deformation</a></h4>

              
                Apical constriction is a basic mechanism for epithelial morphogenesis, making columnar cells into wedge shape and bending a flat cell sheet. It has long been thought that an apically localized myosin generates a contractile force and drives the cell deformation. However, when we tested the increased apical surface contractility in a cellular Potts model simulation, the constriction increased pressure inside the cell and pushed its lateral surface outward, making the cells adopt a drop shape instead of the expected wedge shape. To keep the lateral surface straight, we considered an alternative model in which the cell shape was determined by cell membrane elasticity and endocytosis, and the increased pressure is balanced among the cells. The cellular Potts model simulation succeeded in reproducing the apical constriction, and it also suggested that a too strong apical surface tension might prevent the tissue invagination.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101780">A general framework for characterizing optimal communication in brain networks</a></h4>

              
                Efficient communication in brain networks is foundational for cognitive function and behavior. However, how communication efficiency is defined depends on the assumed model of signaling dynamics, e.g., shortest path signaling, random walker navigation, broadcasting, and diffusive processes. Thus, a general and model-agnostic framework for characterizing optimal neural communication is needed. We address this challenge by assigning communication efficiency through a virtual multi-site lesioning regime combined with game theory, applied to large-scale models of human brain dynamics. Our framework quantifies the exact influence each node exerts over every other, generating optimal influence maps given the underlying model of neural dynamics. These descriptions reveal how communication patterns unfold if regions are set to maximize their influence over one another. Comparing these maps with a variety of brain communication models showed that optimal communication closely resembles a broadcasting regime in which regions leverage multiple parallel channels for information dissemination. Moreover, we found that the brain’s most influential regions are its rich-club, exploiting their topological vantage point by broadcasting across numerous pathways that enhance their reach even if the underlying connections are weak. Altogether, our work provides a rigorous and versatile framework for characterizing optimal brain communication, and uncovers the most influential brain regions, and the topological features underlying their influence.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/83865">Modulation of brain signal variability in visual cortex reflects aging, GABA, and behavior</a></h4>

              
                Moment-to-moment neural variability has been shown to scale positively with the complexity of stimulus input. However, the mechanisms underlying the ability to align variability to input complexity are unknown. Using a combination of behavioral methods, computational modeling, fMRI, MR spectroscopy, and pharmacological intervention, we investigated the role of aging and GABA in neural variability during visual processing. We replicated previous findings that participants expressed higher variability when viewing more complex visual stimuli. Additionally, we found that such variability modulation was associated with higher baseline visual GABA levels and was reduced in older adults. When pharmacologically increasing GABA activity, we found that participants with lower baseline GABA levels showed a drug-related increase in variability modulation while participants with higher baseline GABA showed no change or even a reduction, consistent with an inverted-U account. Finally, higher baseline GABA and variability modulation were jointly associated with better visual-discrimination performance. These results suggest that GABA plays an important role in how humans utilize neural variability to adapt to the complexity of the visual world.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94578">Shaping the physical world to our ends through the left PF technical-cognition area</a></h4>

              
                Our propensity to materiality, which consists in using, making, creating, and passing on technologies, has enabled us to shape the physical world according to our ends. To explain this proclivity, scientists have calibrated their lens to either low-level skills such as motor cognition or high-level skills such as language or social cognition. Yet, little has been said about the intermediate-level cognitive processes that are directly involved in mastering this materiality, that is, technical cognition. We aim to focus on this intermediate level for providing new insights into the neurocognitive bases of human materiality. Here, we show that a technical-reasoning process might be specifically at work in physical problem-solving situations. We found via two distinct neuroimaging studies that the area PF (parietal F) within the left parietal lobe is central for this reasoning process in both tool-use and non-tool-use physical problem-solving and can work along with social-cognitive skills to resolve day-to-day interactions that combine social and physical constraints. Our results demonstrate the existence of a specific cognitive module in the human brain dedicated to materiality, which might be the supporting pillar allowing the accumulation of technical knowledge over generations. Intensifying research on technical cognition could nurture a comprehensive framework that has been missing in fields interested in how early and modern humans have been interacting with the physical world through technology, and how this interaction has shaped our history and culture.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93921">Combinatorial CRISPR screen reveals FYN and KDM4 as targets for synergistic drug combination for treating triple negative breast cancer</a></h4>

              
                Tyrosine kinases play a crucial role in cell proliferation and survival and are extensively investigated as targets for cancer treatment. However, the efficacy of most tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in cancer therapy is limited due to resistance. In this study, we identify a synergistic combination therapy involving TKIs for the treatment of triple negative breast cancer. By employing pairwise tyrosine kinase knockout CRISPR screens, we identify <i>FYN</i> and <i>KDM4</i> as critical targets whose inhibition enhances the effectiveness of TKIs, such as NVP-ADW742 (IGF-1R inhibitor), gefitinib (EGFR inhibitor), and imatinib (ABL inhibitor) both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, treatment with TKIs upregulates the transcription of <i>KDM4</i>, which in turn demethylates H3K9me3 at <i>FYN</i> enhancer for <i>FYN</i> transcription. This compensatory activation of <i>FYN</i> and <i>KDM4</i> contributes to the resistance against TKIs. <i>FYN</i> expression is associated with therapy resistance and persistence by demonstrating its upregulation in various experimental models of drug-tolerant persisters and residual disease following targeted therapy, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. Collectively, our study provides novel targets and mechanistic insights that can guide the development of effective combinatorial targeted therapies, thus maximizing the therapeutic benefits of TKIs.
