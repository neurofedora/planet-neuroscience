              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04749">Bridging Brains and Models: MoE-Based Functional Lesions for Simulating and Rehabilitating Aphasia</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2508.04749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The striking alignment between large language models (LLMs) and human brain activity positions them as powerful models of healthy cognition. This parallel raises a fundamental question: if LLMs can model the intact brain, can we lesion them to simulate the linguistic deficits of the injured brain? In this work, we introduce a methodology to model aphasia - a complex language disorder caused by neural injury - by selectively disabling components in a modular Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) language model. We simulate distinct aphasia subtypes, validate their linguistic outputs against real patient speech, and then investigate functional recovery by retraining the model's remaining healthy experts. Our results demonstrate that lesioning functionally-specialized experts for syntax or semantics induces distinct impairments that closely resemble Broca's and Wernicke's aphasia, respectively. Crucially, we show that freezing the damaged experts and retraining the intact ones on conversational data restores significant linguistic function, demonstrating a computational analogue for rehabilitation. These findings establish modular LLMs as a powerful and clinically-relevant potential framework for modeling the mechanisms of language disorders and for computationally exploring novel pathways for therapy.

                arXiv:2508.04824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Re-entry of travelling excitation loops is a long-suspected driver of human seizures, yet how such loops arise in patient brain networks -- and how susceptible they are to targeted disruption -- remains unclear. We reconstruct a millimetre-scale virtual brain from diffusion MRI of a drug-resistant epilepsy patient, embed excitable Epileptor neural fields, and show that realistic cortico-cortical delays are sufficient to generate self-sustaining re-entry. Systematic parameter sweeps reveal a narrow delay-coupling window that predicts oscillation frequency and seizure duration across 184 recorded seizures. Precisely timed biphasic stimuli or sub-millimetre virtual lesions abort re-entry in silico, yielding phase-dependent termination rules validated in intracranial recordings. Our framework exposes delay-constrained re-entry as a generic dynamical mechanism for large-scale brain synchrony and provides a patient-specific testbed for precision neuromodulation and minimally invasive disconnection.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05288">Covariance spectrum in nonlinear recurrent neural networks</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2508.05288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advances in simultaneous recordings of large numbers of neurons have driven significant interest in the structure of neural population activity such as dimension. A key question is how these dynamic features arise mechanistically and their relationship to circuit connectivity. It was previously proposed to use the covariance eigenvalue distribution, or spectrum, which can be analytically derived in random recurrent networks, as a robust measure to describe the shape of neural population activity beyond the dimension (Hu and Sompolinsky 2022). Applications of the theoretical spectrum have broadly found accurate matches to experimental data across brain areas providing mechanistic insights into the observed low dimensional population dynamics (Morales et al. 2023). However, the empirical success highlights a gap in theory, as the neural network model used to derive the spectrum was minimal with linear neurons. In this work, we aim to close this gap by studying the covariance spectrum in networks with nonlinear neurons and under broader dynamical regimes including chaos. Surprisingly, we found that the spectrum can be precisely understood by equations analogous to the linear theory substituted with an effective recurrent connection strength parameter, that reflects both the connection weights and the nonlinearity of neurons. Across dynamical regimes, this effective connection strength provides a unified interpretation for the spectrum and dimension changes, and stays near the critical value in the chaotic regime without fine-tuning. These results further our understanding of nonlinear neural population dynamics and provide additional theoretical support for applying the covariance spectrum analysis in biological circuits.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04983">Kinetic energy in random recurrent neural networks</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2508.04983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The relationship between unstable fixed points and chaotic dynamics in high-dimensional neural dynamics remains elusive. In this work, we investigate the kinetic energy distribution of random recurrent neural networks by combining dynamical mean-field theory with extensive numerical simulations. We find that the average kinetic energy shifts continuously from zero to a positive value at a critical value of coupling variance (synaptic gain), with a power-law behavior close to the critical point. The steady-state activity distribution is further calculated by the theory and compared with simulations on finite-size systems. This study provides a first step toward understanding the landscape of kinetic energy, which may reflect the structure of phase space for the non-equilibrium dynamics.

                arXiv:2409.14566v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a scalar reduction method beyond weak perturbations for forced or coupled systems to determine the existence and stability of $n{:}m$ phase-locked states. We consider various biologically relevant oscillators including the nonradial isochron clock and thalamic neural oscillators. The proposed scalar reduction successfully captures the emergence and disappearance of phase-locked states as a function of coupling strength and heterogeneity. We find that even small amounts of heterogeneity (often orders of magnitude smaller than the coupling strength) can significantly alter phase-locked states. The proposed method is a straightforward means to both reduce and analyze potentially high-dimensional systems of coupled oscillators in more biologically realistic settings.

                arXiv:2508.05341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose the first fractal frequency mapping, which in a simple form enables to replicate complex neuronal effects. Unlike the conventional filters, which suppress or amplify the input spectral components according to the filter weights, the transformation excites novel components by a fractal recomposition of the input spectra resulting in a formation of spikes at resonant frequencies that are optimal for sampling. This enables high sensitivity detection, robustness to noise and noise-induced signal amplification. The proposed model illustrates that a neuronal functionality can be viewed as a linear summation of spectrum over nonlinearly transformed frequency domain.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04799">Optimality Principles and Neural Ordinary Differential Equations-based Process Modeling for Distributed Control</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2508.04799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most recent advances in machine learning and analytics for process control pose the question of how to naturally integrate new data-driven methods with classical process models and control. We propose a process modeling framework enabling integration of data-driven algorithms through consistent topological properties and conservation of extensive quantities. Interconnections among process network units are represented through connectivity matrices and network graphs. We derive the system's natural objective function equivalent to the non-equilibrium entropy production in a steady state system as a driving force for the process dynamics. We illustrate how distributed control and optimization can be implemented into process network structures and how control laws and algorithms alter the system's natural equilibrium towards engineered objectives. The basic requirement is that the flow conditions can be expressed in terms of conic sector (passivity) conditions. Our formalism allows integration of fundamental conservation properties from topology with learned dynamic relations from data through sparse deep neural networks.
  We demonstrate in a practical example of a simple inventory control system how to integrate the basic topology of a process with a neural network ordinary differential equation model. The system specific constitutive equations are left undescribed and learned by the neural ordinary differential equation algorithm using the adjoint method in combination with an adaptive ODE solver from synthetic time-series data. The resulting neural network forms a state space model for use in e.g. a model predictive control algorithm.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04828">Modelling the emergence of open-ended technological evolution</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2508.04828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Humans stand alone in terms of their potential to collectively and cumulatively improve technologies in an open-ended manner. This open-endedness provides societies with the ability to continually expand their resources and to increase their capacity to store, transmit and process information at a collective-level. Here, we propose that the production of resources arises from the interaction between technological systems (a society's repertoire of interdependent skills, techniques and artifacts) and search spaces (the aggregate collection of needs, problems and goals within a society). Starting from this premise we develop a macro-level model wherein both technological systems and search spaces are subject to cultural evolutionary dynamics. By manipulating the extent to which these dynamics are characterised by stochastic or selection-like processes, we demonstrate that open-ended growth is extremely rare, historically contingent and only possible when technological systems and search spaces co-evolve. Here, stochastic factors must be strong enough to continually perturb the dynamics into a far-from-equilibrium state, whereas selection-like factors help maintain effectiveness and ensure the sustained production of resources. Only when this co-evolutionary dynamic maintains effective technological systems, supports the ongoing expansion of the search space and leads to an increased provision of resources do we observe open-ended technological evolution.

Abstract: Forecasting stock and cryptocurrency prices is challenging due to high volatility and non-stationarity, influenced by factors like economic changes and market sentiment. Previous research shows that Echo State Networks (ESNs) can effectively model short-term stock market movements, capturing nonlinear patterns in dynamic data. To the best of our knowledge, this work is among the first to explore ESNs for cryptocurrency forecasting, especially during extreme volatility. We also conduct chaos analysis through the Lyapunov exponent in chaotic periods and show that our approach outperforms existing machine learning methods by a significant margin. Our findings are consistent with the Lyapunov exponent analysis, showing that ESNs are robust during chaotic periods and excel under high chaos compared to Boosting and Na\"ive methods.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05433">Discovering Interpretable Programmatic Policies via Multimodal LLM-assisted Evolutionary Search</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2508.05433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interpretability and high performance are essential goals in designing control policies, particularly for safety-critical tasks. Deep reinforcement learning has greatly enhanced performance, yet its inherent lack of interpretability often undermines trust and hinders real-world deployment. This work addresses these dual challenges by introducing a novel approach for programmatic policy discovery, called Multimodal Large Language Model-assisted Evolutionary Search (MLES). MLES utilizes multimodal large language models as policy generators, combining them with evolutionary mechanisms for automatic policy optimization. It integrates visual feedback-driven behavior analysis within the policy generation process to identify failure patterns and facilitate targeted improvements, enhancing the efficiency of policy discovery and producing adaptable, human-aligned policies. Experimental results show that MLES achieves policy discovery capabilities and efficiency comparable to Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) across two control tasks, while offering transparent control logic and traceable design processes. This paradigm overcomes the limitations of predefined domain-specific languages, facilitates knowledge transfer and reuse, and is scalable across various control tasks. MLES shows promise as a leading approach for the next generation of interpretable control policy discovery.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05616">TrajEvo: Trajectory Prediction Heuristics Design via LLM-driven Evolution</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2508.05616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Trajectory prediction is a critical task in modeling human behavior, especially in safety-critical domains such as social robotics and autonomous vehicle navigation. Traditional heuristics based on handcrafted rules often lack accuracy and generalizability. Although deep learning approaches offer improved performance, they typically suffer from high computational cost, limited explainability, and, importantly, poor generalization to out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. In this paper, we introduce TrajEvo, a framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically design trajectory prediction heuristics. TrajEvo employs an evolutionary algorithm to generate and refine prediction heuristics from past trajectory data. We propose two key innovations: Cross-Generation Elite Sampling to encourage population diversity, and a Statistics Feedback Loop that enables the LLM to analyze and improve alternative predictions. Our evaluations demonstrate that TrajEvo outperforms existing heuristic methods across multiple real-world datasets, and notably surpasses both heuristic and deep learning methods in generalizing to an unseen OOD real-world dataset. TrajEvo marks a promising step toward the automated design of fast, explainable, and generalizable trajectory prediction heuristics. We release our source code to facilitate future research at https://github.com/ai4co/trajevo.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08057">Vector Quantized-Elites: Unsupervised and Problem-Agnostic Quality-Diversity Optimization</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2504.08057v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quality-Diversity algorithms have transformed optimization by prioritizing the discovery of diverse, high-performing solutions over a single optimal result. However, traditional Quality-Diversity methods, such as MAP-Elites, rely heavily on predefined behavior descriptors and complete prior knowledge of the task to define the behavior space grid, limiting their flexibility and applicability. In this work, we introduce Vector Quantized-Elites (VQ-Elites), a novel Quality-Diversity algorithm that autonomously constructs a structured behavior space grid using unsupervised learning, eliminating the need for prior task-specific knowledge. At the core of VQ-Elites is the integration of Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoders, which enables the dynamic learning of behavior descriptors and the generation of a structured, rather than unstructured, behavior space grid -- a significant advancement over existing unsupervised Quality-Diversity approaches. This design establishes VQ-Elites as a flexible, robust, and task-agnostic optimization framework. To further enhance the performance of unsupervised Quality-Diversity algorithms, we introduce behavior space bounding and cooperation mechanisms, which significantly improve convergence and performance, as well as the Effective Diversity Ratio and Coverage Diversity Score, two novel metrics that quantify the actual diversity in the unsupervised setting. We validate VQ-Elites on robotic arm pose-reaching, mobile robot space-covering, and MiniGrid exploration tasks. The results demonstrate its ability to efficiently generate diverse, high-quality solutions, emphasizing its adaptability, scalability, robustness to hyperparameters, and potential to extend Quality-Diversity optimization to complex, previously inaccessible domains.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00387">STF: Shallow-Level Temporal Feedback to Enhance Spiking Transformers</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2508.00387v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transformer-based Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) suffer from a great performance gap compared to floating-point \mbox{Artificial} Neural Networks (ANNs) due to the binary nature of spike trains. Recent efforts have introduced deep-level feedback loops to transmit high-level semantic information to narrow this gap. However, these designs often span \mbox{multiple} deep layers, resulting in costly feature transformations, higher parameter overhead, increased energy consumption, and longer inference latency. To address this issue, we propose Shallow-level Temporal Feedback (STF), a lightweight plug-and-play module for the encoding layer, which consists of Temporal-Spatial Position Embedding (TSPE) and Temporal Feedback (TF). Extensive experiments show that STF consistently improves performance across various Transformer-based SNN backbones on static datasets, including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet-1K, under different spike timestep settings. Further analysis reveals that STF enhances the diversity of spike patterns, which is key to performance gain. Moreover, evaluations on adversarial robustness and temporal sensitivity confirm that STF outperforms direct coding and its variants, highlighting its potential as a new spike encoding scheme for static scenarios. Our code will be released upon acceptance.

                arXiv:2202.02964v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC) is a promising bio-inspired learning paradigm for its advantage of balancing performance and efficiency and has been increasingly applied to the bio-medical domain. In bio-medical applications, trustworthiness such as replicability and verifiability of the trained learning models is crucial. In this work, we introduce HDCoin, the first proof-of-useful-work blockchain framework for HDC. With HDCoin, we transform the conventional energy-wasteful mining process into a competitive process for developing high accuracy, trustworthy and verifiable hyperdimensional models. We explore four diverse biomedical datasets, and conduct an extensive design-space exploration of key HDC hyperparameters of blockchain miners such as dimensionality, learning rate, and retraining iterations for model performance, adaptive mining difficulty and fairness on proof-of-useful-work.

                arXiv:2506.06790v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is a prominent variational algorithm used for solving combinatorial optimization problems such as the Max-Cut problem. A key challenge in QAOA lies in efficiently identifying suitable parameters (gamma, beta) that lead to high-quality solutions. In this paper, we propose a framework that combines Fully Informed Particle Swarm Optimization (FIPSO) with adaptive gradient correction using the Adam Optimizer to navigate the QAOA parameter space. This approach aims to avoid issues such as barren plateaus and convergence to local minima. The proposed algorithm is evaluated against two classes of graph instances, Erdos Renyi and Watts-Strogatz. Experimental results across multiple QAOA depths consistently demonstrate superior performance compared to random initialization, underscoring the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed optimization framework.

                arXiv:2508.04610v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the brain's hierarchical processing and energy efficiency, this paper presents a Spiking Neural Network (SNN) architecture for lifelong Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS). The proposed system first employs an efficient static SNN to identify potential intrusions, which then activates an adaptive dynamic SNN responsible for classifying the specific attack type. Mimicking biological adaptation, the dynamic classifier utilizes Grow When Required (GWR)-inspired structural plasticity and a novel Adaptive Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity (Ad-STDP) learning rule. These bio-plausible mechanisms enable the network to learn new threats incrementally while preserving existing knowledge. Tested on the UNSW-NB15 benchmark in a continual learning setting, the architecture demonstrates robust adaptation, reduced catastrophic forgetting, and achieves $85.3$\% overall accuracy. Furthermore, simulations using the Intel Lava framework confirm high operational sparsity, highlighting the potential for low-power deployment on neuromorphic hardware.

                <p>Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a bacterial endotoxin that induces innate immune responses. The present study aimed to elucidate alterations in cerebral cortical surface morphology induced by neonatal exposure to LPS using gyrencephalic ferrets. Male ferret pups received a subcutaneous injection of LPS (500&nbsp;&micro;g/g of body weight) on Postnatal Day (P)6 and P7. Furthermore, EdU and BrdU were administered on P5 and P7, respectively, to label postproliferative and proliferating cells that were exposed to LPS in the late stage of cortical neurogenesis. On P20 when the primary sulci and gyri had formed, MRI-based morphometry revealed an anterior shift in sulcal infolding in the medial and dorsolateral cortices of LPS-exposed ferrets. Immunofluorescence analysis showed that LPS increased the density of BrdU-labeled cells and reduced their apoptosis, as indicated by cleaved caspase-3 (cCasp3) immunostaining, in the outer stratum of the lateral sulcus located on the parietal association cortex. Furthermore, cCasp3 immunostaining of EdU-labeled cells was enhanced in the presylvian and lateral sulci located in the prefrontal and parietal association cortices, respectively, but was reduced in the coronal sulcus and gyrus located on the primary motor cortex in LPS-exposed ferrets. This study is the first to elucidate the effect of bacterial components on cerebral cortical sulcogyrogenesis, which is involved in the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental disorders. Such altered sulcal topology may be attributed to a region-related effect on cortical neuron apoptosis in the medial and dorsolateral cortices caused by neonatal LPS exposure.</p>

Epigenetic mechanisms play a crucial role in driving transcript expression and shaping the phenotypic plasticity of glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs), contributing to tumor heterogeneity and therapeutic resistance. These mechanisms dynamically regulate the expression of key oncogenic and stemness-associated genes, enabling GSCs to adapt to environmental cues and evade targeted therapies. Importantly, epigenetic reprogramming allows GSCs to transition between cellular states, including therapy-resistant mesenchymal-like phenotypes, underscoring the need for epigenetic-targeting strategies to disrupt these adaptive processes. Understanding these epigenetic drivers of gene expression provides a foundation for novel therapeutic interventions aimed at eradicating GSCs and improving glioblastoma outcomes. Using machine learning (ML), we employ cross-patient prediction of transcript expression in GSCs by combining epigenetic features from various sources, including ATAC-seq, CTCF ChIP-seq, RNAPII ChIP-seq, H3K27Ac ChIP-seq, and RNA-seq. We investigate different ML and deep learning (DL) models for this task and ultimately build our final pipeline using XGBoost. The model trained on one patient generalizes to other 11 patients with high performance. Notably, H3K27Ac alone from a single patient is sufficient to predict gene expression in all 11 patients. Furthermore, the distribution of H3K27Ac peaks across the genomes of all patients is remarkably similar. These findings suggest that GSCs share a common distributional pattern of enhancer activity characterized by H3K27Ac, which can be utilized to predict gene expression in GSCs across patients. In summary, while GSCs are known for their transcriptomic and phenotypic heterogeneity, we propose that they share a common epigenetic pattern of enhancer activation that defines their underlying transcriptomic expression pattern. This pattern can predict gene expression across patient samples, providing valuable insights into the biology of GSCs.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3003312">An arginine switch drives the stepwise activation of β-arrestin by CXCR7</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jeong Seok Ji, Yaejin Yun, Tomasz Maciej Stepniewski, Hye-Jin Yoon, Kyungjin Min, Ji Young Park, Chiwoon Chung, Miguel Dieguez Eceolaza, Ka Young Chung, Jana Selent, Hyung Ho Lee</p>

β-arrestins (βarrs) play a crucial role in regulating G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling and trafficking. Canonically, interactions of βarr with the phosphorylated intracellular GPCR-tail induce a multi-step conformational transition that results in the activation of βarr. Depending on the specific interaction pattern with the receptor, βarrs adopt multiple conformational states, each tightly linked to a specific functional outcome of βarr recruitment. Despite its physiological relevance, the structural determinants of βarr activation remain poorly understood. Using a combination of molecular dynamics simulations, biochemical and cell-based experiments, we reveal how specific interactions with a chemokine receptor 7 (CXCR7) promote the unbinding of the βarr2 C-tail—a crucial step in arrestin activation. Importantly, we observe that the expulsion of the C-tail is promoted by the displacement of a conserved arginine residue (Arg394) within the βarr polar core, which we dub “the arginine switch.” Our study uncovers a role for the arginine switch that, upon engagement, destabilizes the polar core as a crucial step in the CXCR7-induced βarr activation.

                <p>by Aster Q. Perkins, Erin L. Rich</p>

Economic decisions often require weighing multiple dimensions, or attributes. The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is thought to be important for computing the integrated value of an option from its attributes and comparing values to make a choice. Although OFC neurons are known to encode integrated values, evidence for value comparison has been limited. Here, we used a multi-attribute choice task for monkeys (<i>Macaca mulatta</i>) to investigate how OFC neurons integrate and compare multi-attribute options. By representing attributes with separate cues and using eye tracking to measure attention, we demonstrate that OFC neurons encode the value of attended attributes independent of other attributes in the same option. Encoding was negatively weighted by the value of the matching attribute in the other option, consistent with a comparison between like attributes. These results indicate that OFC computes comparisons between attributes rather than integrated values, and does so dynamically, shifting with the focus of attention.

                <p>by Claudio Basile, Marzio Gerbella, Alfonso Gravante, Amelia Lapadula, Francesca Rodà, Luciano Simone, Leonardo Fogassi, Stefano Rozzi</p>

The lateral prefrontal cortex has been classically defined as an associative region involved in the so-called executive functions, such as guiding behavior based on abstract rules and mnemonic information. However, most neurophysiological studies on monkeys did not address the issue of whether distinct anatomical sectors of lateral prefrontal cortex play different functional roles. The main aim of this work is to study functional properties of neurons recorded from a large part of ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPF) of two monkeys performing passive visual tasks and a visuo-motor task, and to map them on the anatomical areas defined on the basis of our recent parcellations. Our results show that some functional features are broadly distributed within VLPF, while others characterize specific areas. In particular, the temporal structuring of events and the general behavioral rule appear to be coded in all recorded areas, while each area differently contributes to the encoding of visual features and to the exploitation of contextual information for guiding behavior. Caudal VLPF areas, and especially caudal 12r, are characterized by a strong coding of visual information, both when passively presented or exploited for guiding behavior, while middle VLPF areas, and especially middle 46v, are rather more involved in the processing of contextual information for action organization. In this latter sector, visual stimuli/instructions appear to be encoded in a pragmatic format, that is, in terms of the associated behavioral outcome. Finally, area 45A and more anterior VLPF areas are characterized by a generally lower responsiveness to the employed tasks. Altogether, our findings indicate that caudal VLPF areas represent the first processing stage of visual input while middle VLPF areas primarily contribute to the selection and planning of contextually appropriate behaviors.

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>If a map-like representation in the brain originates within a distributed network of brain regions, then this network should be underpinned by white-matter pathways. To test this, we had 83 young adults learn 15 virtual environments through free exploration, followed by tests of their allocentric and non-allocentric representation of these environments. Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) - based tractography was used to extract the main white matter tracts in the brain, including the inferior and middle longitudinal fasciculus, the main connections between the temporal lobe and the visual cortices, as well as the fornix, the main output pathway from the hippocampus to the cortex. Higher microstructural integrity in the inferior and middle longitudinal fasciculus and fornix, as indexed by higher FA, was associated with a more accurate scale, rotation, and translation-invariant allocentric representation of the objects' positional pattern. These findings show that properties of white matter fiber pathways that link visual cortices to the temporal lobe and the temporal lobe to other parts of the brain underpin a person's ability to form successful map-like representations.</p>

                Transcranial electrical stimulation (tES) encompasses non-invasive neuromodulation techniques, such as transcranial direct and alternating current stimulation, which modulate the central nervous system to probe causal links between the brain and behavior and treat disorders. Unfortunately, fixed stimulation paradigms induce variable effects due to intra- and interindividual factors. Consequently, personalized approaches to tES are increasingly used. In this review, we highlight this emerging domain of human brain stimulation, examining strategies for the personalization of stimulation parameters and their underlying rationales. Multiparameter personalization and the identification of markers indicating tES efficacy represent promising directions. Personalization is not a panacea for all the challenges of tES, but marks an essential step toward reducing the variability of this technique.

                Li et al. perform multi-omics comparative analyses in subterranean mammals and identify convergent genomic signatures associated with adaptation to underground life, while their gut microbiomes show no structural or functional convergence. These findings suggest that host genome convergence, rather than microbiome convergence, underlies adaptation to subterranean environments across subterranean mammals.

                Imanishi et al. employ murine models of type 2 skin inflammation to uncover a key basophil-fibroblast pro-inflammatory feedforward loop driving pathology. Through single-cell and spatial transcriptomics (MERFISH) and in vivo validation, the authors demonstrate that disrupting fibroblast IL-4/13 and OSM signaling synergistically reduces skin inflammation and immune recruitment.

The derivative of the linear relationship between lipolytic flux and lipid droplet surface area is called lipolytic efficiency, which is equivalent to the lipase activity.

Here, the authors use in situ high-resolution mass spectrometry and accompanying techniques to identify reaction intermediates and bring about more granular detail of the reaction.

                <p>Nature Physics, Published online: 07 August 2025; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41567-025-02962-1">doi:10.1038/s41567-025-02962-1</a></p>Electron hopping on geometrically frustrated lattices leads to unusual, correlated phenomena, but materials whose structures match such lattices are rare. Now, in Pd5AlI2, frustrated electron motion is shown to emerge from the atomic orbital configuration, rather than the lattice geometry — which means the search space for unusual electronic structures and correlated behaviour can be broadened to materials with simpler, more common structures.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100961">Molecular and mechanical signatures contributing to mouse epidermal differentiation and barrier formation</a></h4>

              
                Formation of the skin barrier requires rapid proliferation coupled with differentiation and stratification of the embryonic epidermis. Basal progenitors give rise to progeny throughout development – first to intermediate cells, a transient proliferative suprabasal cell population, and later to spinous cells. Neither the function nor the differentiation trajectory of intermediate cells has been documented. We generated transcriptomes of intermediate and spinous cells and identified specific markers that distinguish these two populations. Further, we found that intermediate cells express a subset of genes in common with granular cells of the epidermis – the terminal living cell type that helps establish the barrier. Lineage tracing revealed that most intermediate cells directly transition to granular cells without expressing markers specific to spinous cells, thus revealing a distinct lineage pathway leading to granular fate. In addition to their transcriptional similarities, intermediate and granular cells both had hallmarks of increased actomyosin contractility. We found that rather than simply lying downstream of cell fate pathways, contractility was sufficient to suppress spinous fate and promote granular gene expression. Together, these data establish the molecular and mechanical characteristics of the developing epidermis that allow this tissue to rapidly develop barrier activity.

                <i>Salmonella</i> is one of the most common foodborne pathogens, resulting in inflammatory gastroenteritis and frequently accompanied by dysbiosis. Gut commensals, such as <i>Lactobacillus</i> species, have been proven to exhibit broad antibacterial activities and protect hosts against pathogenic infections. Here, <i>Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus</i> strain P118, screened from 290 isolates recovered from fermented yogurts and healthy piglet intestines using traditional and <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>-infection screening strategies, exerts great probiotic properties. Notably, P118 and its supernatant exhibited great antibacterial activities and attenuated <i>C. elegans</i> susceptibility to <i>Salmonella</i> infection. We found that P118 protected mice against <i>Salmonella</i> lethal infections by enhancing colonization resistance, reducing pathogen invasion, alleviating intestinal pro-inflammatory response, and improving microbial dysbiosis and fecal metabolite changes. Microbiota and fecal metabolome analyses suggested P118 administration significantly decreased the relative abundances of potentially harmful microbes (e.g., <i>Salmonella</i>, <i>Anaeroplasma</i>, <i>Klebsiella</i>) and increased the fecal levels of tryptophan and its derivatives (indole, indole-3-acrylic acid, 5-hydroxytryptophan, 5-methoxyindoleacetate). Deterministic processes determined the gut microbial community assembly of P118-pretreated mice. Integrated omics further demonstrated that P118 probiotic activities in enhancing host tolerance to <i>Salmonella</i> infection were mediated by microbe-derived tryptophan/indole metabolites (e.g., indole-3-acrylic acid, indole, tryptophan, 5-methoxyindoleacetic acid, and 5-hydroxytryptophan). Collective results demonstrate that <i>L. rhamnosus</i> P118 could enhance host tolerance to <i>Salmonella</i> infections via various pathways, including direct antibacterial actions, inhibiting <i>Salmonella</i> colonization and invasion, attenuating pro-inflammatory responses of intestinal macrophages, and modulating gut microbiota mediated by microbe-derived indole metabolites.

">Cocaine use disorder is associated with lower brain state transition energy particularly in higher order and excitatory networks</a></h4>

              
                Cocaine use disorder (CUD) detrimentally impacts personal health, social relationships, and economic opportunity. Here, we assess CUD-associated shifts in brain dynamics using Network Control Theory and examine how they align with previously identified changes in neurological systems and behavioral profiles of people with CUD. The SUDMEX CONN dataset consists of multi-modal MRI, cocaine use metrics, behavioral measures, and demographics of individuals with CUD (N=132, 71 CUD). We identified recurring brain activity states and used NCT to calculate the transition energy (TE) between pairs of states. ANCOVAs examined global and regional TE associations with drug use group (CUD vs controls (NC)), years of CUD, and risk-taking behaviors. We identified potential mechanisms driving the differences by correlating CUD-related regional TE effects with neurotransmitter/receptor systems. People with CUD had significantly lower global TE and default mode, dorsal attention and limbic network TE compared to non-user controls, particularly in regions enriched for noradrenaline and mu opioid receptors. Longer duration of CUD was associated with more decreased global TE, top-down TE, default mode, control and ventral attention network TE, and regional TE enriched for excitatory neurotransmitters and receptors. People with CUD needed to expend more global and top-down TE to perform better on a risk-taking task (the Iowa Gambling task), an effect which was not found in NCs. Our analysis of whole-brain activity dynamics provides a link between the effects of upstream glutamatergic excitotoxicity and/or opioid receptor dysfunction, and downstream weakening of inhibitory control that is central to CUD.

">Drift-like dynamics and information flow across the cortical hierarchy during working memory</a></h4>

              
                Working memory is supported by widespread and distributed brain regions spanning across the cortical hierarchy. However, how working memory content evolves and is transmitted across cortical regions remains largely unknown. Here, we investigated the flow of working memory information across the cortex using time-resolved fMRI decoding. Across multiple regions in visual and parietal cortex, we found that decoded working memory content drifted over time from the memoranda towards the later errors in memory reports, consistent with drift-like dynamics predicted by attractor models. These behaviorally predictive neural memory errors emerged earliest in higher-order dorsal visual area (V3AB) and intraparietal sulcus (IPS0), and then later in early visual cortex (V1), suggesting a propagation of mnemonic information originated in higher-level visual area. Inter-areal correlation analyses revealed that during memory maintenance, information flowed predominantly in a top-down manner, from higher to lower visual areas whereas during passive viewing feedforward dynamics prevailed. Together, our findings demonstrate that working memory maintenance involves temporally structured drift dynamics and feedback-dominated information flow across cortical hierarchy, providing a mechanistic link between neural population dynamics and the formation of memory errors.

">Neural Oscillations Coordinate Continuous Error Correction During Force Control</a></h4>

              
                Effective motor control depends on the brain's ability to monitor performance and make continuous corrections. While many studies focus on discrete errors, everyday actions often require ongoing feedback-based adjustments. Here, we used an isometric force control task with EEG to investigate the neural dynamics supporting real-time error correction. Participants maintained a constant grip force with or without continuous visual feedback. With feedback, behavior showed ~6 Hz rhythmic fluctuations, consistent with active correction. These fluctuations were mirrored in EEG activity across theta, beta, and alpha bands, oscillations linked to performance monitoring, updating, and attentional control. Without feedback, performance decayed linearly, and the corresponding neural signatures were reduced. These findings suggest that continuous sensory feedback engages a dynamic feedback loop involving distinct neural processes that support adaptive behavior. Our results highlight the importance of oscillatory activity in tracking and correcting moment-to-moment fluctuations in force, offering insight into the neural basis of feedback-loop force control.

">Serotonin shapes the temporal window for associative fear learning</a></h4>

              
                Fear learning is a critical adaptive mechanism that enables the association of an environmental cue (the conditioned stimulus, CS) with a potential threat (the unconditioned stimulus, US), even when these events are temporally discontiguous. When associations are instead formed between unrelated cues and threats, the maladaptive learning process can give rise to neurological disorders. Therefore, maintaining accurate temporal boundaries for forming such associations is crucial for distinguishing real threats from irrelevant stimuli. Despite its importance, the mechanisms defining this precise time window remain poorly understood. Here, we report that serotonin plays a crucial role in modulating the associable interval in trace fear conditioning. Specifically, we show that serotonergic projections from the dorsal raphe nuclei (DRN) to the CA1 region of the ventral hippocampus (vCA1) dynamically regulate the association of discontiguous CS and US. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that sustained serotonin release in the vCA1 maintains the ensemble activity of 5-HT2C receptor-expressing pyramidal neurons, facilitating the association between temporally separated events. In contrast, when the trace interval exceeds the associable window, transient serotonin release fails to drive vCA1 neuronal ensemble activity, thus preventing maladaptive learning. These findings highlight a key role for serotonin in regulating the temporal precision of fear learning and reveal the DRN-vCA1 serotonergic pathway as a potential therapeutic target for related disorders.

">Frontocentral brain networks amplify action-oriented temporal prediction errors</a></h4>

              
                Successful sensorimotor behavior depends on anticipating when a tactile event will occur and translating it into rapid action, yet it remains unclear how action requirements shape temporal prediction in the human cortex. Here, we combined Magnetoencephalography (MEG), multivariate decoding and computational modeling to contrast temporally jittered finger stimulations under passive versus action-oriented conditions. We characterized a distributed frontal sensorimotor network that was linked to fast tactile-motor associations and predicted reaction-time variability. We found that trial-by-trial deviations from expected stimulus timing modulated behavior, with stronger frontocentral prediction-error encoding when an overt response was required. Temporal prediction errors were primarily encoded in a motor rather than sensory reference frame. These results reveal that action demands dynamically amplify temporal error signaling in sensorimotor circuits, in line with predictive coding frameworks postulating that the brain preferentially encodes task-relevant and goal-directed sensory prediction errors.

">Human Beta Oscillations Reflect Magnitude and Fidelity of Priority Shifts in Working Memory.</a></h4>

              
                Flexible prioritisation in working memory (WM) is supported by neural oscillations in frontal and sensory brain areas, but the roles of different oscillations remain poorly understood. Recordings in humans suggest an interplay between prefrontal slow frequency (2-8Hz) and posterior alpha-band (10Hz) oscillations regulating top-down control and retrieval of WM representations, respectively. Complementary work, primarily in non-human primates, suggests an additional role for beta (15-30Hz) oscillations in clearing or inhibiting stimuli from entering WM. Here we investigated the role of neural oscillations in prioritising WM content using electroencephalography (EEG) as participants (humans of any sex) performed a task requiring frequent priority switches between two memorized oriented bars. Behavioral performance revealed switch costs, which scaled with the angular distance between the two items, suggesting that priority shifts are modulated by shift magnitude. Time-frequency analyses revealed increased frontal theta (4-8Hz) and decreased central-parietal beta (15-25Hz) power during switches. Crucially, only beta desynchronization scaled with the magnitude of the priority shift and predicted the fidelity of neural decoding of the newly prioritized item during subsequent recall. Theta power, by contrast, was elevated on switch trials but did not vary with update magnitude or decoding strength, suggesting a more general role in signaling control demands. Our findings highlight a particular and previously overlooked role for beta-band desynchronization in the flexible prioritisation of WM content.

">Neural correlates of individual variability in reward-based motor learning</a></h4>

              
                Individual differences in motor learning are linked to variability in the neural processes associated with feedback processing and motor memory retention. This study investigated the neural correlates of reward-based motor learning and focused on two electrophysiological markers: event-related desynchronization (ERD) in the sensorimotor cortex and feedback-related negativity (FRN) from frontal EEG channels. Sixty-four healthy adults performed a visuomotor rotation task with monetary reward or punishment feedback. Learning amount, defined as the degree of error compensation, and retention amount, defined as the maintenance of adapted motor behavior in a no-vision condition, were quantified. Scalp EEG was recorded to assess alpha (8-13 Hz) and beta (15-30 Hz) ERD over the primary motor cortex (M1) during movement preparation and FRN amplitude following feedback presentation. Stepwise regression revealed that FRN amplitude in the late adaptation phase was associated with learning amount, but only among participants with robust event-related potential (ERP) responses (amplitude > {+/-}5 V). This finding suggests that greater neural sensitivity to feedback supports better learning. In contrast, alpha ERD magnitude in the late adaptation phase, along with reinforcement conditions, was a significant predictor of motor skill retention in the full sample, although no interaction effect was observed. These findings suggest that FRN and alpha ERD reflect dissociable neural mechanisms underlying learning and retention, respectively, with FRN indexing feedback sensitivity and alpha ERD reflecting cortical excitability related to memory consolidation. The absence of interaction effects between neural markers and reinforcement conditions further supports the idea that these processes contribute independently to motor adaptation. Practically, combining reward-based training with interventions that increase M1 excitability may enhance retention, while tailoring feedback strategies to maximize FRN responses may improve learning efficiency. These findings provide novel insights into the neural basis of individual variability in motor learning and suggest avenues for personalized approaches in rehabilitation and skill learning.

">Comparing Robotic and Computer Vision Assessments of Unilateral and Bilateral Reaching in Healthy Adults</a></h4>

              
                Assessment of reaching is foundational to upper limb neurorehabilitation. Current neurorehabilitation needs have increased the demand for quantitative clinical assessments of bilateral coordination. Robotics and computer vision for motion tracking are two means to provide relevant quantitative metrics but have many differences including the dimensionality of reaching movements (planar versus three-dimensional) and data acquisition. We do not know how consistent measures of bilateral coordination performance are between these different assessments. In this study, we examined how one robotic and one computer vision method can identify differences between symmetrical and asymmetrical reaching, and the correlations in movement time, and hand lag between these two approaches. Thirty healthy young adults completed four reaching games using the Kinarm exoskeleton robot and a custom developed augmented reality assessment using computer vision. We found that both approaches were able to detect well-established movement time and hand lag differences between symmetrical and asymmetrical reaching, with the differences between symmetrical and asymmetrical being larger with the computer vision approach. Moderate correlations were found between approaches for unilateral and symmetric reaching in both movement time and hand lags; however, no significant correlations were found between approaches for asymmetric reaching. Our results show that reaching task performance differs between robotic and computer vision-based assessment, however, both approaches provide quantitative metrics of unilateral and bilateral reaching that are consistent with prior research. There are benefits and tradeoffs to each approach, and this study informs how clinicians and researchers can consider the methodological differences when determining which assessment method to use.

">Rapamycin enhances VEGFA and VSMC contractile protein expression in MSCs via mTORC1 inhibition</a></h4>

              
                Introduction Intracranial aneurysm (ICA) rupture is the most common cause of non-traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage, a devastating type of stroke. Vascular smooth muscle (VSMC) and endothelial cell (EC) dysfunction and death play important roles in the etiology of ICA formation, rupture and treatment failure. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been extensively investigated for their therapeutic potential in vascular diseases. The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a key regulatory pathway involved in cellular functions controlling intracellular anabolic and regulatory processes. Rapamycin, a specific mTOR complex 1 inhibitor, is widely used in the clinical management of cardiac and vascular pathologies. In this study, we explored MSCs potential to express VSMC and EC markers under the influence of rapamycin. Methods Human MSCs were treated with rapamycin for 2, 5, and 10 days, and cell death and proliferation determined by MTT analysis. Protein expression and phosphorylation levels were determined by western blot analysis. Calcein AM and PI staining was used to determine cell viability, and morphology. Results MTT and Calcein AM analysis demonstrated that prolonged rapamycin treatment did not affect MSC viability but was found to reduce MSC proliferation and cause a nearly threefold increase in cell size compared to controls. Rapamycin treatment increased expression of the VSMC protein markers, Alpha-SMA, and transgelin and was required to maintain elevated expression levels both proteins. In contrast, selective inhibition of mTORC2 with JR-AB2-01 caused a decrease in Alpha-SMA and trangelin expression, suggesting mTORC1 regulation of Alpha-SMA and transgelin expression, rather than mTORC2. Rapamycin treated MSC were also found to induce cell sprouting between adjacent cells. MSCs were found not to express endothelial protein markers under either basal conditions or following rapamycin treatment. However, rapamycin treatment was found to increase VEGFA expression, a known promoter of angiogenesis. Conclusion Rapamycin has the potential to increase VSMC protein expression in MSCs by its action on mTORC1. The ability of rapamycin to increase VEGFA expression in MSCs could allow for a novel MSC-based therapeutic intervention in cerebral aneurysm management which could aid in ICA healing and reducing rupture risk.

                Distinct regional functionality of the human cortex is orchestrated by diverse cellular and molecular processes, yet the underlying regulatory mechanisms remain poorly understood. We performed multiomic single-cell and spatial characterization of nine regions of the human cortex to define the gene regulatory networks and transcription factors that govern cell-type and region specificity. With the combined data of over three million cells, two striking patterns of cortical neuron specialization were uncovered: a rostral-caudal gradient of calcium regulatory machinery, and subunit switching of multiple signaling receptor families across the transmodal-sensory axis. Gene regulatory network analysis revealed putative transcriptional regulators of cortical neuron specialization with cell-type- and region-specific gene regulation patterns. While regionalization was observed in gene expression, chromatin accessibility, and spatial distributions, these modalities exhibited distinct cortical patterns. Our findings illuminate critical neuronal pathways that vary throughout the cortex and the gene regulatory networks that establish cortical regionalization in the human brain.

">CK2 inhibition suppresses glial inflammation in the brain</a></h4>

              
                Neuroinflammation plays a key role in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related neurodegenerative disorders. Chronic activation of astrocytes and microglia fuels neuronal damage via cytokine secretion, oxidative stress, and proteolysis. However, glial inflammatory regulation remains poorly understood. Using chemoproteomics, we identified CK2, particularly the brain-enriched catalytic subunit CK22, as a key driver of astrocytic inflammation. CK2 enhances NF-{kappa}B activity by phosphorylating NF-{kappa}B S529 and I{kappa}B S32, promoting pro-inflammatory gene expression. CK2 inhibition via genetic or chemical approaches dampens inflammation, including IL-6 and IL-8 expression in an acute neuroinflammation mouse model. CK22 is upregulated in AD postmortem tissues and patient-derived astrocytes. AD astrocytes exhibit a hyperinflammatory state that can be attenuated by CK2 inhibition. Overexpression of CK22 in cortical organoids mimics AD pathology, whereas CK2 inhibition using the potent, selective, and brain-penetrant probe TAL606 rescues inflammatory markers in transgenic AD mice. These findings position CK2 as a central regulator of neuroinflammation and a promising therapeutic target for AD and related disorders.

">Exogenous Photoreceptor-Specific N-Glycosylated PROM1 Rescues Retinal Degeneration in Patient and Mouse Models</a></h4>

              
                PROM1 is widely expressed across various tissues. However, its pathogenic mutations are exclusively associated with inherited retinal dystrophy (IRD). The mechanisms underlying this retina-specific vulnerability remain poorly understood, and no effective treatment currently exists for PROM1-IRD. Here, we utilized urine cells, hiPSCs, hiPSC-RPE cells, retinal organoids (ROs) and Prom1-/- mice to address these challenges. During photoreceptor development in ROs, PROM1 co-localized with ciliary marker ARL13B and outer segment (OS) marker PRPH2. It exhibited photoreceptor-specific mRNA splicing isoforms and unique N-glycosylation. In IRD patient-specific models with the PROM1 c.619G>T (p.E207X) homozygous mutation, we observed nonsense-mediated mRNA decay and altered splicing, leading to complete loss of PROM1 protein and OS-like structure disruption, faithfully recapitulating PROM1-IRD pathology. To rescue these defects, we engineered a photoreceptor-specific AAV7m8-CRXp-hPROM1, which successfully restored PROM1 expression and OS-like structures in patient-derived ROs. Therapeutic efficacy was further validated in Prom1-/- mice, where subretinal delivery of AAV8-CRXp-hPROM1 led to photoreceptor-specific expression of human PROM1, significantly preserving OS morphology and improving visual function. These findings not only provide the first solid preclinical evidence supporting gene therapy for PROM1-IRD, but also reveal photoreceptor-specific vulnerability to PROM1 mutations, offering a novel conceptual framework for investigating and treating related IRDs.

">Tau deletion results in sex-dependent modulation of synaptic weakening in rat hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                Tangles, a defining characteristic of Alzheimer's disease (AD), are composed principally of hyperphosphorylated and misfolded tau species. However, dysregulation of tau precedes tangle formation by many years and is associated with cognitive decline, the best functional correlate of which is synaptic weakening and eventual synaptic loss. Although tau is present at synapses, its normal synaptic function is poorly understood - information vital to the rational development of tau-modifying therapies. Since rats have a greater cognitive repertoire than mice and display more robust signs of tau pathology in AD models, we developed a tau knockout (Mapt-/-) rat to investigate the impact of tau elimination on synaptic function. We observed that long-term depression (LTD), a form of synaptic weakening, is enhanced in the hippocampus of male, but not female, rats. This enhanced LTD was dependent on the synaptic activation of group I metabotropic glutamate receptors and involved altered synaptic actin polymerization. These studies therefore provide mechanistic insights into how tau modulates synaptic function via regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. Our findings are relevant to the understanding of the physiological roles of synaptic tau, the functional consequences of tau-lowering therapies, and the influence of sex in AD susceptibility.

">Energy Landscape Analysis with Automated Region-of-Interest Selection via Genetic Algorithms</a></h4>

              
                Understanding brain dynamics is essential for advancing cognitive and clinical neuroscience. Energy landscape analysis (ELA), based on the pairwise maximum entropy model, is a powerful framework to characterize brain activity as transitions among discrete states defined by regional activity patterns. However, traditional approaches require a predefined set of regions of interest (ROIs), usually chosen based on prior knowledge from hypothesis-driven studies, which introduces subjectivity and may overlook previously unknown patterns. To overcome this limitation, we developed a new ELA framework enhanced by automated ROI selection using genetic algorithm optimization, called ELA/GAopt. ELA/GAopt employs a genetic algorithm to select ROI subsets that maximize model fitting accuracy while accounting for individual variability. We applied ELA/GAopt to two independent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging datasets. In Scenario 1, we tested how well the method generalizes using the Creativity dataset (OpenNeuro: ds002330), which includes 66 healthy adults (29 males, 36 females, and one non-binary individual; average age 26.6 {+/-} 4.3 years). ELA/GAopt was performed on a discovery set (n = 31), and the optimized ROI sets were validated on a test set (n = 30). Over 100 independent optimization runs, the selected ROI sets achieved significantly higher objective function values than randomly chosen ROI sets (permutation test, p < 0.05, false discovery-rate corrected). The similarity of local minimum states between discovery and test sets was also significantly higher for ELA/GAopt than for random selection (p < 0.05). These results confirm the reproducibility and generalizability of the proposed approach. In Scenarios 2-4, we analyzed data from 293 participants in the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange II dataset, including 157 with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and 136 typically developing controls (CTL) from discovery cohort A and validated findings in an independent cohort (54 ASD and 72 CTL participants). ELA/GAopt showed that ASD participants tend to visit local minima characterized by global co-activation of selected ROIs, especially within sensory-motor and visual networks. Additionally, ROI sets optimized for one group (ASD or CTL) did not generalize across groups, with significant differences in the number and structure of local minima (Mann-Whitney U test, p < 0.05, false discovery-rate corrected). These findings demonstrate that ELA/GAopt offers a robust, data-driven approach to modeling brain state dynamics, minimizing biases from predefined ROI selection. It improves reproducibility and could aid in discovering neuroimaging biomarkers for clinical conditions.

">Coordinate-Dependent Neuroinflammation and Metabolic Disruption Following Experimental Traumatic Brain Injury</a></h4>

              
                Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of long-term neurological dysfunction, with secondary neuroinflammation playing a pivotal role in disease progression. Microglia, the brains resident immune cells, respond to injury in a spectrum of activation states, influencing neuronal survival and cognitive recovery. While past studies have broadly examined neuroinflammatory responses following TBI, the influence of injury approach, specifically, anterior vs. posterior impact, on microglial activation and neuronal damage remains unexplored. This study investigated how the site of controlled cortical impact (CCI) in a moderate TBI model alters neuroinflammatory responses and neuronal vulnerability, providing key insights into coordinate-specific mechanisms of injury.

">Transcranial in-depth ultrafast ultrasound brain imaging in non-human primates</a></h4>

              
                Ultrasound Localization Microscopy (ULM) offers sub-diffraction resolution vascular imaging by tracking individual contrast microbubbles. However, transcranial implementation in non-human primates remains challenging due to the skull's acoustic attenuation and distortion. This study presents a method for non-invasive transcranial ULM imaging of the anesthetized squirrel monkey through intact skull and skin. We systematically evaluated key ultrasound acquisition parameters and identified an optimal configuration balancing resolution, depth, and vascular representation. Using these refined parameters, we achieved a system resolution of 9.5 m, measured by Fourier Ring Correlation (FRC), and consistently visualized vessels as small as 23 m. Full-brain coronal and sagittal acquisitions revealed major vascular landmarks that were reproducible across animals and slices. Importantly, this resolution enables reliable detection of penetrating arterioles and venules, key elements in neurovascular coupling and implicated in various cerebrovascular pathologies. Finally, by tracking microbubbles, we quantified flow velocities from 8.8 to 55 mm/s, corresponding to flow rates ranging from 0.1 to 279 L/min, demonstrating the technique's ability to access micro- and macrovascular dynamics. This work establishes a framework for high-resolution, non-invasive brain imaging in non-human primates, and opens promising perspectives for studying cerebral structure, function, and dysfunction in translational neuroscience.

">Cross-fostering affects microglia and cell death in the hippocampus of female and male degu pups</a></h4>

              
                Parental care is essential for social, behavioural, and neural development of offspring. Disruption of parental care, for example through parental separation, can negatively affect offspring development in rodents. While previous work has focused on maternal and paternal deprivation, the effects of cross-fostering, another form of parental-offspring instability, on brain development remains unclear. Stress significantly suppresses neurogenesis and increases inflammation and apoptosis in the hippocampus, with effects that vary between sexes. Given that degus (Octodon degus) are born precocial and form strong attachments with their parents early in life, this study aimed to investigate the effect of cross-fostering on hippocampal development in female and male degu pups. At postnatal day 8, degus were assigned to either control (pups remained with parents and littermates), partial cross-foster (one pup per litter was cross-fostered), or full cross-foster (the entire litter was cross-fostered) conditions. At weaning (5-weeks-old), offspring brains were collected for immunohistochemistry to examine dentate gyrus volume, density of pyknotic cells, density of immature neurons, and number and morphology of microglia. Both types of cross-fostering reduced hippocampal cell death in both sexes relative to controls, while no significant effects were observed in the dentate gyrus volume or density of immature neurons. Full cross-fostered pups, regardless of sex, had more microglia in the ventral dentate gyrus compared to controls. Full cross-fostered females had fewer amoeboid microglia compared to female controls. Together, these findings suggest that cross-fostering affects pup hippocampal development, however, the effects depend on type of cross-fostering, sex, and hippocampal region.

">Predicting individual learning trajectories in zebrafish via the free-energy principle</a></h4>

              
                The free-energy principle has been proposed as a unified theory of brain function, and recent evidence from in vitro experiments supports its validity. However, its empirical application to in vivo neuronal dynamics during active decision-making remains limited. This work reverse-engineered generative models--cast as canonical neural networks--from large-scale calcium imaging data of zebrafish performing a visually guided go/no-go task in a virtual-reality environment. Leveraging the formal equivalence between neural network dynamics and variational Bayesian inference, we constructed biologically plausible synthetic agents capable of active inference. These agents recapitulated individual variability in zebrafish neuronal dynamics and behaviour by identifying subject-specific prior and posterior beliefs. Additionally, they enabled quantitative predictions of long-term changes in neural activity, effective synaptic connectivity, and behavioural performance, including task accuracy after training. Our results demonstrate a powerful framework of active inference for modelling in vivo neuronal self-organisation and highlight the predictive validity of the free-energy principle in behaving animals.

">Investigation of the molecular-genetic basis for courtship differences between Drosophila melanogaster, Drosophila simulans and their hybrids</a></h4>

              
                Understanding the mechanisms driving behavioral evolution enhances our knowledge of speciation and how behavioral potentials are genetically encoded. Male courtship behaviors, which evolve rapidly, are critical for pre-mating isolation. To investigate the genetic basis of species-specific courtship, we generated hybrid males by crossing two Drosophila melanogaster strains with D. simulans Lhr males. This design allowed us to assess how genetic background and female species identity influence male courtship behavior. In both single-pair and mate-choice assays, hybrid males displayed behavioral plasticity, adjusting their courtship strategies based on the female species. The maternal D. melanogaster strain significantly shaped hybrid behavioral repertoires. To identify the neural correlates, we examined fruitless (fru)-expressing neurons in hybrids. Their projection patterns resembled those in D. melanogaster, indicating conserved circuit architecture. Using CUT&Tag, we identified FruM target genes in both species, revealing conserved core and species-specific FruM targets. Focusing on chemosensory receptors with D. melanogaster-specific FruM binding, we conducted a genetic screen in D. melanogaster, silencing neurons co-expressing fru P1 and specific receptor genes. Courtship preference assays identified three additional olfactory receptor neuron subtypes that modulate species-specific behavior. Using trans-Tango, we mapped second-order projection neurons of these subtypes, revealing their targets in higher-order brain centers. This study uncovers new molecular and neural mechanisms underlying the specification and evolution of courtship behavior, highlighting how genetic and sensory inputs shape species-specific behavioral outcomes.

">Evidence of Incoherent Fluid Flow in the Human Brain from Multidimensional MRI</a></h4>

              
                Purpose: The human brain contains multiple fluids, including blood, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and tissue water. While compartmental models have been used to examine microvascular blood perfusion using intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM), evidence on incoherent flows of CSF is emerging. This study aims to develop in vivo multi-dimensional MRI methods to investigate potential contributions of CSF in the IVIM regime. Method: T1-Diffusion (T1-D) and T2-Diffusion (T2-D) MRI data were acquired from 10 healthy subjects to investigate the relaxivity and diffusion signatures of incoherent fluid flows in the brain. Based on the T1-D and T2-D results, T1/T2 selective IVIM protocols were developed to map incoherent CSF flows in the human brains. Results: T1-D and T2-D MRI suggested incoherent CSF flow in the human brain subarachnoid space. Results from four different relaxation selective IVIM methods further supported incoherent CSF flows in these regions. Conclusion: We have shown the feasibility of using T1-D and T2-D MRI within the low b-value regime to probe the heterogeneity of IVIM components. Designed based on the 2D MRI spectra, relaxation selective 1D IVIM acquisition can be obtained within clinically feasible timeframe.

">Vascularized midbrain assembloids show neuroinflammation and dopaminergic neuron vulnerability in Parkinsons Disease</a></h4>

              
                The use of micro-physiological systems has rapidly risen in the last years due to their translatability and complex cellular composition. Human midbrain-specific organoids contain neuroectoderm-derived cell types and are suitable for brain region-specific disease modeling. However, the lack of vasculature in these systems reduces oxygenation and nutrient supply. Furthermore, neurovascular interactions cannot be studied, and disease phenotypes affecting vascular and neurovascular structures cannot be assessed. To overcome these limitations, in this work, we successfully incorporated a vascular network into midbrain organoids by fusion with vascular organoids. Midbrain-vascular assembloids are enriched in vascular cells and microglia. We observed a decrease in hypoxia and cell death in these assembloids. Furthermore, microglia and endothelial cells increased their morphological complexity. Assembloids derived from a Parkinsons disease patient carrying a LRRK2-G2019S mutation displayed a pro-inflammatory phenotype and altered electrophysiological properties. Midbrain-vascular assembloids increase the midbrain model complexity and allow for neuroinflammation studies in Parkinsons disease.

">Dilated cardiomyopathy remodels cardiac neuronal subtypes in a murine model</a></h4>

              
                The autonomic nervous system is comprised of two parallel chains sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system that innervates myocardium heterogeneously. However, excessive sympathetic signaling is a hallmark of cardiac dysfunction including myocardial infarction and cardiomyopathies. In current research article, first, we carried out echocardiography on DCM-Tg9 mice to characterize cardiac output parameters and performed scRNAseq analysis in a dilated cardiomyopathy mouse model of heart-failure over wildtype control mice. We analyzed differential gene expressions and performed pathway enrichment analysis. The important findings of our research indicate the increment within a specific neuronal subpopulation (NA1b) out of three adrenergic cardiac innervating neuronal subpopulation. We also observed significant increase in M-current potassium ion channel (Kcnq2 ion channel) and genes involved in pathways from oxidative phosphorylation and neurodegeneration pathways. These observations have clearly interpreted that significantly elevated expression of M-current ion channels might be involved with hyperactivated sympathetic signaling in heart-failure mice.

">Investigating action topography in visual cortex and deep artificial neural networks</a></h4>

              
                High-level visual cortex contains category-selective areas embedded within larger-scale topographic maps like animacy and real-world size. Here, we propose action as a key organizing factor shaping visual cortex topography and assess the ability of topographic deep artificial neural networks (DANNs) in capturing this organization. Using fMRI, we examined responses to images of body-parts and objects with different degrees of action properties. In left lateral occipitotemporal cortex, we identified a topographically-organized action gradient, with overlapping activations for bodies, hands, tools, and manipulable objects along a dorsal-posterior to ventral-anterior axis, culminating at the intersection of body parts and objects exhibiting higher action properties. Multivariate analyses confirmed action as a crucial organizing principle, while shape and animacy dominated ventral occipitotemporal cortex and DANNs, which exhibited no action-based organization. Our proposed action dimension serves as a further organizing principle of object categories, advancing understanding of visual cortex organization and its divergence from DANN-based models.

">Unilateral online ultrasound stimulation of early visual cortex suppresses responses to contralateral visual stimuli</a></h4>

              
                Transcranial ultrasound stimulation (TUS) shows great promise for inducing neuroplastic changes that persist long after stimulation. Evidence of stimulation-locked neural changes would enable closed-loop application of TUS, but such responses have not yet been clearly dissociated from the coincident neural response to auditory and peripheral stimulation associated with TUS. We leveraged the contralateral retinotopic organization of the early visual cortex to isolate online TUS effects from peripheral confounds in 19 subjects. Using a hemifield visual stimulation paradigm combined with high-precision, functional MRI guided TUS, we applied TUS to the left early visual cortex while participants viewed checkerboards presented in the left or right visual field. TUS was delivered randomly on half of the trials, enabling within-subject comparisons of pattern-locked visual evoked potentials (VEPs) across hemispheres and against no stimuli. We observed a reduction in VEPs in the contralateral, but not ipsilateral, hemifield, consistent with genuine online neuromodulatory effects. Furthermore, online suppression was positively correlated with the TUS dose delivered to the target, as estimated by modelling TUS field-target overlap and differential attenuation through heterogeneous skulls. Collectively, these findings provide a robust framework for future studies aiming to map the TUS parameter space in real time by leveraging topographic organization to control for peripheral confounds.

">Neural Correlates of Trial Outcome Monitoring during Long-term Learning in Primate Posterior Parietal Cortex</a></h4>

              
                Monitoring behavioral outcomes is crucial for optimizing behavior and learning new tasks. However, how the brain monitors outcome information during long-term learning remains largely unknown. Using two-photon calcium imaging in behaving monkeys, we tracked neuronal activity in area 7a of the posterior parietal cortex (PPC), an important associative cortex that has not been typically implicated in associative learning (AL), while the macaque monkeys learned new visual-motor associations over multiple days. We found robust neuronal representation of salient behavioral outcomes (correct vs. incorrect) which closely correlated with the monkeys' learning behavior. Furthermore, outcome representation significantly reorganized when monkeys transitioned to learn novel associations, followed by gradual evolution over subsequent learning days, a process constrained by the functional connectivity among neurons within local network. These suggest a substantive role for primate PPC in long-term AL through monitoring trial outcome, and indicate a principle for long-term learning: network connectivity constrains the evolution of neural encodings.

">Defined human tri-lineage brain microtissues</a></h4>

              
                Microglia are the immune cells of the central nervous system and are thought to be key players in both physiological and disease conditions. Several microglial features are poorly conserved between mice and human, such as the function of the neurodegeneration-associated immune receptor Trem2. Induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived microglia offer a powerful opportunity to generate and study human microglia. However, human iPSC-derived microglia often exhibit activated phenotypes in vitro, and assessing their impact on other brain cell types remains challenging due to limitations in current co-culture systems. Here, we developed fully defined brain microtissues, composed of human iPSC-derived neurons, astrocytes, and microglia, co-cultured in 2D or 3D formats. Our microtissues are stable and self-sufficient over time, requiring no exogenous cytokines or growth factors. All three cell types exhibit morphologies characteristic of their in vivo environment and show functional properties. Co-cultured microglia develop more homeostatic phenotypes compared to microglia exposed to exogenous cytokines. Hence, these tri-cultures provide a unique approach to investigate cell-cell interactions between brain cell types. We found that astrocytes and not neurons are sufficient for microglial survival and maturation, and that astrocyte-derived M-CSF is essential for microglial survival. Single-cell and single-nucleus RNA sequencing analyses nominated a network of reciprocal communication between cell types. Brain microtissues faithfully recapitulated pathogenic -synuclein seeding and aggregation, suggesting their usefulness as human cell models to study not only normal but also pathological cell biological processes.

">Selective abundance of the stemness-promoting cluster miR-290-295 within the adult substantia nigra dopamine neurons is neuroprotective via preservation of protein synthesis</a></h4>

              
                Locomotor, reward and other critical functions of the body are regulated by the ventral midbrain, with the central role played by dopamine (DA) neurons. The function of these cells from the early development to maturity is critically dependent on the orchestrated expression of coding and non-coding genes. For example, in the stem cells the miR-290-295 cluster constitutes the majority of expressed microRNAs and is critical for stemness in rodents. During development towards various terminally differentiated lineages, such as neurons, the cells typically switch off transcription of these stem cell-specific microRNAs. Here we report that within the adult substantia nigra pars compacta (SN), the miR-290-295 cluster is exclusively expressed in DA neurons (SNDA), preventing the locomotor deficits and maintaining an adequate expression of enzymes involved in DA biogenesis, such as tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), dopa decarboxylase (DDC) and DA transporter (DAT). Importantly, a global knock-out of the miR-290-295 cluster leads to decreased numbers of SNDA neurons in adult mice. Using in vitro and in vivo DA cell-specific loss-of-function models, we demonstrated that miR-292a-3p, the most abundant microRNA in this cluster, directly targets Pten, a phosphatase antagonizing the neuroprotective phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt-mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase (mTOR) pathways regulating translation initiation. Mechanistically, when labelled with the click chemistry-compatible methionine analogue L-azidohomoalanine, miR-290-295 cluster-deficient SNDA neurons revealed a drastic impairment of protein synthesis, which is critical for DA biogenesis. Our surprising finding demonstrates for the first time a selective expression of stem cell-specific and stemness-promoting microRNAs in a distinct population of mature neurons to maintain their physiological functions in the adulthood, suggesting that similar epigenetic disinhibition mechanisms may be also critical for other terminally differentiated cells across species.

">Soluble SORL1 in cerebrospinal fluid as a marker for functional impact of rare SORL1 variants.</a></h4>

              
                Background: As part of the retromer, sortilin-related receptor (SORL1) sorts cargo proteins away from the endosome to the trans-Golgi network or to the cell surface, where SORL1 is cleaved into sSORL1 and shed into the interstitial fluid and CSF. SORL1's cargo includes APP and A{beta}, which may explain why protein-truncating genetic variants (PTVs) in SORL1 are observed almost exclusively in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) patients, and that rare, predicted pathogenic missense variants have been associated with a 10-fold increased risk of AD. However, functional evidence supporting variant pathogenicity is warranted. Here we investigated whether soluble SORL1 (sSORL1) concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) offer a potential in vivo biomarker to support impaired SORL1 function in variant carriers. Methods: Using an ELISA assay for SORL1 (ABCAM), we determined sSORL1 concentrations in CSF from 218 participants of the Alzheimer Dementia Cohort (ADC) (54% females). We compared sSORLA in CSF derived from 90 carriers of diverse SORL1 variants with concentrations observed in 78 SORL1-WT AD patients, and 50 SORL1-WT controls for whom CSF-pTau-181, CSF-tTau, CSF-A{beta}42 concentrations were available. In a subset of 36 individuals, we used Western blotting (WB) to validate sSORL1 concentrations as determined by ELISA. Results: CSF-sSORL1 concentrations did not differ between SORL1-WT AD patients and controls. While CSF-sSORL1 did not correlate with CSF-A{beta}42 concentrations in SORL1-WT AD patients (p=0.62), it correlated with sCSF-ptau-181 (p=9.7x10-6). The mean CSF-sSORL1 concentration in the SORL1 WT AD cases and controls was 466 pg/ml, with wide variance (SD = 133). Comparatively, concentrations were significantly lower in PTV carriers (260 pg/ml, p=3.2x10-7) and in carriers of predicted damaging SORL1 missense variants (323 pg/ml, p=2.4x10-7). CSF-sSORL1 concentrations measured by ELISA correlated strongly with concentrations estimated by WB ({rho} =0.552; p=5.0x10-4). Conclusion: CSF-sSORL1 increases with CSF-ptau, suggesting that increased SORL1-retromer activity may serve to rescue cellular stress associated with AD-related processes. However, impairing SORL1 genetic variants may preclude SORL1 trafficking to the cell surface, as supported by lower CSF-sSORL1 protein concentrations in carriers. While further refinements are necessary, we present first evidence for the applicability of ELISA-based quantification of sSORL1 in CSF to evaluate the functional impact of rare SORL1 variants.

                <p>Neurite outgrowth is critically controlled by calcium influx-mediated cytoskeleton dynamics. Spastin, a AAA ATPase microtubule-severing protein, also plays an important role in neurite outgrowth. However, the detailed mechanisms underlying posttranscriptional fine-tuning spastin activity, particularly in the context of calcium signaling, remain elusive. Here, we identified that the Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II beta (CaMKII&beta;) isoform acted as an upstream kinase to mediate the phosphorylation of spastin. CaMKII&beta; interacted with and phosphorylated spastin on Ser233 and Ser562 amino acids. Moreover, CaMKII&beta;-mediated phosphorylation reduced the polyubiquitination level of spastin and suppressed its proteasomal degradation. This enhanced protein stability by CaMKII&beta; increased the microtubule-severing activity of spastin and coordinately promoted the neurite outgrowth in hippocampal neurons. Inhibition of spastin or CaMKII&beta; impaired synaptic activity, as evidenced by reduced frequency and amplitude of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs). Behaviorally, treatment with spastin or CaMKII&beta; inhibitors led to deficits in short-term working memory and spatial learning, as assessed by Y-maze and Morris water maze tests in male mice, respectively. In general, this study unveils a novel mechanism whereby CaMKII&beta;-mediated phosphorylation of spastin connects extracellular calcium signaling to the regulation of cytoskeleton dynamics and neurite outgrowth.</p>

                <p>Interpreting ambiguous environmental cues, like facial expressions, becomes increasingly challenging with age, especially as cognitive resources decline. Managing these challenges requires adaptive neural mechanisms that are essential for maintaining mental well-being. The locus ceruleus (LC), the brain's main norepinephrine source, regulates attention, arousal, and stress response. With extensive cortical connections, the LC supports adapting to cognitive demands and resolving conflicting cues from environment, particularly in later life. Previous research suggests that LC interacts with the prefrontal cortex (PFC) during high-conflict tasks. However, whether LC activity and its connectivity with the PFC support emotional ambiguity processing and contributes to emotional well-being in healthy aging remains unclear. To address this gap, we used 7T-MRI to examine LC function in 75 younger (25.8 &plusmn; 4.02&nbsp;years, 35 females) and 69 older adults (71.3 &plusmn; 4.1&nbsp;years, 35 females) during facial emotion recognition task morphed with varying ambiguity: unambiguous, intermediate ambiguity, and absolute ambiguity. Behaviorally, participants had longer response times and lower confidence during the absolute-ambiguity condition, while older adults perceived ambiguous faces as happy more frequently than younger adults. Neuroimaging results revealed older adults exhibited greater LC activity and enhanced connectivity with dorsolateral PFC (dlPFC) during absolute ambiguity compared with younger adults. This heightened connectivity in older adults was linked to better task-independent self-reported mental well-being questionnaires and greater emotional resilience scores derived from principal component analysis. Overall, these findings suggest that greater LC activity supports managing cognitively demanding tasks, while enhanced LC&ndash;dlPFC connectivity promotes emotional well-being, highlighting this neural pathway's role in healthy aging.</p>

                <p>Stress is a critical risk factor for the development of psychological disorders, including anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder. Key brain regions, including the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and the infralimbic medial prefrontal cortex (IL-mPFC), play crucial roles in fear regulation. Our previous research demonstrated that neuronal genomic activity of glucocorticoid receptors in the BLA during a 2&nbsp;h acute restraint stress (ARS) is essential for inducing anxiety-like behavior 10&nbsp;d later. Additionally, blocking BLA &beta;-adrenergic signaling during the elevated plus maze is crucial for preventing this stress-induced delayed anxiety-like behavior. Here, we utilized adult male Wistar rats to expand on these findings, revealing that a single ARS session increases the activity of BLA neurons and their projections to the IL-mPFC while decreasing the activity of IL-mPFC neurons and their projections to the BLA during fear extinction. This finding highlights the key role of the BLAIL-mPFC circuitry in fear extinction and its susceptibility to acute stress-induced changes. Notably, the delayed stress-induced fear extinction deficit and decreased IL-mPFC activity during fear extinction depend on the stress-responsive BLA neuronal ensemble and BLA &beta;-adrenergic signaling during contextual fear conditioning (CFC) 10&nbsp;d poststress. Our findings demonstrate the significance of BLA &beta;-adrenergic signaling during CFC, as it induces delayed stress-induced impairments in extinction and regulates IL-mPFC activity during fear extinction. Furthermore, this study indicates that the BLA is a pivotal regulator of delayed stress effects at both the circuitry and behavioral levels, thus shedding new light on the mechanisms underlying stress-related psychiatric conditions.</p>

                <p>Nicotine addiction remains a major cause of disease and premature death worldwide. Nicotine modulates neural pathways that underlie both rewarding and aversive behavioral effects, but persistent activation of brain reward circuitry drives nicotine consumption despite the negative consequences. When nicotine users attempt to quit, additional neural mechanisms are recruited to generate an aversive withdrawal state, which contributes to the remarkably high relapse rate among nicotine users. The interpeduncular nucleus (IPN) and its presynaptic inputs from the medial habenula are key mediators of aversive nicotine withdrawal symptoms, but the downstream neural targets mediating these effects are unknown. The aversive effects of acute exposure to high doses of nicotine require inhibitory IPN GABAergic projections to the laterodorsal tegmentum (LDTg), a key driver of reward-related dopamine signaling. Here we show that optogenetic inhibition of these IPN-&gt;LDTg projections reduces behavioral and physiological effects of nicotine withdrawal in male and female mice. Using fiber photometry, we found that nicotine withdrawal reduced reward-related signaling with decreases in both LDTg neuronal activity and nucleus accumbens dopamine release. These studies demonstrate a direct link between aversive and appetitive neural pathways that is active during nicotine withdrawal, providing novel targets for treating nicotine addiction.</p>

                <p>The endogenous aspect of social influence, reflected in the spontaneous alignment of behaviors within close social relationships, plays a crucial role in understanding human social behavior. In two studies involving 222 human subjects (Study 1: <I>n</I> = 175, 106 females; Study 2: <I>n</I> = 47, 33 females), we used a longitudinal behavioral study and a naturalistic stimuli neuroimaging study to investigate the endogenous consumer behavior similarities and their neural basis in real-world social networks. The findings reveal that friends, compared with nonfriends, exhibit higher similarity in product evaluation, which undergoes dynamic changes as the structure of social networks changes. Both neuroimaging and meta-analytic decoding results indicate that friends exhibit heightened neural synchrony, which is linked to cognitive functions such as object perception, attention, memory, social judgment, and reward processing. Stacking machine learning-based predictive models demonstrate that the functional connectivity maps of brain activity can predict the purchase intention of their friends or their own rather than strangers. Based on the significant neural similarity which exists among individuals in close relationships within authentic social networks, the current study reveals the predictive capacity of neural activity in predicting the behavior of friends.</p>

                <p>The brain's representation of hand position is critical for voluntary movement. Representation is multisensory, combining visual and proprioceptive cues. When these cues conflict, the brain recalibrates its unimodal estimates, shifting them closer together to compensate. Research suggests such updates to body representation are communicated to the motor system to keep hand movements accurate. The neural mechanism is unclear and may depend on how the brain integrates and recalibrates visuoproprioceptive signals: models ranging from hierarchical convergence after unisensory processing to more distributed frameworks have been proposed. We hypothesized that the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) is crucial in this updating process due to its role in proprioception and connections with both primary motor cortex (M1) and multisensory regions of the posterior parietal cortex (PPC). In human participants of both sexes, Experiment 1 showed that short-latency afferent inhibition, a measure of somatosensory&ndash;motor integration, changed with proprioceptive recalibration and only in the presence of a cue conflict. This indicates that S1 activity reflects the results of multisensory computations and is inconsistent with a pure hierarchical convergence model of visuoproprioceptive integration. Experiment 2 found that modulating S1, but not M1, with repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation increased proprioceptive variance and recalibration. This is consistent with the idea that motor effects of proprioceptive recalibration are mediated by the S1-&gt;M1 pathway, although not directly controlled by M1 itself. The specificity of our findings to proprioceptive&mdash;not visual&mdash;recalibration argues against a fully distributed framework, but our findings support a model of multisensory integration with reciprocal interactions between S1 and PPC.</p>

                <p>Identification of the neuron type is critical when using extracellular recordings in awake, behaving animal subjects to understand computation in neural circuits. Yet, modern recording probes have limited power to resolve neuron identity. Here, we present a generalizable framework for assigning the neuron type from extracellular recordings in nonhuman primates. The framework uses a combination of logic, circuit architecture, laminar information, and functional discharge properties. We apply the framework to the well characterized architecture of the cerebellar circuit by using well validated strategies to perform expert identification for a subset of extracellular neural recordings in behaving male rhesus macaques. We then use the subpopulation of expert-labeled neurons to train deep-learning classifiers to perform neuron identification with readily accessible extracellular features as inputs. Waveform, discharge statistics, and the anatomical layer each provide information about neuron identity for a sizable fraction of cerebellar units. Together, as inputs to a deep-learning classifier, the features perform even better. Our tools and methodologies, validated during smooth pursuit eye movements in the cerebellar floccular complex of awake behaving monkeys, can guide expert identification of the neuron type across neural circuits and species by leveraging the circuit layer, waveforms, discharge statistics, anatomical context, and circuit-specific knowledge. Thus, our generalized methodology lays essential groundwork for characterization of information processing at the level of neural circuits.</p>

                <p>In sleep, the brain balances protecting processes like memory consolidation with preserving responsiveness to significant external stimuli. Although reductions in higher-level auditory processes during deeper sleep have been described, the sleep-dependent changes across levels of auditory hierarchy, particularly as regards early sound representations, remain undefined. The frequency-following response (FFR) is an evoked auditory response that indexes neural encoding of sound periodicity. It is generated by neural populations in the brainstem, thalamus, and auditory cortex that phase-lock to periodic auditory stimuli and encode pitch information. The FFR&rsquo;s neural sources, which can be resolved using magnetoencephalography, allow evaluation of neural representation strength throughout the auditory neuraxis as a function of sleep state, as well as neural events like slow waves and sleep spindles that are hypothesized to attenuate acoustic processing as a means of preserving the sleep state. We recorded FFRs during a 2.5 h nap from 14 healthy male and female human adults to investigate how sleep depth and microarchitecture affect auditory encoding. We show that FFR strength is maintained across non-rapid eye movement sleep stages in subcortical nuclei, yet decreases in deeper sleep in the auditory cortex. FFR strength was not influenced by slow wave or spindle activity, but rather by reduced communication between the thalamus and cortex. This differentiation in sound representation across the auditory hierarchy suggests a means by which the brain might balance environmental monitoring with preserving critical restorative processes.</p>

                <p>Extensive evidence shows that humans are inconsistent in their choices. Yet, the neural mechanism underlying inconsistent choice remains unknown. Here, we aim to show that inconsistent choice is tied to the valuation process but is also linked to motor dynamics during task execution. We report the results from two behavioral and one neuroimaging studies. Human subjects (<I>n</I> = 206, 117 females) completed a well validated risky-choice task to measure their inconsistency levels, followed by two novel tasks, explicitly designed to examine motor dynamics free of value computations. We record mouse trajectories during task execution and extract 34 features to examine the role of motor dynamics in choice inconsistency. We show that motor dynamics predict inconsistency levels, even when motor output is absent any sort of valuation elements, nor is it related to deliberation about the decision. These results are robust across all three studies and when using various analysis strategies. We then apply neuroimaging and show that inconsistency is represented in value brain areas but, at the same time, is also related to activity in motor brain regions. These findings suggest that inconsistent choice behavior may arise from multiple cognitive processes and invite choice theorists to examine models of inconsistent choice that include heterogeneous sources of stochasticity.</p>

                <p>Recognizing speech in noise, such as in a busy restaurant, is an essential cognitive skill where the task difficulty varies across environments and noise levels. Although there is growing evidence that the auditory system relies on statistical representations for perceiving and coding natural sounds, it is less clear how statistical cues and neural representations contribute to segregating speech in natural auditory scenes. Here we demonstrate that male and female human listeners rely on mid-level statistics to segregate and recognize speech in environmental noise. Using natural backgrounds and variants with perturbed spectrotemporal statistics, we show that speech recognition accuracy at a fixed noise level varies extensively across natural backgrounds (0&ndash;100%). Furthermore, for each background the unique interference created by summary statistics can mask or unmask speech, thus hindering or improving speech recognition. To identify the neural coding strategy and statistical cues that influence accuracy, we developed generalized perceptual regression, a framework that links summary statistics from a neural model to word recognition accuracy. Whereas summary statistics from a peripheral cochlear model account for only 60% of perceptual variance, summary statistics from a mid-level auditory midbrain model accurately predict single-trial sensory judgments, accounting for &gt;90% of the perceptual variance. Furthermore, perceptual weights from the regression framework identify which statistics and tuned neural filters are influential and how they impact recognition. Thus, perception of speech in natural backgrounds relies on a mid-level auditory representation involving interference of multiple summary statistics that impact recognition beneficially or detrimentally across natural background sounds.</p>

                <p>by Wenjia Zhou, Junhua Zhang</p>

Discovery of cancer driver pathways is essential for targeted therapies, since these pathways govern tumor progression and treatment resistance. However, their context-specific patterns across populations remain poorly understood. Leveraging pan-cancer genomic data, we apply our two models, EntCDP and ModSDP, to perform stratified analyses from four perspectives: region, tumor type, age group, and risk factors. Our results reveal the regional biases in perturbed pathways, such as PI3K-Akt in Chinese patients and GPCR in American patients with bladder cancer. Subtype comparisons highlight the mTOR signaling in lung adenocarcinoma and the FoxO signaling in lung squamous cell carcinoma. Pediatric-adult comparisons emphasize the enrichment of Ras signaling in pediatric acute myeloid leukemia and PAK signaling in pediatric glioblastoma, respectively. Risk factor associations further link Notch-mediated pathways to alcohol consumption and CDKN-regulated pathways to obesity-related cancers. Our findings demonstrate the utility of stratified driver pathway analysis in uncovering common and specific mechanisms, which can help prioritize context-aware therapeutic targets.

                <p>by Nobuhiko Wagatsuma, Sou Nobukawa, Tomoki Kurikawa</p>

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and schizophrenia are complex and heterogeneous mental disorders involving the dysfunction of multiple neural systems. The atypical and heterogenous temporal coordinations of neuronal activity, which are widely observed in these two disorders, are hypothesized to stem from an excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) imbalance in the brain. To investigate the association between the E/I imbalance and atypical neural activities, and to assess the influence of specific subtypes of inhibitory interneurons on network activity regulation, we developed a computational microcircuit model with biologically plausible layer 2/3 of visual cortex that combined excitatory pyramidal neurons with three subtypes of inhibitory interneurons (parvalbumin [PV], somatostatin [SOM], and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide [VIP]). We numerically explored the role of distinct types of E/I imbalance by changing the population size of different subtype neurons. We find that when the E/I balance is disrupted by decreasing the PV population size, activity of the PV population precedes that of the pyramidal population, which enhances beta and gamma oscillations. Conversely, pyramidal neuronal population activity was the precursor of PV interneuron activity when the E/I imbalance was induced by decreasing the SOM population size; this preferentially impaired gamma-frequency activity. The disruption of E/I balance altered the information flow between pyramidal and PV populations, modulating neuronal dynamics. Our results suggest that E/I imbalance due to different subtype interneurons would induce the distinct types of the atypical neural behaviors associated with neural system dysfunction.

Computational pathway design and retro-biosynthetic approaches can facilitate the development of innovative biochemical production routes, biodegradation strategies, and the funneling of multiple precursors into a single bioproduct. However, effective pathway design necessitates a comprehensive understanding of biochemistries, enzyme activities, and thermodynamic feasibility. Herein, we introduce novoStoic2.0, an integrated platform that combines tools for estimating overall stoichiometry, designing de novo synthesis pathways, assessing thermodynamic feasibility, and selecting enzymes. novoStoic2.0 offers a unified web-based interface as a part of the AlphaSynthesis platform (http://novostoic.platform.moleculemaker.org/) tailored for the synthesis of thermodynamically viable pathways as well as the selection of enzymes for re-engineering required for novel reaction steps. We exemplify the utility of the platform to identify novel pathways for hydroxytyrosol synthesis, which are shorter than the known pathways and require reduced cofactor usage. In summary, novoStoic2.0 aims to streamline the process of pathway design contributing to the development of sustainable biotechnological solutions.

                <p>by Anne van der Meij, Hannah Tyrrell, Dustin J. Sokolowski, Evan M. F. Shepherdson, Marie A. Elliot, Justin R. Nodwell</p>

More than a billion tons of chitin are produced on earth each year. Chitin is rich in nitrogen and carbon, making it a valuable resource in competitive microbial ecosystems. However, almost all chitin is found in large, insoluble structures like insect and crustacean exoskeletons. For this material to enter a microorganism’s primary metabolism, it must be degraded extracellularly through a saprophytic process. The extracellular nature of this process means that liberated oligomers may also become accessible to other microorganisms. How microbes navigate this challenge in terrestrial ecosystems remains largely unclear. Here, we show that <i>Streptomyces venezuelae</i> thrives on raw, insoluble chitin as its sole carbon and nitrogen source, outperforming glucose in metabolic activity and sporulation. This was facilitated by a chitinolytic system encompassing up to 10 chitinases and the DasABC chitobiose importer. While deleting some chitinases affected growth on chitin, others did not, implying some degree of functional redundancy. A <i>dasBC</i> null mutation conferred a severe growth defect suggesting that chitobiose is a key breakdown product during chitin-based metabolism in <i>S. venezuelae</i>. The DasABC transporter also played a crucial role in preventing the built-up of chitobiose extracellularly, thereby restricting its access to <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> in co-cultures. Given the global ubiquity of <i>Streptomyces</i> in soil, this pathway likely plays a significant role in soil ecology as well as carbon and nitrogen turnover on a global scale.

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Memories formed in adulthood can last a lifetime, whereas those formed early in life are rapidly forgotten through a process known as infantile amnesia. In recent years, tremendous progress has been made in understanding the memory engram—the physical trace of a memory in the brain—and how it transforms as memories evolve from recent to remote. This review focuses on engram cells and examines their roles in memory encoding, consolidation, retrieval, and forgetting from development to adulthood. We concentrate on four key brain regions: the hippocampus, the retrosplenial cortex, the medial prefrontal cortex, and the anterior thalamic nuclei. We first focus on the adult brain, highlighting recent studies that reveal the distinct contributions of engram cells in each brain region, with particular emphasis on synaptic plasticity and memory consolidation. We then explore how coordinated activity across these regions supports long-term memory. In the second section, we review emerging knowledge of engram cells in the developing brain, examining how developmental differences in their functions contribute to infant memory generalization and infantile amnesia. Compared to adults, much less is known about how, or to what extent, early-life memories undergo consolidation. In the final section, we synthesize current knowledge of memory consolidation and retrieval in the adult brain with what is known about the development of the four brain regions we discuss. We then propose key directions for future research. In sum, this review brings together recent findings that deepen our understanding of the dynamic changes in memory engrams that underlie consolidation and long-term storage and explores how developmental differences may shape the maturation of memory processes.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/xjh4-mfvx">Parrondo's paradox in tumor ecosystems: Adaptive therapy strategies to delay the development of drug resistance</a></h4>

              
                <p>Author(s): De-Ming Liu, Yi-Yang Liu, Zhi-Xi Wu, and Jian-Yue Guan</p><p>This work investigates how alternating high-dose and low-dose chemotherapy could affect development of drug resistance. The authors study a three-component tumor system and find that alternating administration of high-dose and low-dose therapy can significantly delay the development of drug resistance compared to separate administration of either therapy, an outcome akin to Parrondo’s paradox.</p>

                The molecular mechanisms that govern the extended neuronal maturation in the primate brain remain incompletely understood. In this issue of Neuron, Gao et al. measure gene activity, chromatin state, and electrical properties of individual neurons in the macaque to reveal some of the genetic regulators of neuronal maturation in the cerebral cortex.

                Hollis, Sharma, et al. examine cell-type-specific diurnal rhythms in control and Alzheimer’s disease (AD)-affected human brains. They find that AD preserves core clock function but disrupts output rhythms, especially in ribosomal and oxidative phosphorylation genes. In mice, circadian stress adds to AD pathology to further reduce ribosomal components and translational capacity.

                Fujisawa, Tanabe, and colleagues show that the transcription factor BATF is a pioneer in the effector differentiation of CD8+ T cells. BATF initiates chromatin reorganization upon antigen encounters and heterodimerizes with IRF4 to drive the dynamic rearrangement of epigenomic and transcriptomic landscapes.

                The mechanism whereby the Bicoid morphogen gradient regulates target gene expression domains has been challenging to explain at the level of DNA binding. Here, Degen et al. demonstrate how transcription factor-nucleosome competition at key binding sites determines the concentration-dependent regulation of target gene expression.
