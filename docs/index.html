">Stress drives the hippocampus to prioritize statistical prediction over episodic encoding</a></h4>

              
                The hippocampus plays a critical role in encoding individual experiences into episodic memory, while also detecting patterns shared across these experiences that allow us to anticipate future events via statistical learning. Acute stress is known to impact the hippocampus but may have opposite effects on these competing functions. That is, although stress impairs episodic encoding, it may instead enhance statistical learning. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we tested how stress influences the hippocampal pathways and subfields that support episodic encoding and statistical learning while participants performed a task that engaged both processes. Across several analyses, stress biased hippocampal processing in favour of statistical learning, suppressing pattern separation between events in the dentate gyrus and enhancing the representation of statistically predictive features. Furthermore, stress drove the hippocampal monosynaptic pathway to support statistical learning rather than episodic encoding during predictive situations. Together, these data suggest that acute stress elicits targeted, adaptive changes in hippocampal pathways which may facilitate predicting and responding to upcoming events.

Highly ubiquitylated proteins outcompete non-ubiquitylated ones for vesicle incorporation, revealing a competitive sorting mechanism that may help cells selectively remove damaged surface receptors.

">Relationships between phenotypic differences in punishment behaviour and prefrontal cortex network engagement</a></h4>

              
                Avoiding actions with negative consequences is fundamental to adaptive behaviour, yet individuals differ drastically in their tendencies to avoid to punishment. Using a conditioned punishment task in male and female rats, we replicate findings of a bimodal distribution of punishment avoidance, and identify four distinct behavioural phenotypes (Sensitive, Hypersensitive, Insensitive, Generalised) that differed in their punishment avoidance, unpunished reward-seeking, and Pavlovian fear. We examined how these phenotypic differences related to c-Fos (transcriptional activity marker) across prefrontal cortex (PFC) regions. While region-level c-Fos differences were minimal, covariance and graph-theoretic analyses revealed three functional PFC networks predominantly composed of medial PFC, ventrolateral PFC, or sensorimotor regions. Activity in the ventrolateral PFC network predicted punishment avoidance, while activity in the medial PFC network predicted generalised suppression during initial punishment learning. These findings suggest phenotypic differences in punishment sensitivity is underpinned by differential recruitment of distinct cortical networks that drive adaptive versus maladaptive responses to negative outcomes.

">Diazepam alters the shape of alpha oscillations recorded from human cortex using EEG</a></h4>

              
                While neural oscillations are conventionally assessed via their frequency, power and phase, developing literature suggests that their shape also provides neurophysiological and functional information. However, the extent to which the shape of oscillations recorded non-invasively in humans index specific brain processes remains unclear. This study implemented a pharmaco-EEG approach to begin addressing this limitation. In 21 healthy adults, resting-state EEG data was collected before and after placebo or diazepam, a positive allosteric modulator of type A {gamma}-aminobutyric acid (GABAA) receptors. The shape of individual cycles in the alpha band was then derived using empirical mode decomposition, followed by extraction of principal components (PCs) describing specific facets of alpha shape. Results of this approach show that all shape features were unchanged following placebo. In contrast, diazepam was associated with complex changes in several shape features, including peak-trough shape and edge speed. While changes in shape were apparent in all cortical lobes, the strongest alterations were specific to sensorimotor and parietal cortices. Taken together, our results support the neurophysiological utility of waveform shape, particularly with respect to non-invasive human recordings. Furthermore, the regional specificity of effects highlights the need for more granular exploration of waveform diversity.

">Increased ambient temperature mitigates pathology in the Ndufs4-/- mouse model of Leigh Syndrome</a></h4>

              
                Leigh syndrome (LS) is a devastating mitochondrial disease (MD) for which there is no treatment. Together with Leigh-like syndrome (LLS), LS constitutes part of the Leigh syndrome spectrum (LSS) disorders, which are the most frequent manifestation of a primary mitochondrial disease (MD) in children. Ndufs4-/- mice are a widely used animal model to study LS pathophysiology and interventions. These mice display an isolated mitochondrial complex I deficiency and a brain-specific pathomechanism. Similar to other mouse models of human disease, Ndufs4-/- mice are routinely housed and studied at a subthermoneutral ambient temperature. This means that these mice experience chronic cold-stress, which potentially aggravates disease symptoms and reduces their translational value. Here, we provide evidence that housing Ndufs4-/- mice at 26 oC instead of 20 oC increases their skin, core and brain temperature. At this higher temperature, Ndufs4-/- mice displayed lower energy expenditure and, importantly, a longer lifespan, pathology reversal in specific brain regions, as well as increased voluntary locomotor activity. We conclude that ambient temperature is a previously overlooked but highly relevant disease modifier in Ndufs4-/- mice. Given the reduced mitochondrial energy production and aberrant thermoregulation in LSS and other MD patients, our findings suggest that reducing energy requirements might be of therapeutic value and/or contribute to an improved quality of life in these patients. In a broader sense, our results advocate the use of (more) thermoneutral housing to evaluate pathomechanisms and intervention strategies in murine models of human disease.

">Neuronal extracellular vesicles regulate axon development in primary cortical neurons via local miR-99a targeting of HS3ST2</a></h4>

              
                Fully functional neural competence and integrity requires a complex array of communication means among neurons, with extracellular vesicles (EVs) emerging as a relevant mechanism for cell-cell interaction in the CNS. Despite the growing number of studies demonstrating the presence of miRNAs in axon and EVs, the molecular mechanisms of those microRNAs present in EVs and their functional role in nervous system development has not been fully explored. In this study, we investigated whether neuronal EVs can have a role in neuron-to-neuron communication during the development of neuron connectivity in mouse primary cortical neuron cultures. Our results demonstrate how miR-99a can regulate axonal growth via its EV-mediated delivery and through the targeting of HS3ST2, a heparan sulphate glucosamine 3-O-sulphotransferase, which is predominantly expressed in the brain and generates rare 3-O-sulphated domains in heparan sulphate proteoglycans, with growing importance in development and neurodegenerative mechanisms. Importantly, we show how in compartmentalised microfluidic cultures, where axons are isolated from neuronal somas, the growth-promoting effects of neuron-derived EVs are local to the axon. These findings establish that neuronal EVs can deliver miRNAs to discrete subcellular domains to acutely modulate local gene expression, thereby driving axonal growth and shaping neurodevelopment.

">Preoptic activation induces a torpor-like hypothermic and hypometabolic state that is cerebroprotective</a></h4>

              
                Therapeutic hypothermia for stroke has been limited by shivering, increased metabolic demand, and poor patient tolerance. Engaging endogenous thermoregulatory circuits to lower body temperature may overcome these limitations and modulate metabolism, offering an integrated approach to cerebroprotection. Here, we show that chemogenetic activation of neurons in the preoptic area (POA) elicits a torpor-like state in mice, characterized by sustained hypothermia and hypometabolism. In an animal stroke model, this endogenous hypothermic state significantly reduced infarct volume and improved motor outcomes compared to controls, whereas maintaining normothermia attenuated these protective effects. To explore metabolic mechanisms contributing to this state, we performed untargeted metabolomic profiling 30 minutes after POA activation and identified coordinated shifts in nucleotide, phospholipid, and sphingolipid pathways. These rapid, temperature-dependent changes indicate a metabolically reprogrammed state that may enhance neuronal resilience during ischemic stress. Together, our findings suggest that POA-driven hypothermia confers cerebroprotection through specific metabolic adaptations with translational potential.

">Family identity is represented within vocal categories by the gerbil auditory cortex</a></h4>

              
                Vocalizations are integral to social communication, with acoustic features that may convey both meaning and information about an animal's identity or emotional state. The neural representation of vocalizations must therefore permit animals to generalize across one set of acoustic features to recognize meaning, and a different set of features to recognize vocalizer identity. To test this idea, we recorded the responses of gerbil core auditory cortex (AC) neurons to a large array (n>1500) of variants drawn from four vocalization categories and produced by 5 different families. Each vocalization category could be decoded from AC population activity with high accuracy, despite the acoustic variance across vocalization renditions or different families-of-origin, and displayed a 'boundary effect' (i.e., better classification across, than within, a category). Moreover, the family identity of each vocalization category could be decoded from a larger AC population. Thus, AC activity can be used to simultaneously predict vocalization category and family identity, and is robust to the natural range of acoustic variance.

">Visual Salience Controls the Speed of Evidence Accumulation in Value-Based Decisions by Rats</a></h4>

              
                Studies of visual discrimination learning decision making in rodents, particularly those using visual cues, can confound the effects of cue salience with reward value, making it difficult to determine which factor guides choice behavior. We addressed this issue using a two-alternative forced-choice task in which rats chose between visual cues associated with high or low sucrose rewards. After initial training with high (16 LEDs) and low (1 LED) luminance cues, we introduced a novel cue of intermediate luminance (4 LEDs) in a "luminance shift" test, keeping the associated reward values constant. We found that while rats maintained a preference for the higher-value option, the introduction of a perceptually more similar cue consistently reduced choice preference and eliminated latency differences compared to baseline. Using drift diffusion modeling, we determined that the luminance shifts primarily caused a reduction in the drift rate (the speed of evidence accumulation), reflecting increased difficulty in cue discrimination. This finding suggests that the visual salience of the options dictates the efficiency of evidence accumulation in value-based decisions. Furthermore, this effect on drift rate is notable because it shows a dissociation from our previous work (Palmer et al., 2024), where prefrontal cortex inactivation specifically affected the decision threshold but not the drift rate. Our results demonstrate that the relative salience of visual stimuli influences deliberation, with low-level perceptual features shaping the computational dynamics of value-based choice. Our findings clarify the distinct contributions of sensory input and prefrontal function in the decision process.

">Interregional human assembloids recapitulate fetal brain morphologies and enhance neuronal complexity</a></h4>

              
                Neuronal morphology governs how neurons connect, integrate, and process information, offering critical insights into the functional architecture of the brain. Characterizing the three-dimensional (3D) morphology of individual neurons is key not only for mapping circuit connectivity but also for understanding the cellular diversity that emerges during development. Neural organoids are valuable models of human brain development and disease, yet their morphological complexity remains poorly characterized despite advances in single-cell transcriptomics. Here, we use 3D confocal imaging and manual reconstruction of 735 neurons to analyze forebrain (dorsal and ventral) and thalamic (dorsal and ventral) organoids, as well as forebrain, thalamic, and corticothalamic assembloids. We find that organoids and assembloids exhibit distinct morphologies resembling fetal brain neurons, including immature pyramidal-like, double-bouquet, and bushy-like neurons. Interregional assembloids show greater neuronal morphological complexity than individual organoids, with more extensive dendritic branching, longer projections, and diverse soma shapes. Corticothalamic assembloids further display features of emerging connectivity. We observe dendritic spines with excitatory and inhibitory profiles and varicosities, indicative of maturing synaptic architecture. Together, our work makes an initial effort in describing the diversity of neuronal morphology in human neural organoids and assembloids. It further establishes structural phenotyping as a critical dimension for validating human neural models and underscores their value for modeling morphofunctional disorders.

                <p>Although clinical and experimental evidence highlight the role of the thalamus in voluntary movement production, the involvement of the thalamus in complex motor tasks such as speech production remains to be elucidated. The present study examined neural activity within the bilateral thalamus in 13 participants (seven females) with essential tremor undergoing awake deep brain stimulation implantation surgery, using three speech tasks of varied complexity [vowel vocalization, a diadochokinetic task (DDK), and sentence repetition]. Low-frequency neural activity (delta/theta band) activity was significantly increased during sentence and DDK compared with vowel vocalization in the bilateral motor thalamus and, to a lesser extent, increased for sentence repetition compared with DDK. Moreover, there was prominent prespeech beta band activity, with a greater decrease in the power of beta activity for sentence compared with DDK and vowel vocalization. The greater low-frequency activity in more complex speech tasks may reflect the allocation of additional cognitive resources to monitor the execution of speech motor plans through cortico&ndash;thalamo&ndash;cortical pathways in a temporally precise manner. The greater decrease in the power of beta activity prior to the onset of sentence repetition may imply greater involvement of the bilateral thalamus in the planning of complex speech tasks. These findings provide new insights into the role of the bilateral thalamus in speech production and may have clinical implications for neurological disorders that affect speech production.</p>

                <p>Aberrant dopamine transmission is a hallmark of several psychiatric disorders. Dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) display distinct activity states that are regulated by discrete afferent inputs. For example, burst firing requires excitatory input from the mesopontine tegmentum, while dopamine neuron population activity, defined as the number of spontaneously active dopamine neurons, is thought to be dependent on inhibitory drive from the ventral pallidum (VP). Rodent models used to study psychiatric disorders, such as psychosis, consistently exhibit elevated dopamine neuron population activity, due to decreased tonic inhibition from the VP. However, it remains unclear whether the VP can modulate all dopamine neurons or if only a specific subset of VTA dopamine neurons receive innervation from the VP to be recruited as required. This knowledge is critical for understanding dopamine regulation in normal and pathological conditions. Here, we used in vivo electrophysiology in male and female rats to record VTA dopamine neurons inhibited by electrical stimulation of the VP. Specifically, VP stimulation inhibited ~22% of spontaneously active dopamine neurons; however, activation of the ventral hippocampus, a modulator of VTA population activity, increased the proportion to ~48%. This increase suggests that VP selectively modulates a subset of dopamine neurons that can be recruited by afferent activation. Anterograde monosynaptic tracing revealed that approximately half of the VTA dopamine neurons receive input from the VP. Taken together, we demonstrate that a subset of VTA dopamine neurons receives monosynaptic input from the VP, providing valuable information regarding the regulation of VTA neuron activity.</p>

                <p>by Jeremy Charlier, Zeinab Sherkatghanad, Vladimir Makarenkov</p>

Transfer learning has emerged as a powerful tool for enhancing predictive accuracy in complex tasks, particularly in scenarios where data is limited or imbalanced. This study explores the use of similarity-based pre-evaluation as a methodology to identify optimal source datasets for transfer learning, addressing the dual challenge of efficient source-target dataset pairing and off-target prediction in CRISPR-Cas9, while existing transfer learning applications in the field of gene editing often lack a principled method for source dataset selection. We use cosine, Euclidean, and Manhattan distances to evaluate similarity between the source and target datasets used in our transfer learning experiments. Four deep learning network architectures, i.e. Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Feedforward Neural Networks (FNNs), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and two traditional machine learning models, i.e. Logistic Regression (LR) and Random Forest (RF), were tested and compared in our simulations. The results suggest that similarity scores are reliable indicators for pre-selecting source datasets in CRISPR-Cas9 transfer learning experiments, with cosine distance proving to be a more effective dataset comparison metric than either Euclidean or Manhattan distances. An RNN-GRU, a 5-layer FNN, and two MLP variants provided the best overall prediction results in our simulations. By integrating similarity-based source pre-selection with machine learning outcomes, we propose a dual-layered framework that not only streamlines the transfer learning process but also significantly improves off-target prediction accuracy.

                <p>by Hao Zhu, Donna K. Slonim</p>

A major challenge in working with single-cell RNA sequencing data is the prevalence of “dropout,” when some transcripts’ expression values are erroneously not captured. Addressing this issue, which produces zero-inflated count data, is crucial for many downstream data analyses including the inference of gene regulatory networks (GRNs). In this paper, we introduce two novel contributions. First, we propose Dropout Augmentation (DA), a simple but effective model regularization method to improve resilience to zero inflation in single-cell data by augmenting the data with synthetic dropout events. DA offers a new perspective to solve the “dropout” problem beyond imputation. Second, we present DAZZLE, a stabilized and robust version of the autoencoder-based structure equation model for GRN inference using the DA concept. Benchmark experiments illustrate the improved performance and increased stability of the proposed DAZZLE model over existing approaches. The practical application of the DAZZLE model on a longitudinal mouse microglia dataset containing over 15,000 genes illustrates its ability to handle real-world single cell data with minimal gene filtration. The improved robustness and stability of DAZZLE make it a practical and valuable addition to the toolkit for GRN inference from single-cell data. Finally, we propose that Dropout Augmentation may have wider applications beyond the GRN-inference problem. Project website: https://bcb.cs.tufts.edu/DAZZLE.

                <p>by Fabiano Baroni, Ben D. Fulcher</p>

Neuronal activity is organized in collective patterns that are critical for information coding, generation, and communication between neural populations. These patterns are often described in terms of synchrony, oscillations, and phase relationships. Many methods have been proposed for the quantification of these collective states of dynamic neuronal organization. However, it is difficult to determine which method is best suited for which experimental setting and research question. This choice is further complicated by the fact that most methods are sensitive to a combination of synchrony, oscillations, and other factors; in addition, some of them display systematic biases that can complicate their interpretation. To address these challenges, we adopt a highly comparative approach, whereby spike trains are represented by a diverse library of measures. This enables unsupervised or supervised analysis in the space of measures, or in that of spike trains. We compile a battery of 122 measures of synchrony, oscillations, and phase relationships, complemented with 9 measures of spiking intensity and variability. We first apply them to sets of synthetic spike trains with known statistical properties, and show that all measures are confounded by extraneous factors such as firing rate or population frequency, but to different extents. Then, we analyze spike trains recorded in different species—rat, mouse, and monkey—and brain areas—primary sensory cortices and hippocampus—and show that our highly comparative approach provides a high-dimensional quantification of collective network activity that can be leveraged for both unsupervised and supervised characterization of firing patterns. Overall, the highly comparative approach provides a detailed description of the empirical properties of multineuron spike train analysis methods, including practical guidelines for their use in experimental settings, and advances our understanding of neuronal coordination and coding.

Proteins carry out cellular functions by changing their structure among a few conformations, each characterised by a different energy level. Therefore, structural changes, energy transformations, and protein function are intimately related. Despite its central importance, this relationship remains elusive. For example, while many hexameric ATPase motors are known to function using a hand-over-hand alternation of subunits, how energy transduction throughout the assembly structure drives the hand-over-hand mechanism is not known. In this work, we unravel the energetic basis of hand-over-hand in a model AAA+ motor, RuvB. To do so, we develop a general method to compute the residue-scale elastic pseudoenergy due to structure changes and apply it to RuvB structures, recently resolved through cryo-EM. This allows us to quantify how progression through RuvB’s mechanochemical cycle translates into residue-scale energy transduction. In particular, we find that DNA binding is associated with overcoming a high energy barrier. This is possible through inter-subunit transmission of energy, and ultimately driven by nucleotide exchange. Furthermore, we show how this structure-inferred energetic quantification can be integrated into a non-equilibrium model of AAA+ assembly dynamics, consistent with single-molecule biophysics measurements. Overall, our work elucidates the energetic basis for the hand-over-hand mechanism in RuvB’s cycle. Furthermore, it presents a generally applicable methodology for studying the energetics of conformational cycles in other proteins, allowing to quantitatively bridge data from structural biology and single-molecule biophysics.

                <p>by Weifan Wang, Xueyan Niu, Liyuan Liang, Tai-Sing Lee</p>

A ubiquitous phenomenon observed along the ventral stream of the primate hierarchical visual system is the suppression of neural responses to familiar stimuli at the population level. The observation of the suppression of the neural response in the early visual cortex (V1 and V2) to familiar stimuli that are multiple times larger in size than the receptive fields of individual neurons implicates the plausible development of recurrent circuits for encoding these global stimuli. In this work, we investigated the neural mechanisms of familiarity suppression and showed that a recurrent neural circuit based on Hebbian learning, consisting of neurons with small and local receptive fields, can develop to encode specific global familiar stimuli robustly as a result of familiarity training. We proposed that the learned recurrent circuit implements a manifold transform. The recurrent circuit compresses the dimensions of nuisance variations of a familiar image in the neural response manifold relative to the dimensions for discriminating different familiar stimuli, resulting in increased robustness of the global stimulus representation against noise and other irrelevant perturbations. We demonstrate that a recurrent circuit implements the manifold transform using a mixed strategy of locally linear and globally nonlinear computations, where the local linear computation selectively redistributes recurrent gain to enhance concept discrimination. These results provide testable predictions for neurophysiological experiments.

                <p>by Huijuan Zhou, Jun Chen, Xianyang Zhang</p>

Microbiome sequencing data are inherently sparse and compositional, with excessive zeros arising from biological absence or insufficient sampling. These zeros pose significant challenges for downstream analyses, particularly those that require log-transformation. We introduce BMDD (BiModal Dirichlet Distribution), a novel probabilistic modeling framework for accurate imputation of microbiome sequencing data. Unlike existing imputation approaches that assume unimodal abundance, BMDD captures the bimodal abundance distribution of the taxa via a mixture of Dirichlet priors. It uses variational inference and a scalable expectation-maximization algorithm for efficient imputation. Through simulations and real microbiome datasets, we demonstrate that BMDD outperforms competing methods in reconstructing true abundances and improves the performance of differential abundance analysis. Through multiple posterior samples, BMDD enables robust inference by accounting for uncertainty in zero imputation. Our method offers a principled and computationally efficient solution for analyzing high-dimensional, zero-inflated microbiome sequencing data and is broadly applicable in microbial biomarker discovery and host-microbiome interaction studies.

                <p>by Etienne Gosselin, Sophie Bagur, Sara Jamali, Jean-Luc Puel, Jérôme Bourien, Brice Bathellier</p>

Early studies on orientation selectivity in the visual cortex have suggested that sensory systems generate new feature representations at specific processing stages. Many observations challenge this view, but in the absence of systematic, multistage measurements, the logic of how feature tuning emerges remains elusive. Here, using a generic approach based on representational similarity analysis with a noise-corrected population metric, we demonstrate in the mouse auditory system that feature representations evolve gradually with, in some cases, major, feature-specific improvements at particular stages. We observe that single frequency tuning is already fully developed in the cochlear nucleus, the first stage of processing, while tuning to higher-order features improves up to the auditory cortex, with major steps in the inferior colliculus for amplitude modulation frequency or noise bandwidth tuning and in the cortex for frequency modulation direction and for complex sound identity or direction. Moreover, we observe that intensity tuning is established in a feature-ependent manner, earlier for pure frequencies than for more complex sounds. This indicates that auditory feature computations are a mix of stepwise and gradual processes which together contribute to decorrelate sound representations.

Understanding how transcription factors regulate organized cellular diversity in developing tissues remains a major challenge due to their pleiotropic functions. We addressed this by monitoring and genetically modulating the activity of PAX3 and PAX7 during the specification of neural progenitor pools in the embryonic spinal cord. Using mouse models, we show that the balance between the transcriptional activating and repressing functions of these factors is modulated along the dorsoventral axis and is instructive to the patterning of spinal progenitor pools. By combining loss-of-function experiments with functional genomics in spinal organoids, we demonstrate that PAX-mediated repression and activation rely on distinct <i>cis-</i>regulatory genomic modules. This enables both the coexistence of their dual activity in dorsal cell progenitors and the specific control of two major differentiation programs. PAX promote H3K27me3 deposition at silencers to repress ventral identities, while at enhancers, they act as pioneer factors, opening and activating <i>cis-</i>regulatory modules to specify dorsal-most identities. Finally, we show that this pioneer activity is restricted to cells exposed to BMP morphogens, ensuring spatial specificity. These findings reveal how PAX proteins, modulated by morphogen gradients, orchestrate neuronal diversity in the spinal cord, providing a robust framework for neural subtype specification.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>We aimed to evaluate the clinical utility of serum neurofilament light chain (sNfL) and cardiac troponin T (cTnT) in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and assess whether their combination improves diagnostic accuracy.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We retrospectively analyzed 293 ALS patients, 85 neurodegenerative disease controls, and 29 healthy controls. A validation cohort of 501 ALS patients was analyzed to confirm reproducibility of the results. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed for sNfL, cTnT, and their combination, and the area under the curve (AUC) was compared across groups. An ALS-specific cTnT cut-off of 8.35ng/L was determined using the Youden index and applied in subgroup analyses, in which “biomarker-negative” ALS patients were compared to “biomarker-positive” patients regarding disease duration and progression.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>sNfL showed excellent performance in discriminating ALS patients from healthy controls (AUC = 0.94), but only moderate performance in discriminating neurodegenerative disease controls (AUC = 0.82). Combining sNfL and cTnT improved diagnostic accuracy for ALS over neurodegenerative controls, with an AUC of 0.90, whereas cTnT alone showed an AUC of 0.77. The validation cohort showed similar AUCs. “Biomarker-negative” ALS patients had a longer disease duration (73.0 vs 18.0 months, <i>p</i> = 0.0003) and a lower progression rate (0.19 vs 0.70 points per months, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001) than “biomarker-positive” patients.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Although sNfL alone performs well in distinguishing ALS from healthy controls, repurposing cTnT for ALS provides additional value in discriminating ALS from disease controls. The combination of sNfL and cTnT improves diagnostic accuracy and may help identify prognostically distinct ALS subgroups. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                Aim This study aims to compare the isokinetic strength of the Hamstrings against the Quadriceps for Football, Cricket, and Tennis among semi-professional athletes. Methodology An observational, cross-sectional study was conducted with the inclusion of participants between 18-40 years, both males and females having an active athlete profile playing Football, Cricket, and Tennis as semi-professional (competing in inter-collegiate, national-level tournaments in the UAE). The minimum duration for each sport was one hour per day and three to five times per week. A total of 66 participants were enrolled, with 22 participants in each group. The ISOMOVE isokinetic device was used to assess the strength of dynamically contracting Quadriceps concentrically against eccentric contraction of the Hamstring muscles to determine the functional ratio (H/Q ratio). Results Age-wise distribution of players showed predominant male participants with 77.3% of players in Football, 68.2% in Cricket, and 59.1% in Tennis. The comparison for the mean peaks of isokinetic strength for functional ratio suggested a statistically significant difference between the three sports (Football p<0.001, Cricket p=0.006, Tennis p =0.003). The findings suggested that the highest H/Q ratio was found in Football players with a mean value of 0.51±0.07, followed by Cricket and Tennis with a mean of 0.48±0.08 and 0.42±0.05, respectively (p<0.05). Conclusion The isokinetic strength testing for H/Q ratio was found to be higher in Football players, followed by Cricket and Tennis players for semi-professional athletes. The study concluded that the functional H/Q ratio varies between three similar sports as the demand on the target muscle would specifically vary. Thus, semi-professional players who play multiple games should consider enhancing FR for the Hamstring to the Quadriceps, besides the strength and training specific to sports, to avoid the risk of injuries.

                Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a common sexually transmitted infection that can lead to HPV-related cancers such as cervical cancer and other cancers such as anal, vaginal, and penile cancer. HPV rarely produces symptoms and cannot be cured or treated; therefore, vaccination is essential to protect against HPV and HPV-related diseases. However, young Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander (hereafter, respectfully, ‘Aboriginal’) people are not receiving their HPV vaccine dose, resulting in missed opportunities to be protected from HPV-related cancers. Health promotion is a critical way to empower people to take ownership over and control their health and is a core function of public health. One way to deliver health promotion is through social media platforms. In recent COVID-19 times, we have seen the effect of social media on public health messaging, both positive and harmful. In particular, Instagram influencers have had a profound impact on pro- and anti-vaccination messages. Aboriginal adolescents aged 13-15 years old have strong engagement with social media platforms. Combining co-created health promotion messages with local ‘micro-Influencers’ is a novel way to improve HPV vaccination rates. The overall aim of this project is to improve the rates of HPV vaccination amongst young Aboriginal people. We will achieve this through: i) co-creation of health promotion messages, ii) developing and delivering a social media campaign and iii) evaluating the effectiveness of the campaign through an interrupted time-series design. We hypothesise that the co-creation of health promotion messages with young Aboriginal people and their families and utilising the skills of micro-Influencers to engage and influence their followers will result in improvements HPV vaccination rates amongst this population.

                Background The use of ensemble learning has been crucial for improving predictive accuracy in healthcare, especially with regard to critical diagnostic and classification problems. Ensemble models combine the strengths of multiple ML models and reduce the risk of misclassification, which is important in healthcare, where accurate predictions impact patient outcomes. Methods This study introduces the Gradient-Based Weight Optimized Ensemble Model (GBWOEM), an advanced ensemble technique that optimizes the weights of five base models: Decision Tree Classifier (DTC), Random Forest Classifier (RFC), Logistic Regression (LR), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), and K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN), through optimizing the weights. Two variants, GBWOEM-R (random weight initialization) and GBWOEM-U (uniform weight initialization), were proposed and tested on five healthcare-related datasets: breast cancer, Pima Indians Diabetes Database, diabetic retinopathy debrecen, obesity level estimation based on physical condition and eating habits, and thyroid diseases. Results The test accuracy of the proposed models increased to 0.48-8.26% over the traditional ensemble models, such as Adaboost, Catboost, GradientBoost, LightGBM, and XGBoost. Performance metrics, including ROC-AUC analyses, confirmed the model’s efficacy in handling imbalanced data, highlighting its potential for advancing predictive consistency in healthcare applications. Conclusion The GBWOEM model improves the predictive accuracy and offers a reliable solution for healthcare applications even when dealing with the imbalance data. This strategy has the potential to ensure patient outcomes and diagnostic consistency in healthcare settings.

                This study introduces a robust numerical method for addressing the fourth-order Fisher-Kolmogorov reaction-diffusion equation, employing a combination of quintic Hermite splines and Richardson extrapolation. The proposed technique effectively transformed the original equation into a system of linear and nonlinear equations, achieving sixth-order convergence in space and fourth-order convergence in time. A thorough stability analysis confirmed the unconditional stability of the method, ensuring that the numerical solutions remained accurate throughout various perturbation scenarios.

                Zhang et al. reveal that BST2-positive border astrocytes regulate astrocyte-microglia interactions after stroke. Genetic or antibody blockade of BST2 reduces these interactions and improves early functional outcomes, highlighting BST2 as a therapeutic target for brain repair.

                This study isolates extracellular vesicles and particles (EVPs) from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. Biophysical and proteomic analyses demonstrate that sEVs and exomeres are distinctive entities. GALNS and MAN2B1 are identified as potential EM markers. HCC-derived EMs promote oncogenesis via several mechanisms, including PI3K/AKT/mTOR activation, cell cycle progression, and lipidomic dysregulation.

                Sethi et al. define a molecular role for the ATP-dependent chromatin remodeler EP400, a core subunit of the NuA4 HAT complex, in preventing CENP-A mislocalization for chromosomal stability. Cells defective for EP400 function cause mislocalization of CENP-A to non-centromeric regions in a DAXX-dependent manner, leading to CIN phenotypes.

                The blood-brain barrier (BBB) interferes with the treatment of central nervous system disorders owing to the complexity of its structure and restrictive function. Thus, it is challenging to develop central nervous system drug delivery strategies. Specific mode electroacupuncture (EA) stimulation can effectively open the BBB in rats. Here, we used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to comprehensively map the cell population in the Sprague-Dawley rat cerebral cortex. We identified 23 cell subsets and eight types of cells in the brain by cell annotation. scRNA-seq revealed transcriptional changes in the cerebral cortex under EA. Our findings offer valuable insights into the molecular and cellular modifications in the brain resulting from EA intervention and serve as a resource for drug delivery across healthy and diseased states. Innovative approaches to enhance BBB opening will lead to more effective therapeutic plans and enhanced drug delivery.

                The epigenetic adaptation of innate immune cells to inflammatory stimuli, or trained immunity, represents an evolutionarily conserved feature of host defense. Recent advances have revealed that such adaptations can occur at the level of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, resulting in long-lasting epigenetic reprogramming of the immune system. However, a comprehensive mechanistic understanding of these processes remains incomplete, limiting our capacity to predict or therapeutically manipulate the adaptive capacity of hematopoiesis. In this review, we survey the current literature to support a model of hematopoietic memory whose stimulus-specific nuances are shaped by specific cytokine environments and driven by the combinatorial activity of key transcription factors. Comparative analyses underscore the evolutionary conservation and essential biological roles of these factors, suggesting that trained immunity may reflect the strategic repurposing of ancient transcriptional programs for the purpose of enhancing host defense.

">Developmental variation in dopamine neurobiology, neurocognitive functioning, and impulsivity shape substance use trajectories in youth</a></h4>

              
                Theoretical neurodevelopmental models implicate increases in dopamine (DA) function and limitations in neurocognitive control in risk-taking behavior, including substance use, during the transition from adolescence to adulthood. However, developmental relationships between DA, neurocognitive control, and the emergence of substance use are poorly understood. Here, we tested the role of basal ganglia tissue iron, reflecting DA neurophysiology, as well as impulsivity and inhibitory control in longitudinal developmental trajectories of substance use. We leveraged the National Consortium on Alcohol and NeuroDevelopment in Adolescence and Adulthood (NCANDA-A) cohort, a large, multisite longitudinal neuroimaging study of 807 participants (baseline ages 12-22 years old, 50% female, 1-9 annual visits per participant, 6164 sessions total). Substance use, inhibitory control, and tissue iron increased non-linearly during adolescence into young adulthood, concurrent with decreases in impulsivity. Non-linear Growth Mixture Models identified four common trajectories of substance use: low (no- or low levels of use across visits; 30% of participants), youth peak (peak use in adolescence/young adulthood followed by declines; 26%), adolescent increasing (early, steep linear increases in use from adolescence into adulthood; 17%), and adult increasing (low use in adolescence, followed by late linear increases into adulthood; 26%). We show that increased substance use was associated with a phenotype of high impulsivity, low inhibitory control, and low basal ganglia tissue iron, particularly in early adolescence in individuals who displayed youth peak patterns in substance use trajectories. These findings highlight that early developmental differences in DA-related neurobiology and associated impulsivity and cognitive control shape distinct trajectories of adolescent substance use, underscoring adolescence as a critical window for the early identification and implementation of neurodevelopmentally sensitive interventions for substance use disorders.

">APOE3 astrocytes can rescue lipid abnormalities and dystrophic neurites of APOE4 human neurons</a></h4>

              
                Lipid abnormalities are emerging as key pathogenic mechanisms in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Lewy body dementia. Astrocytes in the brain provide APOE proteins and influence neuronal metabolism and health. Using live cell imaging and objective neurite imaging techniques, we show that following induction of cellular lipid (cholesterol and triglycerides) load by inhibiting the lysosomal cholesterol transport protein NPC1 in human neuron-astrocyte co-cultures, that human astrocytes CRISPR edited to be either APOE3 or 4 variants have different effects on rescuing dystrophic neurites, where axons and dendrites of nerve cells become disfigured. APOE3, but not APOE4 or APOEKO, astrocytes prevented cholesterol and lipid induced neurite damage in APOE4 neurons. In the media of APOE3 co-cultured astrocytes with neurons the HDL-like particles were larger and presumably more lipidated than equivalent APOE4 co-cultures. This discovery highlights that living APOE3 astrocytes control key biological mechanisms by physiologically enhancing lipid cellular homeostasis, that can rescue lipid-induced neurite structural abnormalities relevant to Alzheimer's disease and neurodegenerative diseases.

">Neurons in the bat auditory cortex encode class and complexity of future vocalizations</a></h4>

              
                Vocal production is a complex behavior across the animal kingdom that relies on coordinated motor and auditory networks. However, the contribution of sensory areas in vocal control remains poorly understood. Here, we investigated vocalization-related activity in a major auditory processing area in the mammalian brain, the auditory cortex. We recorded neuronal spike rates in an audio-vocal specialist, the bat Carollia perspicillata, which emits vocalizations to echolocate and for social communication. We found distinct spike patterns encoding echolocation and communication calls several hundred milliseconds before vocal onset. Neuronal activity not only contained information about the vocalization category, but also reflected temporal complexity, specifically the syllable amount in a communication sequence. These vocalization-specific firing patterns were dependent on the neuron's frequency receptive field. Our results indicate that single neurons in the auditory cortex not only process acoustic information but also encode the class and temporal structure of future vocal output.

">Long-term co-maturation of stem cell-derived microglia and neuronal networks: an optimized platform to assess human microglial contribution to neuronal function</a></h4>

              
                Microglia-neuron interactions play a central role in a variety of central nervous system disorders. Technologies using human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) have been developed to model human brain cells with the goal to understand their function. To effectively study neuro-immune crosstalk and investigate microglial contributions to neuronal network development and function, both microglia and neurons should co-mature allowing for long-term interactions throughout their differentiation. Here, we present a co-maturation protocol that robustly generates glutamatergic neuronal networks containing human iPSC-derived microglia. We validated the long-term co-cultures using single-cell transcriptomics, imaging and neuronal activity readouts. We show that astrocytes were required for long-term survival of microglia and for their integration into neuronal networks. Our co-maturation approach induced the typical ramified microglia morphology and characteristic microglia-neuron interactions. Homeostatic markers like P2RY12 and TMEM119 and neuronal remodeling associated genes were upregulated compared to microglia monocultures, highlighting the necessity of the environment to generate and maintain the context-dependent microglia signature in vitro. In this manuscript, we include the full optimization process of our co-maturation approach, a comprehensive description of the protocol, practical guidelines and troubleshooting tips. Our co-maturation model provides a powerful tool to assess the role of human microglia in modulating neuronal function and development in health and disease.

">Narrative Context Shifts Gaze from Visual to Semantic Salience</a></h4>

              
                Humans make over a hundred thousand eye movements daily to gather visual information. But what determines where we look? Current computational models typically link gaze behaviour to visual features of isolated images, but we know that eye movements are also strongly shaped by cognitive goals: Observers gather information that helps them to understand, rather than just represent, the world. Within this framework, observers should focus more on information that updates one's understanding of the environment, and less on what is purely visually salient. Here we tested this hypothesis using a free-viewing paradigm of narratives where we experimentally manipulated the meaningfulness of temporal context by either presenting pictures in a coherent, i.e. correct, order, or in a temporally shuffled order. We developed a novel approach to quantify which visual information is semantically salient (i.e., important for understanding): we separately obtained language narratives for images in stories, and computed the contextual surprisal of visual objects using a large language model. The ability of this semantic saliency model in explaining gaze behaviour was compared to a state-of-the art model of visual saliency (DeepGaze-II). We found that individuals looked relatively more often and more quickly at semantically salient objects when images were presented in coherent compared to shuffled order. In contrast, visual salience did not better account for gaze behaviour in coherent than shuffled order. These findings highlight how internal contextual models guide visual sampling and demonstrate that language models could offer a powerful tool for capturing gaze behavior in richer, meaningful settings.

">Slow Transition to Low-Dimensional Chaos in Heavy-Tailed Recurrent Neural Networks</a></h4>

              
                Growing evidence suggests that synaptic weights in the brain follow heavy-tailed distributions, yet most theoretical analyses of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) assume Gaussian connectivity. We systematically study the activity of RNNs with random weights drawn from biologically plausible Levy alpha-stable distributions. While mean-field theory for the infinite system predicts that the quiescent state is always unstable---implying ubiquitous chaos---our finite-size analysis reveals a sharp transition between quiescent and chaotic dynamics. We theoretically predict the gain at which the finite system transitions from quiescent to chaotic dynamics, and validate it through simulations. Compared to Gaussian networks, finite heavy-tailed RNNs exhibit a broader gain regime near the edge of chaos, namely, a slow transition to chaos. However, this robustness comes with a tradeoff: heavier tails reduce the Lyapunov dimension of the attractor, indicating lower effective dimensionality. Our results reveal a biologically aligned tradeoff between the robustness of dynamics near the edge of chaos and the richness of high-dimensional neural activity. By analytically characterizing the transition point in finite-size networks---where mean-field theory breaks down---we provide a tractable framework for understanding dynamics in realistically sized, heavy-tailed neural circuits.

">A schizophrenia-associated radial glia cell state perturbs early human brain development</a></h4>

              
                Multidisciplinary evidence support a neurodevelopmental origin for schizophrenia, yet the mechanistic translation of known risk factors remains poorly understood. In this study, we leverage multi-lineage, forebrain-patterned organoids derived from monozygotic twins discordant for schizophrenia, integrating single-cell transcriptomic and epigenomic profiling to uncover disease-associated gene expression and chromatin accessibility topics. By constructing fate probability maps, we identify an accelerated developmental trajectory emerging from a distinct, schizophrenia-associated radial glia cell state, and reveal unique interactions among schizophrenia risk genes through unbiased multimodal analyses. Further, we confirm that schizophrenia-enriched states persist in differentiated lineages and disrupt synaptic programs, accompanied by molecular and cellular phenotypes mimicking observed disease pathology. Collectively, our findings delineate an early disruption in forebrain development, providing novel mechanistic insights into the origins of schizophrenia risk.

">Impaired larval motor function in a zebrafish Stathmin-2 (STMN2) knockout model</a></h4>

              
                Stathmin-2 (STMN2) is a microtubule associated protein that plays a role in the stability of microtubules of axons in the nervous system of animals. In this study we generated a novel zebrafish STMN2 knockout (KO) model. STMN2 is represented by two genes in the zebrafish genome: stmn2a and stmn2b. Using the CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenic system we selected founder fish lines harbouring frameshift mutations in both genes and bred these together to generate a double stmn2a and stmn2b KO model. Using these models, we observed increased developmental lethality in our double stmn2a and stmn2b KO model and impaired motor function at larval stages of development. Examination of the larval neuromuscular junction (NMJ) revealed a slight increase in the number of orphaned NMJs in trunk musculature as well as a reduction in amplitude of miniature endplate currents in our double stmn2a and stmn2b KO model. In a final series of experiments, we show impaired ventral root axon regrowth following transection in double stmn2a and stmn2b KO larvae. Our findings suggest that while not essential for motor axon development, loss of stmn2a and stmn2b expression perturbs the assembly of zebrafish NMJs during development resulting in a minor motor phenotype and impairs that ability to regenerate motor axons following injury.

">Dynamics of Dentate Gyrus Place Cells and Dentate Spikes Signal Spatial and Nonspatial Changes in Environments</a></h4>

              
                The dentate gyrus (DG) is thought to play a key role in the formation of dissociable memory representations for similar contexts. Neurons in the dentate gyrus (DG) receive highly processed spatial and nonspatial sensory information from the medial and lateral entorhinal cortices, respectively. Changes in spatially tuned firing patterns of DG place cells occur after spatial changes to an environment, but the degree to which DG place cells respond to ethologically relevant nonspatial stimuli is largely unknown. Spatial and nonspatial information is thought to be transmitted to the DG during discrete local field potential events called dentate spikes. Here, we tested the extent to which different spatial and nonspatial stimuli modulate place cell firing patterns and dentate spike dynamics. We performed extracellular recordings of DG place cells and local field potentials in rats of both sexes exploring a familiar spatial environment, in which social stimuli and nonsocial odors of varying ethological relevance were presented, and a novel spatial environment. As expected, DG place cells exhibited different firing patterns between familiar and novel environments. Remarkably, a small population of DG place cells changed their firing patterns when social but not nonsocial stimuli were presented in a familiar environment. Additionally, the occurrence of dentate spikes associated with lateral entorhinal cortex inputs increased during exploration of social but not nonsocial stimuli. Altogether, these results suggest that the DG preferentially responds to social stimuli at neuronal and network levels, providing novel insights into how spatial and nonspatial information is integrated in the DG.

">Endothelial Adgrl2 expression and alternative splicing controls the cerebrovasculature</a></h4>

              
                Central nervous system development requires parallel but interrelated processes of neural circuit assembly and vascularization. Intersecting between these two processes, the cell-adhesion G-protein coupled receptor Adgrl2 is expressed in select neuron populations where it has been found to localize and control the assembly of specific synaptic sites. Further, Adgrl2 is found to be expressed in select non-neuronal brain cells, where it is restricted to endothelial cells. Testing for Adgrl2 function in these cells, here we find that endothelial cell specific Adgrl2 deletion results in an impairment in cerebrovascular integrity. To understand how it might be possible for Adgrl2 to function independently in neuronal and endothelial contexts, we analyzed single-cell RNA sequencing datasets for differences in transcriptional identity between these cell classes. Doing so, we find that expression of Adgrl2 mRNA is subject to robust cell type-specific alternative splicing, resulting in distinct isoforms being produced in neurons compared to endothelial cells. Investigating the functional implication of this cell type-specific alternative splicing, we find that forced expression of the neuronal isoform of Adgrl2 in endothelial cells leads to alterations in cerebrovasculature properties. Morphologically, endothelial cells with the non-native neuronal Adgrl2 isoform induce the formation of ectopic glutamatergic synaptic contacts onto endothelial cells, indicating alternations in the cell-cell recognition process. Functionally, in direct contrast to endothelial Adgrl2 deletion, this genetic expression switch instead enhances blood brain barrier integrity. This overly restricted cerebrovascular function results in dysregulation of blood to cerebrospinal fluid homeostasis, enlargement of brain ventricles, and a higher likelihood in the development of hydrocephalus neurological disorder. As such, alternative splicing serves as a cell type specific mechanism that provides isoform specific Adgrl2 for discerning functions controlling neural circuit assembly and cerebrovascular homeostasis.

">Adeno-Associated Virus-Induced Neurotoxicity is Prevented by CpG Depletion</a></h4>

              
                Adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) are the vector of choice for gene delivery to the nervous system. While AAVs have a strong safety profile, recent studies show that AAV causes dendritic loss and synaptic weakening in mouse somatosensory cortex, impacts that are prevented by systemic administration of blockers of Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9), an innate immunoreceptor that detects unmethylated cytosine-guanine (CpG) motifs. However, TLR9 blockers are immunosuppressive and costly. To realize AAV's full potential, it is critical to identify strategies to protect neurons without compromising immunity. Here we find that partially depleting CpG motifs from the AAV genome prevents AAV-induced dendritic loss and synaptic weakening. CpG depletion of transgene and intronic regions via codon-optimized synonymous mutations was protective and did not impair transgene expression in vivo. To facilitate the production and use of lower-CpG AAVs, we created a web-facing application, CpG-Assist Tool (CpG-AT), which allows researchers to quantify the CpG content of any sequence, explore the CpG content of commonly used AAV components, and generate CpG-depleted coding and non-coding sequences. This study identifies CpG depletion as a practical strategy to prevent AAV-induced neural circuit disruption, and provides tools to facilitate CpG reduction to enhance the safety and efficacy of AAV-mediated gene delivery.

">Order-Selective Cells Tile Temporal Space and Predict Order Memory in Humans</a></h4>

              
                Remembering the temporal order of events is critical for episodic memory, allowing us to link individual events into sequences. While the medial temporal lobe and prefrontal cortex are essential for this process, the underlying neural mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here we characterized the representation of order information at the level of single neurons and field potentials recorded from human neurosurgical patients watching naturalistic videos of everyday events and later recalling the order and content of the events depicted. We found order-selective cells (OSCs) in the human hippocampus, amygdala, and orbitofrontal cortex that responded selectively to specific event orders, independent of event content or absolute time. OSCs exhibited transient theta phase precession following their preferred order during both memory encoding and retrieval, the strength of which predicted participants' order memory accuracy. During retrieval, OSC spike timing relative to theta varied with the relative position of their preferred event within the recalled event sequence, enabling selective retrieval of relevant events. These findings reveal a neural substrate for representing, encoding into and retrieving from memory absolute and relative ordinal relationships between discrete events. OSCs tile temporal space into discrete ordinal positions, thereby weaving episodic experiences into coherent temporal narratives.

">Individualised electrophysiological neural field models for the assessment of thalamocortical function in disorders of consciousness: a multicentre study</a></h4>

              
                Understanding the neural mechanisms underlying disorders of consciousness (DoC) remains a major challenge, particularly in distinguishing limited awareness in minimally conscious state (MCS) and complete unawareness in unresponsive wakefulness syndrome, also coined vegetative state (UWS/VS). In this multicentre study, we fitted a biophysically informed corticothalamic neural field model to high-density EEG data from two large independent datasets, comprising 203 UWS patients, 270 MCS patients and 74 healthy controls. We then used the fitted parameters to simulate EEG time series on a per-subject basis and compared empirical and simulated complexity metrics. The model reliably captured the spectral features across different states of consciousness and revealed reduced corticothalamic integrity in DoC patients that was more pronounced in UWS than in MCS, supporting the mesocircuit hypothesis. Furthermore, the simulated EEG reproduced the complexity patterns of the empirical recordings, with permutation entropy emerging as a sensitive marker capable of distinguishing between MCS and UWS for both real and simulated time series.

">AAV-mediated CSNK2B gene replacement rescues ASD-relevant phenotypes and establishes EEG biomarkers for translation in Csnk2b haploinsufficient mice</a></h4>

              
                De novo CSNK2B variants are strongly associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and early-onset epilepsy, yet in vivo therapeutic evidence and translatable biomarkers remain limited. We generated Csnk2b haploinsufficient (Csnk2b+/-) mice that recapitulate core clinical features: ASD-like social and cognitive deficits, heightened anxiety, spontaneous seizures, cortical and hippocampal structural compromise, and reduced PV-interneuron density with impaired cortical inhibition. Neonatal brain-wide AAV-PHP.eB-mediated CSNK2B replacement (hsyn or CAG promoters, retro-orbital P3) restored cortical/hippocampal structure, normalized neuronal numbers, prolonged survival, and ameliorated seizures and ASD-like behaviors with comparable efficacy across promoters. Critically, treatment also corrected quantitative EEG signatures that are directly deployable in human trials: theta and gamma band power were normalized, theta/gamma (and beta/gamma) ratios recovered, and inter-areal coherence and gamma-band effective connectivity were restored, indicating re-established excitation/inhibition balance and large-scale network coordination. These EEG endpoints constitute a compact, noninvasive biomarker panel of target engagement and physiological efficacy that can be harmonized with clinical EEG to support dose finding, early decision-making, and longitudinal monitoring in CSNK2B gene-therapy trials. Together, our data provide preclinical proof-of-concept that early AAV-mediated CSNK2B replacement is therapeutically effective and nominate band-limited EEG metrics as translational readouts to accelerate first-in-human studies for CSNK2B-linked neurodevelopmental disorders.

">Re-emergence of orientation coding in primate IT cortex and deep networks reveals functional hubs for visual processing</a></h4>

              
                The primate visual system is a hierarchical network of brain areas that transform retinal inputs into rich percepts. According to efficient neural coding principles, basic visual features such as orientation, which are already represented in early visual areas, should not be redundantly encoded in higher areas like V4 and inferotemporal (IT) cortex. We tested this hypothesis by quantifying orientation representation throughout the entire visual stream using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) and multivoxel pattern analysis (MVPA) in macaque monkeys watching full-field gratings. Contrary to predictions from efficient coding, we found robust orientation information along the entire visual ventral stream from V1 to IT cortex. Orientation information was distributed in cortical and representational space, especially in IT. Voxels with multivariate responsiveness to faces, objects, and bodies carried more orientation information than highly category-selective voxels. They also displayed stronger connectivity within IT and with upstream areas V1-V4. These finding suggests the existence of functional "hubs" that integrate low- and high-level features through enhanced connectivity. This phenomenon generalized to deep convolutional neural network models with high brain similarity, underscoring the importance of hub-like units in hierarchical processing of complex inputs. Together, our results show that orientation re-emerges in IT cortex not through redundancy but as a computational byproduct of functional diversity and connectivity, propounding the existence of "hub" neurons that may support flexible, integrative visual processing beyond object recognition.

">The pro-, but not anti-nociceptive effects of Cannabidiol depend on Trpa1b in larval Zebrafish</a></h4>

              
                The promiscuous ligand cannabidiol (CBD) shows promise as an analgesic, but its complex pharmacodynamics has made it difficult to identify its mechanism(s) of action. Numerous putative CBD receptors including cannabinoid receptors CB1 and CB2, as well as Trpv1 and Trpa1, the receptors for capsaicin and mustard-oil (AITC) respectively, have been proposed to contribute to CBD-mediated analgesia. Larval zebrafish have several attributes that lend themselves to inquiries into the biology of nociception. The neural circuits underlying nociception in zebrafish larvae are highly analogous to those found in higher vertebrates. Notably, the small size and optical clarity of zebrafish enable holistic evaluation of analgesic function utilizing behavioral and imaging platforms. Here we report that in larval zebrafish CBD serves both anti- and pro-nociceptive functions. Utilizing place aversion assays as a proxy for nociception, we found that low concentrations of CBD inhibit aversion to noxious chemical stimuli including AITC and acetic acid. Counterintuitively, we found that higher concentrations of CBD potentiated nocifensive behavior as measured by enhanced thermal aversion and increased locomotion. Knockdown of Trpa1b eliminated the algogenic effects of CBD while having no effect on its analgesic properties, as it abolished trpa1b+ sensory neuron responses to CBD, CBD-evoked thermal hypersensitivity, and increased locomotion in Trpa1b-null animals. Strikingly, CBD profoundly inhibited thermal aversion to noxious heat in Trpa1b-null animals but not in wildtype animals, indicating that CBD-mediated Trpa1b activation can oppose the analgesic properties of CBD. These studies provide a framework to investigate the genetic and neural substrates of CBD-mediated analgesia and nociception.

">Choice-induced preference change under a sequential-sampling model framework</a></h4>

              
                Sequential sampling models of choice, such as the drift-diffusion model (DDM), are frequently fit to empirical data to account for a variety of effects related to accuracy/consistency, response time (RT), and sometimes confidence. However, no model in this class has been shown to account for the phenomenon known as choice-induced preference change, wherein decision makers tend to rate options higher after they choose them and lower after they reject them (and often choose the option that they had initially rated lower). Studies have reported choice-induced preference change for many decades, and the principal findings are robust. The resulting spreading of alternatives (SoA) in terms of their subjective value ratings is incompatible with traditional sequential sampling models, which consider the rated values of the options to be stationary throughout choice deliberation. Here, we propose that extending the basic DDM to incorporate independent attributes into the drift rate can allow this class of model to account for SoA. Critically, the extended model assumes that choice deliberation does not always involve the same set of attributes as is involved in individual evaluations of the same options. We show that this model can generate SoA (while simultaneously accounting for consistency and RT), as well as the relationships between SoA and choice difficulty, attribute disparity, and RT previously reported in the literature.

">Bladder mucosal afferents detect UTI and aid pathogen clearance</a></h4>

              
                The bladder is innervated by a complex network of sensory neurons that detect and transmit mechanical and chemical signals to the central nervous system, regulating both urine storage and voiding, as well as mediating sensations of bladder fullness and pain. While stretch-sensitive afferents within the bladder wall are known to monitor filling, the contribution of stretch-insensitive afferents that reside within the bladder mucosa to bladder sensation and function remains unclear. Here, we establish a novel mouse model of selective bladder mucosal afferent denervation using intravesical instillation of resiniferatoxin (RTX) to define the functional roles of these fibres in health and disease. We assessed the impact of mucosal denervation on sensory nerve activity and bladder function in healthy mice and in a model of urinary tract infection (UTI) induced by acute bacterial challenge with uropathogenic E. coli. We show that mucosa-innervating afferents do not influence bladder distension responses or voiding function under healthy conditions. In contrast, during UTI, these afferents become hypersensitive and serve as critical drivers of infection-induced pelvic pain and urinary frequency, responses that contribute to enhanced bacterial clearance. Together, these findings identify bladder mucosal afferents as key sensors of pathogenic challenge and reveal a previously unrecognised mechanism that drives behavioural responses to reduce the burden and extent of UTI.

">Adolescent social profiles predict adult social behaviour, monoamine brain content and regional gene expression</a></h4>

              
                The study of inter-individual variability in animal behaviors during cognitive processes is crucial to better grasp the emergence of personality traits in healthy animals. Social experiences occurring at adolescence can affect the expression of the behavioural variability as it is a critical period of brain and cognitive plasticity. Here, we asked how individual variability of social profiles is shaped at adolescence and whether the profiles are associated with regional brain metabolites and gene expressions in the adult brain. At adolescence we determined a 'dominant' profile expressing more dominance, a 'submissive' profile expressing more submission and an 'explorer' profile showing more novelty exploration than social interaction. Adolescent social behaviors are conserved at adulthood. Our data suggest that dominance tendencies already present at adolescence are likely to stabilize throughout life, thus shaping future social behaviors. Our results show that social profiles are not related to sex and life environment. However, being more dominant, interactive and socially motivated shape dopaminergic olfactory activity at adolescence. Also, showing the explorer or submissive profiles is associated with an opposite serotonin pattern in the cerebellum, but a similar kynurenine pattern in the prefrontal cortex and cerebellum, thus pointing toward major neurotransmitter systems in key regions for brain health. This work opens new perspectives on the importance of studying social profiles early in life and the individual neurobiological associated features that could potentially predict individual vulnerability.

">Kappa opioid receptors delay sucrose self-administration by modulating dopamine ramps before operant responding</a></h4>

              
                Chronic consumption of drugs of abuse increases sensitivity of the dynorphin/kappa opioid receptor (KOR) stress system, which reduces striatal dopamine signaling and promotes drug taking. However, there is mixed evidence on how KOR-modulation of dopamine affects operant behavior in the absence of addiction. To address this gap, we injected dLight1.2 in the nucleus accumbens of male and female C57BL/6J mice and trained them to self-administer sucrose. Mice were injected with the KOR agonist U50,488H, with or without the KOR antagonist aticaprant, prior to each session. U50,488H did not affect dopamine responses during the lever press and did not alter total presses or consumption. The primary effects of KOR activation were to delay initiation of lever pressing, and to diminish the rapid ramp-up in dopamine seen before lever presses. The first lever press of each session was preceded by the largest dopamine ramp; however, ramp size did not correlate with latency under any condition. We further tested whether KOR-modulation of dopamine ramps affects behavior throughout the session. We found that the total amount of dopamine activity 10 seconds before the lever press predicted when the next lever press would occur, specifically after U50,488H injection. When the phasic peaks were subtracted from this to quantify a slower dopamine ramp, time to the next lever press could be predicted and this effect was strongest after U50,488H injection. As U50,488H reduces basal dopamine signaling, we propose that dopamine ramps prior to behavior have a larger signal-to-noise ratio during KOR activation. This relatively greater increase in dopamine from baseline could increase the salience of the decision to perform reward-associated actions, which may play a role in habitual behaviors like drug taking.

">A toolbox for navigating and analyzing the spatiotemporal properties of retinal waves</a></h4>

              
                The precise development of the visual system is driven by retinal waves, which are bursts of spontaneous activity that propagate across retinal neurons in a wave-like fashion. In mice, retinal waves begin embryonically and continue until eye opening at the end of the second postnatal week. During this time, the mechanisms for generating and propagating retinal waves are changing, thus causing retinal waves to exhibit highly dynamic spatiotemporal properties from one day to the next. Critically, the spatiotemporal properties of retinal waves have been shown to instruct the development of the visual system, including eye-specific segregation, retinotopic mapping, direction selectivity, and potentially retinal vascularization. Currently, there is no method for the automatic detection and high-throughput analysis of the spatiotemporal properties of retinal waves. To overcome this barrier, we have created a toolbox to automatically detect retinal waves and analyze their spatiotemporal properties from data collected using multielectrode arrays or calcium imaging. We apply this toolbox to enrich our understanding of retinal waves. First, we recapitulate and uncover novel dynamic spatiotemporal properties of retinal waves in the first two postnatal weeks. Second, we apply this toolbox on ultra long physiological recordings to demonstrate that the spatiotemporal properties of waves change throughout the day in an age-dependent manner. Third, we demonstrate that this toolbox can detect waves in the presence of pharmacological agents that increase the baseline firing of neurons, potentially enabling the discovery of novel factors that perturb retinal waves and visual development. Our toolbox is an intuitive interface that provides a systemized method to segregate and analyze retinal waves and other wave-like data.

                Incorporating Indigenous knowledge into Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) is recognized as one of the key strategies to support culturally responsive and inclusive education. In the sections that follow, we draw upon current international literature and studies to identify approaches with respect to embedding Indigenous knowledge into TVET curricula - strategies and challenges; outcomes. Eighty-five peer-reviewed articles between 2020 and 2025 were reviewed according to PRISMA 2020, concentrating on pedagogical models and methods, curriculum construction process, community involvement and student performance. The outcomes reveal that effective integration is grounded on culturally relevant teaching resources and active engagement with indigenous communities, along with traditional knowledge systems coupling to technical skills. Some of the challenges involve institutionalized barriers, a lack of teacher training and resources can restrict the ways in which we see Indigenous perspectives incorporated in meaningful ways. Notwithstanding these obstacles, there is evidence that students who experience Indigenous knowledge in TVET display higher levels of cultural awareness and identity formation, and engagement with learning; their communities are more empowered to participate in education. The review emphasizes the necessity for an overall framework and policies supporting sustainable integration, and advises that long-term effects on employability, social inclusion and community development be investigated in future studies. By highlighting the importance of Indigenous knowledge in TVET, this study adds to discussions on culturally-responsive pedagogical practice and offers practical advice for educators, policy makers and researchers aiming to improve TVET practices across the world.

                In the contemporary digital landscape, social media platforms have radically reshaped consumer-brand interactions, with Instagram emerging as a pivotal channel for luxury brand marketing. This study investigates the adoption of luxury products through Instagram by integrating psychological, social, and demographic predictors with advanced analytical methodologies. Utilizing a comprehensive dataset of 205 respondents, we examine how Instagram engagement metrics—such as time spent on the platform, influencer marketing, sponsored advertisements, and interactive content—impact consumer adoption behaviours. Employing multiple statistical techniques including multiple linear regression, logistic regression, and path analysis, alongside machine learning models like Support Vector Machines (SVM) and decision trees, we identify the primary drivers of purchase intention and brand trustworthiness in the luxury context. Notably, while surface-level engagement metrics show limited predictive power, factors such as brand trust, prestige, uniqueness, and personalized recommendations have strong influences on consumer purchase intention. The SVM model accurately predicts adoption likelihood with 87% accuracy, underscoring the efficacy of psychological and social variables as discriminators. Additionally, sentiment analysis of qualitative feedback reveals predominantly positive consumer attitudes toward Instagram marketing strategies. Our findings highlight the nuanced role of brand-related psychological constructs and demographic variables in shaping luxury product adoption, offering actionable insights for marketers aiming to optimize Instagram’s potential in luxury branding. This integrative approach advances both theoretical understanding and practical applications, reinforcing the importance of authenticity, emotional connection, and targeted psychographic segmentation in luxury digital marketing.

                Background Leprosy, or Hansen’s disease, is a chronic infectious disease that primarily affects the skin and peripheral nervous system, often leading to disabilities, including trophic ulcers (TU). The role of vitamin D and vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene polymorphisms in the development of TU among leprosy patients remain unclear. Objective This study aims to investigate the differences in serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels and the frequency of VDR gene FokI polymorphism between leprosy patients with and without TU, and to evaluate their association with the occurrence of TU. Methods This Institutional Review Board-approved, single-center, observational, analytic case-control study will enroll adult leprosy patients from the Dermatology and Venereology Clinic at Dr. Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital in Jakarta, Indonesia. Participants will be divided into cases (patients with TU) and controls (patients without TU). Serum 25(OH)D levels will be measured using a chemiluminescence immunoassay, and FokI polymorphism detection is conducted through polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) methods. A total of 82 participants (41 cases and 41 controls) will be recruited. Statistical analysis will be performed to evaluate the differences and associations. Results Data collection commenced in March 2024 and was completed in September 2024, during the Indonesia’s dry season. Data analysis and reporting are expected to be finalized by January 2025. Discussion The findings of this study will enhance the current understanding of the role of the vitamin D axis in the development of TU among leprosy patients. This could lead to new therapeutic strategies, such as vitamin D supplementation or personalized medicine based on genetic profiling, potentially reducing the burden of TU among leprosy patients.

                <p>Epileptic seizures involve the brain transitioning from a resting state to an abnormal state of synchronized bursting, akin to a bifurcation in dynamical systems where a parameter shift triggers a qualitative change in behavior. A comprehensive model was previously developed that used dynamical equations capable of simulating 16 "dynamotypes" of seizures that span the full range of theoretical first-order dynamics. The current work is a tool to understand and implement this model with the goal of generating a wide range of synthetic seizures. We present a dynamical atlas of all 16 possible onset&ndash;offset bifurcation combinations, each characterized by distinct features in simulated EEG-like recordings. We include a tutorial and graphical user interphase that generates diverse simulated seizures. In addition, we include methods to add realistic noise and filtering effects to enhance their resemblance to human EEG data. This toolbox has two purposes: it is a practical, educational demonstration of the dynamical principles underlying seizure bifurcations, and it provides the algorithms necessary to produce large numbers of realistic, diverse seizure patterns that have similar noise and filtering characteristics as human EEG. This generative model can aid in training seizure detection algorithms, understanding brain dynamical behavior for clinicians, and exploring the impact of noise on EEG recordings and detection algorithms.</p>

Yet, sampling distributions are poorly understood and rarely explicitly considered when making inferences. In this tutorial and commentary, I demonstrate how to use simulations to illustrate sampling distributions to answer simple practical questions: for instance, if we could run thousands of experiments, what would the outcome look like? What do these simulations tell us about the results from a single experiment? Such simulations can be run a priori, given expected results, or a posteriori, using existing datasets. Both approaches can help make explicit the data generating process and the sources of variability; they also reveal the large uncertainty in our experimental estimation and lead to the sobering realization that, in most situations, we should not make a big deal out of results from a single experiment. Simulations can also help demonstrate how the selection of effect sizes conditional on some arbitrary cutoff (<I>p</I> &le; 0.05) leads to a literature filled with false positives, a powerful illustration of the damage done in part by researchers&rsquo; over-confidence in their statistical tools. The tutorial focuses on graphical descriptions and covers examples using correlation analyses, proportion data, and response latency data.

                <p>by Ernesto Tavares-Neto, Marcel Aguilella-Arzo, Vicente M. Aguilella</p>

Electrostatic interactions are crucial for protein structure and function, especially in mesoscopic protein channels where ion selectivity is largely governed by the protein’s electrostatic properties. Understanding the protonation state of ionizable residues across pH values —often described by their p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub>— is key to linking structure and function. However, experimental p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub> determination is challenging, typically carried out using Nuclear Magnetic Resonance only in a limited number of membrane proteins. Thus, computational methods are the primary alternative. Constant pH Molecular Dynamics (CpHMD) simulation is one of the most accurate p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub> prediction methods in proteins that contain many charged residues since it captures the coupling between conformational dynamics and residue protonation. Here we study the charge state of a general diffusion porin, OmpF, in which protons exert a crucial regulation of the channel discrimination of small inorganic ions as well as antibiotic translocation. We compare different p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub> prediction methods, using CpHMD as a benchmark, and discuss the somewhat unusual titration of several acidic residues. The most widely used p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub> prediction methods, though effective for globular proteins, fall short for membrane-embedded channels either because they were trained using pKa measurements in globular proteins or because of a poor description of the lipidic environment.

                <p>by Jiawen Chang, Zhuda Yang, Changsong Zhou</p>

The spatiotemporal patterns of neural dynamics are jointly shaped by directed structural interactions and heterogeneous intrinsic features of the neural components. Despite well-developed methods for estimating directionality in network connections from network of homogeneous nodes, how local heterogeneity impacts on directionality estimation remains poorly understood. In particular, the role of excitatory-inhibitory interactions in shaping network directionality and how these interactions should be incorporated into reconstruction frameworks remain largely unexplored. Here, we present a novel reconstruction framework that simultaneously estimates effective heterogeneity across network nodes and asymmetric network connections from neural activity and symmetric connection, both are assessible in experimental data, validated using macaque cortical connectivity data and several circuit models. We found that the estimated local heterogeneity remains consistent across various forms of parameterized local circuit heterogeneity. Furthermore, we demonstrated and quantified how hidden local inhibitory populations only modify within-region connection strengths, elucidating the functional equivalence between dynamics of excitatory-inhibitory networks and purely observing excitatory networks when estimating effective heterogeneity and asymmetry. Finally, we demonstrated the sampling interval effect in estimating network interactions with respect to the sampling resolution. Together, our results not only provide a unified framework for evaluating relative functional contributions of local heterogeneity and asymmetry to overall system dynamics but also reveal the fundamental limitations and scaling principles in reconstructing neural circuit connectivity from experimental observations.

                <p>by Krutika Patidar, Ashlee N. Ford Versypt</p>

The progression of diabetic kidney disease is often characterized by early dysfunction of glomerular endothelial cells, including alterations in fenestration size and number linked to impaired glomerular filtration. However, the cellular mechanisms regulating fenestrations in glomerular endothelial cells remain poorly understood due to limitations in existing <i>in vitro</i> models, challenges in imaging small fenestrations <i>in vivo</i>, and inconsistencies between <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> findings. This study used a logic-based protein-protein interaction network model with normalized Hill functions for dynamics to explore how glucose-mediated signaling dysregulation impacts fenestration dynamics in glomerular endothelial cells. Key drivers of fenestration loss and size changes were identified by incorporating signaling pathways related to actin remodeling, myosin light chain kinase, Rho-associated kinase, calcium, and VEGF and its receptors. The model predicted how hyperglycemia in diabetic mice leads to significant fenestration loss and increased size of fenestrations. Glycemic control in the pre-diabetic stage mitigated signaling dysregulation but was less effective as diabetic kidney disease developed and progressed. The model suggested alternative disease intervention strategies to maintain the integrity of the fenestration structure, such as targeting Rho-associated kinase, VEGF-A, NFκB, and actin stress fibers.

                <p>by Yiyuan Teresa Huang, Zenas C. Chao</p>

Our brain uses prior experience to anticipate the timing of upcoming events. This dynamic process can be modeled using a hazard function derived from the probability distribution of event timings. However, the contexts of an event can lead to various probability distributions for the same event, and it remains unclear how the brain integrates these distributions into a coherent temporal prediction. In this study, we create a foreperiod sequence paradigm consisting of a sequence of paired trials, where in each trial, participants respond to a target signal after a specified time interval (i.e., foreperiod) following a warning cue. The prediction of the target onset in the second trial can be based on two probability distributions: the unconditional probability of the second foreperiod and its conditional probability given the foreperiod in the first trial. These probability distributions are then transformed into hazard functions to represent the unconditional and conditional temporal predictions. The behavioral model incorporating both predictions and their mutual modulation provides the best fit for reaction times to the target signal, indicating that both temporal statistics are integrated to make predictions. We further show that electroencephalographic source signals are also best reconstructed when integrating both predictions. Specifically, the unconditional and conditional predictions are encoded separately in the posterior and anterior brain regions, and integration of these two types of predictive processing requires a third region, particularly the right posterior cingulate area. Our study reveals brain networks that integrate multilevel temporal information, offering insight into the hierarchical predictive coding of time.

Neurons can adjust synaptic output according to the postsynaptic partners. However, the target-specific regulation of synaptic structures within individual neurons in the central nervous system remains unresolved. Applying the CRISPR/Cas9-mediated split-GFP tagging, we visualized the endogenous active zone scaffold protein, Bruchpilot (Brp), in specific cells. This technology enabled the spatial characterization of the presynaptic scaffolds only within the Kenyon cells (KCs) of the <i>Drosophila</i> mushroom bodies. We found the patterned accumulation of Brp among the compartments of axon terminals, where a KC synapses onto different postsynaptic neurons. Mechanistically, the localized octopaminergic projections along γ KC terminals regulate this compartmental Brp heterogeneity via Octβ2R and cAMP signaling. We further found that physiological stress, such as food or sleep deprivation reorganizes this intracellular pattern in an octopamine-dependent manner. Such concurrent regulation of local active zone assemblies thus suggests how the mushroom bodies integrate changing physiological states.

                <p>by Kazuo L. Nakamura, Karen Zhang, Mario R. Mestre, Matías Rojas-Montero, Seth L. Shipman</p>

Retrons are bacterial immune systems that protect a bacterial population against phages by killing infected hosts. Retrons typically comprise a reverse transcriptase (RT), a template noncoding RNA that is partially reverse transcribed into RT-DNA, and a toxic effector. The reverse transcriptase (RT), noncoding RNA, and RT-DNA complex sequester the toxic effector until triggered by phage infection, at which point the toxin is released to induce cell death. Due to their ability to produce single-stranded DNA in vivo, retrons have also been engineered to produce donor templates for genome editing in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. However, the current repertoire of experimentally characterized retrons is limited, with most retrons sourced from clinical and laboratory strains of bacteria. To better understand retron biology and natural diversity, and to expand the current toolbox of retron-based genome editors, we developed a pipeline to isolate retrons and their bacterial hosts from a variety of environmental samples. Here, we identify seven new retron systems, each isolated from a different host bacterium. We characterize DNA production by these retrons and test their ability to defend against a panel of <i>Escherichia coli</i> phages. We find that two of these retrons are disrupted by other elements, in one case a group II intron and in another a separate defense system, yet both retrons still produce RT-DNA. For two other retrons, we further unravel their mechanism of defense by identifying the phage genes responsible for triggering abortive infection. Finally, we engineer these retrons for genome editing in <i>E. coli</i>, demonstrating their potential use in a biotechnological application.

                Background Performance monitoring is essential for enhancing academic staff productivity and institutional accountability in higher education. In Uganda, private chartered universities face challenges in implementing effective performance monitoring systems. This study examines the types and effectiveness of these systems in private chartered universities in Western Uganda. Methods The study was guided by Fayol’s Administrative Management Theory and Vroom’s Expectancy Theory. A concurrent triangulation mixed-methods design was employed. Quantitative data were collected from 386 academic staff using structured questionnaires, while qualitative data were gathered through in-depth interviews with 10 academic deans from four selected universities. Ethical approval was obtained from institutional review boards and the Uganda National Council for Science and Technology (SS3145ES). Descriptive statistics, correlation, and regression analyses were used to analyze quantitative data, while thematic analysis was used for qualitative responses. Results Findings indicate that various performance monitoring tools are in use, including student evaluations, peer reviews, and supervisory assessments. However, their application is often inconsistent, with limited feedback loops and weak integration into staff development initiatives. Quantitative analysis revealed a moderate positive correlation between effective performance monitoring and academic staff performance (r = 0.48, p < 0.05). Regression analysis showed that performance monitoring accounted for 21.3% of the variance in staff performance. Conclusions While performance monitoring tools are present in private chartered universities in Western Uganda, their inconsistent implementation undermines their effectiveness. Strengthening the integration of monitoring outcomes into professional development and decision-making processes could enhance academic staff performance. These findings underscore the need for systematic policy enforcement and capacity-building in performance management practices within the sector.

                Wang et al. reveal a neuroanatomical and functional crosstalk between cholinergic enteric neurons and sensory neurons of the dorsal root ganglia that mediates colonic interoception. While this pathway typically elicits non-aversive reflexes under physiological conditions, inflammatory colitis triggers plasticity that transforms its output to promote aversive behaviors.

                Xu et al. report that intratumoral Citrobacter enrichment correlates with poor overall survival in pancreatic cancer patients. An intratumoral Citrobacter freundii strain metabolizes 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) into inactive products via PreTA. Gimeracil, an inhibitor of human dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase, preserves 5-FU efficacy by blocking PreTA activity.

                Ras mutations drive tumorigenesis yet persist in normal tissues. Elliot et al. explore this paradox, finding that HRASG12V induces bifurcating cell fates in the zebrafish larval epidermis, with lamc2+krt18+ cancer stem cell-like cells emerging from permissive cells at the preneoplastic stage and expressing neutrophil-modulating cytokines that instigate reciprocal tumor-supportive crosstalk.

                Waschina et al. explored how multi-strain probiotic supplementation influenced the gut microbiome and metabolome in very-low-birth-weight infants at high risk of late-onset sepsis. Probiotics promote colonization with beneficial microbes and reduce antibiotic-resistant pathobionts. Late-onset sepsis is associated with lower levels of key fermentation products (lactate and acetate) of probiotics.

The study improves our understanding of the complex interactions in microbial community, providing potential avenues to therapeutic implications.

                Rodriguez et al. employ bioinformatic analyses to discover effectors involved in the virulence of the understudied human fungal pathogen Histoplasma and uncover an expansion of knottins (inhibitor cystine knot proteins). Their algorithms are broadly applicable to other organisms and uncover virulence effectors with diverse predicted structures.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/105319">Molecular dynamics of the matrisome across sea anemone life history</a></h4>

              
                The evolutionary expansion of extracellular matrix (ECM) molecules has been crucial for the establishment of cell adhesion and the transition from unicellular to multicellular life. Members of the early diverging metazoan phylum Cnidaria offer an exceptionally rich perspective into the metazoan core adhesome and its original function in developmental and morphogenetic processes. Here, we present the ensemble of ECM proteins and associated factors for the starlet sea anemone <i>Nematostella vectensis</i> based on in silico prediction and quantitative proteomic analysis of decellularized mesoglea from different life stages. The integration of the matrisome with single-cell transcriptome atlases shows that gastrodermal cells are the primary producers of <i>Nematostella’s</i> complex ECM, confirming the homology of the cnidarian inner cell layer with bilaterian mesoderm. The transition from larva to polyp is marked by an upregulation of metalloproteases and basement membrane components including all members of an unusually diversified SVEP1/Polydom family, suggesting massive epithelial remodeling. The enrichment of Wnt/PCP pathway factors during this process further indicates directed cell rearrangements as a key contributor to the polyp’s morphogenesis. Mesoglea maturation in adult polyps involves wound response proteins indicating shared molecular patterns in growth and regeneration. Our study identifies conserved matrisomal networks that coordinate transitions in <i>Nematostella’s</i> life history.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/104043">Toward stable replication of genomic information in pools of RNA molecules</a></h4>

              
                The transition from prebiotic chemistry to living systems requires the emergence of a scheme for enzyme-free genetic replication. Here, we analyze a recently proposed prebiotic replication scenario, the so-called Virtual Circular Genome (VCG) [Zhou et al., RNA 27, 1-11 (2021)]: Replication takes place in a pool of oligomers, where each oligomer contains a subsequence of a circular genome, such that the oligomers encode the full genome collectively. While the sequence of the circular genome may be reconstructed based on long oligomers, monomers and short oligomers merely act as replication feedstock. We observe a competition between the predominantly error-free ligation of a feedstock molecule to a long oligomer and the predominantly erroneous ligation of two long oligomers. Increasing the length of long oligomers and reducing their concentration decreases the fraction of erroneous ligations, enabling high-fidelity replication in the VCG. Alternatively, the formation of erroneous products can be suppressed if each ligation involves at least one monomer, while ligations between two long oligomers are effectively prevented. This kinetic discrimination (favoring monomer incorporation over oligomer–oligomer ligation) may be an intrinsic property of the activation chemistry, or can be externally imposed by selectively activating only monomers in the pool. Surprisingly, under these conditions, shorter oligomers are extended by monomers more quickly than long oligomers, a phenomenon that has already been observed experimentally [Ding et al., JACS 145, 7504-7515 (2023)]. Our work provides a theoretical explanation for this behavior and predicts its dependence on system parameters such as the concentration of long oligomers. Taken together, the VCG constitutes a promising scenario of prebiotic information replication: It could mitigate challenges in non-enzymatic copying via template-directed polymerization, such as short lengths of copied products and high error rates.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98920">Spatiotemporal brain complexity quantifies consciousness outside of perturbation paradigms</a></h4>

              
                Signatures of consciousness are found in spectral and temporal properties of neuronal activity. Among these, spatiotemporal complexity after a perturbation has recently emerged as a robust metric to infer levels of consciousness. Perturbation paradigms remain, however, difficult to perform routinely. To discover alternative paradigms and metrics, we systematically explore brain stimulation and resting-state activity in a whole-brain model. We find that perturbational complexity only occurs when the brain model operates within a specific dynamical regime, in which spontaneous activity produces a large degree of functional network reorganizations referred to as being fluid. The regime of high brain fluidity is characterized by a small battery of metrics drawn from dynamical systems theory and predicts the impact of consciousness-altering drugs (Xenon, Propofol, and Ketamine). We validate the predictions in a cohort of 15 subjects at various stages of consciousness and demonstrate their agreement with previously reported perturbational complexity, but in a more accessible paradigm. Beyond the facilitation in clinical use, the metrics highlight complexity properties of brain dynamics in support of the emergence of consciousness.
