<p>Hippocampal cognitive map---a neuronal representation of the spatial
environment---is broadly discussed in the computational neuroscience literature
for decades. More recent studies point out that hippocampus plays a major role
in producing yet another cognitive framework that incorporates not only
spatial, but also nonspatial memories---the memory space. However, unlike
cognitive maps, memory spaces have been barely studied from a theoretical
perspective. Here we propose an approach for modeling hippocampal memory spaces
as an epiphenomenon of neuronal spiking activity. First, we suggest that the
memory space may be viewed as a finite topological space---a hypothesis that
allows treating both spatial and nonspatial aspects of hippocampal function on
equal footing. We then model the topological properties of the memory space to
demonstrate that this concept naturally incorporates the notion of a cognitive
map. Lastly, we suggest a formal description of the memory consolidation
process and point out a connection between the proposed model of the memory
spaces to the so-called Morris' schemas, which emerge as the most compact
representation of the memory structure.

<p>How choices are made within noisy environments is a central question in the
neuroscience of decision making. Previous work has characterized temporal
accumulation of evidence for decision-making in static environments. However,
real-world decision-making involves environments with statistics that change
over time. This requires discounting old evidence that may no longer inform the
current state of the world. Here we designed a rat behavioral task with a
dynamic environment, to probe whether rodents can optimally discount evidence
by adapting the timescale over which they accumulate it. Extending existing
results about optimal inference in a dynamic environment, we show that the
optimal timescale for evidence discounting depends on both the stimulus
statistics and noise in sensory processing. We found that when both of these
components were taken into account, rats accumulated and temporally discounted
evidence almost optimally. Furthermore, we found that by changing the dynamics
of the environment, experimenters could control the rats' accumulation
timescale, switching them from accumulating over short timescales to
accumulating over long timescales and back. The theoretical framework also
makes quantitative predictions regarding the timing of changes of mind in the
dynamic environment. This study establishes a quantitative behavioral framework
to control and investigate neural mechanisms underlying the adaptive nature of
evidence accumulation timescales and changes of mind.

<p>We develop a unified theory that encompasses the macroscopic dynamics of
recurrent interactions of binary units within arbitrary network architectures.
Using the martingale theory, our mathematical analysis provides a complete
description of nonequilibrium fluctuations in networks with finite size and
finite degree of interactions. Our approach allows the investigation of systems
for which a deterministic mean-field theory breaks down. To demonstrate this,
we uncover a novel dynamic state in which a recurrent network of binary units
with statistically inhomogeneous interactions, along with an asynchronous
behavior, also exhibits collective nontrivial stochastic fluctuations in the
thermodynamical limit.

<p>by Nan Lin, Yun Zhu, Ruzong Fan, Momiao Xiong</p>

Investigating the pleiotropic effects of genetic variants can increase statistical power, provide important information to achieve deep understanding of the complex genetic structures of disease, and offer powerful tools for designing effective treatments with fewer side effects. However, the current multiple phenotype association analysis paradigm lacks breadth (number of phenotypes and genetic variants jointly analyzed at the same time) and depth (hierarchical structure of phenotype and genotypes). A key issue for high dimensional pleiotropic analysis is to effectively extract informative internal representation and features from high dimensional genotype and phenotype data. To explore correlation information of genetic variants, effectively reduce data dimensions, and overcome critical barriers in advancing the development of novel statistical methods and computational algorithms for genetic pleiotropic analysis, we proposed a new statistic method referred to as a quadratically regularized functional CCA (QRFCCA) for association analysis which combines three approaches: (1) quadratically regularized matrix factorization, (2) functional data analysis and (3) canonical correlation analysis (CCA). Large-scale simulations show that the QRFCCA has a much higher power than that of the ten competing statistics while retaining the appropriate type 1 errors. To further evaluate performance, the QRFCCA and ten other statistics are applied to the whole genome sequencing dataset from the TwinsUK study. We identify a total of 79 genes with rare variants and 67 genes with common variants significantly associated with the 46 traits using QRFCCA. The results show that the QRFCCA substantially outperforms the ten other statistics.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/o8lOFnQ0TmI" width="1" />

As noted in our paper (1), values of the Newtonian viscosity, ηN, of squalane from Deegan et al. (2) are well fit by the Vogel–Fulcher–Tammann (VFT) equation over the measured range of temperature, T.

<p>Musical rhythms performed by humans typically show temporal fluctuations.
While they have been characterized in simple rhythmic tasks, it is an open
question what is the nature of temporal fluctuations, when several musicians
perform music jointly in all its natural complexity. To study such fluctuations
in over 100 original jazz and rock/pop recordings played with and without
metronome we developed a semi-automated workflow allowing the extraction of
cymbal beat onsets with millisecond precision. Analyzing the inter-beat
interval (IBI) time series revealed evidence for two long-range correlated
processes characterized by power laws in the IBI power spectral densities. One
process dominates on short timescales ($t &lt; 8$ beats) and reflects microtiming
variability in the generation of single beats. The other dominates on longer
timescales and reflects slow tempo variations. Whereas the latter did not show
differences between musical genres (jazz vs. rock/pop), the process on short
timescales showed higher variability for jazz recordings, indicating that jazz
makes stronger use of microtiming fluctuations within a measure than rock/pop.
Our results elucidate principles of rhythmic performance and can inspire
algorithms for artificial music generation. By studying microtiming
fluctuations in original music recordings, we bridge the gap between
minimalistic tapping paradigms and expressive rhythmic performances.

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1710.05494">REM sleep complicates period adding bifurcations from monophasic to polyphasic sleep behavior in a sleep-wake regulatory network model for human sleep. (arXiv:1710.05494v1 [q-bio.NC])</a></h4>

<p>The structure of human sleep changes across development as it consolidates
from the polyphasic sleep of infants to the single nighttime sleep period
typical in adults. Across this same developmental period, time scales of the
homeostatic sleep drive, the physiological drive to sleep that increases with
time spent awake, also change and presumably govern the transition from
polyphasic to monophasic sleep behavior. Using a physiologically-based,
sleep-wake regulatory network model for human sleep, we investigated the
dynamics of wake, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, and non-REM (NREM) sleep
during this transition by varying the homeostatic sleep drive time constants.
Previously, we introduced an algorithm for constructing a one-dimensional
circle map that represents the dynamics of the full sleep-wake network model.
By tracking bifurcations in the piecewise continuous circle map as the
homeostatic sleep drive time constants are varied, we establish evidence for a
border collision bifurcation that results in period-adding-like behavior in the
number of sleep cycles per day. Interestingly, this bifurcation is preceded by
bifurcations in the number of REM bouts per sleep cycle that exhibit truncated
period-adding-like behavior. The interaction of these bifurcations in numbers
of sleep episodes and numbers of REM bouts per sleep episode generate
non-monotonic variation in sleep cycle patterns as well as quasi-periodic
patterns during the transition from polyphasic to monophasic sleep behavior.
This analysis may have implications for understanding changes in sleep in early
childhood when preschoolers transition from napping to non-napping behavior,
and the wide interindividual variation observed during this transition.

<p>Despite the recent advances in developing more effective thresholding methods
to convert weighted networks to unweighted counterparts, there are still
several limitations that need to be addressed. One such limitation is the
inability of the most existing thresholding methods to take into account the
topological properties of the original weighted networks during the
binarization process, which could ultimately result in unweighted networks that
have drastically different topological properties than the original weighted
networks. In this study, we propose a new thresholding method based on the
percolation theory to address this limitation. The performance of the proposed
method was validated and compared to the existing thresholding methods using
simulated and real-world functional connectivity networks in the brain.
Comparison of macroscopic and microscopic properties of the resulted unweighted
networks to the original weighted networks suggest that the proposed
thresholding method can successfully maintain the topological properties of the
original weighted networks.

<p>The CamCAN Lifespan Neuroimaging Dataset, Cambridge (UK) Centre for Ageing
and Neuroscience, was acquired and processed beginning in December, 2016. The
referee consensus solver deployed to the Open Science Grid was used for this
task. The dataset includes demographic and screening measures, a
high-resolution MRI scan of the brain, and whole-head magnetoencephalographic
(MEG) recordings during eyes closed rest (560 sec), a simple task (540 sec),
and passive listening/viewing (140 sec). The data were collected from 619
neurologically normal individuals, ages 18-87. The processed results from the
resting recordings are completed and available online. These constitute 1.7
TBytes of data including the location within the brain (1 mm resolution), time
stamp (1 msec resolution), and 80 msec time course for each of 3.7 billion
validated neuroelectric events, i.e. mean 6.1 million events for each of the
619 participants.
</p>
<p>The referee consensus solver provides high yield (mean 11,000 neuroelectric
currents/sec; standard deviation (sd): 3500/sec) high confidence (p &lt; 10-12 for
each identified current) measures of the neuroelectric currents whose magnetic
fields are detected in the MEG recordings. We describe the solver, the
implementation of the solver deployed on the Open Science Grid, the workflow
management system, the opportunistic use of high performance computing (HPC)
resources to add computing capacity to the Open Science Grid reserved for this
project, and our initial findings from the recently completed processing of the
resting recordings. This required 14 million core hours, i.e. 40 core hours per
second of data.

<p>The balance between excitation and inhibition is crucial for neuronal
computation. It is observed that the balanced state of neuronal networks exists
in many experiments, yet its underlying mechanism remains to be fully
clarified. Theoretical studies of the balanced state mainly focus on the
analysis of the homogeneous Erd$\ddot{\text{o}}$s-R\'enyi network. However,
neuronal networks have been found to be inhomogeneous in many cortical areas.
In particular, the connectivity of neuronal networks can be of the type of
scale-free, small-world, or even with specific motifs. In this work, we examine
the questions of whether the balanced state is universal with respect to
network topology and what characteristics the balanced state possesses in
inhomogeneous networks such as scale-free and small-world networks. We discover
that, for a sparsely but strongly connected inhomogeneous network, despite that
the whole network receives external inputs, there is a small active subnetwork
(active core) inherently embedded within it. The neurons in this active core
have relatively high firing rates while the neurons in the rest of the network
are quiescent. Surprisingly, the active core possesses a balanced state and
this state is independent of the model of single-neuron dynamics. The dynamics
of the active core can be well predicted using the Fokker-Planck equation with
the mean-field assumption. Our results suggest that, in the presence of
inhomogeneous network connectivity, the balanced state may be ubiquitous in the
brain, and the network connectivity in the active core is essentially close to
the Erd$\ddot{\text{o}}$s-R\'enyi structure. The existence of the small active
core embedded in a large network may provide a potential dynamical scenario
underlying sparse coding in neuronal networks.

<p>We introduce a graphical method originating from the computer graphics domain
that is used for the arbitrary and intuitive placement of cells over a
two-dimensional manifold. Using a bitmap image as input, where the color
indicates the identity of the different structures and the alpha channel
indicates the local cell density, this method guarantees a discrete
distribution of cell position respecting the local density function. This
method scales to any number of cells, allows to specify several different
structures at once with arbitrary shapes and provides a scalable and versatile
alternative to the more classical assumption of a uniform non-spatial
distribution. Furthermore, several connection schemes can be derived from the
paired distances between cells using either an automatic mapping or a
user-defined local reference frame, providing new computational properties for
the underlying model. The method is illustrated on a discrete homogeneous
neural field, on the distribution of cones and rods in the retina and on a
coronal view of the basal ganglia.

<p>Recent years have seen dramatic progress in the development of techniques for
measuring the activity and connectivity of large populations of neurons in the
brain. However, as these techniques grow ever more powerful---allowing us to
even contemplate measuring every neuron in entire brain---a new problem arises:
how do we make sense of the mountains of data that these techniques produce?
Here, we argue that the time is ripe for building an intermediate or
"mesoscale" computational theory that can bridge between single-cell
(microscale) accounts of neural function and behavioral (macroscale) accounts
of animal cognition and environmental complexity. Just as digital accounts of
computation in conventional computers abstract away the non-essential dynamics
of the analog circuits that implementing gates and registers, so too a
computational account of animal cognition can afford to abstract from the
non-essential dynamics of neurons. We argue that the geometry of neural
circuits is essential in explaining the computational limitations and
technological innovations inherent in biological information processing. We
propose a blueprint for how to employ tools from modern machine learning to
automatically infer a satisfying mesoscale account of neural computation that
combines functional and structural data, with an emphasis on learning and
exploiting regularity and repeating motifs in neuronal circuits. Rather than
suggest a specific theory, we present a new class of scientific instruments
that can enable neuroscientists to design, propose, implement and test
mesoscale theories of neural computation.

<p>The interaction between excitation and inhibition is crucial for brain
computation. To understand synaptic mechanisms underlying brain function, it is
important to separate excitatory and inhibitory inputs to a target neuron. In
the traditional method, after applying somatic current or voltage clamp, the
excitatory and inhibitory conductances are determined from the synaptic
current-voltage (I-V) relation --- the slope corresponds to the total
conductance and the intercept corresponds to the reversal current. Because of
the space clamp effect, the measured conductance in general deviates
substantially from the local conductance on the dendrite. Therefore, the
interpretation of the conductance measured by the traditional method remains to
be clarified. In this work, based on the investigation of an idealized
ball-and-stick neuron model and a biologically realistic pyramidal neuron
model, we first demonstrate both analytically and numerically that the
conductance determined by the traditional method has no clear biological
interpretation due to the neglect of a nonlinear interaction between the clamp
current and the synaptic current across the spatial dendrites. As a
consequence, the traditional method can induce an arbitrarily large error of
conductance measurement, sometimes even leads to unphysically negative
conductance. To circumvent the difficulty of elucidating synaptic impact on
neuronal computation using the traditional method, we then propose a framework
to determine the effective conductance that reflects directly the functional
impact of synaptic inputs on action potential initiation and thereby neuronal
information processing. Our framework has been further verified in realistic
neuron simulations, thus greatly improves upon the traditional approach by
providing a reliable and accurate assessment of the role of synaptic activity
in neuronal computation.

<p>The interplay between excitatory and inhibitory neurons imparts rich
functions of the brain. To understand the underlying synaptic mechanisms, a
fundamental approach is to study the dynamics of excitatory and inhibitory
conductances of each neuron. The traditional method of determining conductance
employs the synaptic current-voltage (I-V) relation obtained via voltage clamp.
Using theoretical analysis, electrophysiological experiments, and realistic
simulations, here we demonstrate that the traditional method conceptually fails
to measure the conductance due to the neglect of a nonlinear interaction
between the clamp current and the synaptic current. Consequently, it incurs
substantial measurement error, even giving rise to unphysically negative
conductance as observed in experiments. To elucidate synaptic impact on
neuronal information processing, we introduce the concept of effective
conductance and propose a framework to determine it accurately. Our work
suggests re-examination of previous studies involving conductance measurement
and provides a reliable approach to assess synaptic influence on neuronal
computation.

<p>The brain has no direct access to physical stimuli, but only to the spiking
activity evoked in sensory organs. It is unclear how the brain can structure
its representation of the world based on differences between those noisy,
correlated responses alone. Here we show how to build a distance map of
responses from the structure of the population activity of retinal ganglion
cells, allowing for the accurate discrimination of distinct visual stimuli from
the retinal response. We introduce the Temporal Restricted Boltzmann Machine to
learn the spatiotemporal structure of the population activity, and use this
model to define a distance between spike trains. We show that this metric
outperforms existing neural distances at discriminating pairs of stimuli that
are barely distinguishable. The proposed method provides a generic and
biologically plausible way to learn to associate similar stimuli based on their
spiking responses, without any other knowledge of these stimuli.

<p>Bias in perceptual decisions comes to pass when the advance knowledge
colludes with the current sensory evidence in support of the final choice. The
literature on decision making suggests two main hypotheses to account for this
kind of bias: internal bias signals are derived from (a) the residual of motor
response-related signals, and (b) the sensory information residues of the
decisions that we made in the past. Beside these hypotheses, a credible
hypothesis proposed by this study to explain the cause of decision biasing,
suggests that the decision-related neuron can make use of the residual
information of the previous decision for the current decision. We demonstrate
the validity of this assumption, first by performing behavioral experiments
based on the two-alternative forced-choice (TAFC) discrimination of motion
direction paradigms and then, we modified the pure drift-diffusion model (DDM)
based on accumulation to the bound mechanism to account for the sequential
effect. In both cases, the trace of the previous trial influences the current
decision. Results indicate that the probability of being correct in a current
decision increases if it is in line with the previously made decision. Also,
the model that keeps the previous decision information provides a better fit to
the behavioral data. Our findings suggest that the state of a decision variable
which is represented in the activity of decision-related neurons after crossing
the bound (in the previous decision) can accumulate with the decision variable
for the current decision in consecutive trials.

Goal-directed behavior requires integrating action selection processes with learning systems that adapt control using environmental feedback. These functions intersect in the basal ganglia (BG), which has at least two targets of plasticity: a dopaminergic modulation of striatal pathways and cortical modulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN). Dual learning mechanisms suggests that feedback signals have a multifaceted impact on BG-dependent decisions. Using a hybrid of accumulation-to-bound decision models and reinforcement learning, we modeled the performance of humans in a stop-signal task where participants (N=75) learned the prior distribution of the timing of a stop signal through trial-and-error feedback. Changes in the drift-rate of the action execution process were driven by errors in action timing, whereas adaptation in the boundary height served to increase caution following failed stops. These findings highlight two interactive learning mechanisms for adapting the control of goal-directed actions based on dissociable dimensions of feedback error.

The present study is designed to identify the influences of genetic background to optic nerve regeneration using the two parental strains C57BL/6J and DBA/2J and 7 BXD recombinant inbred strains. To study regeneration in the optic nerve, Pten was knocked down in the retinal ganglion cells using AAV, and a mild inflammatory response was induced by an intravitreal injection of zymosan with CPT-cAMP, and the axons were damaged by optic nerve crush (ONC). Regenerating axons were labeled by Cholera Toxin B and quantified 14 days after ONC. The number of axons at 0.5 mm and 1 mm from the crush site were counted. In addition, we measured the distance that 5 axons had grown down the nerve and the longest distance a single axon reached. Results showed a considerable amount of differential axonal growth across all 9 BXD strains. There was a significant difference (P=0.014 Mann-Whitney U test) in the regenerative capacity in the number of axons reaching 0.5 mm from a low of 1487.6 {+/-} 264.9 axons in BXD102 to a high of 4175.8 {+/-} 648.6 axons in BXD29. There were also significant differences (P=0.014 Mann-Whitney U test) in the distance axons traveled, looking at a minimum of 5 axons with the shortest distance was 787.2 {+/-} 46.5m in BXD102 to a maximum distance of 2025.5 {+/-} 223.3m in BXD29. These results reveal that genetic background can modulate axonal regeneration and that the BXD strains are a particularly well-suited model system.

Neurons use sequences of action potentials (spikes) to convey information across neuronal networks. In neurophysiology experiments, information about external stimuli or behavioral tasks has been frequently characterized in term of neuronal firing rate. The firing rate is conventionally estimated by averaging spiking responses across multiple similar experiments (or trials). However, there exist a number of applications in neuroscience research that require firing rate to be estimated on a single trial basis. Estimating firing rate from a single trial is a challenging problem and current state-of-the-art methods do not perform well. To address this issue, we develop a new method for estimating firing rate based on kernel smoothing technique that considers the bandwidth as a random variable with prior distribution that is adaptively updated under a Bayesian framework. By carefully selecting the prior distribution together with Gaussian kernel function, an analytical expression can be achieved for the kernel bandwidth. We refer to the proposed method as Bayesian Adaptive Kernel Smoother (BAKS). We evaluate the performance of BAKS using synthetic spike train data generated by biologically plausible models: inhomogeneous Gamma (IG) and inhomogeneous inverse Gaussian (IIG). We also apply BAKS to real spike train data from non-human primate (NHP) motor and visual cortex. We benchmark the proposed method against the established and previously reported methods. These include: optimized kernel smoother (OKS), variable kernel smoother (VKS), local polynomial fit (Locfit), and Bayesian adaptive regression splines (BARS). Results using both synthetic and real data demonstrate that the proposed method achieves better performance compared to competing methods. This suggests that the proposed method could be useful for understanding the encoding mechanism of neurons in cognitive-related tasks. The proposed method could also potentially improve the performance of brain-machine interface (BMI) decoder that relies on estimated firing rate as the input.

The dentate gyrus in the hippocampal formation is one of few regions in the brain where neurogenesis persists in the adult, and is therefore studied in the context of neurodevelopment and regenerative medicine. However, the relationship between developmental and adult neurogenesis has not been studied in detail. Here, we used extensive and unbiased single-cell RNA-seq to reveal the molecular dynamics and diversity of cell types in perinatal, juvenile and adult mice. We found clearly distinct quiescent and proliferating progenitor cell types, linked by transient intermediate states to neuroblast stages and fully mature granule cells. The molecular identity of quiescent and proliferating radial glia shifted after postnatal day 5, and was then maintained through postnatal and adult stages. A similar shift was observed for granule cells at P20. In contrast, intermediate progenitor cells, neuroblasts and immature granule cells were nearly indistinguishable at all ages. These findings demonstrate the fundamental continunity of postnatal and adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus, and pinpoint the early postnatal transformation of radial glia from embryonic progenitors to adult quiescent stem cells.

Understanding how neuronal signals propagate in local network is an important step in understanding information processing. As a result, spike trains recorded with Multi-electrode Arrays (MEAs) have been widely used to study behaviors of neural connections. Studying the dynamics of neuronal networks requires the identification of both excitatory and inhibitory connections. The detection of excitatory relationships can robustly be inferred by characterizing the statistical relationships of neural spike trains. However, the identification of inhibitory relationships is more difficult: distinguishing endogenous low firing rates from active inhibition is not obvious. In this paper, we propose an in silico interventional procedure that makes predictions about the effect of stimulating or inhibiting single neurons on other neurons, and thereby gives the ability to accurately identify inhibitory causal relationships. To experimentally test these predictions, we have developed a Neural Circuit Probe (NCP) that delivers drugs transiently and reversibly on individually identified neurons to assess their contributions to the neural circuit behavior. With the help of NCP, three inhibitory connections identified by our in silico modeling were validated through real interventional experiments. Together, these methods provide a basis for mapping complete neural circuits.

Adequate protein intake is crucial for animals. Despite the recent progress in understanding protein hunger and satiety in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, how fruit flies assess prospective dietary protein sources and ensure protein consumption remains elusive. We show here that three specific amino acids, L-glutamate (L-Glu), L-alanine (L-Ala), and L-aspartate (L-Asp), rapidly promote food consumption in fruit flies when present in food. The effect of dietary amino acids to promote food consumption is independent of mating experience and internal nutritional status. Genetic analysis identifies six brain neurons expressing diuretic hormone 44 (DH44) as a sensor of dietary amino acids. DH44+ neurons can be directly activated by these three amino acids, and are both necessary and sufficient for dietary amino acids to promote food consumption. By conducting single cell RNAseq analysis, we also identify an amino acid transporter, CG13248, which is highly expressed in DH44+ neurons and is required for dietary amino acids to promote food consumption. Therefore, these data suggest that dietary amino acids may enter DH44+ neurons via CG13248 and modulate their activity and hence food consumption. Taken together, these data identify an internal amino acid sensor in the fly brain that evaluate food sources post-ingestively and facilitates adequate protein intake.

Sexual dimorphism has been reported in the prevalence, onset and progression of neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders. We hypothesize that immunological signaling in the developing brain, notably the complement cascade underlying microglial synaptic pruning, could be one mechanism for this dimorphism. Here we show that genes differentially expressed between male and female normal cortical development are enriched for pathways associated with the activation of the innate immune system, complement cascade and phagocytic processes. Specifically, the male brain is enriched for the expression of genes associated with phagocytic function of microglia through complement-dependent synaptic pruning especially at the developmental stages before birth. Our results suggest the existence of a common regulatory module involved in both prenatal immune activation in males and postnatal immune activation in females. The activation of immune pruning pathways at different stages of normal male and female development could provide valuable insights about critical periods of plasticity and refinement in the human cortex that could explain the different vulnerabilities of males and females to neurological disorders.

<p>by Shiran Abadi, Winston X. Yan, David Amar, Itay Mayrose</p>

The adaptation of the CRISPR-Cas9 system as a genome editing technique has generated much excitement in recent years owing to its ability to manipulate targeted genes and genomic regions that are complementary to a programmed single guide RNA (sgRNA). However, the efficacy of a specific sgRNA is not uniquely defined by exact sequence homology to the target site, thus unintended off-targets might additionally be cleaved. Current methods for sgRNA design are mainly concerned with predicting off-targets for a given sgRNA using basic sequence features and employ elementary rules for ranking possible sgRNAs. Here, we introduce CRISTA (CRISPR Target Assessment), a novel algorithm within the machine learning framework that determines the propensity of a genomic site to be cleaved by a given sgRNA. We show that the predictions made with CRISTA are more accurate than other available methodologies. We further demonstrate that the occurrence of bulges is not a rare phenomenon and should be accounted for in the prediction process. Beyond predicting cleavage efficiencies, the learning process provides inferences regarding patterns that underlie the mechanism of action of the CRISPR-Cas9 system. We discover that attributes that describe the spatial structure and rigidity of the entire genomic site as well as those surrounding the PAM region are a major component of the prediction capabilities.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/GOLPfmV6XL8" width="1" />

<p>by Evelina Gabasova, John Reid, Lorenz Wernisch</p>

Integrative clustering is used to identify groups of samples by jointly analysing multiple datasets describing the same set of biological samples, such as gene expression, copy number, methylation etc. Most existing algorithms for integrative clustering assume that there is a shared consistent set of clusters across all datasets, and most of the data samples follow this structure. However in practice, the structure across heterogeneous datasets can be more varied, with clusters being joined in some datasets and separated in others. In this paper, we present a probabilistic clustering method to identify groups across datasets that do not share the same cluster structure. The proposed algorithm, Clusternomics, identifies groups of samples that share their global behaviour across heterogeneous datasets. The algorithm models clusters on the level of individual datasets, while also extracting global structure that arises from the local cluster assignments. Clusters on both the local and the global level are modelled using a hierarchical Dirichlet mixture model to identify structure on both levels. We evaluated the model both on simulated and on real-world datasets. The simulated data exemplifies datasets with varying degrees of common structure. In such a setting Clusternomics outperforms existing algorithms for integrative and consensus clustering. In a real-world application, we used the algorithm for cancer subtyping, identifying subtypes of cancer from heterogeneous datasets. We applied the algorithm to TCGA breast cancer dataset, integrating gene expression, miRNA expression, DNA methylation and proteomics. The algorithm extracted clinically meaningful clusters with significantly different survival probabilities. We also evaluated the algorithm on lung and kidney cancer TCGA datasets with high dimensionality, again showing clinically significant results and scalability of the algorithm.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/dGbVYIyHTbc" width="1" />

<h3>Abstract</h3>
<div class="para"><p><b>Objective</b>: We tested the hypothesis that somatosensory system injury would more strongly affect movement than motor system injury in children with unilateral cerebral palsy (USCP). This hypothesis was based on how somatosensory and corticospinal circuits adapt to injury during development: while the motor system can maintain connections to the impaired hand from the uninjured hemisphere, this doesn't occur in the somatosensory system. As a corollary, cortical injury strongly impairs sensory function, so we hypothesized that cortical lesions would impair hand function more than subcortical lesions.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Methods</b>: Twenty-four children with unilateral CP had physiological and anatomical measures of the motor and somatosensory systems and lesion classification. Motor physiology was performed with transcranial magnetic stimulation and somatosensory physiology with vibration-evoked EEG potentials. Tractography of the corticospinal tract and the medial lemniscus were performed with diffusion tensor imaging, and lesions were classified by MRI. Anatomical and physiological results were correlated with measures of hand function using two independent statistical methods.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Results</b>: Children with disruptions in the somatosensory connectivity, and cortical lesions had the most severe upper extremity impairments, particularly somatosensory function. Motor system connectivity was significantly correlated with bimanual function, but not unimanual function or somatosensory function.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Interpretation</b>: Both sensory and motor connectivity impact hand function in children with USCP. Somatosensory connectivity could be an important target for recovery of hand function in children with USCP. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.</p></div>

<p>We explore a combinatorial framework which efficiently quantifies the
asymmetries between minima and maxima in local fluctuations of time series. We
firstly showcase its performance by applying it to a battery of synthetic
cases. We find rigorous results on some canonical dynamical models (stochastic
processes with and without correlations, chaotic processes) complemented by
extensive numerical simulations for a range of processes which indicate that
the methodology correctly distinguishes different complex dynamics and
outperforms state of the art metrics in several cases. Subsequently, we apply
this methodology to real-world problems emerging across several disciplines
including cases in neurobiology, finance and climate science. We conclude that
differences between the statistics of local maxima and local minima in time
series are highly informative of the complex underlying dynamics and a
graph-theoretic extraction procedure allows to use these features for
statistical learning purposes.

<p>Neural-network models of high-level brain functions such as memory recall and
reasoning often rely on the presence of stochasticity. The majority of these
models assumes that each neuron in the functional network is equipped with its
own private source of randomness, often in the form of uncorrelated external
noise. However, both in vivo and in silico, the number of noise sources is
limited due to space and bandwidth constraints. Hence, neurons in large
networks usually need to share noise sources. Here, we show that the resulting
shared-noise correlations can significantly impair the performance of
stochastic network models. We further demonstrate that this problem can be
overcome by using deterministic recurrent neural networks as sources of
stochasticity, exploiting the decorrelating effect of inhibitory feedback.
Consequently, even a single recurrent network of a few hundred neurons can
serve as a natural noise source for large ensembles of functional networks,
each comprising thousands of units. We test the proposed framework for a
diverse set of networks with different dimensionalities and entropies. A
network reproducing handwritten digits with distinct predefined frequencies
demonstrates the practical relevance. Finally, we show that the same design
transfers to functional networks of spiking neurons.

not been clarified in what sense it can be regarded as an effective model. We
draw here the correspondence between the two, which indicates the need to
introduce a local feedback term in the reduced model, i.e., in the Potts
network. Complementary to previous work, we study the storage capacity of the
Potts network with this additional term, the local feedback $w$, which
contributes to drive the activity of the network towards one of the stored
patterns. The storage capacity calculation, performed using replica tools, is
limited to fully connected networks, for which a Hamiltonian can be defined. To
extend the results to the case of intermediate partial connectivity, we also
derive the self-consistent signal-to-noise analysis for the Potts network; and
finally we discuss implications for semantic memory in humans.

Natural environments feature mixtures of odorants of diverse quantities, qualities and complexities. Olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) are the first layer in the sensory pathway and transmit the olfactory signal to higher regions of the brain. Yet, the response of ORNs to mixtures is strongly non-additive, and exhibits antagonistic interactions among odorants. Here, we model the processing of mixtures by mammalian ORNs, focusing on the role of inhibitory mechanisms. Theoretically predicted response curves capture experimentally determined glomerular responses imaged by a calcium indicator expressed in ORNs of live, breathing mice. Antagonism leads to an effective "normalization" of the ensemble glomerular response, which arises from a novel mechanism involving the distinct statistical properties of receptor binding and activation, without any recurrent neuronal circuitry. Normalization allows our encoding model to outperform non-interacting models in odor discrimination tasks, and to explain several psychophysical experiments in humans.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/204271v1?rss=1">A control theoretic model of adaptive behavior in dynamic environments</a></h4>

In order to behave adaptively in environments that are noisy and non-stationary, humans and other animals must monitor feedback from their environment and adjust their predictions and actions accordingly. An under-studied approach for modeling these adaptive processes comes from the engineering field of control theory, which provides general principles for regulating dynamical systems, often without requiring a generative model. The proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller is one of the most popular models of industrial process control. The proportional term is analogous to the "delta rule" in psychology, adjusting estimates in proportion to each successive error in prediction. The integral and derivative terms augment this update to simultaneously improve accuracy and stability. Here, we tested whether the PID algorithm can describe how people sequentially adjust their predictions in response to new information. Across three experiments, we found that the PID controller was an effective model of participants' decisions in noisy, changing environments. In Experiment 1, we re-analyzed a change-point detection experiment, and showed that participants' behavior incorporated elements of PID updating. Experiments 2-3 employed a gradual change-point task that was optimized to detect PID-like adjustments. In both experiments, the PID model offered better descriptions of behavioral adjustments than the classical delta-rule model. We further examined how participants weighted different PID terms in response to salient environmental events. Across experiments, we found that the weights on these control terms were modulated by reward, surprise, and outcome entropy. These experiments provide preliminary evidence that adaptive behavior in dynamic environments resembles PID control.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/204248v1?rss=1">Rats optimally accumulate and discount evidence in a dynamic environment</a></h4>

How choices are made within noisy environments is a central question in the neuroscience of decision making. Previous work has characterized temporal accumulation of evidence for decision-making in static environments. However, real-world decision-making involves environments with statistics that change over time. This requires discounting old evidence that may no longer inform the current state of the world. Here we designed a rat behavioral task with a dynamic environment, to probe whether rodents can optimally discount evidence by adapting the timescale over which they accumulate it. Extending existing results about optimal inference in a dynamic environment, we show that the optimal timescale for evidence discounting depends on both the stimulus statistics and noise in sensory processing. We found that when both of these components were taken into account, rats accumulated and temporally discounted evidence almost optimally. Furthermore, we found that by changing the dynamics of the environment, experimenters could control the rats accumulation timescale, switching them from accumulating over short timescales to accumulating over long timescales and back. The theoretical framework also makes quantitative predictions regarding the timing of changes of mind in the dynamic environment. This study establishes a quantitative behavioral framework to control and investigate neural mechanisms underlying the adaptive nature of evidence accumulation timescales and changes of mind.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/204222v1?rss=1">Transcranial alternating current stimulation induces long-term augmentation of neural connectivity and sustained anxiety reduction</a></h4>

Although transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) has demonstrated short-term effects in modulating neural oscillations, potential clinical efficacy of tACS for treating "oscillopathies" (disorders associated with aberrant neural oscillations) hinges on its ability to generate long-term neural plasticity, which can translate into lasting behavioral changes. Administering alpha-frequency tACS over 4 consecutive days, we evaluated short- and long-term (&gt; 24 hours) effects of alpha-tACS on local alpha power and oscillatory connectivity, along with behavioral outcomes in anxious arousal and affective sensory perception. The alpha-tACS (vs. sham stimulation) group exhibited increases in posterior alpha power immediately and 30 minutes post-stimulation but not 24 hours post-stimulation, suggesting transient effects on local neuronal synchrony. Strikingly, long-range alpha-frequency Granger causal connectivity (posterior-to-frontal) increased not only immediately and 30 minutes but also 24 hours post-stimulation, paralleled by sustained reductions in anxious arousal and aversion to auditory stimuli. Therefore, tACS is capable of eliciting long-term plasticity in long-range oscillatory connectivity with direct, lasting behavioral consequences, while leaving endogenous local oscillations unaltered. This temporal disparity in local and network effects favors the view of large-scale network strengthening by tACS, calling for research attention to the circuit and network impacts of tACS. Critically, with the growing recognition of large-scale network dysfunctions as a transdiagnostic pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders, this connectivity plasticity advocates for the clinical application of tACS with its unique advantage in tackling network pathologies.

The hair-cell mechanotransduction channel remains unidentified. We tested whether four transient receptor channel (TRP) family members, TRPV5, TRPV6, TRPM6, and TRPM7, participated in transduction. Using cysteine-substitution mouse knock-ins and methanethiosulfonate reagents selective for those alleles, we found that inhibition of TRPV5 or TRPV6 had no effect on transduction in mouse cochlear hair cells. TRPM6 and TRPM7 each interacted with the tip-link component PCDH15 in cultured eukaryotic cells, which suggested they could participate in transduction. Cochlear hair cell transduction was insensitive to shRNA knockdown of Trpm6 or Trpm7, however, and was not affected by manipulations of Mg2+, which normally perturbs TRPM6 and TRPM7. To definitively examine the role of these two channels in transduction, we showed that deletion of either or both of their genes selectively in hair cells had no effect on auditory function. We suggest that TRPV5, TRPV6, TRPM6, and TRPM7 are unlikely to be the pore-forming subunit of the hair-cell transduction channel.

In this work, I address the connection of phonetic structure with phonological representations. This classical issue is discussed in the light of recent neurophysiological data which, thanks to direct measurements of temporal and spatial brain activation, provide new avenues to investigate the biological substrate of human language. After describing principal techniques and methods, I critically discuss magnetoencephalographic and electroencephalographic findings of speech processing based on event-related potentials and event-related oscillatory rhythms. The available data do not permit us to clearly disambiguate between neural evidence suggesting pure acoustic patterns and those indicating abstract phonological features. Starting from this evidence, which only at the surface represents a limit, I develop a preliminary proposal where discretization and phonological abstraction are the result of a continuous process that converts spectro-temporal (acoustic) states into neurophysiological states such that some properties of the former undergo changes interacting with the latter until a new equilibrium is reached. I assume that, at the end of the process, phonological segments (and the related categorical processes) take the form of continuous neural states represented by nested cortical oscillatory rhythms spatially distributed in the auditory cortex. Within this perspective, distinctive features (i.e., the relevant representational linguistic primitives) are represented by both spatially local and distributed neural selectivity. I suggest that this hypothesis is suitable to explain hierarchical layout of auditory cortex highly specialized in analyzing different aspects of the speech signal and to explain learning and memory processes during the acquisition of phonological systems.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/204008v1?rss=1">Deficit in parietal memory network underlies auditory hallucination: a longitudinal study</a></h4>

Auditory hallucination is a prominent and common symptom in schizophrenia. Previous neuroimaging studies have yielded mixed results of its brain network deficits. We proposed a novel hypothesis that parietal memory network, centered at the precuneus, plays a critical role in auditory hallucination. This network is adjacent and partially overlaps with the default mode network, and has been associated with brain function of familiarity labelling in memory processing. Using a longitudinal design and a large cohort of first-episode, drug-naive schizophrenia patients, we examined this hypothesis and further investigated whether the functional connectivity patterns of the parietal memory network can serve as a neuroimaging marker for auditory hallucination and help to predict future treatment effects. Resting-state scans from 59 first-episode drug-naive schizophrenic patients (27 with and 32 without hallucination) and 53 healthy control subjects were acquired at the baseline test, and 56 of them were scanned again after two months. Functional connectivity strength within the parietal memory network and between this network and memory hubs was across the three groups at baseline and follow-up scans. Results showed that decreased functional connectivity strength within the parietal memory network was specific to the auditory hallucination group (p = 0.009, compare to the healthy subjects; p = 0.029, compare to the patients without hallucination), with the precuneus representing the largest group difference. The intra-network connectivity strength of the precuneus negatively correlated with the severity of hallucination at the baseline scan (r = -0.437, p = 0.029), and it was significantly increased after two-month medication (p = 0.039). Logistic regression analysis and cross-validation test demonstrated that the functional connectivity strength of the precuneus and precuneus-hippocampus connectivity could differentiate patients with or without auditory hallucination with a sensitivity of 0.750 and a specificity of 0.708. Moreover, cross-validation test showed that these imaging features at the baseline scan well predicted the extents of positive symptom improvement in the hallucination group after the two-month medication (R2 = 0.433, p = 0.022). Our results provide evidence for a critical role of the parietal memory network underlying auditory hallucination, and further propose a novel neuroimaging marker for identifying patients, accessing severity, and prognosis of treatment effect for auditory hallucination.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/203943v1?rss=1">Degeneracy in hippocampal physiology and plasticity</a></h4>

Degeneracy, defined as the ability of structurally disparate elements to perform analogous function, has largely been assessed from the perspective of maintaining robustness of physiology or plasticity. How does the framework of degeneracy assimilate into an encoding system where the ability to change is an essential ingredient for storing new incoming information? Could degeneracy maintain the balance between the apparently contradictory goals of the need to change for encoding and the need to resist change towards maintaining homeostasis? In this review, we explore these fundamental questions with the mammalian hippocampus as an example encoding system. We systematically catalog lines of evidence, spanning multiple scales of analysis, that demonstrate the expression of degeneracy in hippocampal physiology and plasticity. We assess the potential of degeneracy as a framework to achieve encoding and homeostasis without cross-interferences, and postulate that multiscale parametric and interactional complexity could establish disparate routes towards accomplishing these conjoint goals. These disparate routes then provide several degrees of freedom to the encoding-homeostasis system in accomplishing its tasks in an input- and state-dependent manner. Finally, the expression of degeneracy spanning multiple scales offers an ideal reconciliation to several outstanding controversies, through the recognition that the seemingly contradictory disparate observations are merely alternate routes that the system might recruit towards accomplishment of its goals. Juxtaposed against the ubiquitous prevalence of degeneracy and its strong links to evolution, it is perhaps apt to add a corollary to Theodosius Dobzhansky's famous quote and state "nothing in physiology makes sense except in the light of degeneracy".

The goal of CNS implanted devices is to build a stable brain-machine-interface. The brain tissue response to the foreign body limits the functionality and viability of this brain-machine connection. Notably the astrocytic glial scar formation and inflammation with resulting neuronal cell loss is considered to be responsible for the signal deterioration over time. We chronically implanted a polyimide microelectrode in the dorsolateral striatum of rats. First, we analyzed the c-fos immunoreactivity following high frequency stimulation (HFS) of the dorsolateral striatum and second, using GFAP and ED1 immunocytochemistry, the brain tissue response. Acute as well as chronic HFS showed no significant change of neuronal c-fos expression in the dorsolateral striatum and corresponding cortical areas. We found that the sole chronic implantation of a polyimide microelectrode leads to a reaction of the surrounding neurons, i.e. c-fos expression, along the implantation trajectory. We also observed the formation of a glial scar around the microelectrode with a low number of inflammation cells. Histological and statistical analysis of NeuN positive cells showed no 'kill zone', which accompanied neuronal cell death around the implantation site.

Neurophysiological recordings are dominated by arhythmical activity whose spectra can be characterised by power-law functions, and on this basis are often referred to as reflecting scale-free brain dynamics. Relatively little is known regarding the neural generators and temporal dynamics of this arhythmical behaviour compared to rhythmical behaviour. Here we signal analytically separated the two types of activity and show in both monkeys and humans that oscillatory alpha power dynamically correlates with arhythmical activity. In a series of human studies probing the sensitivity of arhythmical activity to excitation-inhibition balance, we show that drugs interacting with GABA, NMDA, AMPA and 5HT receptors systematically flatten and steepen the profile of arhythmical activity. Similar modifications are seen in monkeys during general anaesthesia. Surrogate data analysis demonstrates that arhythmical activity is generated by both linear and non-linear schemes, with non-linear effects emerging at critical boundaries. We propose a unifying model which can explain, the 1/f nature of electrophysiological spectra, their dynamic interaction with oscillatory rhythms as well as the sensitivity of 1/f activity to excitation-inhibition balance by considering electrophysiological spectra as being generated by a collection of stochastically perturbed damped oscillators having a distribution of relaxation rates.

Previous works have shown that neurons from the ventral premotor cortex (PMv) represent several elements of perceptual decisions. One of the most striking findings was that, after the outcome of the choice is known, neurons from PMv encode all the information necessary for evaluating the decision process. These results prompted us to suggest that this cortical area could be involved in shaping future behavior. In this work, we have characterized neuronal activity and behavioral performance as a function of the outcome of the previous trial. We found that the outcome of the immediately previous trial (n-1) significantly changes, in the current trial (n), the activity of single cells and behavioral performance. The outcome of trial n-2, however, does not affect either behavior or neuronal activity. Moreover, the outcome of difficult trials had a greater impact on performance and recruited more PMv neurons than the outcome of easy trials. These results give strong support to our suggestion that PMv neurons evaluate the decision process and use this information to modify future behavior.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/202507v1?rss=1">Homeostatic feedback, not early activity, modulates development of two-state patterned activity in the C. elegans egg-laying circuit</a></h4>

Neuron activity accompanies synapse formation and maintenance, but how early circuit activity contributes to behavior development is not well understood. Here, we use the Caenorhabditis elegans egg-laying motor circuit as a model to understand how coordinated cell and circuit activity develops and drives a robust two-state behavior in adults. Using calcium imaging in behaving animals, we find the Hermaphrodite Specific Neurons (HSNs) and vulval muscles show rhythmic calcium transients in L4 larvae before eggs are produced. HSN activity in L4 is tonic and lacks the alternating burst-firing/quiescent pattern seen in egg-laying adults. Vulval muscle activity in L4 is initially uncoordinated, but becomes synchronous as the anterior and posterior muscle arms meet at HSN synaptic release sites. However, coordinated muscle activity does not require presynaptic HSN input. Using reversible silencing experiments, we show that neuronal and vulval muscle activity in L4 is not required for the onset of adult behavior. Instead, the accumulation of eggs in the adult uterus renders the muscles sensitive to HSN input. Sterilization or acute electrical silencing of the vulval muscles inhibits presynaptic HSN activity, and reversal of muscle silencing triggers a homeostatic increase in HSN activity and egg release that maintains ~12-15 eggs in the uterus. Feedback of egg accumulation depends upon the vulval muscle postsynaptic terminus, suggesting a retrograde signal sustains HSN synaptic activity and egg release. Thus, circuit development and activity is necessary but not sufficient to drive behavior without additional modulation by sensory feedback.

Non-invasive monitoring of electrophysiological neural activities in real-time -- that would enable quantification of neural functions without a need for invasive craniotomy and the longer time constants of fMRI and PET -- presents a very challenging yet significant task for neuroimaging. We present in vivo proof-of-concept results of transcranial photoacoustic (PA) imaging of chemoconvulsant seizure activity in the rat brain. The framework involves use of a fluorescence quenching-based near-infrared voltage-sensitive dye (VSD) delivered through the blood-brain barrier (BBB), opened by pharmacological modulation of adenosine receptor signaling. Using normalized time-frequency analysis on temporal PA sequences, the neural activity in the seizure group was distinguished from those of the control groups. Electroencephalogram (EEG) recording confirmed the changes of severity and frequency of brain activities, induced by chemoconvulsant seizures of the rat brain. The findings demonstrate that PA imaging of fluorescence quenching-based VSD is a promising tool for in vivo recording of deep brain activities in the rat brain, thus excluding the use of invasive craniotomy.

Mutations in 17 genes have been shown to cause this phenotype. Recently, mutations in <em>CIT,</em> encoding CRIK (citron rho-interacting kinase)—a component of the central spindle matrix—were added.

Furthermore, in a patient presenting with a severe form of primary microcephaly and short stature, we identified compound heterozygous missense mutations in <em>KIF14</em> (NM_014875.2;c.2545C&gt;G;p.His849Asp and c.3662G&gt;T;p.Gly1221Val). Three of the 5 identified mutations impaired splicing, and 2 resulted in a truncated protein. Intriguingly, <em>Kif14</em> knockout mice also showed primary microcephaly. Human kinesin-like protein KIF14, a microtubule motor protein, localizes at the midbody to finalize cytokinesis by interacting with CRIK. We found impaired localization of both KIF14 and CRIK at the midbody in patient-derived fibroblasts. Furthermore, we observed a large number of binucleated and apoptotic cells—signs of failed cytokinesis that we also observed in experimentally KIF14-depleted cells.</p></div></div>

<h3>ABSTRACT</h3>
<div class="para"><p><b>Objective</b>: Oral Anticoagulation Treatment (OAT) resumption is a therapeutic dilemma in Intracerebral Hemorrhage (ICH) care, particularly for lobar hemorrhages related to amyloid angiopathy. We sought to determine whether OAT resumption after ICH is associated with long-term outcome, accounting for ICH location (i.e. lobar vs. non-lobar).</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Methods</b>: We meta-analyzed individual patient data from: 1) the multi-center RETRACE study (n=542); 2) a US-based single-center ICH study (n=261); 3) the Ethnic/Racial Variations of Intracerebral Hemorrhage (ERICH) study (n=209). We determined whether, within one year from ICH, OAT resumption was associated with: 1) mortality; 2) favorable functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale [mRS] 0-3); stroke incidence. We separately analyzed non-lobar and lobar ICH cases using propensity score matching and Cox regression models.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Results</b>: We included 1012 OAT-related ICH survivors (633 non-lobar and 379 lobar). Among non-lobar ICH survivors 178/633 (28%) resumed OAT, while 86/379 (23%) lobar ICH survivors did. In multivariable analyses OAT resumption after non-lobar ICH was associated with decreased mortality (Hazard Ratio [HR]=0.25, 95% Confidence Interval [CI]=0.14-0.44, p&lt;0.0001) and improved functional outcome (HR=4.22, 95% CI=2.57-6.94, p&lt;0.0001). OAT resumption after lobar ICH was also associated with decreased mortality (HR=0.29, 95% CI=0.17-0.45, p&lt;0.0001) and favorable functional outcome (HR=4.08, 95% CI=2.48-6.72, p&lt;0.0001). Furthermore, OAT resumption was associated with decreased all-cause stroke incidence in both lobar and non-lobar ICH (both p&lt;0.01).</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Interpretation</b>: These results suggest novel evidence of an association between OAT resumption and outcome following ICH, regardless of hematoma location. These findings support conducting randomized trials to explore risks and benefits of OAT resumption after ICH. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.</p></div>

<p>Causality testing, the act of determining cause and effect from measurements,
is widely used in physics, climatology, neuroscience, econometrics and other
disciplines. As a result, a large number of causality testing methods based on
various principles have been developed. Causal relationships in complex systems
are typically accompanied by entropic exchanges which are encoded in patterns
of dynamical measurements. A data compression algorithm which can extract these
encoded patterns could be used for inferring these relations. This motivates us
to propose, for the first time, a generic causality testing framework based on
data compression. The framework unifies existing causality testing methods and
enables us to innovate a novel Compression-Complexity Causality measure. This
measure is rigorously tested on simulated and real-world time series and is
found to overcome the limitations of Granger Causality and Transfer Entropy,
especially for noisy and non-synchronous measurements. Additionally, it gives
insight on the `kind' of causal influence between input time series by the
notions of positive and negative causality.

<p>Evaluating human brain potentials during watching different images can be
used for memory evaluation, information retrieving, guilty-innocent
identification and examining the brain response. In this study, the effects of
watching images, with different levels of familiarity, on subjects'
Electroencephalogram (EEG) have been studied. Three different groups of images
with three familiarity levels of "unfamiliar", "familiar" and "very familiar"
have been considered for this study. EEG signals of 21 subjects (14 men) were
recorded. After signal acquisition, pre-processing, including noise and
artifact removal, were performed on epochs of data. Features, including
spatial-statistical, wavelet, frequency and harmonic parameters, and also
correlation between recording channels, were extracted from the data. Then, we
evaluated the efficiency of the extracted features by using p-value and also an
orthogonal feature selection method (combination of Gram-Schmitt method and
Fisher discriminant ratio) for feature dimensional reduction. As the final step
of feature selection, we used 'add-r take-away l' method for choosing the most
discriminative features. For data classification, including all two-class and
three-class cases, we applied Support Vector Machine (SVM) on the extracted
features. The correct classification rates (CCR) for "unfamiliar-familiar",
"unfamiliar-very familiar" and "familiar-very familiar" cases were 85.6%,
92.6%, and 70.6%, respectively. The best results of classifications were
obtained in pre-frontal and frontal regions of brain. Also, wavelet, frequency
and harmonic features were among the most discriminative features. Finally, in
three-class case, the best CCR was 86.8%.

<p>We study dynamics of a reverberating neural net by means of computer
simulation. The net, which is composed of 9 leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF)
neurons arranged in a square lattice, is fully connected with interneuronal
communication delay proportional to the corresponding distance. The network is
initially stimulated with different stimuli and then goes freely. For each
stimulus, in the course of free evolution, activity either dies out completely
or the network converges to a periodic trajectory, which may be different for
different stimuli. The latter is observed for a set of 285290 initial stimuli
which constitutes 83% of all stimuli applied. By applying each stimulus from
the set, we found 102 different periodic end-states. By analyzing the
trajectories, we conclude that neuronal firing is the necessary prerequisite
for merging different trajectories into a single one, which eventually
transforms into a periodic regime. Observed phenomena of self-organization in
the time domain are discussed as a possible model for processes taking place
during perception. The repetitive firing in the periodic regimes could underpin
memory formation.

<p>by Niklas Hübel, Mahshid S. Hosseini-Zare, Jokūbas Žiburkus, Ghanim Ullah</p>

Simultaneous changes in ion concentrations, glutamate, and cell volume together with exchange of matter between cell network and vasculature are ubiquitous in numerous brain pathologies. A complete understanding of pathological conditions as well as normal brain function, therefore, hinges on elucidating the molecular and cellular pathways involved in these mostly interdependent variations. In this paper, we develop the first computational framework that combines the Hodgkin–Huxley type spiking dynamics, dynamic ion concentrations and glutamate homeostasis, neuronal and astroglial volume changes, and ion exchange with vasculature into a comprehensive model to elucidate the role of glutamate uptake in the dynamics of spreading depolarization (SD)—the electrophysiological event underlying numerous pathologies including migraine, ischemic stroke, aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage, intracerebral hematoma, and trauma. We are particularly interested in investigating the role of glutamate in the duration and termination of SD caused by K<sup>+</sup> perfusion and oxygen-glucose deprivation. Our results demonstrate that glutamate signaling plays a key role in the dynamics of SD, and that impaired glutamate uptake leads to recovery failure of neurons from SD. We confirm predictions from our model experimentally by showing that inhibiting astrocytic glutamate uptake using TFB-TBOA nearly quadruples the duration of SD in layers 2-3 of visual cortical slices from juvenile rats. The model equations are either derived purely from first physical principles of electroneutrality, osmosis, and conservation of particles or a combination of these principles and known physiological facts. Accordingly, we claim that our approach can be used as a future guide to investigate the role of glutamate, ion concentrations, and dynamics cell volume in other brain pathologies and normal brain function.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/AsuHPRHYqL0" width="1" />

<p>by Phuong Dao, Yoo-Ah Kim, Damian Wojtowicz, Sanna Madan, Roded Sharan, Teresa M. Przytycka</p>

The analysis of the mutational landscape of cancer, including mutual exclusivity and co-occurrence of mutations, has been instrumental in studying the disease. We hypothesized that exploring the interplay between co-occurrence, mutual exclusivity, and functional interactions between genes will further improve our understanding of the disease and help to uncover new relations between cancer driving genes and pathways. To this end, we designed a general framework, BeWith, for identifying modules with different combinations of mutation and interaction patterns. We focused on three different settings of the BeWith schema: (i) BeME-WithFun, in which the relations between modules are enriched with mutual exclusivity, while genes within each module are functionally related; (ii) BeME-WithCo, which combines mutual exclusivity between modules with co-occurrence within modules; and (iii) BeCo-WithMEFun, which ensures co-occurrence between modules, while the within module relations combine mutual exclusivity and functional interactions. We formulated the BeWith framework using Integer Linear Programming (ILP), enabling us to find optimally scoring sets of modules. Our results demonstrate the utility of BeWith in providing novel information about mutational patterns, driver genes, and pathways. In particular, BeME-WithFun helped identify functionally coherent modules that might be relevant for cancer progression. In addition to finding previously well-known drivers, the identified modules pointed to other novel findings such as the interaction between NCOR2 and NCOA3 in breast cancer. Additionally, an application of the BeME-WithCo setting revealed that gene groups differ with respect to their vulnerability to different mutagenic processes, and helped us to uncover pairs of genes with potentially synergistic effects, including a potential synergy between mutations in TP53 and the metastasis related DCC gene. Overall, BeWith not only helped us uncover relations between potential driver genes and pathways, but also provided additional insights on patterns of the mutational landscape, going beyond cancer driving mutations.

<p>by Kevin Drew, Christian L. Müller, Richard Bonneau, Edward M. Marcotte</p>

Determining the three dimensional arrangement of proteins in a complex is highly beneficial for uncovering mechanistic function and interpreting genetic variation in coding genes comprising protein complexes. There are several methods for determining co-complex interactions between proteins, among them co-fractionation / mass spectrometry (CF-MS), but it remains difficult to identify directly contacting subunits within a multi-protein complex. Correlation analysis of CF-MS profiles shows promise in detecting protein complexes as a whole but is limited in its ability to infer direct physical contacts among proteins in sub-complexes. To identify direct protein-protein contacts within human protein complexes we learn a sparse conditional dependency graph from approximately 3,000 CF-MS experiments on human cell lines. We show substantial performance gains in estimating direct interactions compared to correlation analysis on a benchmark of large protein complexes with solved three-dimensional structures. We demonstrate the method’s value in determining the three dimensional arrangement of proteins by making predictions for complexes without known structure (the exocyst and tRNA multi-synthetase complex) and by establishing evidence for the structural position of a recently discovered component of the core human EKC/KEOPS complex, GON7/C14ORF142, providing a more complete 3D model of the complex. Direct contact prediction provides easily calculable additional structural information for large-scale protein complex mapping studies and should be broadly applicable across organisms as more CF-MS datasets become available.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/pvQ962AXtfg" width="1" />

<p>by Bo Wang, Lin Huang, Yuke Zhu, Anshul Kundaje, Serafim Batzoglou, Anna Goldenberg</p>

Biological networks entail important topological features and patterns critical to understanding interactions within complicated biological systems. Despite a great progress in understanding their structure, much more can be done to improve our inference and network analysis. Spectral methods play a key role in many network-based applications. Fundamental to spectral methods is the Laplacian, a matrix that captures the global structure of the network. Unfortunately, the Laplacian does not take into account intricacies of the network’s local structure and is sensitive to noise in the network. These two properties are fundamental to biological networks and cannot be ignored. We propose an alternative matrix <i>Vicus</i>. The Vicus matrix captures the local neighborhood structure of the network and thus is more effective at modeling biological interactions. We demonstrate the advantages of Vicus in the context of spectral methods by extensive empirical benchmarking on tasks such as single cell dimensionality reduction, protein module discovery and ranking genes for cancer subtyping. Our experiments show that using Vicus, spectral methods result in more accurate and robust performance in all of these tasks.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/N-68mvTRJW4" width="1" />

A large fraction of the proteins that are being identified as key tumor dependencies represent poor pharmacological targets or lack clinically-relevant small-molecule inhibitors. Availability of fully generalizable approaches for the systematic and efficient prioritization of tumor-context specific protein activity inhibitors would thus have significant translational value. Unfortunately, inhibitor effects on protein activity cannot be directly measured in systematic and proteome-wide fashion by conventional biochemical assays. We introduce OncoLead, a novel network based approach for the systematic prioritization of candidate inhibitors for arbitrary targets of therapeutic interest. <i>In vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> validation confirmed that OncoLead analysis can recapitulate known inhibitors as well as prioritize novel, context-specific inhibitors of difficult targets, such as <i>MYC</i> and <i>STAT3</i>. We used OncoLead to generate the first unbiased drug/regulator interaction map, representing compounds modulating the activity of cancer-relevant transcription factors, with potential in precision medicine.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/VxPfG32FVlU" width="1" />

Network propagation is an important and widely used algorithm in systems biology, with applications in protein function prediction, disease gene prioritization, and patient stratification. However, up to this point it has required significant expertise to run. Here we extend the popular network analysis program Cytoscape to perform network propagation as an integrated function. Such integration greatly increases the access to network propagation by putting it in the hands of biologists and linking it to the many other types of network analysis and visualization available through Cytoscape. We demonstrate the power and utility of the algorithm by identifying mutations conferring resistance to Vemurafenib.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/UR4nnjuvuFI" width="1" />

<p>by Aziz M. Mezlini, Anna Goldenberg</p>

Discovering genetic mechanisms driving complex diseases is a hard problem. Existing methods often lack power to identify the set of responsible genes. Protein-protein interaction networks have been shown to boost power when detecting gene-disease associations. We introduce a Bayesian framework, Conflux, to find disease associated genes from exome sequencing data using networks as a prior. There are two main advantages to using networks within a probabilistic graphical model. First, networks are noisy and incomplete, a substantial impediment to gene discovery. Incorporating networks into the structure of a probabilistic models for gene inference has less impact on the solution than relying on the noisy network structure directly. Second, using a Bayesian framework we can keep track of the uncertainty of each gene being associated with the phenotype rather than returning a fixed list of genes. We first show that using networks clearly improves gene detection compared to individual gene testing. We then show consistently improved performance of Conflux compared to the state-of-the-art diffusion network-based method Hotnet2 and a variety of other network and variant aggregation methods, using randomly generated and literature-reported gene sets. We test Hotnet2 and Conflux on several network configurations to reveal biases and patterns of false positives and false negatives in each case. Our experiments show that our novel Bayesian framework Conflux incorporates many of the advantages of the current state-of-the-art methods, while offering more flexibility and improved power in many gene-disease association scenarios.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/kUw0rxsgQDw" width="1" />

<p>by Emine Guven-Maiorov, Chung-Jung Tsai, Ruth Nussinov</p>

Hundreds of different species colonize multicellular organisms making them “metaorganisms”. A growing body of data supports the role of microbiota in health and in disease. Grasping the principles of host-microbiota interactions (HMIs) at the molecular level is important since it may provide insights into the mechanisms of infections. The crosstalk between the host and the microbiota may help resolve puzzling questions such as how a microorganism can contribute to both health and disease. Integrated superorganism networks that consider host and microbiota as a whole–may uncover their code, clarifying perhaps the most fundamental question: how they modulate immune surveillance. Within this framework, structural HMI networks can uniquely identify potential microbial effectors that target distinct host nodes or interfere with endogenous host interactions, as well as how mutations on either host or microbial proteins affect the interaction. Furthermore, structural HMIs can help identify master host cell regulator nodes and modules whose tweaking by the microbes promote aberrant activity. Collectively, these data can delineate pathogenic mechanisms and thereby help maximize beneficial therapeutics. To date, challenges in experimental techniques limit large-scale characterization of HMIs. Here we highlight an area in its infancy which we believe will increasingly engage the computational community: predicting interactions across kingdoms, and mapping these on the host cellular networks to figure out how commensal and pathogenic microbiota modulate the host signaling and broadly cross-species consequences.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/I1eNXPCZnzk" width="1" />

<p>by Kevin S. Bonham, Melanie I. Stefan</p>

While women are generally underrepresented in STEM fields, there are noticeable differences between fields. For instance, the gender ratio in biology is more balanced than in computer science. We were interested in how this difference is reflected in the interdisciplinary field of computational/quantitative biology. To this end, we examined the proportion of female authors in publications from the PubMed and arXiv databases. There are fewer female authors on research papers in computational biology, as compared to biology in general. This is true across authorship position, year, and journal impact factor. A comparison with arXiv shows that quantitative biology papers have a higher ratio of female authors than computer science papers, placing computational biology in between its two parent fields in terms of gender representation. Both in biology and in computational biology, a female last author increases the probability of other authors on the paper being female, pointing to a potential role of female PIs in influencing the gender balance.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/6WjygxNvj58" width="1" />

<div class="para"><p>Biallelic <em>DNAJC12</em> mutations were described in children with hyperphenylalaninemia, neurodevelopmental delay, and dystonia. We identified <em>DNAJC12</em> homozygous null variants (c.187A&gt;T;p.K63* and c.79-2A&gt;G;p.V27Wfs*14) in two kindreds with early-onset parkinsonism. Both probands had mild intellectual disability, mild nonprogressive, motor symptoms, sustained benefit from small dose of levodopa, and substantial worsening of symptoms after levodopa discontinuation. Neuropathology (Proband-A) revealed no alpha-synuclein pathology, and substantia nigra depigmentation with moderate cell loss. <em>DNAJC12</em> transcripts were reduced in both patients. Our results suggest that <em>DNAJC12</em> mutations (absent in 500 early-onset patients with Parkinson's disease) rarely cause dopa-responsive nonprogressive parkinsonism in adulthood, but broaden the clinical spectrum of <em>DNAJC12</em> deficiency.

<div class="section" id="ana25045-sec-0001"><h4>Objective</h4><div class="para"><p>We here aimed at characterizing heart–brain interactions in patients with disorders of consciousness. We tested how this information impacts data-driven classification between unresponsive and minimally conscious patients.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" id="ana25045-sec-0002"><h4>Methods</h4><div class="para"><p>A cohort of 127 patients in vegetative state/unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (VS/UWS; n = 70) and minimally conscious state (MCS; n = 57) were presented with the local–global auditory oddball paradigm, which distinguishes 2 levels of processing: short-term deviation of local auditory regularities and global long-term rule violations. In addition to previously validated markers of consciousness extracted from electroencephalograms (EEG), we computed autonomic cardiac markers, such as heart rate (HR) and HR variability (HRV), and cardiac cycle phase shifts triggered by the processing of the auditory stimuli.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" id="ana25045-sec-0003"><h4>Results</h4><div class="para"><p>HR and HRV were similar in patients across groups. The cardiac cycle was not sensitive to the processing of local regularities in either the VS/UWS or MCS patients. In contrast, global regularities induced a phase shift of the cardiac cycle exclusively in the MCS group. The interval between the auditory stimulation and the following R peak was significantly shortened in MCS when the auditory rule was violated. When the information for the cardiac cycle modulations and other consciousness-related EEG markers were combined, single patient classification performance was enhanced compared to classification with solely EEG markers.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" id="ana25045-sec-0004"><h4>Interpretation</h4><div class="para"><p>Our work shows a link between residual cognitive processing and the modulation of autonomic somatic markers. These results open a new window to evaluate patients with disorders of consciousness via the embodied paradigm, according to which body–brain functions contribute to a holistic approach to conscious processing.

A long-standing question has been how presynaptic NMDA receptors influence high-frequency evoked neurotransmission but spontaneous release at low rates. Providing resolution, Abrahamsson et al. show that these receptors regulate evoked and spontaneous release via distinct RIM1αβ- and JNK2-dependent mechanisms, respectively.

<p>by Mark L. Ioffe, Michael J. Berry II</p>

Recent advances in experimental techniques have allowed the simultaneous recordings of populations of hundreds of neurons, fostering a debate about the nature of the collective structure of population neural activity. Much of this debate has focused on the empirical findings of a phase transition in the parameter space of maximum entropy models describing the measured neural probability distributions, interpreting this phase transition to indicate a critical tuning of the neural code. Here, we instead focus on the possibility that this is a first-order phase transition which provides evidence that the real neural population is in a ‘structured’, collective state. We show that this collective state is robust to changes in stimulus ensemble and adaptive state. We find that the pattern of pairwise correlations between neurons has a strength that is well within the strongly correlated regime and does not require fine tuning, suggesting that this state is generic for populations of 100+ neurons. We find a clear correspondence between the emergence of a phase transition, and the emergence of attractor-like structure in the inferred energy landscape. A collective state in the neural population, in which neural activity patterns naturally form clusters, provides a consistent interpretation for our results.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/B5PqSxk57oU" width="1" />

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/41/9999?rss=1">Domain-General Brain Regions Do Not Track Linguistic Input as Closely as Language-Selective Regions</a></h4>

<p>Language comprehension engages a cortical network of left frontal and temporal regions. Activity in this network is language-selective, showing virtually no modulation by nonlinguistic tasks. In addition, language comprehension engages a second network consisting of bilateral frontal, parietal, cingulate, and insular regions. Activity in this "multiple demand" (MD) network scales with comprehension difficulty, but also with cognitive effort across a wide range of nonlinguistic tasks in a domain-general fashion. Given the functional dissociation between the language and MD networks, their respective contributions to comprehension are likely distinct, yet such differences remain elusive. Prior neuroimaging studies have suggested that activity in each network covaries with some linguistic features that, behaviorally, influence on-line processing and comprehension. This sensitivity of the language and MD networks to local input characteristics has often been interpreted, implicitly or explicitly, as evidence that both networks track linguistic input closely, and in a manner consistent across individuals. Here, we used fMRI to directly test this assumption by comparing the BOLD signal time courses in each network across different people (<i>n</i> = 45, men and women) listening to the same story. Language network activity showed fewer individual differences, indicative of closer input tracking, whereas MD network activity was more idiosyncratic and, moreover, showed lower reliability within an individual across repetitions of a story. These findings constrain cognitive models of language comprehension by suggesting a novel distinction between the processes implemented in the language and MD networks.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Language comprehension recruits both language-specific mechanisms and domain-general mechanisms that are engaged in many cognitive processes. In the human cortex, language-selective mechanisms are implemented in the left-lateralized "core language network", whereas domain-general mechanisms are implemented in the bilateral "multiple demand" (MD) network. Here, we report the first direct comparison of the respective contributions of these networks to naturalistic story comprehension. Using a novel combination of neuroimaging approaches we find that MD regions track stories less closely than language regions. This finding constrains the possible contributions of the MD network to comprehension, contrasts with accounts positing that this network has continuous access to linguistic input, and suggests a new typology of comprehension processes based on their extent of input tracking.</p>

<p>Classical schemes of basal ganglia organization posit that parkinsonian movement difficulties presenting after striatal dopamine depletion stem from the disproportionate firing rates of spiny projection neurons (SPNs) therein. There remains, however, a pressing need to elucidate striatal SPN firing in the context of the synchronized network oscillations that are abnormally exaggerated in cortical–basal ganglia circuits in parkinsonism. To address this, we recorded unit activities in the dorsal striatum of dopamine-intact and dopamine-depleted rats during two brain states, respectively defined by cortical slow-wave activity (SWA) and activation. Dopamine depletion escalated striatal net output but had contrasting effects on "direct pathway" SPNs (dSPNs) and "indirect pathway" SPNs (iSPNs); their firing rates became imbalanced, and they disparately engaged in network oscillations. Disturbed striatal activity dynamics relating to the slow (~1 Hz) oscillations prevalent during SWA partly generalized to the exaggerated beta-frequency (15–30 Hz) oscillations arising during cortical activation. In both cases, SPNs exhibited higher incidences of phase-locked firing to ongoing cortical oscillations, and SPN ensembles showed higher levels of rhythmic correlated firing, after dopamine depletion. Importantly, in dopamine-depleted striatum, a widespread population of iSPNs, which often displayed excessive firing rates and aberrant phase-locked firing to cortical beta oscillations, preferentially and excessively synchronized their firing at beta frequencies. Conversely, dSPNs were neither hyperactive nor synchronized to a large extent during cortical activation. These data collectively demonstrate a cell type-selective entrainment of SPN firing to parkinsonian beta oscillations. We conclude that a population of overactive, excessively synchronized iSPNs could orchestrate these pathological rhythms in basal ganglia circuits.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Chronic depletion of dopamine from the striatum, a part of the basal ganglia, causes some symptoms of Parkinson's disease. Here, we elucidate how dopamine depletion alters striatal neuron firing <i>in vivo</i>, with an emphasis on defining whether and how spiny projection neurons (SPNs) engage in the synchronized beta-frequency (15–30 Hz) oscillations that become pathologically exaggerated throughout basal ganglia circuits in parkinsonism. We discovered that a select population of so-called "indirect pathway" SPNs not only fire at abnormally high rates, but are also particularly prone to being recruited to exaggerated beta oscillations. Our results provide an important link between two complementary theories that explain the presentation of disease symptoms on the basis of changes in firing rate or firing synchronization/rhythmicity.</p>

<p>Dendritic spines are key elements underlying synaptic integration and cellular plasticity, but many features of these important structures are not known or are controversial. We examined these properties using newly developed simultaneous sodium and calcium imaging with single-spine resolution in pyramidal neurons in rat hippocampal slices from either sex. Indicators for both ions were loaded through the somatic patch pipette, which also recorded electrical responses. Fluorescence changes were detected with a high-speed, low-noise CCD camera. Following subthreshold electrical stimulation, postsynaptic sodium entry is almost entirely through AMPA receptors with little contribution from entry through NMDA receptors or voltage-gated sodium channels. Sodium removal from the spine head is through rapid diffusion out to the dendrite through the spine neck with a half-removal time of ~16 ms, which suggests the neck has low resistance. Peak [Na<sup>+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> changes during single EPSPs are ~5 mm. Stronger electrical stimulation evoked small plateau potentials that had significant longer-lasting localized [Na<sup>+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> increases mediated through NMDA receptors.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Dendritic spines, small structures that are difficult to investigate, are important elements in the fundamental processes of synaptic integration and plasticity. The main tool for examining these structures has been calcium imaging. However, the kinds of information that calcium imaging reveals is limited. We used newly developed, high-speed, simultaneous sodium and calcium imaging to examine ion dynamics in spines in hippocampal pyramidal neurons. We found that following single subthreshold synaptic activation most sodium entry was through AMPA receptors and not through NMDA receptors or through voltage-gated sodium channels and that the spine neck is not a significant resistance barrier. Most spine mechanisms are linear. However, regenerative NMDA conductances can be activated with stronger stimulation.</p>

<p>The regulated transport of AMPA-type glutamate receptors (AMPARs) to the synaptic membrane is a key mechanism to determine the strength of excitatory synaptic transmission in the brain. In this work, we uncovered a new role for the microtubule-associated protein MAP1B in modulating access of AMPARs to the postsynaptic membrane. Using mice and rats of either sex, we show that MAP1B light chain (LC) accumulates in the somatodendritic compartment of hippocampal neurons, where it forms immobile complexes on microtubules that limit vesicular transport. These complexes restrict AMPAR dendritic mobility, leading to the intracellular trapping of receptors and impairing their access to the dendritic surface and spines. Accordingly, increasing MAP1B-LC expression depresses AMPAR-mediated synaptic transmission. This effect is specific for the GluA2 subunit of the AMPAR and requires glutamate receptor interacting protein 1 (GRIP1) interaction with MAP1B-LC. Therefore, MAP1B-LC represents an alternative link between GRIP1-AMPARs and microtubules that does not result in productive transport, but rather limits AMPAR availability for synaptic insertion, with a direct impact on synaptic transmission.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The ability of neurons to modify their synaptic connections, known as synaptic plasticity, is accepted as the cellular basis for learning and memory. One mechanism for synaptic plasticity is the regulated addition and removal of AMPA-type glutamate receptors (AMPARs) at excitatory synapses. In this study, we found that a microtubule-associated protein, MAP1B light chain (MAP1B-LC), participates in this process. MAP1B-LC forms immobile complexes along dendrites. These complexes limit intracellular vesicular trafficking and trap AMPARs inside the dendritic shaft. In this manner, MAP1B restricts the access of AMPARs to dendritic spines and the postsynaptic membrane, contributing to downregulating synaptic transmission.</p>

<p>Declarative memory recall is thought to involve the reinstatement of neural activity patterns that occurred previously during encoding. Consistent with this view, greater similarity between patterns of activity recorded during encoding and retrieval has been found to predict better memory performance in a number of studies. Recent models have argued that neural oscillations may be crucial to reinstatement for successful memory retrieval. However, to date, no causal evidence has been provided to support this theory, nor has the impact of oscillatory electrical brain stimulation during encoding and retrieval been assessed. To explore this we used transcranial alternating current stimulation over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of human participants [<i>n</i> = 70, 45 females; age mean (SD) = 22.12 (2.16)] during a declarative memory task. Participants received either the same frequency during encoding and retrieval (60–60 or 90–90 Hz) or different frequencies (60–90 or 90–60 Hz). When frequencies matched there was a significant memory improvement (at both 60 and 90 Hz) relative to sham stimulation. No improvement occurred when frequencies mismatched. Our results provide support for the role of oscillatory reinstatement in memory retrieval.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Recent neurobiological models of memory have argued that large-scale neural oscillations are reinstated to support successful memory retrieval. Here we used transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) to test these models. tACS has recently been shown to induce neural oscillations at the frequency stimulated. We stimulated over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex during a declarative memory task involving learning a set of words. We found that tACS applied at the same frequency during encoding and retrieval enhances memory. We also find no difference between the two applied frequencies. Thus our results are consistent with the proposal that reinstatement of neural oscillations during retrieval supports successful memory retrieval.</p>

<p>Remyelination failure by oligodendrocytes contributes to the functional impairment that characterizes the demyelinating disease multiple sclerosis (MS). Since incomplete remyelination will irreversibly damage axonal connections, treatments effectively promoting remyelination are pivotal in halting disease progression. Our previous findings suggest that fibronectin aggregates, as an environmental factor, contribute to remyelination failure by perturbing oligodendrocyte progenitor cell (OPC) maturation. Here, we aim at elucidating whether exogenously added gangliosides (i.e., cell surface lipids with a potential to modulate signaling pathways) could counteract fibronectin-mediated inhibition of OPC maturation. Exclusive exposure of rat oligodendrocytes to GD1a, but not other gangliosides, overcomes aggregated fibronectin-induced inhibition of myelin membrane formation, <i>in vitro</i>, and OPC differentiation in fibronectin aggregate containing cuprizone-induced demyelinated lesions in male mice. GD1a exerts its effect on OPCs by inducing their proliferation and, at a late stage, by modulating OPC maturation. Kinase activity profiling revealed that GD1a activated a protein kinase A (PKA)-dependent signaling pathway and increased phosphorylation of the transcription factor cAMP response element-binding protein. Consistently, the effect of GD1a in restoring myelin membrane formation in the presence of fibronectin aggregates was abolished by the PKA inhibitor H89, whereas the effect of GD1a was mimicked by the PKA activator dibutyryl-cAMP. Together, GD1a overcomes the inhibiting effect of aggregated fibronectin on OPC maturation by activating a PKA-dependent signaling pathway. Given the persistent presence of fibronectin aggregates in MS lesions, ganglioside GD1a might act as a potential novel therapeutic tool to selectively modulate the detrimental signaling environment that precludes remyelination.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> As an environmental factor, aggregates of the extracellular matrix protein fibronectin perturb the maturation of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs), thereby impeding remyelination, in the demyelinating disease multiple sclerosis (MS). Here we demonstrate that exogenous addition of ganglioside GD1a overcomes the inhibiting effect of aggregated fibronectin on OPC maturation, both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>, by activating a PKA-dependent signaling pathway. We propose that targeted delivery of GD1a to MS lesions may act as a potential novel molecular tool to boost maturation of resident OPCs to overcome remyelination failure and halt disease progression.</p>

<p>Increased p25, a proteolytic fragment of the regulatory subunit p35, is known to induce aberrant activity of cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5), which is associated with neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease. Previously, we showed that replacing endogenous p35 with the noncleavable mutant p35 (p35) attenuated amyloidosis and improved cognitive function in a familial Alzheimer's disease mouse model. Here, to address the role of p25/Cdk5 in tauopathy, we generated double-transgenic mice by crossing mice overexpressing mutant human tau (P301S) with <i>p35KI</i> mice. We observed significant reduction of phosphorylated tau and its seeding activity in the brain of double transgenic mice compared with the P301S mice. Furthermore, synaptic loss and impaired LTP at hippocampal CA3 region of <i>P301S</i> mice were attenuated by blocking p25 generation. To further validate the role of p25/Cdk5 in tauopathy, we used frontotemporal dementia patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) carrying the Tau P301L mutation and generated P301L:p35KI isogenic iPSC lines using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing. We created cerebral organoids from the isogenic iPSCs and found that blockade of p25 generation reduced levels of phosphorylated tau and increased expression of synaptophysin. Together, these data demonstrate a crucial role for p25/Cdk5 in mediating tau-associated pathology and suggest that inhibition of this kinase can remedy neurodegenerative processes in the presence of pathogenic tau mutation.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Accumulation of p25 results in aberrant Cdk5 activation and induction of numerous pathological phenotypes, such as neuroinflammation, synaptic loss, Aβ accumulation, and tau hyperphosphorylation. However, it was not clear whether p25/Cdk5 activity is necessary for the progression of these pathological changes. We recently developed the <i>p35KI</i> transgenic mouse that is deficient in p25 generation and Cdk5 hyperactivation. In this study, we used this mouse model to elucidate the role of p25/Cdk5 in FTD mutant tau-mediated pathology. We also used a frontotemporal dementia patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cell carrying the Tau P301L mutation and generated isogenic lines in which p35 is replaced with noncleavable mutant p35. Our data suggest that p25/Cdk5 plays an important role in tauopathy in both mouse and human model systems.</p>

<p>Different cortical regions processing distinct information, such as the hippocampus and the neocortex, share common cellular components and circuit motifs but form unique networks by modifying these cardinal units. Cortical circuits include diverse types of GABAergic interneurons (INs) that shape activity of excitatory principal neurons (PNs). Canonical IN types conserved across distinct cortical regions have been defined by their morphological, electrophysiological, and neurochemical properties. However, it remains largely unknown whether canonical IN types undergo specific modifications in distinct cortical regions and display "regional variants." It is also poorly understood whether such phenotypic variations are shaped by early specification or regional cellular environment. The chandelier cell (ChC) is a highly stereotyped IN type that innervates axon initial segments of PNs and thus serves as a good model with which to address this issue. Here, we show that Cadherin-6 (Cdh6), a homophilic cell adhesion molecule, is a reliable marker of ChCs and <i>Cdh6-CreER</i> mice (both sexes) provide genetic access to hippocampal ChCs (h-ChCs). We demonstrate that, compared with neocortical ChCs (nc-ChCs), h-ChCs cover twice as much area and innervate twice as many PNs. Interestingly, a subclass of h-ChCs exhibits calretinin (CR) expression, which is not found in nc-ChCs. Furthermore, we find that h-ChCs appear to be born earlier than nc-ChCs. Surprisingly, despite the difference in temporal origins, ChCs display host-region-dependent axonal/synaptic organization and CR expression when transplanted heterotopically. These results suggest that local cellular environment plays a critical role in shaping terminal phenotypes of regional IN variants in the hippocampus and the neocortex.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Canonical interneuron (IN) types conserved across distinct cortical regions such as the hippocampus and the neocortex are defined by morphology, physiology, and gene expression. However, it remains unknown whether they display phenotypic variations in different cortical regions. In addition, it is unclear whether terminal phenotypes of regional IN variants belonging to a canonical IN type are determined intrinsically or extrinsically. Our results provide evidence of striking differences in axonal/synaptic organization and calretinin expression between hippocampal chandelier cells (ChCs) and neocortical ChCs. They also reveal that local cellular environment in distinct cortical regions regulates these terminal phenotypes. Therefore, our study suggests that local cortical environment shapes the phenotypes of regional IN variants, which may be required for unique circuit operations in distinct cortical regions.</p>

<p>Neurotransmission plays an essential role in neural circuit formation in the central nervous system (CNS). Although neurotransmission has been recently clarified as a key modulator of retinal circuit development, the roles of individual synaptic transmissions are not yet fully understood. In the current study, we investigated the role of neurotransmission from photoreceptor cells to ON bipolar cells in development using mutant mouse lines of both sexes in which this transmission is abrogated. We found that deletion of the ON bipolar cation channel TRPM1 results in the abnormal contraction of rod bipolar terminals and a decreased number of their synaptic connections with amacrine cells. In contrast, these histological alterations were not caused by a disruption of total glutamate transmission due to loss of the ON bipolar glutamate receptor mGluR6 or the photoreceptor glutamate transporter VGluT1. In addition, <i>TRPM1</i> deficiency led to the reduction of total dendritic length, branch numbers, and cell body size in AII amacrine cells. Activated Goα, known to close the TRPM1 channel, interacted with TRPM1 and induced the contraction of rod bipolar terminals. Furthermore, overexpression of Channelrhodopsin-2 partially rescued rod bipolar cell development in the <i>TRPM1</i><sup>–/–</sup> retina, whereas the rescue effect by a constitutively closed form of TRPM1 was lower than that by the native form. Our results suggest that TRPM1 channel opening is essential for rod bipolar pathway establishment in development.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Neurotransmission has been recognized recently as a key modulator of retinal circuit development in the CNS. However, the roles of individual synaptic transmissions are not yet fully understood. In the current study, we focused on neurotransmission between rod photoreceptor cells and rod bipolar cells in the retina. We used genetically modified mouse models which abrogate each step of neurotransmission: presynaptic glutamate release, postsynaptic glutamate reception, or transduction channel function. We found that the TRPM1 transduction channel is required for the development of rod bipolar cells and their synaptic formation with subsequent neurons, independently of glutamate transmission. This study advances our understanding of neurotransmission-mediated retinal circuit refinement.</p>

<p>Activity-dependent synaptic plasticity plays a critical role in the refinement of circuitry during postnatal development and may be disrupted in conditions that cause intellectual disability, such as Down syndrome (DS). To test this hypothesis, visual cortical plasticity was assessed in Ts65Dn mice that harbor a chromosomal duplication syntenic to human chromosome 21q. We find that Ts65Dn mice demonstrate a defect in ocular dominance plasticity (ODP) following monocular deprivation. This phenotype is similar to that of transgenic mice that express amyloid precursor protein (APP), which is duplicated in DS and in Ts65DN mice; however, normalizing <i>APP</i> gene copy number in Ts65Dn mice fails to rescue plasticity. Ts1Rhr mice harbor a duplication of the telomeric third of the Ts65Dn-duplicated sequence and demonstrate the same ODP defect, suggesting a gene or genes sufficient to drive the phenotype are located in that smaller duplication. In addition, we find that Ts65Dn mice demonstrate an abnormality in olfactory system connectivity, a defect in the refinement of connections to second-order neurons in the olfactory bulb. Ts1Rhr mice do not demonstrate a defect in glomerular refinement, suggesting that distinct genes or sets of genes underlie visual and olfactory system phenotypes. Importantly, these data suggest that developmental plasticity and connectivity are impaired in sensory systems in DS model mice, that such defects may contribute to functional impairment in DS, and that these phenotypes, present in male and female mice, provide novel means for examining the genetic and molecular bases for neurodevelopmental impairment in model mice <i>in vivo</i>.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Our understanding of the basis for intellectual impairment in Down syndrome is hindered by the large number of genes duplicated in Trisomy 21 and a lack of understanding of the effect of disease pathology on the function of neural circuits <i>in vivo</i>. This work describes early postnatal developmental abnormalities in visual and olfactory sensory systems in Down syndrome model mice, which provide insight into defects in the function of neural circuits <i>in vivo</i> and provide an approach for exploring the genetic and molecular basis for impairment in the disease. In addition, these findings raise the possibility that basic dysfunction in primary sensory circuitry may illustrate mechanisms important for global learning and cognitive impairment in Down syndrome patients.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/41/9871?rss=1">Visual Responses in FEF, Unlike V1, Primarily Reflect When the Visual Context Renders a Receptive Field Salient</a></h4>

<p>When light falls within a neuronal visual receptive field (RF) the resulting activity is referred to as the visual response. Recent work suggests this activity is in response to both the visual stimulation and the abrupt appearance, or salience, of the presentation. Here we present a novel method for distinguishing the two, based on the timing of random and nonrandom presentations. We examined these contributions in frontal eye field (FEF; <i>N</i> = 51) and as a comparison, an early stage in the primary visual cortex (V1; <i>N</i> = 15) of male monkeys (<i>Macaca mulatta</i>). An array of identical stimuli was presented within and outside the neuronal RF while we manipulated salience by varying the time between stimulus presentations. We hypothesized that the rapid presentation would reduce salience (the sudden appearance within the visual field) of a stimulus at any one location, and thus decrease responses driven by salience in the RF. We found that when the interstimulus interval decreased from 500 to 16 ms there was an approximate 79% reduction in the FEF response compared with an estimated 17% decrease in V1. This reduction in FEF response for rapid presentation was evident even when the random sequence preceding a stimulus did not stimulate the RF for 500 ms. The time course of these response changes in FEF suggest that salience is represented much earlier (&lt;100 ms following stimulus onset) than previously estimated. Our results suggest that the contribution of salience dominates at higher levels of the visual system.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The neuronal responses in early visual processing [e.g., primary visual cortex (V1)] reflect primarily the retinal stimulus. Processing in higher visual areas is modulated by a combination of the visual stimulation and contextual factors, such as salience, but identifying these components separately has been difficult. Here we quantified these contributions at a late stage of visual processing [frontal eye field (FEF)] and as a comparison, an early stage in V1. Our results suggest that as visual information continues through higher levels of processing the neural responses are no longer driven primarily by the visual stimulus in the receptive field, but by the broader context that stimulus defines—very different from current views about visual signals in FEF.</p>

<p>Astrocytes spontaneously release glutamate (Glut) as a gliotransmitter (GT), resulting in the generation of extrasynaptic NMDAR-mediated slow inward currents (SICs) in neighboring neurons, which can increase local neuronal excitability. However, there is a deficit in our knowledge of the factors that control spontaneous astrocyte GT release and the extent of its influence. We found that, in rat brain slices, increasing the supply of the physiological transmitter Glut increased the frequency and signaling charge of SICs over an extended period. This phenomenon was replicated by exogenous preexposure to the amino acid D-aspartate (D-Asp). Using D-Asp as a "false" GT, we determined the extent of local neuron excitation by GT release in ventrobasal thalamus, CA1 hippocampus, and somatosensory cortex. By analyzing synchronized neuronal NMDAR-mediated excitation, we found that the properties of the excitation were conserved in different brain areas. In the three areas, astrocyte-derived GT release synchronized groups of neurons at distances of &gt;;200 μm. Individual neurons participated in more than one synchronized population, indicating that individual neurons can be excited by more than one astrocyte and that individual astrocytes may determine a neuron's synchronized network. The results confirm that astrocytes can act as excitatory nodes that can influence neurons over a significant range in a number of brain regions. Our findings further suggest that chronic elevation of ambient Glut levels can lead to increased GT Glut release, which may be relevant in some pathological states.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Astrocytes spontaneously release glutamate (Glut) and other gliotransmitters (GTs) that can modify neuronal activity. Exposing brain slices to Glut and D-aspartate (D-Asp) before recording resulted in an increase in frequency of GT-mediated astrocyte–neuron signaling. Using D-Asp, it was possible to investigate the effects of specific GT release at neuronal NMDARs. Calcium imaging showed synchronized activity in groups of neurons in cortex, hippocampus, and thalamus. The size of these populations was similar in all areas and some neurons were involved in more than one synchronous group. The findings show that GT release is supply dependent and that the properties of the signaling and activated networks are largely conserved between different brain areas.</p>

<p>Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) loss causes Fragile X syndrome (FXS), a major disorder characterized by autism, intellectual disability, hyperactivity, and seizures. FMRP is both an RNA- and channel-binding regulator, with critical roles in neural circuit formation and function. However, it remains unclear how these FMRP activities relate to each other and how dysfunction in their absence underlies FXS neurological symptoms. In testing circuit level defects in the <i>Drosophila</i> FXS model, we discovered a completely unexpected and highly robust neuronal dye iontophoresis phenotype in the well mapped giant fiber (GF) circuit. Controlled dye injection into the GF interneuron results in a dramatic increase in dye uptake in neurons lacking FMRP. Transgenic wild-type FMRP reintroduction rescues the mutant defect, demonstrating a specific FMRP requirement. This phenotype affects only small dyes, but is independent of dye charge polarity. Surprisingly, the elevated dye iontophoresis persists in <i>shaking B</i> mutants that eliminate gap junctions and dye coupling among GF circuit neurons. We therefore used a wide range of manipulations to investigate the dye uptake defect, including timed injection series, pharmacology and ion replacement, and optogenetic activity studies. The results show that FMRP strongly limits the rate of dye entry via a cytosolic mechanism. This study reveals an unexpected new phenotype in a physical property of central neurons lacking FMRP that could underlie aspects of FXS disruption of neural function.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> FXS is a leading heritable cause of intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorders. Although researchers established the causal link with FMRP loss &gt;;25 years ago, studies continue to reveal diverse FMRP functions. The <i>Drosophila</i> FXS model is key to discovering new FMRP roles, because of its genetic malleability and individually identified neuron maps. Taking advantage of a well characterized <i>Drosophila</i> neural circuit, we discovered that neurons lacking FMRP take up dramatically more current-injected small dye. After examining many neuronal properties, we determined that this dye defect is cytoplasmic and occurs due to a highly elevated dye iontophoresis rate. We also report several new factors affecting neuron dye uptake. Understanding how FMRP regulates iontophoresis should reveal new molecular factors underpinning FXS dysfunction.</p>

<p>The proper formation of synapses—specialized unitary structures formed between two neurons—is critical to mediating information flow in the brain. Synaptic cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) are thought to participate in the initiation of the synapse formation process. However, <i>in vivo</i> functional analysis demonstrates that most well known synaptic CAMs regulate synaptic maturation and plasticity rather than synapse formation, suggesting that either CAMs work synergistically in the process of forming synapses or more CAMs remain to be found. By screening for unknown CAMs using a co-culture system, we revealed that protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type O (PTPRO) is a potent CAM that induces the formation of artificial synapse clusters in co-cultures of human embryonic kidney 293 cells and hippocampal neurons cultured from newborn mice regardless of gender. PTPRO was enriched in the mouse brain and localized to postsynaptic sites at excitatory synapses. The overexpression of PTPRO in cultured hippocampal neurons increased the number of synapses and the frequency of miniature EPSCs (mEPSCs). The knock-down (KD) of PTPRO expression in cultured neurons by short hairpin RNA (shRNA) reduced the number of synapses and the frequencies of the mEPSCs. The effects of shRNA KD were rescued by expressing either full-length PTPRO or a truncated PTPRO lacking the cytoplasmic domain. Consistent with these results, the N-terminal extracellular domain of PTPRO was required for its synaptogenic activity in the co-culture assay. Our data show that PTPRO is a synaptic CAM that serves as a potent initiator of the formation of excitatory synapses.</p>

<p>It has been reported consistently that many female chronic pain sufferers have an attenuation of symptoms during pregnancy. Rats display increased pain tolerance during pregnancy due to an increase in opioid receptors in the spinal cord. Past studies did not consider the role of non-neuronal cells, which are now known to play an important role in chronic pain processing. Using an inflammatory (complete Freund's adjuvant) or neuropathic (spared nerve injury) model of persistent pain, we observed that young adult female mice in early pregnancy switch from a microglia-independent to a microglia-dependent pain hypersensitivity mechanism. During late pregnancy, female mice show no evidence of chronic pain whatsoever. This pregnancy-related analgesia is reversible by intrathecal administration of naloxone, suggesting an opioid-mediated mechanism; pharmacological and genetic data suggest the importance of -opioid receptors. We also observe that T-cell-deficient (<i>nude</i> and <i>Rag1</i>-null mutant) pregnant mice do not exhibit pregnancy analgesia, which can be rescued with the adoptive transfer of CD4<sup>+</sup> or CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells from late-pregnant wild-type mice. These results suggest that T cells are a mediator of the opioid analgesia exhibited during pregnancy.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Chronic pain symptoms often subside during pregnancy. This pregnancy-related analgesia has been demonstrated for acute pain in rats. Here, we show that pregnancy analgesia can produce a complete cessation of chronic pain behaviors in mice. We show that the phenomenon is dependent on pregnancy hormones (estrogen and progesterone), -opioid receptors, and T cells of the adaptive immune system. These findings add to the recent but growing evidence of sex-specific T-cell involvement in chronic pain processing.</p>

<p>In Parkinson's disease, intracellular α-synuclein inclusions form in neurons. We suggest that prion-like behavior of α-synuclein is a key component in Parkinson's disease pathogenesis. Although multiple molecular changes are involved in the triggering of the disease process, we propose that neuron-to-neuron transfer is a crucial event that is essential for Lewy pathology to spread from one brain region to another. In this review, we describe key findings in human postmortem brains, cultured cells, and animal models of disease that support the idea that α-synuclein can act as a prion. We consider potential triggers of the α-synuclein misfolding and why the aggregates escape cellular degradation under disease conditions. We also discuss whether different strains of α-synuclein fibrils can underlie differences in cellular and regional distribution of aggregates in different synucleinopathies. Our conclusion is that α-synuclein probably acts as a prion in human diseases, and a deeper understanding of this step in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease can facilitate the development of disease-modifying therapies in the future.</p>

<p>The notion that prion-like spreading of misfolded α-synuclein (α-SYN) causes Parkinson's disease (PD) has received a great deal of attention. Although attractive in its simplicity, the hypothesis is difficult to reconcile with postmortem analysis of human brains and connectome-mapping studies. An alternative hypothesis is that PD pathology is governed by regional or cell-autonomous factors. Although these factors provide an explanation for the pattern of neuronal loss in PD, they do not readily explain the apparently staged distribution of Lewy pathology in many PD brains, the feature of the disease that initially motivated the spreading hypothesis by Braak and colleagues. While each hypothesis alone has its shortcomings, a synthesis of the two can explain much of what we know about the etiopathology of PD.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/41/10012?rss=1">Adaptation of Thalamic Neurons Provides Information about the Spatiotemporal Context of Stimulus History</a></h4>

<p>Adaptation of neural responses due to the history of sensory input has been observed across all sensory modalities. However, the computational role of adaptation is not fully understood, especially when one considers neural coding problems in which adaptation increases the ambiguity of the neural responses to simple stimuli. To address this, we quantified the impact of adaptation on the information conveyed by thalamic neurons about paired whisker stimuli in male rat. At the single neuron level, although paired-pulse adaptation reduces the information about the present stimulus, the information per spike increases. Moreover, the adapted response can convey significant amounts of information about whether, when and where a previous stimulus occurred. At the population level, ambiguity of the adapted responses about the present stimulus can be compensated for by large numbers of neurons. Therefore, paired-pulse adaptation does not reduce the discriminability of simple stimuli. It provides information about the spatiotemporal context of stimulus history.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The present work provides a computational framework that demonstrates how adaptation allows neurons to encode spatiotemporal dynamics of stimulus history.</p>

<h3>ABSTRACT</h3>
<div class="para"><p><b>Objective</b>: To retrospectively analyze the effect of plasma exchange (PLEX, yes=PLEX+, no=PLEX-) and steroids administration timing (prophylactically –proST- or therapeutically –therST-) on the longitudinal clinical course of patients with natalizumab related progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) and full blown immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (PML-IRIS).</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Methods</b>: Clinical and radiological data of 42 Italian patients with PML were analyzed. Patient's data are available until 12 months after PML diagnosis. PLEX and steroids treatment as time-dependent covariates were entered in: i) a Cox model to investigate their impact on full blown PML-IRIS latency; ii) an ANOVA to investigate their impact on IRIS duration; iii) a linear mixed model to assess their impact on the longitudinal clinical course (measured by means of EDSS).</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Results</b>: Treatment with PLEX was not associated to PML-IRIS latency (HR=1.05, p=0.92), but once IRIS emerged, its duration was significantly longer in patients who underwent PLEX (101 vs 54 days in PLEX+ and PLEX- patients, p=0.028). Receiving proST vs therST was not associated to IRIS latency (HR=0.67, p=0.39) or duration (p=0.95). Patients who underwent proST had a significant higher EDSS increase during PML (0.09 EDSS points per month, p=0.04) as compared to those who had therST.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Interpretation</b>: this study highlights that: i) caution on the use of PLEX should be considered as the current data do not support a beneficial effect of PLEX; ii) caution on the early use of steroids is suggested since their prophylactic use to prevent full blown PML-IRIS seems to negatively impact on the longitudinal disability course.

Neuroscience as a broad and growing discipline encompasses many fields of study, from molecular to systems-level, including cognitive and theoretical domains. These are exciting times for neuroscience, when many of these traditionally separate efforts are beginning to converge, and one can envision the day we may be able to respond to some fundamental questions, such as how molecules, cells, and circuits interplay to make us feel, act, and ultimately understand who we are. I am delighted to be the new Editor-in-Chief of Neuron, whose mission is to continue to disseminate the highest quality work in neuroscience.

How nuclear architecture contributes to transcriptional regulation in neural progenitor cells (NeuPCs) is poorly understood. A study by Toda et al. (2017) now shows that the nuclear pore protein Nup153 associates with the Sox2 transcription factor in the regulation of NeuPC maintenance and neural fate.

Astrocytes are important regulators of synapse formation. Farhy-Tselnicker et al. identify the molecular pathway of active neuronal synapse formation induced by astrocyte-secreted glypican 4. These data functionally link astrocytes to signaling cascades activated in both pre- and postsynaptic neurons.

A striking observation in obsessive-compulsive disorder is that patients know that their obsessions and compulsions are excessive, but their symptoms nevertheless persist. Drawing on computational models from basic neuroscience, Vaghi and colleagues suggest a quantitative account of this clinical finding.

Kupferschmidt et al. probe real-time activity dynamics of associative and sensorimotor cortical projections to striatum during skill learning. They reveal substantive co-engagement and dissociable disengagement of the two pathways across learning and find that associative pathway disengagement predicts subsequent skill learning.

<h3>Abstract</h3>
<div class="para"><p><b>Objective</b>:To detect and quantify peripheral nerve lesions in multiple sclerosis (MS) by magnetic resonance neurography (MRN).</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Methods</b>: 36 patients diagnosed with MS based on the 2010 McDonald criteria (34 with the relapsing-remitting form, 2 with clinically isolated syndrome) with and without disease modifying treatment were compared to 35 healthy age/sex-matched volunteers. All patients underwent detailed neurological and electrophysiological examinations. 3T MRN with large anatomical coverage of both legs and the lumbosacral plexus was performed by using 2D fat-saturated, T2-weighted and dual echo turbo-spin-echo sequences as well as a 3D T2-weighted, fat-saturated SPACE sequence. Besides qualitative visual nerve assessment, a T2w-signal quantification was performed by calculation of proton-spin-density and T2-relaxation time. Nerve diameter was measured as a morphometric criterion.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Results</b>:T2w-hyperintense nerve lesions were detectable in all MS patients with a mean lesion number at thigh level of 151.5±5.7 vs. 19.1±2.4 in controls (p&lt;0.0001). Nerve proton-spin-density was higher in MS (tibial/peroneal: 371.8±7.7/368.9±8.2) vs. controls (tibial/peroneal: 266.0±11.0/276.8±9.7;p&lt;0.0001). In contrast, T2-relaxation time was significantly higher in controls (tibial/peroneal:82.0±2.1/78.3±1.7) vs. MS (tibial/peroneal:64.3±1.0/61.2±0.9; p&lt;0.0001). Proximal tibial and peroneal nerve caliber was higher in MS (tibial:52.4±2.1mm<sup>2</sup>; peroneal:25.4±1.3mm<sup>2</sup>) vs. controls (tibial:45.2±1.4mm<sup>2</sup>; p&lt;0.0015; peroneal:21.3±0.7mm<sup>2</sup>; p=0.0049).</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Interpretation</b>:Peripheral nerve lesions could be visualized and quantified in MS <em>in vivo</em> by high resolution MRN. Lesions are defined by an increase of proton-spin-density and a decrease of T2-relaxation time, indicating changes in the microstructural organization of the extracellular matrix in peripheral nerve tissue in MS. By showing involvement of the peripheral nervous system in MS, this proof-of-concept study may offer new insights into the pathophysiology and treatment of MS. This article is protected by copyright.

<p>by Jiawen Chen, Steven C. Almo, Yinghao Wu</p>

The interactions between membrane receptors and extracellular ligands control cell-cell and cell-substrate adhesion, and environmental responsiveness by representing the initial steps of cell signaling pathways. These interactions can be spatial-temporally regulated when different extracellular ligands are tethered. The detailed mechanisms of this spatial-temporal regulation, including the competition between distinct ligands with overlapping binding sites and the conformational flexibility in multi-specific ligand assemblies have not been quantitatively evaluated. We present a new coarse-grained model to realistically simulate the binding process between multi-specific ligands and membrane receptors on cell surfaces. The model simplifies each receptor and each binding site in a multi-specific ligand as a rigid body. Different numbers or types of ligands are spatially organized together in the simulation. These designs were used to test the relation between the overall binding of a multi-specific ligand and the affinity of its cognate binding site. When a variety of ligands are exposed to cells expressing different densities of surface receptors, we demonstrated that ligands with reduced affinities have higher specificity to distinguish cells based on the relative concentrations of their receptors. Finally, modification of intramolecular flexibility was shown to play a role in optimizing the binding between receptors and ligands. In summary, our studies bring new insights to the general principles of ligand-receptor interactions. Future applications of our method will pave the way for new strategies to generate next-generation biologics.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/x-8iK-8w2t8" width="1" />

<p>by Alex D. M. Dewar, Antoine Wystrach, Andrew Philippides, Paul Graham</p>

All organisms wishing to survive and reproduce must be able to respond adaptively to a complex, changing world. Yet the computational power available is constrained by biology and evolution, favouring mechanisms that are parsimonious yet robust. Here we investigate the information carried in small populations of visually responsive neurons in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>. These so-called ‘ring neurons’, projecting to the ellipsoid body of the central complex, are reported to be necessary for complex visual tasks such as pattern recognition and visual navigation. Recently the receptive fields of these neurons have been mapped, allowing us to investigate how well they can support such behaviours. For instance, in a simulation of classic pattern discrimination experiments, we show that the pattern of output from the ring neurons matches observed fly behaviour. However, performance of the neurons (as with flies) is not perfect and can be easily improved with the addition of extra neurons, suggesting the neurons’ receptive fields are not optimised for recognising abstract shapes, a conclusion which casts doubt on cognitive explanations of fly behaviour in pattern recognition assays. Using artificial neural networks, we then assess how easy it is to decode more general information about stimulus shape from the ring neuron population codes. We show that these neurons are well suited for encoding information about size, position and orientation, which are more relevant behavioural parameters for a fly than abstract pattern properties. This leads us to suggest that in order to understand the properties of neural systems, one must consider how perceptual circuits put information at the service of behaviour.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/DGYmgqBhDFo" width="1" />

<h3>Abstract</h3>
<div class="para"><p>Objective: Previous work measures spinal cord thinning in chronic progressive myelopathies, including HTLV-1 associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP) and multiple sclerosis (MS). Quantitative measurements of spinal cord atrophy are important in fully characterizing these and other spinal cord diseases. We aimed to investigate patterns of spinal cord atrophy and correlations with clinical markers.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Methods: Spinal cord cross sectional area was measured in individuals (24 healthy controls (HC), 17 asymptomatic carriers of HTLV-1 (AC), 47 HAM/TSP, 74 RRMS, 17 SPMS, and 40 PPMS) from C1 to T10. Clinical disability scores, viral markers, and immunological parameters were obtained for patients and correlated with representative spinal cord cross sectional area regions at the C2-C3, C4-C5, and T4-T9 levels. In two HAM/TSP patients, spinal cord cross sectional area was measured over three years.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Results: All spinal cord regions are thinner in HAM/TSP (56 mm<sup>2</sup> [SD 10], 59 [10], 23 [5]) than in HC (76 [7], 83 [8], 38 [4]) and AC (71 [7], 78 [9], 36 [7]). SPMS (62 [9], 66 [9], 32 [6]) and PPMS (65 [11], 68 [10], 35 [7]) have thinner cervical cords than HC and RRMS (73 [9], 77 [10], 37 [6]). Clinical disability scores (EDSS (p=0.009) and IPEC(p=0.03)) and CD8+ T cell frequency (p=0.04) correlate with T4-T9 spinal cord cross sectional area in HAM/TSP. Higher CSF HTLV-1 proviral load (p=0.01) was associated with thinner spinal cord cross sectional area. Both HAM/TSP patients followed longitudinally showed thoracic thinning followed by cervical thinning.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Interpretation: Group average spinal cord cross sectional area in HAM/TSP and progressive MS show spinal cord atrophy. We further hypothesize that is possible that neuroglial loss from a thoracic inflammatory process results in anterograde and retrograde degeneration of axons, leading to the temporal progression of thoracic to cervical atrophy described here.

<h3>Abstract</h3>
<div class="para"><p><b>Objective</b>: Cardiac diseases are established risk factors for ischemic stroke incidence and severity. Conversely, there is increasing evidence that brain ischemia can cause cardiac dysfunction. The mechanisms underlying this neurogenic heart disease are incompletely understood. While it is established that ischemic stroke is associated with cardiac arrhythmias, myocardial damage, elevated cardiac enzymes and plasma catecholamines in the acute phase, nothing is known about the delayed consequences of ischemic stroke on cardiovascular function.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Methods</b>: To determine the long-term cardiac consequences of a focal cerebral ischemia, we subjected young and aged mice to a 30-minute transient middle cerebral artery occlusion and analyzed cardiac function by serial transthoracic echocardiography and hemodynamic measurements up to week 8 after surgery. Finally, animals were treated with metoprolol to evaluate a pharmacologic treatment option to prevent the development of heart failure.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Results</b>: Focal cerebral ischemia induced a long-term cardiac dysfunction with a reduction in left ventricular ejection fraction and an increase in left ventricular volumes; this development was associated with higher peripheral sympathetic activity. Metoprolol treatment prevented the development of chronic cardiac dysfunction by decelerating extracellular cardiac remodeling and inhibiting sympathetic signaling relevant to chronic autonomic dysfunction.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Interpretation</b>: Focal cerebral ischemia in mice leads to the development of chronic systolic dysfunction driven by increased sympathetic activity. If these results can be confirmed in a clinical setting, treating physicians should be attentive to clinical signs of heart failure in every patient after ischemic stroke. Therapeutically, the successful β-blockade with metoprolol in mice could also have future clinical implications. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.</p></div>

<h3>ABSTRACT</h3>
<div class="para"><p><b>Objective</b>: Studies suggest a greater risk of Parkinson disease (PD) after traumatic brain injury (TBI), but it is possible that the risk of TBI is greater in the prodromal period of PD. We aimed to examine the time-to-TBI in PD patients in their prodromal period compared to population-based controls.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Methods</b>: We identified 89,790 incident PD cases and 118,095 comparable controls &gt; 65 years of age in 2009 using Medicare claims data. Using data from the preceding five years, we compared time-to-TBI in PD patients in their prodromal period to controls. We estimated hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for TBI in a Cox regression, while adjusting for age, sex, race/ethnicity, modified Charlson comorbidity index, smoking, and alcohol use.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Results</b>: Risk of TBI was greater in PD patients in their prodromal period across all age and sex groups, with HRs consistently increasing with proximity to PD diagnosis. HRs ranged from 1.64 (95% CI 1.52, 1.77) five years prior to diagnosis to 3.93 (95% CI 3.74, 4.13) in the year prior. The interaction between PD, TBI, and time was primarily observed for TBI attributed to falls. Motor dysfunction and cognitive impairment, suggested by corresponding ICD-9 codes, partially mediated the PD-TBI association.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Interpretation</b>: There is a strong association between PD and a recent TBI in the prodromal period of PD. This association strengthens as PD diagnosis approaches and may be a result of undetected non-motor and motor symptoms, but confirmation will be required. This article is protected by copyright.

<h3>ABSTRACT</h3>
<div class="para"><p><b>OBJECTIVE</b>: To investigate the associations between age, vascular health, and Alzheimer's disease (AD) imaging biomarkers in an elderly sample.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>METHODS</b>: We identified 430 individuals along the cognitive continuum aged&gt;60 years with amyloid-PET, Tau-PET, and MRI scans from the population-based Mayo Clinic Study of Aging. A subset of 329 individuals had FDG-PET. We ascertained presently existing cardiovascular and metabolic conditions (CMC) from healthcare records and used the summation of presence/absence of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, cardiac-arrhythmias, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus, and stroke as a surrogate for vascular health. We used global amyloid from PiB-PET, entorhinal cortex tau uptake (ERC-tau) from Tau-PET, and neurodegeneration in AD signature regions from MRI and FDG-PET as surrogates for AD pathophysiology. We dichotomized participants into CMC=0 (CMC-) vs. CMC&gt;0 (CMC+) and tested for age-adjusted group differences in AD biomarkers. Using structural equation models (SEM), we assessed the impact of vascular health on AD biomarker cascade (amyloid leads to tau leads to neurodegeneration) after considering the direct and indirect age, sex, and APOE effects.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>RESULTS</b>: CMC+ participants had significantly greater neurodegeneration than CMC- participants but did not differ by amyloid or ERC-tau. The SEM models showed that i) vascular health had a significant direct and indirect impact on neurodegeneration but not on amyloid; and ii) vascular health specifically the presence of hyperlipidemia had a significant direct impact on ERC-tau.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>INTERPRETATION</b>: Vascular health had quantifiably greater impact on neurodegeneration in AD regions than on amyloid deposition. Longitudinal studies are warranted to clarify the relationship between tau deposition and vascular health. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.</p></div>

<h3>Abstract</h3>
<div class="para"><p><em>Objective</em>: Mucopolysaccharidosis IIIA or Sanfilippo disease type A is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder presenting in early childhood, caused by an inherited deficiency of the lysosomal hydrolase sulfamidase. New missense mutations, for which genotype-phenotype correlations are currently unknown, are frequently reported, hampering early prediction of phenotypic severity and efficacy assessment of new disease-modifying treatments. We aimed to design a method to determine phenotypic severity early in the disease course. <em>Methods</em>: Fifty-three patients were included of whom skin fibroblasts and data on disease course and mutation analysis were available. Patients were phenotypically characterized on clinical data as ‘rapidly progressing' or ‘slowly progressing'. Sulfamidase activity was measured in fibroblasts cultured at 37°C and at 30°C. <em>Results</em>: Sulfamidase activity in fibroblasts from patients homozygous or compound heterozygous for a combination of known severe mutations remained below the limit of quantification under both culture conditions. In contrast, sulfamidase activity in fibroblasts from patients homozygous or compound heterozygous for a known mild mutation increased above the limit of quantification when cultured at 30°C. With division on the basis of the patients phenotype, fibroblasts from ‘slowly progressing' patients could be separated from ‘rapid progressing' patients by increase in sulfamidase activity when cultured at 30°C (p&lt;0.001, sensitivity 96%, specificity 93%). <em>Interpretation</em>: Phenotypic severity strongly correlates with the potential to increase sulfamidase activity in fibroblasts cultured at 30°C, allowing reliable distinction between patients with ‘rapidly progressing' or ‘slowly progressing' phenotypes. This method may provide an essential tool for assessment of treatment effects and for healthcare and life planning decisions. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.</p></div>

                <h4><a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25047">Bicycling suppresses abnormal beta synchrony in the Parkinsonian basal ganglia</a></h4>

<div class="section" id="ana25047-sec-0001"><h4>Objective</h4><div class="para"><p>Freezing of gait is a poorly understood symptom of Parkinson disease, and can severely disrupt the locomotion of affected patients. However, bicycling ability remains surprisingly unaffected in most patients suffering from freezing, suggesting functional differences in the motor network. The purpose of this study was to characterize and contrast the oscillatory dynamics underlying bicycling and walking in the basal ganglia.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" id="ana25047-sec-0002"><h4>Methods</h4><div class="para"><p>We present the first local field potential recordings directly comparing bicycling and walking in Parkinson disease patients with electrodes implanted in the subthalamic nuclei for deep brain stimulation. Low (13–22Hz) and high (23–35Hz) beta power changes were analyzed in 22 subthalamic nuclei from 13 Parkinson disease patients (57.5 ± 5.9 years old, 4 female). The study group consisted of 5 patients with and 8 patients without freezing of gait.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" id="ana25047-sec-0003"><h4>Results</h4><div class="para"><p>In patients without freezing of gait, both bicycling and walking led to a suppression of subthalamic beta power (13–35Hz), and this suppression was stronger for bicycling. Freezers showed a similar pattern in general. Superimposed on this pattern, however, we observed a movement-induced, narrowband power increase around 18Hz, which was evident even in the absence of freezing.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" id="ana25047-sec-0004"><h4>Interpretation</h4><div class="para"><p>These results indicate that bicycling facilitates overall suppression of beta power. Furthermore, movement leads to exaggerated synchronization in the low beta band specifically within the basal ganglia of patients susceptible to freezing. Abnormal ∼18Hz oscillations are implicated in the pathophysiology of freezing of gait, and suppressing them may form a key strategy in developing potential therapies. Ann Neurol 2017</p></div></div>

<p>by Peter Ashcroft, Markus G. Manz, Sebastian Bonhoeffer</p>

Hematopoietic stem cells in mammals are known to reside mostly in the bone marrow, but also transitively passage in small numbers in the blood. Experimental findings have suggested that they exist in a dynamic equilibrium, continuously migrating between these two compartments. Here we construct an individual-based mathematical model of this process, which is parametrised using existing empirical findings from mice. This approach allows us to quantify the amount of migration between the bone marrow niches and the peripheral blood. We use this model to investigate clonal hematopoiesis, which is a significant risk factor for hematologic cancers. We also analyse the engraftment of donor stem cells into non-conditioned and conditioned hosts, quantifying the impact of different treatment scenarios. The simplicity of the model permits a thorough mathematical analysis, providing deeper insights into the dynamics of both the model and of the real-world system. We predict the time taken for mutant clones to expand within a host, as well as chimerism levels that can be expected following transplantation therapy, and the probability that a preconditioned host is reconstituted by donor cells.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/rXyJusEBHNY" width="1" />

<p>by Thomas G. Fai, Alejandra Leo-Macias, David L. Stokes, Charles S. Peskin</p>

We simulate deformable red blood cells in the microcirculation using the immersed boundary method with a cytoskeletal model that incorporates structural details revealed by tomographic images. The elasticity of red blood cells is known to be supplied by both their lipid bilayer membranes, which resist bending and local changes in area, and their cytoskeletons, which resist in-plane shear. The cytoskeleton consists of spectrin tetramers that are tethered to the lipid bilayer by ankyrin and by actin-based junctional complexes. We model the cytoskeleton as a random geometric graph, with nodes corresponding to junctional complexes and with edges corresponding to spectrin tetramers such that the edge lengths are given by the end-to-end distances between nodes. The statistical properties of this graph are based on distributions gathered from three-dimensional tomographic images of the cytoskeleton by a segmentation algorithm. We show that the elastic response of our model cytoskeleton, in which the spectrin polymers are treated as entropic springs, is in good agreement with the experimentally measured shear modulus. By simulating red blood cells in flow with the immersed boundary method, we compare this discrete cytoskeletal model to an existing continuum model and predict the extent to which dynamic spectrin network connectivity can protect against failure in the case of a red cell subjected to an applied strain. The methods presented here could form the basis of disease- and patient-specific computational studies of hereditary diseases affecting the red cell cytoskeleton.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/0HEAkCv60RE" width="1" />

<p>by Emre Akbas, Miguel P. Eckstein</p>

Humans and many other species sense visual information with varying spatial resolution across the visual field (foveated vision) and deploy eye movements to actively sample regions of interests in scenes. The advantage of such varying resolution architecture is a reduced computational, hence metabolic cost. But what are the performance costs of such processing strategy relative to a scheme that processes the visual field at high spatial resolution? Here we first focus on visual search and combine object detectors from computer vision with a recent model of peripheral pooling regions found at the V1 layer of the human visual system. We develop a foveated object detector that processes the entire scene with varying resolution, uses retino-specific object detection classifiers to guide eye movements, aligns its fovea with regions of interest in the input image and integrates observations across multiple fixations. We compared the foveated object detector against a non-foveated version of the same object detector which processes the entire image at with homogeneous high spatial resolution. We evaluated the accuracy of the foveated and non-foveated object detectors identifying 20 different objects classes in scenes from a standard computer vision data set (the PASCAL VOC 2007 dataset). We show that the foveated object detector can approximate the performance of the object detector with homogeneous high spatial resolution processing while bringing significant computational cost savings. Additionally, we assessed the impact of foveation on the computation of bottom-up saliency. An implementation of a simple foveated bottom-up saliency model with eye movements showed agreement in the selection of top salient regions of scenes with those selected by a non-foveated high resolution saliency model. Together, our results might help explain the evolution of foveated visual systems with eye movements as a solution that preserves perceptual performance in visual search while resulting in computational and metabolic savings to the brain.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/aI5auQXLGpk" width="1" />

A dramatic maturational process ongoing in adolescence is prefrontal cortex development, including its dopamine innervation. Dopamine axons grow from the striatum to the prefrontal cortex, the only known case of long-distance axon growth during adolescence. This is coordinated by the Netrin-1 guidance cue receptor DCC (deleted in colorectal cancer), which in turn controls the intrinsic development of the prefrontal cortex itself. Stimulant drugs in adolescence alter DCC in dopamine neurons and, in turn prefrontal cortex maturation, impacting cognitive abilities.

The hippocampus community, and the wider groups of neuroscientists studying learning and memory, were shocked to learn of the sudden and unexpected death of Dr Howard Eichenbaum on 21 July 2017. An immensely respected and well-liked figure, Howard made major contributions to our understanding of the neurobiology of memory at a systems level. In addition to his scientific contributions, he was also a diligent member and steward of the neuroscience community as Editor of the journal Hippocampus and in many other ways.

Inhibitory interneurons comprise a diverse subpopulation of cells that are critical to circuit function. How distinct inhibitory microcircuits control long-range projections remains poorly understood. A recent study by Lu and colleagues uncovered a unidirectional microcircuit of prefrontal chandelier cells that preferentially innervate and suppress long-range amygdala-projecting pyramidal cells.

Self representation is fundamental to mental functions. While the self has mostly been studied in traditional psychophilosophical terms (‘self as subject’), recent laboratory work suggests that the self can be measured quantitatively by assessing biases towards self-associated stimuli (‘self as object’). Here, we summarize new quantitative paradigms for assessing the self, drawn from psychology, neuroeconomics, embodied cognition, and social neuroscience. We then propose a neural model of the self as an emerging property of interactions between a core ‘self network’ (e.g., medial prefrontal cortex; mPFC), a cognitive control network [e.g., dorsolateral (dl)PFC], and a salience network (e.g., insula).

While clues have existed that endosomal trafficking is associated with Alzheimer’s disease (AD), whether it plays a central role in the disease and if so how has remained unknown. Here we rely on recent genetic and cellular findings to construct a model proposing that traffic jams in the early endosome can act as an upstream pathogenic hub in AD. We also rely on an independent series of findings to suggest how the traffic jams can act as a unified mediator of downstream pathophysiology. The model predicts, therefore, that interventions designed to unjam the endosome carry high therapeutic promise.

Over the past few years our understanding of estrogen signaling in the brain has expanded rapidly. Estrogens are synthesized in the periphery and in the brain, acting on multiple receptors to regulate gene transcription, neural function, and behavior. Various estrogen-sensitive signaling pathways often operate in concert within the same cell, increasing the complexity of the system. In females, estrogen concentrations fluctuate over the estrous/menstrual cycle, dynamically modulating estrogen receptor (ER) expression, activity, and trafficking.
