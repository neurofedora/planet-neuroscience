">Aging is associated with uniform structural decline across cerebellar regions while preserving topological organization and showing no relation with sensorimotor function</a></h4>

              
                Aging affects cerebellar structure, yet the regional specificity of this decline and its relationship to sensorimotor function remain unclear. In this study, we quantified age-related gray matter differences in 50 young and 80 older adults using both anatomically defined cerebellar lobular parcellations and a function-based cerebellar atlas. Across both anatomical and functional parcellations, older adults showed robust reductions in gray matter volume relative to young adults. However, contrary to prior reports of region-specific vulnerability, age effects did not differ significantly across regions: both datasets demonstrated remarkably uniform gray matter decline. Structural covariance analyses revealed that correlations between cerebellar regions were determined primarily by spatial proximity and, to a lesser extent, by medial-lateral (vermis-hemisphere) organization or functional similarity. Importantly, the topological organization of the cerebellum remained stable across age groups, indicating preserved structural coordination despite widespread gray matter loss. Finally, despite substantial interindividual variability in behavioral, regional cerebellar gray matter volumes, whether anatomically or functionally defined, did not predict inter-individual variability for any of our eight cerebellum-dependent outcomes. This absence of structure-function relationships suggests that behavioral performance is maintained through compensatory mechanisms or microstructural features not captured by regional gray matter volume. Together, the results demonstrate uniform age-related cerebellar degeneration alongside preserved topological organization and no measurable impact on cerebellar sensorimotor function, supporting the notion of a robust cerebellar reserve throughout healthy aging.

">Alpha oscillations track the projection of reactivated memories into conscious awareness</a></h4>

              
                By definition, episodic memory is a conscious phenomenon. Memory traces reactivated by the hippocampus and reinstated in the sensory cortices need to enter conscious awareness for them to be re-experienced and overtly recalled. However, it remains unclear whether such reactivation in-and-of-itself ensures that memories will be overtly recalled. To investigate this, magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings were analysed from thirty-one participants (18 female, 13 male) completing a video-word pair associates memory task. When combining linear classifiers and spectral analyses, sensory cortical reactivation could be observed without overt recall occurring, suggesting reactivation does not guarantee overt recall. Instead, overt recall was additively predicted by (i) an increase in reactivated representations rhythmically fluctuating within the alpha band, and (ii) a decrease in total sensory neocortical alpha power. These results are consistent with accounts which propose that reactivation benefits from desynchronising the network to provide representational space for stimulus-specific information, and/or amplifying stimulus-specific information above residual noise. Altogether, these results suggest that representational reactivation can occur without overt recall, and suggest a role for alpha oscillations in projecting internally-generated representations into conscious awareness.

                This study aims to examine how psychological, cognitive, and contextual factors are associated with entrepreneurial intention and entrepreneurial action distinguishing between discovery and exploitation phases among university students in five Latin American countries. Using a cross-national design, the analysis combines non-parametric statistical techniques, correlation and regression models, and visual analytics through raincloud plots. Although numerous emotional, cognitive, and contextual profile variables were measured, this report focuses on those that showed significant cross-country differences or emerged as relevant predictors of entrepreneurial intention and action. Entrepreneurial attitude, self-efficacy, entrepreneurial action in the discovery phase, university training, and empathy were identified as significant predictors of entrepreneurial intention. Self-awareness, self-efficacy, and entrepreneurial attitude explained the discovery phase, whereas financial knowledge, emotional well-being, flow at work, self-efficacy, and low cognitive load were determinants of the exploitation phase. The findings highlight the importance of adaptive entrepreneurship curricula that integrate emotional competencies, stage-specific training pathways, and institutional support strategies.

                The emergence of COVID-19 vaccines has reshaped the trajectory of the ongoing pandemic, offering hope for widespread immunity. Beyond conferring protection against SARS-CoV-2, these vaccines have exhibited intriguing immunomodulatory effects. This research explores the dynamic interplay among VDR mRNA expression levels, calcium (ionized and total), and intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) concentrations in individuals post-COVID-19 vaccination. The Vitamin D Receptor (VDR) plays a pivotal role in immune regulation and is closely intertwined with calcium homeostasis. This study investigates the hypothesis that COVID-19 vaccination may induce alterations in VDR mRNA expression, subsequently influencing calcium metabolism and iPTH secretion. Our findings reveal dynamic shifts in VDR mRNA expression following COVID-19 vaccination, with distinct patterns observed across individuals. Concurrently, we observe ionized and total calcium levels alterations, hinting at potential links between VDR activity and calcium metabolism post-vaccination. Furthermore, iPTH levels exhibit intriguing fluctuations, suggesting a regulatory role of VDR in parathyroid hormone secretion. The integration of clinical outcomes and vaccine response data sheds light on the significance of these molecular and biochemical alterations. This research underscores the multifaceted impact of COVID-19 vaccination on VDR mRNA expression, calcium homeostasis, and iPTH regulation. Beyond the scope of vaccination, our findings may bear implications for immunomodulation in various disease contexts, particularly in individuals with pre-existing calcium-related disorders. In conclusion, our study unveils the intricate relationships among VDR mRNA expression, calcium levels, and iPTH concentrations in the context of post-COVID-19 vaccination. These discoveries extend our understanding of vaccine-induced immunomodulation and may pave the way for personalized vaccination strategies, while also opening new avenues for investigating the role of VDR in immune responses and calcium regulation beyond the pandemic.

                Background The rising consumption of ultra-processed foods (UPFs) is a global concern, given their poor nutritional quality and the presence of multiple additives that may pose health risks when consumed in excess. Young populations are particularly vulnerable due to lifestyle habits and the widespread availability and accessibility of these products. The present study aimed to assess the consumption of ultra-processed foods (UPFs), taking into account the co-occurrence of additives and their association with risk factors in a young population. Methods A two-phase cross-sectional study was conducted. In the first phase, 500 ultra-processed food products available on the Peruvian market were analysed and classified into five groups: meat products, cereals, confectionery, dairy, and beverages, in order to identify the presence and frequency of additives. In the second phase, a structured survey was administered to 385 students, collecting data on UPF consumption over the previous 24 hours, along with variables related to lifestyle. Chi-square tests and ordinal logistic regression were used to analyse the associations. Results The categories with the highest levels of consumption were carbonated beverages (59.6%), meat products (54.7%), and dairy in various forms (66.3%). A high frequency of co-occurrence was identified between colourings and acidulants, particularly INS 133, INS 150d, and INS 339i. Statistical analysis revealed a significant association between UPF consumption and male sex (OR = 1.603), as well as alcohol consumption (OR = 2.059), while age showed an inverse relationship (OR = 0.756). Other variables, such as physical activity and smoking, did not demonstrate a significant association. Conclusion It is concluded that excessive UPF consumption varies according to age and sex and represents a continuous source of exposure to food additives. In addition, a statistically significant association was observed between UPF consumption and alcohol consumption, which may indicate a relationship of relevance from a public health perspective; however, a causal relationship cannot be established.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-922/v2?src=rss">Design and Evaluation of Sustainable Structural Lightweight Concrete Using Recycled Pet as Aggregates [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background The accumulation of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic waste poses environmental and sustainability challenges due to its non-biodegradable nature and limited disposal options. Repurposing PET as aggregates in structural lightweight concrete (SLWC) offers a dual benefit of waste valorisation and conservation of natural resources, while supporting circular economy objectives. Methods Eight experimental mix proportions of SLWC were developed using a factorial design approach, with water–to–cement ratios ranging from 0.40 to 0.45. PET aggregates were produced via thermal–mechanical processing and subjected to calcium hypochlorite treatment to improve surface bonding with cement paste. Standard tests were conducted to determine workability (Vebe time), fresh and dry densities, compressive strength, splitting tensile strength, and water absorption. Structural efficiency was also computed as a strength-to-weight performance indicator. Results The fresh and dry densities of the PET-based SLWC ranged from 1455–1515 kg/m3 and 1490–1537 kg/m3, respectively, corresponding to category D1.6 lightweight concrete. Compressive strengths ranged between 14.1 and 16.5 MPa, fulfilling the LC13 classification for structural applications. Splitting tensile strengths were between 0.84 and 1.4 MPa, with several mixes achieving minimum thresholds for structural performance. Water absorption values ranged from 4.66% to 10.16%, remaining within international standards for lightweight concrete durability. Workability was low (Vebe times 13–40 s), attributed to the angular and hydrophobic properties of PET aggregates. Structural efficiency values of 9.5–10.9 kPa·m3/kg exceeded minimum international requirements. Conclusions This study confirms that PET aggregates can be successfully utilised to produce structurally viable and durable lightweight concrete. Although workability is reduced, the compressive strength, tensile strength, density, and durability criteria align with international standards. These results demonstrate a sustainable strategy for PET waste valorisation in construction, contributing to resource conservation, reduced environmental burden, and advancement of circular economy goals.

                Background Comparing non-randomized groups, such as COVID-19 vaccinated and unvaccinated, even in the presence of seemingly relevant control variables, is challenging, but in this study, using English data, I show an achievable approach. Methods First, I estimated age-standardized all-cause mortality among vaccinated and unvaccinated ten years and older, covering 26 months from Apr 21 to May 23. Then, I estimated mortality not involving COVID-19, and finally, I contrasted the calculations. Results First, I found that all-cause mortality among unvaccinated was higher than among vaccinated. But, as the pattern was similar concerning mortality not involving COVID-19, the discrepancy can be attributed mainly to unvaccinated having inferior health at the outset. There were nonetheless indications of significant protection for vaccinated between July 21 and Jan 22. In the absence of control variables as a means to compare non-randomized groups, I reached that conclusion by contrasting all-cause mortality with mortality not involving COVID-19. However, while mortality not involving COVID-19 decreased among unvaccinated compared to the first observation month, it remained high among vaccinated, indicating a relative increase. Conclusions An interpretation is that vaccination, despite a potential temporary protection, has increased mortality. Strengthening the interpretation was relatively high mortality among vaccinated not involving COVID-19 counterintuitively following periods of excess mortality. Further strengthening the interpretation was the relatively high mortality not involving COVID-19 among vaccinated, corresponding with excess mortality during much of the same period. Future research should include data over a longer period than those available for this study. Also, future research should examine different age groups, vaccination types, and the number of doses given.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-50/v2?src=rss">THE PROTECTIVE EFFECT OF APOCYNIN ON A SELENITE-INDUCED CATARACT MODEL [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Introductıon The aim of this study was to investigate the protective effects of apocynin in a selenite-induced cataract model, and to evaluate its impact on cataract severity and antioxidant enzyme activities. Given the limited availability of pharmacological strategies to delay cataract progression, the identification of agents that modulate oxidative stress may provide translational insight for the development of future non-surgical approaches. Methods In this randomized experimental study, thirty-five rats were randomly separated into five groups (n = 7 per group). The control group received only saline. Groups 1, 2, 3, and 4 were administered sodium selenite at a dose of 30 nmol/g. In addition, Group 2 received dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), Group 3 received 10 mg/kg apocynin, and Group 4 received 20 mg/kg apocynin. The apocynin treatment was administered intraperitoneally for 7 consecutive days. Cataract severity was defined as the primary outcome, while antioxidant enzyme activities and oxidative stress markers were evaluated as secondary outcomes. Results Low-dose apocynin was seen to enhance antioxidant defence by increasing catalase (CAT) and glutathione reductase (GR) levels (p = 0.003, p = 0.002) without altering malondialdehyde (MDA) levels (p = 0.04). High-dose apocynin (20 mg/kg) led to an increase in MDA, suggesting a possible dose-related pro-oxidant effect. Conclusion This study suggests that apocynin, particularly at a low dose (10 mg/kg), may prevent selenite-induced cataract formation. Low-dose apocynin effectively delayed cataract progression by enhancing antioxidant defence and limiting oxidative stress. In contrast, high-dose exposure revealed a possible pro-oxidant effect, highlighting the need for careful dose optimization.

                Background After witnessing the implementations of Banach fixed point theory which is stated that a mapping T: X→X has always a unique fixed point in X in giving the existence and uniqueness solutions for many integral and differential equations, various extensions of Banach fixed point theory were established. Consequently, the theory has evolved to encompass diverse extensions and is fruitful in many fields. One of the most significant advances in pure and applied mathematics is the discovery of solutions for linear and nonlinear systems as well fractal graphics, optimization theory, approximation theory, discrete dynamics, and numerous other areas. Our main outcomes in this manuscript represent one of the most important of these extensions. Methods and Results Vital concepts are needed in the sequels which are playing a major role in verifying our major outcomes have been presented. Throughout this manuscript, ( X , ≼ ) indicates to a partially ordered set with the partially ordered ≼ . In this study, our main objective is to investigate and verify various new enhanced results of coupled fixed point theorems for continuous maps having the property of mixed monotone under the influence of extended contraction circumstances in the context of partially ordered D ∗ -complete metric spaces. Numerous characterizations of these types of coupled fixed point theorems have been verified. Additionally, an appropriate example that supports the major outcomes was prepared. Conclusions Our main results in this manuscript have been explored novel various outcomes related to the uniqueness of various coupled fixed point theorems for continuous maps having the property of mixed monotone under the influence of extended contraction circumstances in the context of partially ordered D ∗ -complete metric spaces. We predict that the discoveries in this study will aid scientists in enhancing the research on popularized partially ordered metric spaces to elevate a universal framework for their practical implementations.

                Background The derivation of novel biomarkers from biomedical data to accurately predict individual patient’s responses, would be an advance. We hypothesized that quantitative AI designed to analyze complex data, based on evolutionary computation, could identify algorithmic biomarkers from baseline data in a clinical trial, predictive of individual therapeutic responses. Methods A previously published randomized placebo controlled clinical trial in which patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) naive to anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) therapy, were randomized to receive infliximab or placebo was analyzed. Baseline peripheral blood gene expression data, plus the treatment variable, infliximab or placebo, yielding 52,379 variables were available for 59 patients. The variable for analysis was a decrease in Disease Activity Score-28 (DSA28) score of 1.2. At 14 weeks, 20 of the 30 patients receiving infliximab had responded, and ten of the 29 patients receiving placebo had responded. Findings The AI derived a discovery algorithm, with 4 gene expression variables plus treatment assignment, that predicted responders versus non-responders for all 59 patients, with 100% accuracy. We present the discovery algorithm to enable transparent verification. Excluding the 4 gene expression variables, we then derived similarly accurate predictive algorithms with 4 other gene expression variables. We tested the hypothesis that the software could derive algorithms as predictors of treatment response applying just these 8 discovery gene expression variables to 6 previously published independent datasets. In each validation analysis, the accuracy of the algorithmic predictors surpassed those benchmarks previously reported, using a variety of analytic approaches. Conclusions AI based on evolutionary computation summarized a clinical trial, with transparent biomarker algorithms derived from baseline data, correctly predicting the outcome for all patients. The biomarker variables, validated in 6 independent cohorts, are now in development as a clinical test. This approach may expedite the discovery of companion diagnostics.

                Abstract* Background The purpose of this research is to compare regulations related to cyberbullying in Indonesia, South Korea, and Japan, and to explore digital citizenship as a long-term preventive measure. The phenomenon of cyberbullying is increasing in these three countries, becoming a serious challenge in the context of mental health and the protection of citizens in the digital age. Methods This research employs a methodological approach that combines juridical normative analysis with analytical and comparative research. It analyzes the laws of each country, starting from the Electronic Information and Transactions Law (ITE Law) in Indonesia, the Network Act in South Korea, and the Japanese Penal Code. Results The results of the study show that South Korea has the most comprehensive regulatory framework, encompassing both penal and non-penal approaches. At the same time, Japan excels in enforcing flexibility and protecting victims, even though it does not yet have a special constitution. On the other hand, Indonesia still faces weaknesses in its legal framework, as there is no explicit definition, and reactive approaches are still emerging. Conclusions Research highlights the importance of adaptive legal reform in dynamic technological environments and recommends integrating digital citizenship into national curricula to prevent cyberbullying. Implementing the nine elements of digital citizenship, according to Ribble, involves being a framework-relevant work in the form of ethical and responsible digital citizens who are aware of the law.

                Background The Transportation Problem (TP) is a detailed model in operations study with applications in logistics, supply chain management, and resource allocation. The classical IBFS methods including North-West Corner, Least Cost and Vogel’s Approximation have competitive computational efficiency, but they are very sensitive to the structure of the problem and usually lead to a solution that is far from the global optimum. Classic enhancement strategies like the Generalized Distribution (MODI) and Stepping-Stone (SS) approaches have low computational complexity but may fall into a local optimum quickly, which makes them ineffective in large-scale or unbalanced problems. Methods We propose the first generic hybrid algorithm, called Ester Hybrid Improvement for Transportation Problem (EHITP), which was developed with the aim of mitigating the shortcomings of traditional IBFS-based methods. To overcome the local minima problem, the proposed EHITP framework combines adaptive perturbation procedures and guided neighborhood search methodologies to broaden the solution space. Results Initial experiments on benchmark and synthetically created datasets show that EHITP obtains a much less total transportation cost relative to the classical IBFS and improved MODI/SS methods. These features lead to a more robust method, stable solutions over iterations, and convergence across a wider range of problem sizes and structures. Conclusions The findings show EHITP serves as a more reliable, scalable, and expense-effective solution to transportation issues. The balance this algorithm achieves between the quality of the solution it produces, and its computational efficiency makes it a potential candidate for real life applications in topics such as distribution chain and economic resource allocation.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-262/v1?src=rss">Improving the characteristics of mozzarella cheese manufactured in an unconventional way and fortified with nanosalt and studying the effect of freezing on it [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Mozzarella cheese is a soft, moisture-rich cheese that is highly sensitive to storage conditions, impacting its physical and chemical properties. By salting mozzarella cheese with nanosalt and comparing it to chilling and freezing, this study aimed to improve its physicochemical and sensory properties. Methods By milling, nanosodium chloride was created. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to analyze shape and structure. Citric acid was added to samples of mozzarella cheese made from cow’s milk. A cooled control (T1), a frozen sample (T2), with 0.5% nanosalt added (T3), 1% nanosalt added (T4), and 1.5% nanosalt added (T5) comprised the five groups of samples. Changes in moisture, protein and fat contents, pH, acidity, ash content, and sensory assessment were all measured in the samples. Results From electron microscopy show the presence of sodium chloride, with tiny nanoparticles exhibiting irregular and sometimes cubic shapes. The samples ranged in dimensions from 36.99 nm to 70.59 nm. Chemical tests on mozzarella cheese stored under various conditions showed significant differences (p≤0.05) in moisture content (52.74% vs. 49.91%) and ash content (2.99% vs. 3.89%). The protein content varied between 25.00% and 25.90% across treatments, remaining unchanged. Fat percentage, pH and acidity measurements showed no significant differences between the treatments. Sensory analysis of the mozzarella cheese samples that were preserved using various techniques revealed that the samples’ sensory qualities were maintained within reasonable bounds for the duration of storage. No differences in appearance, opening, or color were found, confirming these traits are stable. Significant differences (p≤0.05) in taste, texture, and flavour were found, with the largest in T3–T5 where nanosalt was added, showing its positive impact on sensory quality versus cooling and freezing alone. The weight reduction effects for mozzarella cheese varied significantly (p≤0.05) between the treatments (T1-T5) after 21 days, with values ranging from 26.95 to 92.50. Treatment T5 produced the least amount of weight loss when compared to the other treatments. Conclusion Adding nanosalt to mozzarella cheese formulations enhances quality, shelf life, and resistance to freezing flaws, while maintaining sensory and textural qualities and offering a valuable alternative for traditional preservation methods.

                This paper presents a systematic investigation of a newly defined comprehensive subclass of analytic and univalent functions in the open unit disk. The introduced function class constitutes a broad generalization that incorporates several significant families, particularly Yamaguchi functions and starlike functions, which themselves exhibit fundamental properties within the established Bazilevič function hierarchy. The formal construction of this class employs the Ma-Minda framework through the application of subordination principles, set-theoretic operations, and analytical formulations involving infinite series and product combinations of specific geometric expressions. The principal contributions of this work include the derivation of sharp coefficient bounds, complete solutions for the Fekete-Szegö problem with parameters, and precise estimates for Hankel determinants containing a real parameter. The proposed class demonstrates remarkable generality, as it systematically reduces to numerous well-established function classes when its parameters are specialized to particular values within their defined domains, thereby providing a unified approach to studying these classical families.

                Background Bootstrap resampling is used throughout biology to perform critical statistical tasks, including estimating confidence intervals as part of statistical inference and learning. A key assumption of bootstrap resampling is that data are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.), but this assumption is at odds with the inherently sequential nature of biomolecular sequences. To relax this simplifying assumption, RAWR (“RAndom Walk Resampling”) was introduced as a technique for sequence-aware statistical resampling. RAWR has been applied to several different biomolecular sequence analysis tasks to date, including phylo- genetic tree support estimation. In each of these tasks, RAWR produces comparable or superior results to the bootstrap method and state-of-the-art resampling methods. Methods and Results A comprehensive software suite for RAWR resampling of unaligned biomolecular sequence data has been developed. Version 1.0 of the distribution focuses on two essential applications in computational biology and bioinformatics: (1) phylogenetic support estimation and (2) estimating confidence intervals on multiple sequence alignments (MSAs). The software implementation includes a local Galaxy client, a desktop PC client with a graphical user interface (GUI), and a standalone web server application. Access to software library functionality is provided via a developer-friendly application programming interface (API). User and developer documentation and tutorials are also provided. Availability and Implementation The software suite, documentation, and tutorials are publicly available under an open-source copyleft license at https://github.com/kjl-msu/RAWR-web-software. The software and API are implemented in Python for use on macOS, Linux, and Windows operating systems.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-259/v1?src=rss">The Role of Website Quality on the Enhancement of E-Loyalty: The Moderating Role of Customer Knowledge Management [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Abstract: Considering the accelerating digital transformation, organizations are increasingly relying on digital technologies to enhance customer experience, boost satisfaction and loyalty, and build a positive brand image. Websites are among the most important digital interaction channels influencing customer behavior, particularly in the banking sector. This study aimed to analyze the relationship between website quality and Electronic loyalty (EL), while also examining the mediating role of customer knowledge management (CKM). Despite the increasing number of studies examining website quality and its role in enhancing customer satisfaction and loyalty, most of these studies have focused on the direct relationship between website quality and EL, neglecting the explanatory role of mediating variables, particularly customer knowledge management. Furthermore, previous literature has rarely addressed this topic within the context of banking institutions in developing countries, and more specifically within the Iraqi environment, which is characterized by distinct regulatory and technological features. Therefore, this study aims to bridge this gap by analyzing the relationship between website quality and EL, while also examining the mediating role of CKM in the Iraqi banking sector. To achieve this objective, a descriptive-analytical approach was adopted, and the study was applied to Al-Rafidain Bank in Nineveh Governorate, Iraq. Data was collected using a standardized questionnaire and analyzed using structural equation modeling with partial least squares (PLS-SEM). The analysis revealed significant correlations and influences between website quality and EL. The results also indicated that CKM plays a mediating role in strengthening this relationship, highlighting its importance in explaining online customer behavior. The study concludes that improving website quality, along with adopting effective CKM practices, contributes to enhancing EL in the banking sector. The findings also provide theoretical and practical insights that can support decision-makers in developing more effective digital strategies.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-229/v2?src=rss">Exploring antecedents of built environment for walkability of older adults: A systematic literature review [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                As the global population ages, creating supportive environments for walking is a priority for public health and urban planning. While empirical studies are numerous, there is a lack of synthesized knowledge regarding the underlying theoretical constructs used to understand these environments. This systematic literature review examines the theoretical frameworks and conceptual models that define the relationship between the built environment and walking behaviors of older adults. Specifically, it explores the antecedents within these models that influence walkability. Following PRISMA guidelines, a systematic search was conducted focusing on publications that present or utilize theoretical frameworks for older adult walkability. Papers were analyzed based on their research focus categorized into model development, testing, advancement, or integration and their contribution type to the field. The review identifies a range of theoretical approaches, examining dominant theoretical frameworks within the Built Environment for Walkability (BEW) and its social and policy extensions. Findings suggest that while many models are described as “holistic,” they vary significantly in how they weigh individual, social, and environmental factors. The analysis highlights a shift toward model integration as a means to address the multi-dimensional nature of aged-friendly environments. By focusing on theoretical antecedents rather than purely empirical outcomes, this review provides a roadmap for future research to refine existing models. It emphasizes the need for a more consistent definition of the socio-built environment to better support the mobility of older populations.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-258/v1?src=rss">Insomnia, a sequel of stress among medical students in Iraq [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background insomnia is common at any age; however, it is more prevalent among medical students due to the competitive environment they live. Stress is thought to be a primary contributor in the development of insomnia due to its two-way relationship with the disorder. The objective of this study is to assess sleep quality among medical students and explore the relation between insomnia and the level of stress they experience. Methods This cross-sectional study was conducted among medical students from Anbar and Fallujah universities in Anbar province/Iraq. All students who agreed to participate were included in the study. The presence of insomnia was evaluated according to the Athens insomnia scale (AIS-8). The level of stress was measured according to the perceived stress scale (PSS-10). Results The total number of participants was 452, 72.8% of whom reported insomnia. Low-stress level was experienced by 8.4%, moderate stress by 60.0%, and high perceived stress by 31.6% of the respondents. Level of stress was significantly associated with gender (p< 0.001), with prevalence of insomnia among females (42.5%) been higher than that among males (30.3%). Logistic regression model revealed that students with high perceived stress had OR of 3.188 for insomnia compared to those with low level of stress (C.I. 2.1-4.8, P<0.001). Conclusion Prevalence of insomnia among medical students is high, statistically attributed to stress. The findings of the study encourage adopting certain programs to enhance awareness of medical students about this problem.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-1001/v2?src=rss">The Use of Clear Aligner Therapy for Orthognathic Surgery Patients: A Cross-Sectional Survey Among Saudi Orthodontists and Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background Orthognathic surgery corrects severe skeletal discrepancies that cannot be addressed by orthodontics alone. With advancements in digital workflows and CAD/CAM technologies, clear aligner therapy (CAT) has emerged as a potential adjunct in surgical cases. However, its clinical application remains under-researched. This study aimed to assess the knowledge, experience, and attitudes of orthodontists and oral and maxillofacial surgeons in Saudi Arabia regarding CAT in orthognathic surgery patients. Methods A cross-sectional survey was conducted from April 1 to May 31, 2023, using a closed-ended online questionnaire distributed to specialists across Saudi Arabia. The survey gathered demographic and clinical data. Statistical analysis included descriptive methods, chi-square testing (p < 0.05), and univariate regression to identify demographic predictors of CAT use. Results Out of 278 expected responses, 46 (16.5%) were received. Most participants were aged 31–40 years (p < 0.05) and had 6–10 years of experience (p = 0.03). Orthodontists accounted for 65.2% of the respondents, with oral and maxillofacial surgeons at 34.8% (p = 0.03). While most treated 1–4 orthognathic patients monthly, 80% had no experience using CAT in these cases. Although general CAT usage was significant (p < 0.05), its clinical application in orthognathic surgery was minimal. Challenges included pre-surgical alignment, intraoperative fixation, and post-operative occlusion control. Regression analysis showed that age was significantly associated with CAT use (p < 0.05; R2 = 0.38), while gender and experience were not. Conclusion The study indicates limited clinical experience with CAT in orthognathic surgery in Saudi Arabia. Age may influence CAT adoption, but further studies with larger sample sizes are needed to validate these findings and inform future integration of aligner protocols in surgical orthodontics.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-257/v1?src=rss">Integrative Healthcare for Optimal Health [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Conventional medicine and public health have collectively improved health and saved the lives of millions. Yet, as we confront the escalating crisis of non-communicable diseases (NCDs), it becomes increasingly clear that conventional approaches alone are no longer sufficient. A new, evidence-based paradigm shift is necessary. Integrative health, which combines conventional medicine with complementary and lifestyle medicine, offers that shift. To assess its effectiveness, we identified and reviewed 14 clinical trials published within the past 5 years in widely read, high-impact factor journals (and their sub-specialty counterparts) – including The New England Journal of Medicine, the Lancet, the BMJ and JAMA. These trials directly compared integrative health interventions with conventional medical treatments across conditions such as insomnia, obesity, age-related disorders, Parkinsonism, and motor neuron disease. The included trials assessed outcomes related to mental health, pain management, and quality of life. Across these studies, we found that integrative health interventions were consistently associated with improved health outcomes. While we acknowledge that stronger evidence is needed, the research findings represent an important step toward exploring a well-balanced, evidence-based approach to integrative health.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.70084?af=R">Upstream CB1R Regulation of β‐Adrenergic Memory Consolidation</a></h4>

              
                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Object recognition memory (ORM) plays a key role in identifying familiar items and encoding episodic information. ORM consolidation depends on β-adrenergic receptor (βAR) signaling and is associated with increased BDNF expression in the dorsal hippocampus. Although hippocampal activation of cannabinoid type-1 receptors (CB1Rs) is known to impair ORM consolidation, the mechanisms underlying this effect remain unclear. In this study, we used the novel object recognition task to examine the interaction between CB1Rs and βARs during ORM consolidation in adult male Wistar rats. Intra-dorsal CA1 infusion of the CB1R agonist ACEA, the βAR antagonist propranolol, or the PKA inhibitor myristoylated PKI<sub>14–22</sub>, administered 5-min post-training, impaired ORM consolidation. Notably, co-administration of the PKA activator 8Br-cAMP or the βAR agonist isoproterenol reversed ACEA-induced amnesia. In contrast, the CB1R inverse agonist AM251 failed to reverse propranolol-induced amnesia, which was instead rescued by recombinant BDNF infusion into the hippocampus 120-min post-training. These findings suggest that hippocampal CB1Rs regulate ORM consolidation by acting upstream of βARs via a signaling cascade involving PKA activation and BDNF expression.</p>

">Functional interactions between anteroventral periventricular kisspeptin neurons and gonadotropin-releasing hormone neurons in female mice</a></h4>

              
                Kisspeptin neurons in the rostral hypothalamus are hypothesized to initiate preovulatory gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) surges by causing estradiol-dependent activation of GnRH neuron action potential firing and subsequent GnRH release. To determine if estradiol or ovarian cycle stage modulates functional connectivity in this circuit, we used optogenetics to photostimulate anteroventral-periventricular (AVPV) area kisspeptin neurons while recording electrical activity and/or evoked synaptic currents from preoptic area GnRH neurons in acutely-prepared mouse brain slices. Slices were prepared from mice in multiple hormonal states, including 2-days post ovariectomy (OVX) and OVX plus estradiol during the morning or afternoon, diestrus, proestrus and 1-week post OVX, and 6-weeks post OVX with or without 1 week of estradiol replacement. Photostimulation induced a sustained, frequency-dependent increase in GnRH neuron firing rate. This neuromodulatory-typical response was not different in diestrous vs proestrous mice but was blunted in 1-week OVX mice, suggesting ovarian steroids amplify this response. Neuromodulatory responses were infrequent in 6-week OVX mice even with 1-week of estradiol treatment. A minority of GnRH neurons exhibited a substantial and near-immediate increase in firing rate typical of fast synaptic transmission. Monosynaptic connectivity was low and stable across the hormone states tested and mediated by GABA. Interestingly, evidence of a monosynaptic connection was not a requirement for GnRH neurons to exhibit a sustained increase in firing rate, suggesting non-synaptic or volume transmission occurs in this system. Synaptic connectivity did, however, amplify the increase in firing rate observed in GnRH neurons from proestrous mice, indicating proestrous hormonal conditions can amplify this response.

">Distinct tau filament folds in familial frontotemporal dementia due to the MAPT S305I mutation</a></h4>

              
                Frontotemporal lobar degeneration with tau inclusions (FTLD-tau) comprise a class of fatal heterogeneous neurodegenerative diseases. Approximately 10% arise from pathogenic MAPT mutations and often cause severe, early-onset disease with pathology that is distinct yet partially overlapping with sporadic cases. Here, we evaluated post-mortem tissue from a patient with FTLD-tau due to MAPT S305I showing neuropathology most consistent with argyrophilic grain disease (AGD), a prevalent limbic tauopathy of aging. Structures determined by cryo-electron microscopy reveal tau filament folds that differ from those found in sporadic AGD or other tauopathies and feature a 4-layer architecture stabilized by the Ile substitution within its core. Comparative structural analysis reveals conserved motifs are shared among AGD, corticobasal degeneration, and MAPT P301T. A well-defined density stacks along a cationic cleft, indicative of a bound RNA-like polyanion or small-molecule. In vitro analysis shows the S305I mutation promotes fibrilization relative to normal tau. These results demonstrate that MAPT S305I stabilizes a distinct aggregation-prone tau fold that likely contributes to disease pathology and heterogeneity beyond its known splicing defects, and underscore potential limitations of using the most pathologically similar genetic form as a model for sporadic FTLD-tau.

">A learning-evoked slow-oscillatory architecture paces population activity for offline reactivation across the human medial temporal lobe</a></h4>

              
                Memory processing requires the coordinated engagement of neuronal populations across distributed brain networks and across time. How such coordination is organized in the human medial temporal lobe (MTL) remains unclear. Here, we show that MTL population activity is dynamically structured by a transient slow-oscillatory architecture that emerges during online learning to promote offline consolidation and later recall. Using intracranial recordings that combine single-neuron spiking activity and local field potentials in human participants, we find that mnemonic engagement evokes on-demand slow-oscillatory bursts in the hippocampus. These hippocampal bursts synchronize gamma-band patterns across MTL regions, defining discrete coordination events that pace cross-regional coactivity motifs during learning. These learning-time population motifs are then selectively reactivated during hippocampal ripples in post-learning rest, and the strength of their reactivation predicts subsequent recall accuracy. Together, these findings identify a multi-scale coordination mechanism that links distributed population activity across learning, consolidation, and recall in humans.

">Inferring population-level physiologically based model parameters for sleep in infancy and young childhood</a></h4>

              
                The sleep patterns of infants and young children differ from adult sleep patterns, with longer duration and multiple bouts per 24 hours. There is also considerable heterogeneity in infant sleep, both between individuals and within individuals across development. While mathematical models have been used to understand the mechanisms that regulate adult sleep, the development of sleep from infancy through early childhood has remained largely unexplored. Here we used an established mathematical model for adult sleep regulation to investigate how the underlying mechanisms of sleep mature from ages 1 month to 5 years, and identify a basis for inter-individual differences at each age. Using a Bayesian approach to estimate joint distributions of model parameters at different ages, we found that: (i) decreases in the rate of accumulation of sleep homeostatic pressure captured the reduction in sleep duration across development; while (ii) increases in the time scale of the sleep homeostatic drive captured the consolidation of sleep into fewer sleep bouts per day across development. In terms of inter-individual differences, we found larger spread in the parameters within the earlier stages of infancy (<1 year). The center and boundaries of the joint distributions evolved with age through the parameter space, converging towards previously described adult parameter values. A bifurcation analysis of the homeostatic timescale parameter revealed that progressive consolidation of sleep occurs through abrupt loss of bouts one at a time, punctuated by narrow intervals of greater-than-24 h cycles. These results establish plausible, population-level trajectories in physiological parameters underpinning maturation of sleep regulation through infancy and early childhood.

">Vicious circle of amyloid and leptomeningeal macrophages evokes vascular dysfunction in CAA</a></h4>

              
                The subarachnoid space contains leptomeningeal arteries and resident immune cells known as subarachnoid macrophages (SAMs). In Alzheimers disease (AD) and related cerebral amyloid angiopathy, amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}) frequently accumulates around the leptomeningeal arteries. Nevertheless, the local immune responses and their functional consequences remain poorly understood. Using longitudinal intravital imaging in a mouse model of AD, we tracked A{beta} deposition and identified a distinct SAM population that migrates to and phagocytoses these arterial A{beta} deposits. SAM recruitment correlated with vascular remodeling, including smooth muscle loss, aneurysm formation, and reduced cerebral perfusion. Transcriptomic profiling revealed a distinct SAM population in AD with upregulated CD39 expression. Pharmacological inhibition of CD39 attenuated arterial A{beta} deposition, identifying SAMs as a potential therapeutic target in AD.

                Understanding single-cell neuronal activity across multiple brain regions in the context of ethologically relevant behaviors is a major goal in systems neuroscience. We have engineered the Cortex Camera Array Microscope (CortexCAM), integrating four miniaturized fluorescence imaging microscopes to simultaneously capture cellular activity from contiguous fields of view spanning over 48 mm2 of the dorsal cortex. The CortexCAM is capable of imaging > 9000 individual neurons across much of the primary and secondary motor, somatosensory, visual, retrosplenial, and association cortices across both hemispheres of the dorsal cortex. The compact nature of the CortexCAM allows integration into a passive mechanical gantry system to form the mobile CortexCAM. The mobile CortexCAM allows volitional control of translational motion (x, y) and rotational motion (yaw) in physical behavior arenas. We then use the mobile CortexCAM to perform cortex-wide cellular resolution imaging in freely locomoting mice performing alternating choice tasks, as well as during social interactions. Thus the CortexCAM allows studying cortex-wide cellular dynamics in behaviors that cannot be achieved in headfixed settings.

">Ecological Suboptimality in Naturalistic Foraging: Amplified Deviation from Optimality in a Mouse Model of Alzheimer Disease</a></h4>

              
                Foraging requires animals to integrate spatial, temporal, and reward-related costs to guide adaptive action selection, yet how neurodegenerative pathology alters this process remains poorly understood. We compared foraging behavior in control (C57BL/6J) and APPNL-G-F transgenic mice, a knock-in mouse model of Alzheimer disease. The foraging task was structured such that distance to home, the size of food-pellet rewards, and food texture jointly shaped choices. These task variables implicitly imposed time costs related to travel, handling, and inter trial intervals. While control mice adjusted foraging behavior in relation to task demands across conditions, APPNL-G-F mice showed systematic deviations from control patterns. Their choices were characterized by increased withdrawal and reduced flexibility as spatial and temporal costs increased. Using a normative rate-maximization framework grounded in classical foraging theory, we quantified optimality and found marked suboptimality in both groups: control mice achieved 53% of the optimal reward rate, whereas APPNL-G-F mice achieved 45%. This suboptimality indicates that naturalistic decision making operates under context-dependent constraints rather than adhering to strict theoretical optimality. Within this constrained landscape, APPNL-G-F mice deviated more strongly from optimality than control mice, particularly under conditions requiring fine-grained integration of time-based costs. Group differences were most pronounced when optimal policies were highly sensitive to small errors in the estimation of temporal and spatial trade-offs. These findings suggest that Alzheimer-related pathology selectively amplified normative decision deficits rather than producing qualitatively distinct foraging strategies.

">Cortical maps diverge, representations converge along cortical hierarchy</a></h4>

              
                Brain maps (e.g. retinotopy, somatotopy) vary across individuals. This is thought to reflect underlying computational differences. However, artificial neural networks (ANNs) show that similar performance and internal representations can coexist with diverse circuit layouts. Consequently, we tested the presumption that spatial diversity reflects representational diversity in the brain, but found this presumption often breaks down. Using task and resting-state fMRI data we compared regional functional topographies and representational geometries--the within-individual dissimilarities among activity patterns. Across individuals (n = 414), representations converged in higher-order cortex despite substantial topographic diversity, indicating that similar information was encoded by different, individual-specific activity patterns. Topography only tracked representational differences in sensory-motor cortices and regions under strong architectural constraints, such as myelination or laminar differentiation. We show this parallels ANNs: architectural permissiveness allows idiosyncratic layouts to arise from random initializations rather than learned representations. To test whether topographies and representations show analogous developmental origins, we examined twins (n = 394), and found topographies were more heritable than representations. This shows that representational convergence occurs across idiosyncratic layouts in both artificial and biological systems, but is moderated by architectural constraints on implementation flexibility. Accordingly, the relevance of localization- and representation-based paradigms of brain function depends on neural architecture.

">Noradrenergic neuromodulation produces a NMDAR-dependent network state of respiratory rhythmogenesis in the preBotzinger Complex</a></h4>

              
                Norepinephrine (NE) is an important mediator of sympathetic activity that influences breathing. At the level of the inspiratory neural network, the preBotzinger complex (preBotC), NE modulation orchestrates changes in neuronal network dynamics that influence the stability of inspiratory rhythmogenesis. While this phenomenon has largely been attributed to NE-modulation of intrinsic excitability of inspiratory preBotC neurons, NE is also capable of modulating synaptic drive. Here, we resolve how NE affects synaptic properties and changes the activity dynamics of interconnected preBotC neurons in rhythmic brainstem slice preparations. Increased network burst amplitude and frequency coincided with enhanced inspiratory drive currents at the single neuron level. This increased drive was blocked by the NMDA receptor (NMDAR) antagonist, APV. Our in silico modeling indicated that synaptic calcium entry via NDMAR is key to maintaining network synchrony during this elevated state of excitability. This was consistent with our multi-electrode array studies revealing that NE-dependent NMDAR activity enhances and preserves synchrony during inspiratory network bursts. This synaptic mechanism may be a critical determinant for shaping inspiratory drive associated with changed neuromodulatory environments.

">Neuromuscular Basis of Kinematic Adaptations During Bidirectional Walking</a></h4>

              
                Background: Human locomotion is a highly adaptive motor skill that adjusts to new environmental demands through learning. Split-belt treadmill paradigms have advanced our understanding of gait adaptation. Most studies have examined gait when the belts move at different speeds in the same direction. We are studying muscle activation patterns during an asymmetric gait, when the treadmill belts move at equal speed in opposite directions, i.e., bidirectional walking (BDW). Methods: Twelve healthy volunteers performed a single session on a split-belt treadmill. We simultaneously collected ground reaction forces via treadmill force plates, joint kinematics via motion capture, and surface electromyography (EMG) from bilateral soleus (SOL) and tibialis anterior (TA) muscles. Participants started with 2min of forward walking (FW), followed with four 5min blocks of BDW separated by 1min standing rest intervals, and finished the session with 2min of FW (washout). Results: All participants successfully completed the protocol. We analyzed EMG signals for temporal activation patterns (rhythm generation) and amplitude characteristics (pattern formation). EMG recordings revealed antiphasic activation of SOL and TA muscles bilaterally throughout all trials. During BDW, the backward-moving leg's TA showed prolonged activation patterns that persisted during washout FW, suggesting retention of adaptive changes. Burst-to-cycle duration ratios showed transient changes during early adaptation but remained relatively stable across conditions, demonstrating robust rhythm generation despite adaptive modulation of activation patterns during BDW. Discussion: These findings demonstrate that BDW induces asymmetric adjustments in muscle activation patterns. Rhythm generation (timing) did not significantly differ between BDW and FW. However, we did observe changes in pattern formation (i.e., EMG profiles) during FW pre- and post-BDW training. Burst-to-cycle duration ratios, as a measure of rhythm generation, showed changes during early adaptation, particularly the increase in right SOL and right TA during block 1, though these changes did not reach statistical significance and largely returned to baseline during washout. The underlying pattern formation structure, was maintained across all conditions, with selective amplitude modulations rather than fundamental reorganization of activation patterns. The substantial temporal adjustments in the backward-moving leg's SOL and phase shifts in TA provide the neuromuscular mechanism driving the bilateral step-length reduction, altered inter-limb phasing, and asymmetric double stance timing. These results extend our understanding of locomotor control by suggesting how the central nervous system (CNS) dynamically recalibrates muscle timing and amplitude to maintain satisfactory locomotion under new environmental demands.

">On the accuracy of image registration in portable low-field 3D brain MRI</a></h4>

              
                Portable low-field MRI offers an affordable and mobile alternative to conventional high-field scanners, enabling imaging in point-of-care and resource-limited settings. However, its lower signal-to-noise ratio, reduced resolution, and acquisition artifacts raise concerns about the accuracy of standard image registration methods. Reliable registration is critical for a wide range of emerging applications, including frequent brain monitoring, assessment of neurodegenerative disease progression, and evaluation of treatment effects such as those of Alzheimer's therapeutics. In this work, we systematically evaluated state-of-the-art registration approaches on simulated low-field scans (obtained by downsampling high-field images) and on real low-field brain MRI data. We compared three representative approaches: classical optimization (NiftyReg), learning-based registration (SynthMorph), and synthesis-based registration (SynthSR+NiftyReg). Using downsampled high-field scans, all methods performed well, achieving high Dice scores and smooth deformation fields, indicating that reduced resolution alone does not hinder registration. In contrast, real low-field data exhibited lower accuracy, primarily due to geometric distortion and other acquisition-specific artifacts. Among the tested approaches, the synthesis-based pipeline achieved the most robust performance across subjects and modalities. Overall, existing algorithms can accommodate resolution limitations, however, future methods could further enhance coregistration by explicitly addressing the distortions present in low-field MRI scans.

">HAPI Cells are SIM-A9-related Mouse Microglial Cells Useful for In Vitro Modeling of Microglial Immunometabolism</a></h4>

              
                Highly aggressively proliferating immortalized (HAPI) cells were initially described as a spontaneously immortalized rat cell line isolated from a mixed neonatal rat glial population. It was demonstrated that HAPI cells are phagocytic, stain for macrophage-/microglia-specific markers like CD11b and GLUT5, and exhibit lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced nitric oxide (NO) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-) release. These characteristics led to their widespread use as a rat microglial cell line. Here, we report that HAPI cells are mouse cells, not rat cells, but further establish that they have a microglia-like identity and properties useful for in vitro modeling. Cell line authentication by short tandem repeat (STR) profiling, a method that detects identifying DNA signatures, indicates that HAPI cells are a 100% match for SIM-A9 cells, a mouse microglial cell line reported to be spontaneously immortalized from primary cell culture. We find that both HAPI cells and SIM-A9 cells express the microglia-selective gene Tmem119, as well as the microglia-/macrophage-selective marker Cx3cr1, supporting a microglial origin. Like primary rodent microglia or macrophages, HAPI cells respond to combined stimulation with LPS and the Type II interferon, interferon-gamma (IFN-{gamma}), with a pro-inflammatory morphology, NO production, NO-dependent suppression of mitochondrial oxygen consumption, and increased extracellular acidification (an indicator of glycolysis). The Type I interferon, interferon-alpha (IFN-), also reduces mitochondrial oxygen consumption when administered alone or in combination with LPS. Overall, results indicate that HAPI cells are SIM-A9-related mouse cells of microglial origin and support their continued use to study microglial behavior in vitro, including immunometabolism.

">Voluntary temporal attention improves perception even in the absence of temporal competition</a></h4>

              
                When successive stimuli occur close enough together in time, their perception can be impaired. Such impairments indicate temporal competition between successive stimuli for representational resources. Voluntary temporal attention can bias processing resources in favor of a behaviorally relevant moment, improving perception at the attended time at the expense of impairments at unattended times. However it is unclear whether these perceptual tradeoffs across time arise because voluntary temporal attention selects among actively competing stimulus representations, such as within visual working memory, or if instead, temporal attention facilitates stimulus processing prior to a competitive stage. Here we used a temporal cueing task with up to two targets in succession to test whether and how the effects of temporal attention depend on temporal competition. We found that voluntary temporal attention improved performance even in the absence of temporal competition, when only one stimulus appeared during the trial. Moreover, the magnitude of attentional enhancement was comparable with and without competition. These results suggest that voluntary temporal attention enhances perception by facilitating processing prior to a competitive stage, rather than by resolving conflicts between actively competing stimulus representations.

">Chronic nicotine reduces nigral dopaminergic activity and remodels pedunculopontine cholinergic subpopulations</a></h4>

              
                Chronic nicotine is linked to neuroprotective effects and reduced Parkinson's disease (PD) risk, yet its physiological effects on vulnerable substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) dopaminergic and pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN) cholinergic neurons are not fully understood. These populations exhibit specialized properties such as spontaneous pacemaking and elevated dendritic calcium influx that contribute to their selective neurodegeneration in PD. Here, we used whole-cell patch-clamp, two-photon calcium imaging, and morphological reconstruction in acute brain slices from adult mice of both sexes following 8-10 weeks of oral nicotine. Chronic nicotine reduced spontaneous pacemaking, burst propensity, and rebound firing in SNc dopaminergic neurons, while decoupling tonic firing rate from proximal dendritic calcium levels. The changes in the SNc occurred without altering L-type channel contributions, dendritic arborization, or excitatory synaptic drive. In PPN cholinergic neurons, chronic nicotine induced subregion-specific plasticity. Rostral PPN neurons showed depolarized membrane potentials, broadened action potentials, and dendritic pruning, whereas caudal PPN neurons showed reduced spike frequency adaptation and accelerated excitatory postsynaptic current kinetics. These findings reveal potential cellular and circuit mechanisms by which nicotine may contribute to resilience against PD.

">Affiliation in mice induced by an auditory-conditioned stimulus</a></h4>

              
                Social affiliation is a vital survival strategy that promotes well-being across species. While innate threats consistently trigger affiliation, it remains unclear whether learned threats engage the same affiliative systems. Here, we report that an auditory conditioned stimulus induced affiliation in mice. In same-sex dyads, mice subjected to auditory fear conditioning increased proximity during presentation of the conditioned stimulus (CS). This CS-evoked affiliation was independent of freezing levels, required familiarity between partners, and depended on intact basolateral amygdala-to-ventral hippocampus inputs and oxytocin signaling. These findings suggest that neural pathways activated by learned and innate threats converge on shared social-affiliation circuitry.

">A Multimodal Single-Cell Epigenomic and 3D Genome Atlas of the Human Basal Ganglia</a></h4>

              
                The basal ganglia are a group of forebrain nuclei critical for motor control and reward processing, and their dysfunction contributes to neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders. Here, we present the first multimodal single-cell epigenomic atlas of the human basal ganglia across major subregions and cell types. We jointly profiled DNA methylation and 3D chromatin conformation in 197,003 nuclei from eight basal ganglia subregions using multi-omic sequencing (snm3C-seq), and integrated these data with existing DNA methylation and chromatin conformation sequencing datasets to build a unified atlas of 261,331 cells spanning 31 subclasses and 59 groups. This atlas reveals extensive cell-type- and region-specific differential methylation, enriched for distinct transcription factor motifs, and validated by MERFISH spatial transcriptomics, which uncovered epigenetic gradients linked to transcriptional output. Compared to neuronal cells, non-neuronal cells exhibit distinct 3D genome organization, including smaller chromatin compartments, increased long-range inter-compartment contacts, shorter loops, and stronger CG hypomethylation in A compartments. We further identified genes that display compartment switches, are strongly correlated with compartment scores, and exhibit differential domain boundaries and chromatin looping across basal ganglia cell types. We identified multiple medium spiny neuron subtypes defined by distinct hypomethylated signature genes, with 3D genome embeddings emphasizing dorsal, ventral, and hybrid populations. By integrating chromatin accessibility and histone modification profiles, we reconstructed cell-type-resolved enhancer-promoter links and gene regulatory networks, providing a comprehensive epigenomic framework for interpreting genetic risk loci and regulatory architecture in the human basal ganglia.

">TRIM32-UBQLN2-p62 axis promotes TDP-43 inclusion formation and amyloid aggregation through shuttle condensates</a></h4>

              
                Aberrant protein aggregation is a hallmark of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), which share overlapping genetic and pathological features. Similar aggregates are increasingly recognized in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy (LATE). However, it remains unclear whether a shared molecular pathway drives this pathological aggregation. Here, we report that the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM32, together with the shuttle factor UBQLN2 and the autophagy adaptor p62/SQSTM1, form condensates that depend on E3 ligase activity and a network of intermolecular interactions. These condensates act as scaffolds that capture UBQLN2 client proteins, including TDP-43 and ANXA11, and modulate their mobility. A unique hydrophobic loop within TRIM32's substrate-binding domain mimics low-complexity motifs in ANXA11 and TDP-43, enabling selective retention via competitive binding mediated by UBQLN2 STI1 domain. Moreover, TRIM32 condensates promote amyloid aggregation of TDP-43, an effect that is exacerbated by pathogenic UBQLN2 mutation. In brains from individuals with diverse neurodegenerative diseases, TRIM32 co-localizes with pathological phospho-TDP-43 (pTDP-43) inclusions, supporting a model in which TRIM32-driven condensates function as selective proteostasis sorting compartments that broadly contribute to TDP-43 proteinopathy.

">Computational modeling of neurotransmitter cycling predicts human brain glutamate and GABA dynamics in response to administration of exogenous ketones</a></h4>

              
                Administration of ketones is used as a therapeutic option in multiple conditions, including epilepsy, mental health disorders, and brain aging. A proposed mechanism of action involves the modulation of glutamate and GABA, the brain's primary excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters, which jointly regulate the excitatory-inhibitory balance. However, the precise mechanism by which ketones influence these neurotransmitters remains unclear. In this study, we hypothesize that ketones modulate glutamate and GABA alterations in the pseudo-malate-aspartate shuttle (PMAS). To test this, we developed a computational model of neurotransmitter cycling centered on the PMAS, simulating the temporal dynamics and steady-state concentrations of glutamate and GABA as functions of ketone metabolism. We then compared the model outputs with MRS data from ketone administration experiments, which showed agreement with the model predictions, providing quantitative support for our proposed mechanism that ketones modulate neurotransmitters through the PMAS. Building on this consistency, we performed metabolic control analysis to identify key enzymes that modulate selectively glutamate and GABA. Overall, the model provides researchers and clinicians with a framework for hypothesis testing and treatment optimization, while also serving as a foundation for future model expansions.

Scientific data management is at a critical juncture, driven by exponential data growth, increasing cross-domain dependencies, and a severe reproducibility crisis in modern research. Traditional centralized data management approaches are not only struggling with data volume but also fail to address the fragmentation of research results across domains. This hinders scientific reproducibility and cross-domain collaboration and increases concerns about data sovereignty and governance. This article proposes FAIR and federated Data Ecosystems as an improved architectural pattern for future research data ecosystems. It tries to incorporate the latest advancements in decentralized, distributed systems into existing research infrastructure to promote cross-domain collaboration. Based on established patterns from Data Commons, Data Meshes, and Data Spaces, our approach focuses on a layered architecture that consists of governance, data, service, and application layers. With this, it could be possible to preserve domain-specific expertise and control while facilitating data integration through standardized interfaces and semantic enrichment. Key requirements include adaptive metadata management, simplified user interaction, robust security, and transparent data transactions. Our architecture supports compute-to-data as well as data-to-compute paradigms, implementing a decentralized peer-to-peer network that scales horizontally. This article aims to provide both an impulse for the technical architecture as well as concepts for a governance framework so that FAIR and federated Data Ecosystems could enable researchers to build on existing work while maintaining control over their data and computing resources. This could provide a practical path towards an integrated research infrastructure that respects domain autonomy as well as interoperability requirements.

                <p>by Karin M. Danzer, Konstantin M. J. Sparrer</p>

Despite decades of intensive research, our current approaches to treating neurodegenerative diseases only slow down the seemingly inevitable. Could recent data associating vaccinations with reduced risk of dementia offer an unexpected beacon of hope?

Current therapies for neurodegenerative diseases largely manage symptoms and only modestly slow progression. This Perspective highlights emerging evidence that vaccines and antivirals may lower dementia risk by targeting viral triggers, opening new avenues for prevention.

                <p>by Pietro Pollo, Szymon M. Drobniak, Hamed Haselimashhadi, Malgorzata Lagisz, Ayumi Mizuno, Laura A. B. Wilson, Daniel W. A. Noble, Shinichi Nakagawa</p>

Biological differences between males and females are pervasive. Researchers often focus on sex differences in the mean or, occasionally, in variation, albeit other measures can be useful for biomedical and biological research. For instance, differences in skewness (asymmetry of a distribution), kurtosis (heaviness of a distribution’s tails), and correlation (relationship between two variables) might be crucial to improve medical diagnosis and to understand natural processes. Yet, there are currently no meta-analytic ways to measure differences in these metrics between two groups. We propose three effect size statistics to fill this gap: Δ<i>sk</i>, Δ<i>ku</i>, and Δ<i>Zr</i>, which measure differences in skewness, kurtosis, and correlation, respectively. Besides presenting the rationale for the calculation of these effect size statistics, we conducted a simulation to explore their properties and used a large dataset of mice traits to illustrate their potential. For example, in our case study, we found that females show, on average, a greater correlation between fat mass and heart weight than males. Although calculating Δ<i>sk</i>, Δ<i>ku</i>, and Δ<i>Zr</i> will require large sample sizes of individual data, technological advancements in data collection create increase opportunities to use these effect size statistics. Importantly, Δ<i>sk</i>, Δ<i>ku</i>, and Δ<i>Zr</i> can be used to compare any two groups, allowing a new generation of meta-analyses that explore such differences and potentially leading to new insights in multiple fields of study.

                Background Total adrenalectomy (TA) is the standard approach for the management of unilateral adrenal tumors. However, TA leads to adrenal insufficiency requiring corticosteroid replacement therapy, which may cause complications such as adrenal crisis, Cushing syndrome, obesity, immunodeficiency, and cardiovascular disease. Partial adrenalectomy (PA) was then performed to preserve residual adrenal function and minimize the need for lifelong corticosteroid therapy. In unilateral adrenal tumors, higher recurrence rates with PA than with TA need to be considered. Given the variability in outcomes, a systematic review is needed to compare the outcomes of PA and TA in patients with unilateral adrenal tumors. Methods We searched the literature using PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library from inception to March 2025. We used specific keywords, such as “partial adrenalectomy,” “total adrenalectomy,” and “unilateral adrenal tumor.” Three authors independently screened the studies, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias using the ROBINS-I. The primary outcomes included the operative time, blood loss, and hospital stay. The secondary outcomes were overall complications, hypertension, hypokalemia, and local recurrence. Results Eight studies involving 982 patients with unilateral adrenal tumors (adrenal adenoma, adrenal pheochromocytoma, adrenal hyperplasia, and other pathologies) were included. Partial adrenalectomy resulted in a significant reduction in hospital stay (mean difference (MD) -0.49 days; 95% CI −0.78 to −0.21; I2 = 0%; p = 0,0006). There were no statistically significant differences in operative time, blood loss, overall complications, postoperative hypertension and hypokalemia, or recurrence between the TA and PA. Conclusions Partial adrenalectomy is associated with a shorter hospital stay than total adrenalectomy in patients with unilateral adrenal tumors. Some outcomes showed high heterogeneity and wide confidence intervals; therefore, these findings should be interpreted with caution.

                Background Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection demonstrates significantly elevated prevalence among hemodialysis populations worldwide, with particularly high rates in Middle Eastern countries. Despite this epidemiological pattern, limited evidence exists regarding the impact of HCV infection on hemostatic complications following arteriovenous fistula (AVF) creation in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Methods This prospective cohort study enrolled 460 patients diagnosed with ESRD requiring AVF creation at three tertiary hospitals in Baghdad, Iraq (Al-Yarmouk Teaching Hospital, Ibn-Al-Nafees Teaching Hospital, and Al-Shaheed Ghazi Al-Hariri Surgical Hospital), between January 2017 and January 2024. Patients were stratified by HCV serological status using third-generation enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The primary outcome was hemostatic complications (bleeding requiring intervention or clinically significant hematoma) monitored for six weeks postoperatively. Secondary outcomes included coagulation parameters, AVF maturation rates, and other vascular complications. Multivariate logistic regression identified independent predictors of complications. Results Among 460 patients, 151 (32.8%) tested positive for HCV. HCV-positive patients demonstrated significantly prolonged prothrombin time (19±5 versus 15±2.5 seconds, p<0.001), activated partial thromboplastin time (40±4 versus 32±3 seconds, p<0.001), and reduced platelet count (153±43 versus 215±72 ×103/mm3, p<0.001). Hemostatic complications occurred in 28.5% of HCV-positive patients compared to 5.5% of HCV-negative patients (crude OR: 6.835, 95% CI: 3.597-12.987, p<0.001). In multivariate analysis, HCV infection emerged as the strongest independent predictor of hemostatic complications (adjusted OR: 5.892, 95% CI: 3.102-11.196, p<0.001). AVF maturation rates were significantly lower in HCV-positive patients (74.2% versus 86.4%, p=0.002). Conclusions Hepatitis C virus infection increases hemostatic complications following AVF creation nearly six-fold and adversely affects fistula maturation rates. These findings emphasize the importance of incorporating HCV status into preoperative risk stratification and perioperative management protocols, particularly in high-prevalence regions.

                Background Informal employment and its impact on economic growth have been receiving greater attention, but less is known about their socioeconomic conditions and determinants of income in India. This column attempts to uncover the determinants of informal income and socioeconomic conditions with respect to migration status. Methods This study was based on primary investigation. Hence the data collection was performed on multi-stage stratified sampling method. The primary data has been collected through a structured questionnaire for the informal sector workers in Cuttack city of Odisha. The data analysis was completed by ANOVA and multiple regression analysis. Results The income of migrant workers is more than the non-migrant workers due to their nature of work and pattern of payment, whereas the non-migrant workers are engaged in household services with lower payment. The important socio economic determinants such as category of land they lived, gender, various age groups of household head, migration status, availability of off-season support, type of employment, social group, religion, principal sectors, number of dependency, and members of the union are responsible for lower income of the informal workers. Conclusion For sustainable and equitable improvements in basic facilities such as housing, electricity, health, vocational education, social security and employment opportunity should be facilitated by the policy makers. In order to achieve these objectives, this study emphasized more on the mobile-education-services, MGNREGS programs and the MSMEs sector by which Sustainable Development Goals 1,2,3,4,6,8,9,12, and 17 can simultaneously be achieved.

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The taiep rat originated from a spontaneous mutation in a colony of Sprague–Dawley rats, whose phenotype is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. The mutant taiep rat shows hypomyelination and demyelination of the central nervous system (CNS) and has been considered a chronic animal model of multiple sclerosis and tubulinopathies. Unlike taiep rats, heterozygous rats for the mutation (+/−), referred to as carriers, have not been widely studied. Thus, the objective of the present study was to examine the dendritic arborization and dendritic spine density of CA1 and CA3 pyramidal neurons of taiep mutation carriers. We evaluated the following groups: Sprague–Dawley rats as a control (SD), mutation carriers (Carrier), and taiep rats (taiep). The brains of the animals were processed using the Golgi-Cox technique to analyze the basilar and apical dendritic arborization and dendritic spine density of CA1 and CA3 pyramidal neurons. We observed a decrease in dendritic arborization in the basilar arbors of dorsal hippocampal CA1 and CA3 pyramidal neurons in both carrier and taiep adult rats, as well as a decrease in dendritic arborization in the apical arbors of CA3 neurons in carrier rats. Moreover, dendritic spine density was reduced in CA1 neurons in both rats. These results show that even when rats are mutation carriers, they exhibit alterations in the dendritic arborization of dorsal hippocampal neurons similar to those of taiep rats.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-472/v2?src=rss">Assessing the effects of fluids and antibiotics in an acute murine model of sepsis: study protocol for the National Preclinical Sepsis Platform-01 (NPSP-01) Study [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background Sepsis remains a leading cause of mortality in critical care. Despite extensive preclinical research on sepsis pathophysiology, the development of effective therapies has been largely unsuccessful. Key obstacles include limited construct validity of animal models, insufficient methodological rigor and the lack of collaborative frameworks akin to clinical trials. These issues plague not only sepsis research, but preclinical research in general. The National Preclinical Sepsis Platform (NPSP), an interdisciplinary network under Sepsis Canada, addresses these challenges in sepsis research through multilaboratory, randomized, controlled preclinical studies. NPSP-01 will establish baseline conditions for future investigations using an acute fecal-induced peritonitis model of sepsis. Methods This randomized, controlled study will evaluate the effect of standard sepsis therapy in a mouse model of sepsis across six centres. Interlaboratory variability and the interaction of biological sex on outcomes will also be examined. C57BL/6 mice of both sexes will be randomized into sham (healthy control) + treatment, sepsis, or sepsis + treatment groups. Sepsis will be induced via intraperitoneal injection of fecal slurry, while sham mice will receive vehicle control. Antibiotics and fluids will be administered to treatment groups at 4 hours post-induction, and mice with be euthanized at 8 hours post-induction. The primary outcome is plasma interleukin-6 levels. Secondary outcomes include biological (blood gas and chemistry, white blood cell count, bacterial load), clinical (body weight, core temperature, sepsis score, mortality as measured by surrogate humane endpoints), and feasibility measures. Conclusions NPSP-01 will be the first multilaboratory study of sepsis and represents a shift in preclinical critical illness research, mirroring the rigor of clinical multicenter trials. By addressing procedural standardization, interlaboratory variability, and sex-based differences, this study aims to enhance the reliability and translational relevance of preclinical findings. The outcomes of NPSP-01 will establish foundational data for future investigations and provide a roadmap for rigorous collaborative preclinical studies to accelerate the evaluation of novel sepsis therapies.

                Background: Humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy (HHM) is a paraneoplastic syndrome commonly associated with solid organ and hematological malignancies. Its occurrence in neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) is rare, with majority cases in pancreatic NETs. Here, we describe an extremely rare case of a metastatic duodenal NET presenting with severe hypercalcemia due to the secretion of Parathyroid Hormone-related Protein (PTHrP). This case features an exceptionally high PTHrP level, making it one of the most severe reported cases of NET-associated HHM. Case Presentation: A 70-year-old Indian male with hypertension and diabetes mellitus was found to have a well-differentiated Duodenal NET (grade 2, Ki67 index: 18.2%; T2N1M0). He underwent distal gastrectomy with D1 duodenal resection. Subsequent disease progression with hepatic and peripancreatic nodal metastases was managed with octreotide injections, Everolimus and Lutetium177 DOTATATE PRRT (Peptide receptor radionuclide therapy). Six months later, he presented with acute unresponsiveness and severe hypercalcemia (corrected calcium: 14.06 mg/dL) with suppressed iPTH levels (Intact Parathyroid Hormone) and markedly elevated PTHrP levels of 252 pmol/L (Parathyroid Hormone related Peptide), thereby confirming HHM. Multiple myeloma and osteolytic bone metastasis were excluded. Despite management with intravenous fluids, calcitonin, ibandronate, and multiple hemodialysis sessions, the patient succumbed to hypoxic brain injury. Discussion: We report a rare case of metastatic duodenal NET causing severe hypercalcemia due to excessive PTHrP production. With a remarkably elevated PTHrP level, this case is one amongst the most severe documented cases. The relationship between tumour grade and PTHrP production along with the refractory nature of the hypercalcemia, highlights the complex pathophysiology of this condition. Conclusion: PTHrP-mediated humoral hypercalcemia is an uncommon but life-threatening complication of duodenal NETs and is associated with adverse outcomes. Early recognition of this paraneoplastic syndrome, prompt metabolic correction, and timely escalation of NET-directed therapies, including consideration of PRRT, are crucial to improving clinical outcomes in patients with aggressive, receptor-positive disease.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-252/v1?src=rss">Experimental Investigation of H-Pile Performance in Layered Soils [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                This paper presents an experimental study on the behavior of H-piles buried in a stratified soil section, considering variations in the position and depth of a weakly clay layer. Tests were conducted in a specially fabricated steel enclosure attached to a rigid load-bearing frame to impose a uniform stress and minimize boundary effects. The clay layer was placed at three depths: L1(top layer near the surface), L2 (middle layer, mid-depth of pile), and L3 (at the bottom, beneath the pile) and tested under four different textures: solid clay (SCL), semi-solid clay (SSCL), semi-liquid clay (SLCL), and liquid clay (LCL). Axial loading tests were carried out using a laboratory loading apparatus that adopted the general principles of ASTM D1143 in the method of applying the load and measuring the settlement, with some modifications made as needed to suit the tests of scale models. The test results indicated that the ultimate bearing capacity and overall load-bearing strength of the piles were strongly affected by the position and texture of the clay layer. A clay that is solid enhances resistance to piles, particularly in situations where the layer is near the surface and is supported by sand that is under the surface. However, liquid clay led to a significant reduction in the load-carrying capacity of the piles. Overall, the objective of the current research is to determine the combined effect of soil hardness, depth, and the soils surrounding the piles on the H-response of the piles in stratified soils in order to make certain recommendations that are somewhat practical for designing a foundation in soils with various subsurface characteristics.

                Human behavior relies on the ability to simplify complex goals using interim subgoals and the ability to plan using an internal model of the world. Grossman et al. demonstrate that the brain represents subgoals and computes values for choices in relation to those subgoals using a world model.

                McIlvried et al. report an inverse relationship between patient-reported pain and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in patients with oral cancer. Using gain- and loss-of-function approaches in syngeneic mouse models, they establish that tumor-evoked nociceptor activation drives CGRP-mediated immunosuppression. They then show that CGRP receptor antagonism reduces both tumor-associated pain and immune evasion.

                Chen et al. have discovered that IGF signaling acts locally to promote the migration of a lymphatic vessel along the craniofacial cartilage. They also demonstrate that IGF1R signaling promotes both zebrafish and human lymphatic cell migration, indicating that IGF signaling has a conserved role in lymphatic-vessel development.

                Abou Karam et al. identify a cell communication mechanism used by the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. The parasite delivers its mRNAs into monocytes and imports them into their protected nuclei, where they perturb the splicing. This extracellular RNA-based strategy disrupts host transcript processing and immune signaling, revealing another layer of host interference.

                Liu et al. reveal that vascular stiffening drives pulmonary hypertension by inducing EphB4 to undergo phase separation in smooth muscle cells. These condensates trap YAP inhibitors, unleashing pathogenic proliferation. A targeted peptide disrupts condensation and attenuates pulmonary hypertension in vivo, revealing a new mechanotherapeutic strategy.

">TRAINING SESSION INTERVALS SHAPE FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY IN SPATIAL LEARNING: A BRAIN-WIDE ANALYSIS</a></h4>

              
                A substantial body of research indicates that spaced training, characterized by longer inter-trial intervals between training epochs, consistently outperforms massed training in promoting durable memory. To investigate the neural mechanisms underlying this difference, we quantified c-Fos expression across 126 brain regions and mapped network activity following both spatial and cue based learning under massed and spaced training protocols. While both training regimens (spaced and massed) and memory types (spatial and cue-based) produced small-world networks with similar overall topology, they differed in the functional organization of specific circuits. Massed spatial training preferentially activated hippocampal-thalamic and claustrum-basal ganglia-thalamic pathways. In contrast, spaced spatial training promoted stronger cortico-thalamic interactions and enhanced communication between the hippocampus and basal ganglia, indicating a shift toward a more integrated, cortically mediated network. These findings suggest that temporal spacing of training reorganizes memory-related brain networks, enhancing cortical, thalamic dynamics to support more efficient spatial memory. Finally, spaced networks were more sensitive to targeted disruptions of key connector hubs-identified through betweenness centrality analysis-than massed networks, pointing to a potential systems-level trade-off.

">Generation and characterization of human iPSC-derived NPC1I1061T/I10161T i3Neurons as a model for NPC1 disease</a></h4>

              
                Niemann-Pick disease, type C is an autosomal recessive, fatal, neurodegenerative disorder caused by pathological variants in NPC1 or PC2. Dysfunction of either NPC1 or NPC2 results in impaired intracellular cholesterol transport and subsequent storage of unesterified cholesterol in endolysosomal compartments. Earlier cell-based studies utilized patient fibroblasts to study this disease; however, neuronal cells allow for investigation of the neurodegenerative aspect of NPC1. Expression of neurogenin in induced pluripotent stem cells leads to the generation of i3Neurons (integrated, isogenic, and inducible), allowing for rapid, synchronized growth of homogenous neurons. In this study, we report the development and characterization of a human iPSC-derived NPC1I1061T/I1061T i3Neuronal model system. NPC1I1061T is a missense variant resulting in a misfolded protein targeted for proteasomal degradation in the ER. NPC1I1061T/I1061T i3Neurons phenocopied the cellular pathological features of NPC1 disease including endolysosomal cholesterol accumulation, lysosomal morphological changes, and response to the proteostasis modulator, mo56HC. The NPC1 phenotype was alleviated by 2-hydroxypropyl-{beta}-cyclodextrin treatment, a drug demonstrating efficacy both in vitro and in vivo. This NPC1I1061T/I1061T i3Neuronal cell line can facilitate future high-throughput drug and genomic screens, particularly those aimed at identifying proteostasis regulators that improve the expression/stability of the mutant NPC1 protein.

">Neuroanatomy of substantia nigra and ventral tegmental area dopaminergic, and dorsal raphe serotonergic circuits in the human brain using T1-weighted and diffusion magnetic resonance imaging: A morphometric pilot study with estimate of reliability</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: We present here a methodology for morphometric analysis of the substantia nigra (SN), the ventral tegmental area (VTA), the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) and their respective structural brain circuits. Methods: Our analyses were based on multimodal T1-weighted MRI and diffusion MRI (dMRI) segmentation and tractography in 12 human subjects drawn from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) repository. Results: We were able to demonstrate strong connections of the SN, VTA and DRN with several brain regions, in particular the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and the cerebellum. More specifically, we created comprehensive visualizations of the SN and VTA dopaminergic as well as the DRN serotonergic structural circuits in the human brain, which, although preliminary, demonstrate the potential of multimodal neuroimaging to investigate these circuits quantitatively in clinical conditions. Finally, we created a pilot dataset for the most frequently observed structural connections, specifically those that were present more than 92% of the time among all subjects. Discussion: This pilot morphometric report examines the structural circuits of the SN, VTA and DRN, which are critically involved in several biobehaviors and clinical conditions such as addiction, stress, Parkinson's disease (PD), schizophrenia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, mood disorders, COVID-19 and long COVID. Importantly, the strong structural connectivity of the DLPFC and cerebellum with the SN, VTA and DRN is expected to be a potential target of noninvasive neuromodulation treatments in neuropsychiatry. Our findings demonstrate the potential of current clinical multimodal neuroimaging to delineate the dopaminergic (DA) and serotonergic (5-HT) circuits in the human brain in clinical conditions.

">Exploring the PLD1-tau interaction in Frontotemporal Dementia.</a></h4>

              
                Frontotemporal dementia (FTD), a leading cause of young-onset dementia, is characterized by progressive behavioral and cognitive decline associated with frontotemporal cortical atrophy. Nearly 40% of cases exhibit tauopathy, yet the molecular drivers of tau aggregation leading to synaptic dysfunction remain poorly understood. Here, we investigated whether Phospholipase D1 (PLD1, a lipid signaling enzyme), implicated in Alzheimers disease (AD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), contributes to tau pathology dependent synaptic deficits in FTD. Postmortem temporal (BA38) and frontal (BA9) cortices from clinically diagnosed FTD and age-matched control subjects were analyzed using fluorescence-assisted single synaptosome long-term potentiation (FASS-LTP), immunofluorescence, proximity ligation assays (PLA), and PLD1-interactome proteomics. FASS-LTP revealed markedly reduced glutamatergic potentiation in BA38 and BA9 crude synaptoneurosomes from FTD brains compared to controls. Western blotting demonstrated elevated PLD1 expression in both crude synaptoneurosomal and cytosolic fractions from FTD subjects in BA38, but not BA9. Bielschowsky staining confirmed increased Pick body burden in FTD temporal cortex. Immunofluorescence and PLA showed robust PLD1 co-localization with total tau (HT7), hyperphosphorylated tau (AT8), and acetylated tau oligomers (TOMA2), indicating a strong spatial association between PLD1 and pathological tau species. PLD1 also exhibited enhanced co-localization with astrocytic GFAP and synaptic markers (PSD95, Nrx1{beta}), suggesting compartmentalized involvement in glial and synaptic remodeling. Proteomic profiling of PLD1-associated complexes revealed compartment-specific alterations with cytosolic fractions enriched for metabolic enzymes, stress-response proteins, and GFAP, while crude synaptoneurosomal fractions showed depletion of presynaptic scaffolds, vesicle-trafficking regulators, and proteostasis components. Cross-compartment integration indicated that over one-third of proteins were redistributed from synapses to cytosol, consistent with trafficking and degradative impairments. Gene Ontology analysis highlighted lipid metabolism, astrocyte activation, and proteasome dysfunction as dominant pathways. Collectively, these findings identify PLD1 as a critical mediator of synaptic dysfunction and tau pathology in FTD, acting through astroglial activation and disrupting synaptic proteostasis. This study provides the human clinical relevance towards PLD1 attenuation as a therapeutic target for FTD and related tauopathies to mitigate tau-driven neurodegeneration and restore synaptic integrity.

">Baicalin ameliorates behavioral and physiological deficits in Gtf2i-duplication mice and modulates synaptic activity in 7q11.23 Duplication Syndrome patient-derived neurons</a></h4>

              
                7q11.23 Duplication Syndrome (7Dup) is a type of syndromic autism spectrum disorder caused by duplication of a typically 1.5-1.8 Mb segment in section q11.23 of chromosome 7, including 25-27 genes. Previous work has highlighted the GTF2I gene as playing a major role in the phenotype of 7Dup patients. Accordingly, mice with Gtf2i duplication (Gtf2i+/dup) are commonly used as an animal model of 7Dup. We previously reported deficits in several behavioral and physiological modalities, which were associated with Gtf2i dosage in mice conducting a battery of social discrimination tests. Here, we report the effect of treating Gtf2i+/dup mice with Baicalin, a naturally occurring flavonoid added to the mice's drinking water (0.15 mg/ml), on these deficits. We found that Baicalin treatment ameliorated the higher surface temperature observed in Gtf2i+/dup males and the lower tail temperature observed in Gtf2i+/dup females during the social behavior tests. It also prevented the increased defecation rate exhibited by Gtf2i+/dup mice during the social preference test. We further analyzed the effect of Baicalin treatment on cortical neurons differentiated from 7Dup patient-derived IPSCs. Using whole cell patch clamp and calcium imaging, we found an increased rate of excitatory postsynaptic currents in Baicalin-treated cells, without a change in their firing rate, indicating a stronger synaptic activity in the Baicalin-treated cells. Altogether, our results reveal that Baicalin administration alleviates some of the behavioral and physiological effects of Gtf2i duplication in mice, and affects neuronal activity in cultured 7Dup human neurons. Thus, Baicalin administration has the potential to serve as a treatment for 7Dup patients.

">An adaptive gain model for predicting auditory brain activity in mice outperforms standard methods for predicting cortical speech tracking in human EEG</a></h4>

              
                Human brain activity tracks slow fluctuations in continuous sound, including speech, and modelling this relationship provides insight into how the brain encodes naturalistic auditory input. Traditional approaches to modelling the tracking of speech in the brain with linear regression often use the amplitude envelope of the stimulus as a regressor, implicitly assuming that neural responses scale linearly with sound intensity. However, previous studies of central auditory processing in both animals and humans have shown that adaptive mechanisms adjust auditory responses based on recent sound history. Here, we show that a simple nonlinear transformation of the stimulus envelope, derived from studies of mouse auditory thalamic responses to temporally varying sounds, significantly improves modelling of human cortical speech tracking. This Adaptive Gain transformation essentially normalizes sound level by its recent context. Improvements in modelling of cortical speech tracking using the Adaptive Gain representation are robust across experiments, participant groups, and languages, indicating that short-timescale adaptation to recent sound level is a general feature of auditory processing. We further show that the optimal adaptation time constant for human cortical responses to continuous speech is approximately 50-100 ms, longer than previously observed for auditory thalamic responses to temporally varying sounds in mice. In summary, the Adaptive Gain transformation is a mathematically simple alternative to the standard envelope representation that captures dynamic adaptation in auditory processing and reliably improves prediction of human cortical EEG signals during listening to continuous speech.

">Noise Decorrelation as a Hypothetical Mechanism for Phase-Specific Neurometabolic Outcomes in HIV Infection: A Computational Framework</a></h4>

              
                Despite direct neurotoxic assault and cytokine storm during acute HIV infection, over 90% of individuals maintain normal neurocognitive function with preserved N-acetylaspartate (NAA) - a clinical paradox that has resisted mechanistic explanation for 35 years. Here we propose that environmental noise correlation length (xi) may distinguish protected from vulnerable neurometabolic states. Using hierarchical Bayesian inference on magnetic resonance spectroscopy data (13 group-level observations aggregating approximately 220 patients across 4 independent studies), we find the data are consistent with shorter noise correlation during acute infection (xi_acute = 0.425 +/- 0.065 nm) compared to chronic infection (xi_chronic = 0.790 +/- 0.065 nm), with non-overlapping 95% highest density intervals. The inferred protection exponent beta_xi = 2.33 +/- 0.51 (95% HDI: 1.49-3.26) suggests superlinear scaling of metabolic protection with decreasing correlation length. Independent validation via enzyme kinetics modeling yields concordant results (protection ratio = 1.28 +/- 0.17). These computational findings support the feasibility of noise-mediated neuroprotection but do not constitute empirical proof. The phase-specific and regionally structured modulation observed is consistent with a conserved strategy for maintaining neuronal metabolic integrity during acute inflammatory stress.

">Sympathetic Control of Sensory Neuron Fate and Function</a></h4>

              
                Sensory neurons in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) serve as conduits for transmitting peripheral stimuli to the central nervous system, playing an essential role in sensory perception and coordinated movement. This study reveals that sympathetic innervation is critical for these neurons' survival and functional integrity. Using a surgical microsympathectomy model in mice, we found that targeted sympathetic denervation of the lumbar DRGs triggered robust neuronal apoptosis, peaking four days post-surgery. This cellular loss is evidenced by reduced spinal projections, decreased nerve density in the skin, and impaired sensory and motor functions. We further identified norepinephrine (NE) as a vital neuroprotective agent; continuous NE supplementation effectively prevented cell death. Additionally, macrophage activation following denervation proved protective, as macrophage depletion exacerbated neuronal loss. It is suggested that the loss of sympathetic input disrupted mitochondrial homeostasis, releasing Smac/DIABLO, activating Caspase-3, and leading to cell death. These findings highlight the sympathetic nervous system's novel role in maintaining sensory neuron viability through tonic adrenergic support.

">Stimulus-Driven Thermodynamic Shifts and Geometric Reorganization in Mouse Primary Visual Cortex</a></h4>

              
                Efficient coding is essential for sensory systems to extract meaningful information from the environment. Here, we investigate how stimulus-driven thermodynamic shifts and geometric reorganization enable efficient population coding. Using wide-field calcium imaging, we simultaneously recorded neuronal activity across the entire mouse V1 under the presentation of structured stimuli and characterized neural dynamics spanning microscale neuronal connectivity, mesoscale thermodynamic states, and macroscale manifold geometry. We found that stimulus presentation reorganized neuronal couplings into increasingly modular subnetworks, driving a shift from near-critical dynamics toward a more ordered regime. This shift coincided with a compression of neural population activity onto low-dimensional manifolds aligned with stimulus features, thereby enabling efficient coding. Furthermore, mathematical derivations and in silico perturbation experiments confirmed that selective modulations of neuronal connectivity altered both critical temperature and manifold geometry, establishing a causal link from neuronal couplings to efficient coding. Collectively, our findings suggest a mechanistic bridge between statistical physics and neural geometry, providing new theoretical insights into how neural networks dynamically transition into more stable and efficient coding states in response to the environment.

">Evaluation of Significance of SERPINA3 and SPP1 in Driving Glioma Progression Through Dysregulation of Brain Inflammatory Pathway</a></h4>

              
                Glioma is a highly aggressive malignancy with a poor prognosis, particularly in grade IV glioblastoma. The monitoring of disease progression remains challenging due to high heterogeneity in the tumour and a lack of progressive markers to keep track of the tumour progression. This scarcity of good progressive biomarkers has led us to search for better options. SERPINA3 and SPP1 were investigated as potential dual biomarkers reflecting tumour microenvironment and enabling assessment of progression. In silico analysis was conducted, where correlation analysis was performed to evaluate the cell-type specificity of SERPINA3 in astrocytes and SPP1 in microglial cells, with comparisons across other neural populations in both low-grade glioma and glioblastoma. Pan-cancer expression analysis was conducted to determine whether these biomarkers remain significantly elevated in glioma relative to other malignancies, including hepatocellular carcinoma, given their hepatic origin. Alzheimer s disease datasets were analysed to verify the relevance in neurodegenerative diseases. The in silico analysis revealed that SERPINA3 and SPP1 show astrocytic and microglial specificity, respectively, and exhibit their highest expression levels in glioma across cancers. Coexpression analysis further identified enrichment of immunoregulatory pathways alongside upregulated oxidative stress associated markers, highlighting the functional relevance of these biomarkers within the glioma microenvironment.

                <p>by Abhisha Thayambath, Julio M. Belmonte</p>

Planar cell polarity (PCP) is an important patterning mechanism in both vertebrates and invertebrates by which cells coherently polarize along the apical surface of the epithelium. This patterning mechanism acts upstream of many developmental processes, such as oriented growth, division, cell movements and orientation of body hairs. While various models have been proposed to explain PCP patterning, all rely on persistent global cues/gradients to obtain global orientation of large tissues. However, recent experimental work has shown that this process can happen independently of such global cues, challenging the current paradigm. In this work, we developed a new model for PCP using the Cellular Potts modelling framework to investigate the conditions under which global tissue orientation can be achieved without a tissue spanning morphogen. We found that a combination of a local boundary signal, a small initial tissue size and uniform proliferation can effectively establish long-range polarity without the need for global cues. We also investigated the impact of cell division planes and growth rates on final patterning. Finally, we compared the cell-autonomous and cell non-autonomous versions of our PCP model, as found in flies and mice, and found that the latter offers more robust patterning outcomes in the absence of gradients.

Arbor is a software library designed for efficient simulation of large-scale networks of biological neurons with detailed morphological structures. It combines customizable neuronal and synaptic mechanisms with high-performance computing, supporting multi-core CPU and GPU systems.
In humans and other animals, synaptic plasticity processes play a vital role in cognitive functions, including learning and memory. Recent studies have shown that intracellular molecular processes in dendrites significantly influence single-neuron dynamics. However, for understanding how the complex interplay between dendrites and synaptic processes influences network dynamics, computational modeling is required.
To enable the modeling of large-scale networks of morphologically detailed neurons with diverse plasticity processes, we have extended the Arbor library to support simulations of a large variety of spike-driven plasticity paradigms. To showcase the features of the extended framework, we present examples of computational models, beginning with single-synapse dynamics, progressing to multi-synapse rules, and finally scaling up to large recurrent networks. While cross-validating our implementations by comparison with other simulators, we show that Arbor allows simulating plastic networks of multi-compartment neurons at nearly no additional cost in runtime compared to point-neuron simulations. In addition, we demonstrate that Arbor is highly efficient in terms of runtime and memory use as compared to other simulators.
Using the extended framework, as an example, we investigate the impact of dendritic structures on network dynamics across a timescale of several hours, finding a relation between the length of dendritic trees and the ability of the network to efficiently store information.
By our extension of Arbor, we aim to provide a valuable tool that will support future studies on the impact of synaptic plasticity, especially, in conjunction with neuronal morphology, in large networks.

                <p>by David Angulo-Garcia, Alessandro Torcini</p>

Recurrent neural networks with balanced excitation and inhibition exhibit irregular asynchronous dynamics, which is fundamental for cortical computations. Classical balance mechanisms require strong external input currents in order to sustain finite firing rates, thus raising concerns about their biological plausibility. Here, we investigate an alternative mechanism based on short-term synaptic depression (STD) acting on excitatory-excitatory synapses, which dynamically balances the network activity without the need of strong external driving. Using accurate numerical simulations and theoretical investigations we characterize the dynamics of a densely connected recurrent network made up of <i>N</i> rate-neuron models encompassing STD. Depending on the synaptic strength <i>J</i><sub>0</sub>, the network exhibits two distinct regimes: at sufficiently small <i>J</i><sub>0</sub>, it converges to a homogeneous fixed point, while for sufficiently large <i>J</i><sub>0</sub> <i>Rate Chaos</i> emerges. For finite networks, we observe a <i>transition region</i> at intermediate <i>J</i><sub>0</sub>, where the system passes from the homogeneous fixed point to Rate Chaos following several different routes to chaos depending on the network realization. Furthermore, we show that the width of the transition region shrinks for increasing <i>N</i> and eventually vanishes in the thermodynamic limit (N→∞). The characterization of the Rate Chaos regime has been performed by means of Dynamical Mean Field (DMF) approaches. This analysis has revealed on one side that the novel balancing mechanism is able to sustain finite irregular activity even in the thermodynamic limit, and on the other side that balancing occurs via dynamic cancellation of the correlations in the synaptic input currents induced by the dense connectivity. Our findings show that STD provides an intrinsic self-regulating mechanism for balanced networks, sustaining irregular yet stable activity without the need of biologically unrealistic strong external currents. This work extends the balanced network paradigm, offering insights into how cortical circuits could maintain robust dynamics via synaptic adaptation.

Synapses are the connections that transform neurons from simple electrically charged cells into complex circuits that support perception, cognition and action. Recent advances in single-punctum synapse mapping in mice make studying synapse diversity and differential expression possible. How do diverse synapses relate to the spatial patterning of whole-brain dynamics? Here we map the spatial distribution of multiple synapse types to >6 000 time-series features from fMRI recordings in awake mice to understand the comprehensive dynamical phenotype of multiple synapse types. We find that specific synapse types are associated with specific features of haemodynamics, including high-amplitude events and signal stationarity. These variations in synapse types and dynamics are associated with the structural and functional network embedding of brain regions. Finally, using two additional fMRI datasets in anaesthetized mice, we show that synaptic protein lifetime reflects differential synaptic engagement across behavioural states. Collectively, this work suggests that the spatial organization of microscale synapse types may shape whole-brain dynamics.

Little is known about how sex and diet interact at the level of chromatin organization. A comprehensive analysis of diet-induced chromatin dynamics can reveal how the liver mounts a rapid adaptive response to environmental cues and uncover mechanisms underlying sex differences. Here, we employed an integrative strategy to construct a nucleosome accessibility atlas of the mouse liver under different dietary conditions. Stringent analysis revealed a largely preserved hepatic chromatin landscape across feeding states, with sex being the critical factor driving changes in chromatin accessibility. Notably, lipid-rich diet preferentially enriched CCAAT-binding motifs in females, while nutrient-sensing nuclear receptor motifs were more strongly enriched in males. Furthermore, using the Four Core Genotypes model (XX ovaries / XY testes / XX testes / XY ovaries), we disentangled the effects of gonadal and chromosomal sex on diet-induced gene regulation. By leveraging this framework with multiple mouse models and molecular approaches, we identified a suppressive role of testosterone in regulating the sex-dimorphic GWAS gene <i>PNPLA3</i>. Overall, we establish an unbiased transcriptomic resource that revealed chromatin dynamics and identified gene clusters associated with distinct sex-related factors.

Systematic identification of global epileptic reorganization and critical seizure-controlling circuits is essential for comprehending epilepsy pathophysiology and for developing network-guided targeted therapies. The piriform cortex (PC) is a recognized epileptogenic region, but how its hyperactivity reshapes whole-brain dynamics and which specific circuits mediate seizures remains unclear. Through multimodal integration of optogenetics, fMRI, electrophysiology, Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging, neural tracing, and circuit-specific manipulation, we mapped the whole-brain dynamics following optogenetic stimulation of PC and identified the fundamental circuit governing piriform seizures. We observed pronounced generalized seizures in mice via repeated optogenetic stimulation of PC <i>Vglut1</i>+ neurons. Optogenetic kindling of PC<sup>Vglut1</sup> induced widespread blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal hyperactivation and resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) alterations, notably sustained hyperactivation in the lateral entorhinal cortex (Lent) and enhanced PC-Lent rsFC. Chronic elimination of Lent neurons receiving PC projections significantly decreased the Lent-dentate gyrus (DG) rsFC. Disruption of the PC-Lent or Lent-DG circuit effectively suppressed PC-stimulation-triggered seizures and brain-wide hyperactivation. Our findings demonstrate the dominant role of the PC<sup>Vglut1</sup>-Lent<sup>glut</sup>-DG circuit in mediating piriform seizures and driving their resulting brain-wide functional reorganization, offering new insights for targeted epilepsy treatments.

                <p>by Pil Jung Kang, Hana Mazak, Sung Sik Lee, Hay-Oak Park</p>

Cdc42, a small GTPase essential for cell polarity, often becomes hyperactive with age and promotes senescence in yeast and animal cells. Yet, the mechanisms driving its age-related upregulation remain unclear. Here, we show that in budding yeast, Cdc42 accumulates over successive cell divisions and that reducing its levels extends life span. Using microfluidics-assisted live-cell imaging and genetic analysis, we found that Cdc42 is distributed unevenly between mother and daughter cells during division. Daughter cells inherit lower Cdc42 levels, which likely help them remain young. This asymmetric distribution depends on Cdc42’s association with and/or release from endomembranes and likely involves Ydj1, a farnesylated Hsp40/DnaJ chaperone anchored to the endoplasmic reticulum. Ydj1 interacts with Cdc42, promoting its stability and proper partitioning during cell division. We propose that ER-bound Ydj1 facilitates the asymmetric distribution of Cdc42, thereby restricting aging to mother cells.

                <h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>Changes in the gut microbiome may be involved in the pathogenesis and progression of Parkinson's disease (PD). This randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded study aimed to assess the effects of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) on the manifestation of the motor symptoms of PD (The Movement Disorders Society - Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale Part III [MDS-UPDRS III]) over a 12 month long observation and non-motor symptoms as secondary objectives: the Movement Disorders Society-Non-Motor Rating Scale; EuroQol-5 Dimension; PD Quality-of-Life Questionnaire; Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA); UPDRS I, II, and IV; Gastrointestinal Dysfunction Scale for PD; modified Constipation Assessment Scale; and levodopa equivalent dose.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>The patients were randomly assigned to receive either fecal microbiota (Mbiotix, Human Biome Institute) or placebo (auto-fecal microbiota, prepared from the patient's stool) in a 1:1 ratio. The fecal microbiota transplantation was performed via colonoscopy. Assessments were performed before and after 12 months for the MoCA and at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months for the other scales. Intention-to-treat analysis was performed using a multivariable mixed regression model.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Of the 59 patients included, 28 were randomly assigned to the Mbiotix group (median age = 65 years; 15 male patients) and 31 to the placebo group (median age = 63 years; 14 male patients). No significant differences were observed in the MDS-UPDRS III “OFF” state score at 12 months between groups (1.50 points, 95% confidence interval [CI] = −4.28 to 7.28, <i>p</i> = 1.00), however, some non-motor symptoms improved in different study timepoints.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>A single FMT does not influence motor symptoms manifestation in patients with PD but could improve non-motor functioning via gut-brain axis.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-244/v1?src=rss">Why COVID-19 vaccination cannot be ruled out as an explanation for all-cause excess mortality in the pandemic’s aftermath: A population-level study of over 3,000 US counties with over 320 million people [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Research has shown consistent excess all-cause mortality since the COVID-19 pandemic, but without a clear explanation. In parallel, research has shown side effects from COVID-19 vaccination and increased deaths. Therefore, one cannot rule out COVID-19 vaccination as an explanation for the excess mortality. Methods US county-level data were used to model 2022 and 2023 all-cause excess mortality as dependent variables and per capita COVID-19 vaccine uptake at the end of 2021 and 2022 as independent variables. I included lagged dependent variables as controls. The data include over 3,000 US counties. Results A one-unit increase in per-capita vaccination uptake was significantly associated with a .042 (95% CI: .030–.055) increase in 2022 all-cause excess mortality, and significantly associated with a.030 (95% CI: .024–.036) increase in 2023. Conclusions COVID-19 vaccine uptake was significantly positively associated with all-cause excess mortality. Given the time asymmetry between vaccine uptake and all-cause excess mortality, the inclusion of lagged dependent variables as controls, and the large number of observations, the study has strong internal validity.

     alt="Purkinje Cells as Gatekeepers of Seizure Susceptibility: Insights From Optogenetics"/>
<p>Optogenetic manipulation of Purkinje cells in zebrafish revealed that their inhibition increases seizure-like activity and reduces locomotion, whereas activation transiently enhances movement and suppresses seizures under hyperexcitable conditions. These findings identify cerebellar Purkinje cells as key modulators of both motor coordination and epileptic network dynamics.</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Purkinje cells (PCs), the principal output neurons of the cerebellar cortex, are classically implicated in motor coordination via inhibitory projections to the deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN). Emerging evidence suggests their influence extends to seizure susceptibility, yet the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we investigated the functional role of PCs in locomotion and seizure-like activity in zebrafish larvae. Using the UAS/Gal4 system, we selectively expressed light-sensitive ion channels in PCs: Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) to activate, and Anion ChannelRhodopsin-2 (ACR2) to inhibit neuronal activity. Behavioral assays at 5 days post-fertilization assessed locomotor output, while local field potential recordings monitored seizure-like events under baseline conditions and following administration of a proconvulsant agent. Optogenetic activation of PCs transiently increased locomotion and significantly reduced the duration and power of seizure-like events under hyperexcitable conditions, without affecting baseline activity. Conversely, inhibition of PCs was sufficient to induce seizure-like activity even in the absence of convulsant stimuli. These results reveal a dual role for PCs: they suppress pathological hyperexcitability during proconvulsant states, yet their inhibition can trigger seizures. This work highlights the cerebellum as a critical regulator of excitation-inhibition balance, linking motor control and seizure susceptibility, and suggests that cerebellar dysfunction may contribute to both motor and epileptic phenotypes observed in neurodegenerative disorders.</p>

                Background Artificial intelligence (AI) offers significant opportunities to improve the field of implementation science by supporting key activities such as evidence synthesis, contextual analysis, and decision-making to promote the adoption and sustainability of evidence-based practices. This living scoping review aims to: (1) map applications of AI in implementation research and practice; (2) identify evaluation approaches, reported outcomes, and potential risks; and (3) synthesize reported research gaps and opportunities for advancing the use of AI in implementation science. Methods This scoping review will follow the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) methodology and the Cochrane guidance for living systematic reviews. A living scoping review is warranted to keep up with the rapid changes in AI and its growing use in implementation science. We will include empirical studies, systematic reviews, grey literature, and policy documents that describe or evaluate applications of AI to support implementation science across the steps of the Knowledge-to-Action (KTA) Model. AI methods and models of interest include machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing, large language models, and related technologies and approaches. A search strategy will be applied to bibliographic databases (MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, IEEE Xplore, Web of Science), relevant journals, conference proceedings, and preprint servers. Two reviewers will independently screen studies and extract data on AI characteristics, specific implementation task according to the KTA Model, evaluation methods, outcome domains, risks, and research gaps. Extracted data will be analyzed descriptively and synthesized narratively using a mapping approach aligned with the KTA Model. Discussion This living review will consolidate the evidence base on how AI is applied across the spectrum of implementation science. It will inform researchers, policymakers, and practitioners seeking to harness AI to improve the adoption, scale-up, and sustainability of evidence-based interventions, while identifying areas for methodological advancement and risk mitigation.

<p>Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) and punicalagin (PU) alleviate Alzheimer's disease–like pathology in adult zebrafish by reducing Aβ aggregation, neuroinflammation, and amyloidogenic signaling while promoting neuronal recovery and neurogenesis. These molecular and cellular effects translate into improved anxiety- and aggression-like behaviors, supporting EGCG + PU as a potential neuroprotective therapeutic approach.</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by cognitive decline, memory impairment, and behavioral alterations. The pathogenesis of AD involves the accumulation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques and the hyperphosphorylated tau proteins, which disrupt neuronal function and trigger neuroinflammation. This study explores the therapeutic potential of epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) and punicalagin (PU) in mitigating Aβ-induced toxicity using an adult zebrafish model of AD. Our results demonstrate that the EGCG + PU combination significantly reduces Aβ accumulation, protects against cellular damage, suppresses acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, and normalizes the expression of amyloidogenic and AD-related genes. Additionally, EGCG + PU treatment alleviates neuroinflammation by suppressing glial activation, including reductions in L-plastin and proinflammatory cytokine expression, while promoting neuronal recovery through mechanisms of neurogenesis and neuroprotection. Notably, the combination treatment restored neuronal density and improved behavioral outcomes by alleviating anxiety- and aggression-like behaviors associated with Aβ toxicity. These results underscore the synergistic neuroprotective effects of EGCG + PU, highlighting their potential as a novel therapeutic approach for mitigating the pathological, behavioral, and inflammatory aspects of AD.</p>

                Background In the context of accelerating digital transformation, the alignment between digital transformation initiatives and sustainable supply chain finance has become an important issue for firms seeking to improve operational coordination and financial efficiency. This alignment, however, is influenced not only by technological adoption but also by organizational and contextual conditions such as governance structures, strategic orientation, and resource availability. Existing studies have not sufficiently examined how these contextual factors jointly shape the integration of digital transformation and supply chain finance. Methods This study adopts a mixed-methods approach that combines quantitative analysis based on survey data with qualitative insights. A multidimensional analytical framework is developed to examine the contextual factors affecting the integration between digital transformation and sustainable supply chain finance. The framework includes leadership vision, strategic orientation, information-sharing mechanisms, supplier collaboration, organizational resources, process readiness, and access to financial and credit resources. Results The findings indicate that these contextual factors collectively influence the degree of alignment between digital transformation initiatives and sustainable supply chain financial models. Leadership vision and clear strategic orientation play a central role in guiding coordination among supply chain actors. Effective information-sharing mechanisms support collaboration and transparency across partners. In addition, organizational resources and process readiness significantly affect the feasibility and effectiveness of implementing digital solutions linked to supply chain finance. Access to financial and credit resources also conditions firms’ ability to operationalize such initiatives. Conclusion The study provides empirical evidence on how organizational and contextual conditions shape the integration of digital transformation with sustainable supply chain finance. The results suggest that alignment depends on a combination of strategic direction, internal capabilities, and coordination mechanisms, offering useful implications for firms seeking to design digital transformation initiatives that are consistent with their organizational capacities and operational contexts.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-241/v1?src=rss">Malware Detection Using RNA Encoding and Convolutional Neural Networks on the Malicious Network Dataset [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background The detection of malware in network traffic remains a critical cybersecurity challenge. Traditional signature-based intrusion detection demonstrates a high level of familiarity with issues that have been recorded in the database; but show significantly lower effectiveness when it comes to polymorphic or zero-day attacks. Conversely, anomaly-based approaches are also endowed with the ability to detect new incursions, but often have a high false-positive rate. Methods This study proposes a combined malware-detection framework which makes use of RNA encoding network-flow attributes alongside Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classifiers. The framework has three functionalities: a Signature-CNN, which is trained on RNA-encoded representation of known malicious flows; an Anomaly-CNN, which is developed to distinguish between benign and malicious traffic without any signature prior knowledge; and a Hybrid-CNN, which combines both paradigms in a two-stage detection pipeline. Results Experiments conducted on the Malicious Network Dataset show that the Signature-CNN achieves 91% accuracy with strong precision on known threats, the Anomaly-CNN achieves 93% detection rate on unknown malware, and the Hybrid-CNN achieves the best overall performance with 95% detection rate and 94.5% F1 score. Conclusions The results demonstrate that RNA encoding combined with CNN classifiers offers a robust and scalable solution for malware detection in networked environments.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-240/v1?src=rss">Smart School Attendance: Virtual Solution to Optimize Registration and Parental Monitoring in Secondary Level Schools in Imperial, Cañete. [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background School attendance monitoring is an essential component of educational management in public schools, especially at secondary schools. In Peruvian rural regions such as Imperial-Cañete, attendance is registered manually, generating inefficiencies, human error, and lack of immediate traceability. This situation is amplified by digital divide: only 18.5% of rural houses have stable internet access, limiting the implementation platforms that depend on constant connectivity. Methods The study was realized using agile methodology (Scrum) with five phases to develop a web-based attendance system. Phase one involved analyzing requirements for the attendance system based on needs of school employees and parents. Phase two involved prioritizing requirements and defining tasks with deadlines. Implementation used modern web technologies (Next.js, Node.js, WebSockets) and hybrid data architecture (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, Google Drive) to ensure efficient and reliable operation. Finally, after completing previous phases, developed software was implemented and additional testing to ensure correct functionality. Results After implementation of the web platform, we identified significant improvements: complete automation of attendance registration using QR codes, which drastically reduced registration times and errors associated with manual methods; successful implementation of real-time parental monitoring, allowing parents access to their children’s daily and monthly attendance registers; integration of automatic email notifications to tutors and administrators in cases of consecutive absences or tardiness; and differentiated role-based access for school employees (assistants, teachers, and directors). The use of information technology ensured operational consistency even under poor connectivity conditions through local caching (IndexedDB) and synchronization. Conclusions This research focuses specifically on optimizing attendance management in rural secondary schools using information technology. The study is characterized by its personalized web platform designed to support the specific needs of educational institutions with limited connections. The results demonstrated the efficiency of this robust approach and its positive impact on school attendance management.

                Goode et al. show that prodynorphin (Pdyn)-expressing neurons of the dorsolateral septum (DLS) receive substantial dorsal hippocampal (DHPC) input and inhibit lateral hypothalamic (LHA) GABAergic neurons. DLS(Pdyn) activity is changed by training for food, is context-sensitive, and its disruption by optogenetics (or Pdyn deletion) in DHPC-DLS(Pdyn)-LHA circuits impairs conditioned feeding.

                Kandror et al. present an innovative framework redefining human spinal cord cellular diversity through epigenetic configuration and spatial organization. They identify unseen enhancer classes, show cell-type-specific reconfiguration of gene regulatory networks along the rostrocaudal axis, and uncover cellular networks mediated by discrete paracrine signaling, challenging conventional definitions of cellular state.
