	<p>The human brain is constantly active, even at rest. Alpha coherence is an electroencephalography (EEG) rhythm that regulates functional connectivity between different brain regions. However, the relationships between resting-state alpha coherence and N2/P3 components associated with response inhibition and cognitive processes have not been investigated in addictive disorders. The present study investigated the relationships between alpha coherence during the resting state and N2/P3 components of event-related potentials during the Go/Nogo task in healthy controls (HCs) and patients with Internet gaming disorder (IGD). A total of 64 young adults (HC: n = 31; IGD: n = 33) participated in this study. Alpha coherence values at left fronto-central and bilateral centro-temporal electrode sites were significantly correlated with P3 latency in HCs, whereas inverse correlations were observed in patients with IGD. Furthermore, significant differences were observed in the correlation values between the groups. Our results suggest that patients with IGD lack dynamic interactions of functional connectivity between the fronto-centro-temporal regions during the resting state and the event-related potential (ERP) index during cognitive tasks. The findings of this study may have important implications for understanding the neurophysiological mechanisms linking resting-state EEG and task-related ERPs underlying IGD.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Previous research has indicated that reward-paired cues can enhance disadvantageous risky choice in both humans and rodents. Systemic administration of a serotonin 2C receptor antagonist can attenuate this cue-induced risk preference in rats. However, the neurocognitive mechanisms mediating this effect are currently unknown. We therefore assessed whether the serotonin 2C receptor antagonist RS 102221 is able to attenuate cue-enhanced risk preference via its actions in the lateral orbitofrontal cortex (lOFC) or prelimbic (PrL) area of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). A total of 32 male Long&ndash;Evans rats were trained on the cued version of the rat gambling task (rGT), a rodent analog of the human Iowa gambling task, and bilateral guide cannulae were implanted into the lOFC or PrL. Intra-lOFC infusions of the 5-HT<SUB>2C</SUB> antagonist RS 102221 reduced risky choice in animals that showed a preference for the risky options of the rGT at baseline. This effect was not observed in optimal decision-makers, nor those that received infusions targeting the PrL. Given prior data showing that 5-HT<SUB>2C</SUB> antagonists also improve reversal learning through the same neural locus, we hypothesized that reward-concurrent cues may amplify risky decision-making through cognitive inflexibility. We therefore devalued the sugar pellet rewards used in the cued rGT (crGT) through satiation and observed that decision-making patterns did not shift unless animals also received intra-lOFC RS 102221. Collectively, these data suggest that the lOFC is one critical site through which reward-concurrent cues promote risky choice patterns that are insensitive to reinforcer devaluation, and that 5-HT<SUB>2C</SUB> antagonism may optimize choice by facilitating exploration.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Excitatory amino acid transporters (EAATs) remove glutamate from the synaptic cleft. In the retina, EAAT1 and EAAT2 are considered the major glutamate transporters. However, it has not yet been possible to determine how EAAT5 shapes the retinal light responses because of the lack of a selective EAAT5 blocker or EAAT5 knock-out (KO) animal model. In this study, EAAT5 was found to be expressed in a punctate manner close to release sites of glutamatergic synapses in the mouse retina. Light responses from retinae of wild-type (WT) and of a newly generated model with a targeted deletion of EAAT5 (EAAT5<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup>) were recorded <I>in vitro</I> using multielectrode arrays (MEAs). Flicker resolution was considerably lower in EAAT5<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> retinae than in WT retinae. The close proximity to the glutamate release site makes EAAT5 an ideal tool to improve temporal information processing in the retina by controlling information transfer at glutamatergic synapses.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">GCAEMDA: Predicting miRNA-disease associations via graph convolutional autoencoder</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Lei Li, Yu-Tian Wang, Cun-Mei Ji, Chun-Hou Zheng, Jian-Cheng Ni, Yan-Sen Su</p>

microRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs related to a number of complicated biological processes. A growing body of studies have suggested that miRNAs are closely associated with many human diseases. It is meaningful to consider disease-related miRNAs as potential biomarkers, which could greatly contribute to understanding the mechanisms of complex diseases and benefit the prevention, detection, diagnosis and treatment of extraordinary diseases. In this study, we presented a novel model named Graph Convolutional Autoencoder for miRNA-Disease Association Prediction (GCAEMDA). In the proposed model, we utilized miRNA-miRNA similarities, disease-disease similarities and verified miRNA-disease associations to construct a heterogeneous network, which is applied to learn the embeddings of miRNAs and diseases. In addition, we separately constructed miRNA-based and disease-based sub-networks. Combining the embeddings of miRNAs and diseases, graph convolution autoencoder (GCAE) is utilized to calculate association scores of miRNA-disease on two sub-networks, respectively. Furthermore, we obtained final prediction scores between miRNAs and diseases by adopting an average ensemble way to integrate the prediction scores from two types of subnetworks. To indicate the accuracy of GCAEMDA, we applied different cross validation methods to evaluate our model whose performance were better than the state-of-the-art models. Case studies on a common human diseases were also implemented to prove the effectiveness of GCAEMDA. The results demonstrated that GCAEMDA were beneficial to infer potential associations of miRNA-disease.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Noise increases the correspondence between artificial and human vision</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jessica A. F. Thompson</p>

The best performing computer vision systems are based on deep neural networks (DNNs). A study in this issue of PLOS Biology shows that DNNs trained on noisy stimuli are better than standard DNNs at mirroring both human behavioral and neural visual responses.

This Primer explores the implications of a recent PLOS Biology study, arguing that noise-robustness, a property of human vision that standard computer vision models fail to mimic, provides an opportunity to probe the neural mechanisms underlying visual object recognition and refine computational models of the ventral visual stream.

                Background: Most patients with COVID-19 experience mild illness which can be managed in a home environment. This study was done to assess the perception, awareness and practices regarding home-based management of COVID-19 among the general population in India. Methods: This cross-sectional study was done in May and June 2021. Data were collected using a Google Form. Results: Mean age of the 294 participants was 36.6 ± 12.1 years. Of these participants, 45 (15.3%) were diagnosed with COVID-19 anytime in the past. Among them, 37 (82.2%) underwent home-based management for COVID-19. Monitoring of body temperature and oxygen saturation was performed just once a day by 15.2% and 5.9% of COVID-19 patients respectively. Self-medication was practiced by 11 (29.7%) patients. Disposable face masks were worn by 23 (62.2%) patients beyond eight hours of continuous usage. The disposable type of face mask was not discarded despite becoming wet and cloth masks were worn by eight (21.6%) patients. Disposable gloves were only worn by 14 (37.8%) care providers of COVID-19 patients. As many as 10 (27%) patients were tested for COVID-19 after completion of home isolation. Awareness of all mild symptoms and signs of the disease were known to only 19 (6.5%) participants. Normal oxygen saturation in the blood was known to 40 (13.6%) participants. Just six (2%) participants were aware of the correct duration of home isolation in a symptomatic patient with COVID-19. The recommended duration of hand washing with soap and water was known to 102 (34.7%) participants. As many as 17.4% and 32.7% participants were not confident in using thermometer and pulse oximeter respectively. Conclusion: Practices, awareness and perception regarding certain essential measures in COVID-19 home management were found lacking among a number of participants. These need to be addressed by suitable training programs among the general population.

                Background: Unmarried women who experience unintended pregnancy tend to hide their pregnancy and not attend pregnancy care services. The study analyzed the effect of unintended pregnancy on antenatal care (ANC) visits among unmarried women in Indonesia. Methods: The study employed secondary data from the Indonesian Demographic and Health Survey (IDHS) 2017. This cross-sectional study involved unmarried women aged 15-49 years old who gave birth in the last five years. The 2017 IDHS used stratification and multistage random sampling, and the task obtained 508 respondents as samples. The variables analyzed included ANC visits, unintended pregnancy, residence, age, marital status, education, employment, wealth, and health insurance ownership. The study used the binary logistic regression test at the final stage. Results: The results show that unmarried women who had an unintended pregnancy were 0.588 times more likely than those who did not have an unintended pregnancy to have ANC visits ≥ four times (AOR 0.588; 95% CI 0.587-0.588). The analysis indicates that unmarried women who have an unintended pregnancy in Indonesia are less likely to complete ANC visits. Apart from unintended pregnancy, the study found seven other independent variables as significant determinants of ANC visit performance: type of residence, age group, marital status, education level, employment status, wealth status, and health insurance ownership. Conclusion: The study concluded that unmarried women who experienced an unintended pregnancy in Indonesia were less likely to complete ANC visits.

                Aortic to right ventricular fistula formation after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is a rare complication. We describe the first case of an aorto-RV fistula after TAVR, conservatively managed, in a patient with concomitant aortic stenosis and wild-type transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis. Given that the underlying pathology may have implications, transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis screening in patients undergoing TAVR is warranted.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Concomitant activation of GLI1 and Notch1 contributes to racial disparity of human triple negative breast cancer progression</a></h4>

              
                Mortality from triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is significantly higher in African American (AA) women compared to White American (WA) women emphasizing ethnicity as a major risk factor; however, the molecular determinants that drive aggressive progression of AA-TNBC remain elusive. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that AA-TNBC cells are inherently aggressive, exhibiting elevated growth, migration, and cancer stem-like phenotype compared to WA-TNBC cells. Meta-analysis of RNA-sequencing data of multiple AA- and WA-TNBC cell lines shows enrichment of GLI1 and Notch1 pathways in AA-TNBC cells. Enrichment of GLI1 and Notch1 pathway genes was observed in AA-TNBC. In line with this observation, analysis of TCGA dataset reveals a positive correlation between GLI1 and Notch1 in AA-TNBC and a negative correlation in WA-TNBC. Increased nuclear localization and interaction between GLI1 and Notch1 is observed in AA-TNBC cells. Of importance, inhibition of GLI1 and Notch1 synergistically improves the efficacy of chemotherapy in AA-TNBC cells. Combined treatment of AA-TNBC-derived tumors with GANT61, DAPT, and doxorubicin/carboplatin results in significant tumor regression, and tumor-dissociated cells show mitigated migration, invasion, mammosphere formation, and CD44<sup>+</sup>/CD24<sup>-</sup> population. Indeed, secondary tumors derived from triple-therapy-treated AA-TNBC tumors show diminished stem-like phenotype. Finally, we show that TNBC tumors from AA women express significantly higher level of GLI1 and Notch1 expression in comparison to TNBC tumors from WA women. This work sheds light on the racial disparity in TNBC, implicates the GLI1 and Notch1 axis as its functional mediators, and proposes a triple-combination therapy that can prove beneficial for AA-TNBC.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Combined effect of cell geometry and polarity domains determines the orientation of unequal division</a></h4>

              
                Cell division orientation is thought to result from a competition between cell geometry and polarity domains controlling the position of the mitotic spindle during mitosis. Depending on the level of cell shape anisotropy or the strength of the polarity domain, one dominates the other and determines the orientation of the spindle. Whether and how such competition is also at work to determine unequal cell division (UCD), producing daughter cells of different size, remains unclear. Here, we show that cell geometry and polarity domains cooperate, rather than compete, in positioning the cleavage plane during UCDs in early ascidian embryos. We found that the UCDs and their orientation at the ascidian third cleavage rely on the spindle tilting in an anisotropic cell shape, and cortical polarity domains exerting different effects on spindle astral microtubules. By systematically varying mitotic cell shape, we could modulate the effect of attractive and repulsive polarity domains and consequently generate predicted daughter cell size asymmetries and position. We therefore propose that the spindle position during UCD is set by the combined activities of cell geometry and polarity domains, where cell geometry modulates the effect of cortical polarity domain(s).

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The population genetics of collateral resistance and sensitivity</a></h4>

              
                Resistance mutations against one drug can elicit collateral sensitivity against other drugs. Multi-drug treatments exploiting such trade-offs can help slow down the evolution of resistance. However, if mutations with diverse collateral effects are available, a treated population may evolve either collateral sensitivity or collateral resistance. How to design treatments robust to such uncertainty is unclear. We show that many resistance mutations in Escherichia coli against various antibiotics indeed have diverse collateral effects. We propose to characterize such diversity with a joint distribution of fitness effects (JDFE) and develop a theory for describing and predicting collateral evolution based on simple statistics of the JDFE. We show how to robustly rank drug pairs to minimize the risk of collateral resistance and how to estimate JDFEs. In addition to practical applications, these results have implications for our understanding of evolution in variable environments.

                Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) are regarded as two ends of a pathogenetic spectrum, termed ALS-frontotemporal spectrum disorder (ALS-FTSD). However, it is currently difficult to predict where on the spectrum an individual will lie, especially for patients with C9orf72 hexanucleotide repeat expansions (HRE), a mutation associated with both ALS and FTD. It has been shown that both inflammation and protein misfolding influence aspects of ALS and ALS-FTSD disease pathogenesis, such as the manifestation or severity of motor or cognitive symptoms. Previous studies have highlighted markers which may influence C9orf72-associated disease presentation in a targeted fashion, though there has yet to be a systematic and quantitative assessment of common immunohistochemical markers to investigate the significance of these pathways in an unbiased manner. Here we report the first extensive digital pathological assessment with random forest modelling of pathological markers often used in neuropathology practice. This study profiles glial activation and protein misfolding in a cohort of deeply clinically profiled post-mortem tissue from patients with a C9orf72 HRE, who either met the criteria for a diagnosis of ALS or ALS-FTSD. We show that microglial immunohistochemical staining features, both morphological and spatial, are the best independent classifiers of disease status and that clinicopathological associations exist between microglial activation status and cognitive dysfunction in ALS-FTSD patients with C9orf72 HRE. Furthermore, we show that spatially resolved changes in FUS staining are also an accurate predictor of disease status, implying that liquid-liquid phase shift of this aggregation-prone RNA-binding protein may be important in ALS caused by a C9orf72 HRE. Our findings provide further support to the hypothesis of dysfunctional immune regulation and proteostasis in the pathogenesis of C9orf72 ALS and provide a framework for digital analysis of commonly used neuropathological stains as a tool to enrich our understanding of clinicopathological associations between cohorts.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neuronal activity-driven oligodendrogenesis in selected brain regions is required for episodic memories</a></h4>

              
                The formation of long-term episodic memories requires the activation of molecular mechanisms in several regions of the medial temporal lobe, including the hippocampus and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). The extent to which these regions engage distinct mechanisms and cell types to support memory formation is not well understood. Recent studies reported that oligodendrogenesis is essential for learning and long-term memory; however, whether these mechanisms are required only in selected brain regions is still unclear. Also still unknown are the temporal kinetics of engagement of learning-induced oligodendrogenesis and whether this oligodendrogenesis occurs in response to neuronal activity. Here we show that in rats and mice, episodic learning rapidly increases the oligodendrogenesis and myelin biogenesis transcripts olig2, myrf, mbp, and plp1, as well as oligodendrogenesis, in the ACC but not in the dorsal hippocampus (dHC). Region-specific knockdown and knockout of Myrf, a master regulator of oligodendrocyte maturation, revealed that oligodendrogenesis is required for memory formation in the ACC but not the dHC. Chemogenetic neuronal silencing in the ACC showed that neuronal activity is critical for learning-induced oligodendrogenesis. Hence, an activity-dependent increase in oligodendrogenesis in selected brain regions, specifically in the ACC but not dHC, is critical for the formation of episodic memories.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Benchmarking GE-BOLD, SE-BOLD, and SS-SI-VASO sequences for depth-dependent separation of feedforward and feedback signals in high-field MRI</a></h4>

              
                Recent advances in high-field fMRI have allowed differentiating feedforward and feedback information in the grey matter of the human brain. For continued progress in this endeavor, it is critical to understand how MRI data acquisition parameters impact the read-out of information from laminar response profiles. Here, we benchmarked three different MR-sequences at 7T - gradient-echo (GE), spin-echo (SE) and vascular space occupancy imaging (VASO) - in differentiating feedforward and feedback signals in human early visual cortex (V1). The experiment (N=4) consisted of two complementary tasks: a perception task that predominantly evokes feedforward signals and a working memory task that relies on feedback signals. In the perception task, participants saw flickering oriented gratings while detecting orthogonal color-changes. In the working memory task, participants memorized the precise orientation of a grating. We used multivariate pattern analysis to read out the perceived (feedforward) and memorized (feedback) grating orientation from neural signals across cortical depth. Analyses across all the MR-sequences revealed perception signals predominantly in the middle cortical compartment of area V1 and working memory signals in the deep compartment. Despite an overall consistency across sequences, SE-EPI was the only sequence where both feedforward and feedback information were differently pronounced across cortical depth in a statistically robust way. We therefore suggest that in the context of a typical cognitive neuroscience experiment as the one benchmarked here, SE-EPI may provide a favorable trade-off between spatial specificity and signal sensitivity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Detection of Motor-Evoked Potentials Below the Noise Floor: Rethinking the Motor Threshold</a></h4>

              
                Background: Motor-evoked potentials (MEP) are one of the most prominent responses to brain stimulation, such as supra-threshold transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and electrical stimulation. Understanding of the neurophysiology and the determination of the lowest stimulation strength that evokes responses requires the detection of even smaller responses, e.g., from single motor units. However, available detection and quantization methods suffer from a large noise floor. Objective: This paper develops a detection method that extracts MEPs hidden below the noise floor. With this method, we aim to estimate excitatory activations of the corticospinal pathways well below the conventional detection level. Methods: The presented MEP detection method presents a self-learning matched-filter approach for improved robustness against noise. The filter is adaptively generated per subject through iterative learning. For responses that are reliably detected by conventional detection, the new approach is fully compatible with established peak-to-peak readings and provides the same results but extends the dynamic range below the conventional noise floor. Results: In contrast to the conventional peak-to-peak measure, the proposed method increases the signal-to-noise ratio by more than a factor of 5. The first detectable responses appear to be substantially lower than the conventional threshold definition of 50 V median peak-to-peak amplitude. Conclusion: The proposed method shows that stimuli well below the conventional 50 V threshold definition can consistently and repeatably evoke muscular responses and thus activate excitable neuron populations in the brain. As a consequence, the IO curve is extended at the lower end, and the noise cut-off is shifted. Importantly, the IO curve extends so far that the 50 V point turns out to be closer to the center of the logarithmic sigmoid curve rather than close to the first detectable responses. The underlying method is applicable to a wide range of evoked potentials and other biosignals, such as in electroencephalography.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Commanding or being a simple intermediary: how does it affect moral behavior and related brain mechanisms?</a></h4>

              
                History has shown that fractioning operations between several individuals along a hierarchical chain allows diffusing responsibility between components of the chain, which has the potential to disinhibit antisocial actions. Here, we present two studies, one using fMRI (Study 1) and one using EEG (Study 2), designed to help understand how commanding or being in an intermediary position impacts the sense of agency and empathy for pain. In the age of military drones, we also explored whether commanding a human or robot agent influences these measures. This was done within a single behavioral paradigm in which participants could freely decide whether or not to send painful shocks to another participant in exchange for money. In Study 1, fMRI reveals that activation in social cognition and empathy-related brain regions was equally low when witnessing a victim receive a painful shock while participants were either commander or simple intermediary transmitting an order, compared to being the agent directly delivering the shock. In Study 2, results indicated that the sense of agency did not differ between commanders and intermediary, no matter if the executing agent was a robot or a human. However, we observed that the neural response over P3 was higher when the executing agent was a robot compared to a human. Source reconstruction of the EEG signal revealed that this effect was mediated by areas including the insula and ACC. Results are discussed regarding the interplay between the sense of agency and empathy for pain for decision-making.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cognitive experience alters cortical involvement in navigation decisions</a></h4>

              
                The neural correlates of decision-making have been investigated extensively, and recent work aims to identify under what conditions cortex is actually necessary for making accurate decisions. We discovered that mice with distinct cognitive experiences, beyond sensory and motor learning, use different cortical areas and neural activity patterns to solve the same task, revealing past learning as a critical determinant of whether cortex is necessary for decision-making. We used optogenetics and calcium imaging to study the necessity and neural activity of multiple cortical areas in mice with different training histories. Posterior parietal cortex and retrosplenial cortex were mostly dispensable for accurate decision-making in mice performing a simple navigation-based decision task. In contrast, these areas were essential for the same simple task when mice were previously trained on complex tasks with delay periods or association switches. Multi-area calcium imaging showed that, in mice with complex-task experience, single-neuron activity had higher selectivity and neuron-neuron correlations were weaker, leading to codes with higher task information. Therefore, past experience sets the landscape for how future tasks are solved by the brain and is a key factor in determining whether cortical areas have a causal role in decision-making.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Rule-based and stimulus-based cues bias auditory decisions via different computational and physiological mechanisms</a></h4>

              
                The varied effects of expectations on auditory perception are not well understood. For example, both top-down rules and bottom-up stimulus regularities generate expectations that can bias subsequent perceptual judgments. However, it is unknown whether these different sources of bias use the same or different computational and physiological mechanisms. We examined how rule-based and stimulus-based expectations influenced human subjects' behavior and pupil-linked arousal, a marker of certain forms of expectation-based processing, during an auditory frequency-discrimination task. Rule-based cues biased choice and response times (RTs) toward the more-probable stimulus. In contrast, stimulus-based cues had a complex combination of effects, including choice and RT biases toward and away from the frequency of recently heard stimuli. These different behavioral patterns also had distinct computational signatures, including different modulations of key components of a novel form of a drift-diffusion model, and distinct physiological signatures, including substantial bias-dependent modulations of pupil size in response to rule-based but not stimulus-based cues. These results imply that different sources of expectations can modulate auditory perception via distinct mechanisms: one that uses arousal-linked, rule-based information and another that uses arousal-independent, stimulus-based information to bias the speed and accuracy of auditory perceptual decisions.

                Although optical microscopy has allowed us to study the entire brain in early developmental stages, access to the brains of live, adult vertebrates has been limited. Danionella, a genus of miniature, transparent fish closely related to zebrafish has been introduced as a neuroscience model to study the entire adult vertebrate brain. However, the extent of optically accessible depth in these animals has not been quantitatively characterized. Here, we show that two- and three-photon microscopy can be used to access the entire depth of the adult wild type Danionella dracula brain without any modifications to the animal other than mechanical stabilization. Three-photon microscopy provides high signal to background ratio and optical sectioning through the deepest part of the brain. While vasculature can be observed with two-photon microscopy, the deeper regions have low contrast. We show that multiphoton microscopy is ideal for readily penetrating the entire adult brain within the geometry of these animals' head structures and without the need for pigment removal. With multiphoton microscopy enabling optical access to the entire adult brain and a repertoire of methods that allow observation of the larval brain, Danionella provides a model system for readily studying the entire brain over the lifetime of a vertebrate.

                A major difficulty with treating psychiatric disorders is their heterogeneity: different neural causes can lead to the same phenotype. To address this, we propose describing the underlying pathophysiology in terms of interpretable, biophysical parameters of a neural model derived from the electroencephalogram. We analyzed data from a small patient cohort of patients with depression and controls. We constructed biophysical models that describe neural dynamics in a cortical network activated during a task that is used to assess depression state. We show that biophysical model parameters are biomarkers, that is, variables that allow subtyping of depression at a biological level. They yield a low dimensional, interpretable feature space that allowed description of differences between individual patients with depressive symptoms. They capture internal heterogeneity/variance of depression state and achieve significantly better classification than commonly used EEG features. Our work is a proof of concept that a combination of biophysical models and machine learning may outperform earlier approaches based on classical statistics and raw brain data.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">D-amphetamine maintenance therapy reduces cocaine use in female rats</a></h4>

              
                Currently, there are no approved medications to treat cocaine addiction. In this context, d-amphetamine maintenance therapy is a promising pharmacological strategy to reduce cocaine use. In both male rats and human cocaine users, d-amphetamine treatment reduces cocaine taking and seeking. However, this has not been examined systematically in female animals, even though cocaine addiction afflicts both women and men, and the sexes can differ in their response to cocaine. Here, we determined how d-amphetamine maintenance therapy during cocaine self-administration influences cocaine use in female rats. In experiment 1, two groups of female rats received 14 intermittent access (IntA) cocaine self-administration sessions. One group received concomitant d-amphetamine maintenance treatment (COC + A rats; 5 mg/kg/day, via minipump), the other group did not (COC rats) After discontinuing d-amphetamine treatment, we measured responding for cocaine under a progressive ratio schedule, responding under extinction and cocaine-primed reinstatement of drug seeking. In experiment 2, we assessed the effects of d-amphetamine maintenance on these measures in already cocaine-experienced rats. To this end, rats first received 14 IntA cocaine self-administration sessions without d-amphetamine. They then received 14 more sessions now either with (COC/COC + A rats) or without (COC/COC rats) concomitant d-amphetamine treatment. In both experiments, d-amphetamine-treated rats showed reduced motivation to take and seek cocaine, responding less for cocaine both under progressive ratio and extinction conditions. In contrast, d-amphetamine treatment did not influence cocaine-primed reinstatement of cocaine seeking. Thus, d-amphetamine treatment reduces both the development and expression of addiction-relevant patterns of cocaine use in female animals.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">People with nicotine dependence use-disorder exhibit more prefrontal activity during preparatory control but reduced anterior cingulate activity during reactive control</a></h4>

              
                Reduced inhibitory control and a hypersensitivity to reward are key deficits in drug-dependents, however, they tend to be studied in isolation. Here we seek to understand the neural processes underlying control over reward and how this is different in people with a nicotine use disorder (pNUD). A novel variant of the monetary incentive delay task was performed by pNUD (n = 20) and non-smokers (n = 20), where we added a stop-signal component such that participants had to inhibit prepotent responses to earn a larger monetary reward. Brain activity was recorded using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We estimated stop signal reaction times (SSRT), an indicator of impulsivity, and correlated these with brain activity. Inhibitory accuracy scores did not differ between the control group and pNUD. However, pNUD had slower SSRTs, suggesting that they may find it harder to inhibit responses. Brain data revealed that pNUD had greater preparatory control activity in the middle frontal gyrus and inferior frontal gyrus prior to successful inhibitions over reward. In contrast, non-smokers had greater reactive control associated with more activity in the anterior cingulate cortex during these successful inhibitions. SSRT-brain activity correlations revealed that pNUD engaged more control related prefrontal brain regions when SSRTs are slower. Overall, whilst the inhibition accuracy scores were similar between groups, differential neural processes and strategies were used to successfully inhibit a prepotent response. The findings suggest that increasing preparatory control in pNUD may be one possible treatment target in order to increase inhibitory control over reward.

                While recent findings demonstrated the importance of initial state estimates about gravity for optimized motor control, it remains unclear whether novel initial states are rapidly implemented movement planning (and control) in the same way when gravity is removed or increased. Here, we investigated the effect of microgravity and hypergravity exposure on whole-body reaching movements performed by standing subjects during parabolic flights. Reaching movements were analyzed regarding spatial accuracy (finger endpoint deviation), arm kinematics (arm angular displacement), whole-body kinematics (body bending) and EMG activity (muscular activation and synergies) of eight muscles. Results showed that kinematics and muscular activity are adjusted in microgravity allowing accurate whole-body reaching, thus confirming the perfectly scaled sensorimotor reorganization reported in previous recent studies. Contrasting with these observations, participants hardly reached the targets in 1.8g (systematic undershot). Strikingly, whole-body kinematics remained unchanged in hypergravity compared to 1g observations. Finally, while the analysis of synergies highlighted a comparable muscular organization in all gravitational contexts, our main findings revealed local muscular adjustments leading to accurate motor responses in microgravity, but not in hypergravity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Integration of visual motion and pursuit signals in areas V3A and V6+ across cortical depth using 9.4T fMRI</a></h4>

              
                Neural mechanisms underlying a stable perception of the world during pursuit eye movements are not fully understood. Both, perceptual stability as well as perception of real (i.e. objective) motion are the product of integration between motion signals on the retina and efference copies of eye movements. Human areas V3A and V6 have previously been shown to have strong objective ('real') motion responses. Here we used high-resolution laminar fMRI at ultra-high magnetic field (9.4T) in human subjects to examine motion integration across cortical depths in these areas. We found an increased preference for objective motion in areas V3A and V6+ i.e. V6 and possibly V6A towards the upper layers. When laminar responses were detrended to remove the upper-layer bias present in all responses, we found a unique, condition-specific laminar profile in V6+, showing reduced mid-layer responses for retinal motion only. The results provide evidence for differential, motion-type dependent laminar processing in area V6+. Mechanistically, the mid-layer dip suggests a special contribution of retinal motion to integration, either in the form of a subtractive (inhibitory) mid-layer input, or in the form of feedback into extragranular or infragranular layers. The results show that differential laminar signals can be measured in high-level motion areas in human occipitoparietal cortex, opening the prospect of new mechanistic insights using non-invasive brain imaging.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Engineered biological neural networks on high density CMOS micro electrode arrays</a></h4>

              
                In bottom-up neuroscience, questions on neural information processing are addressed by engineering small but reproducible biological neural networks of defined network topology textit{in vitro}. The network topology can be controlled by culturing neurons within polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) microstructures that are combined with microelectrode arrays (MEAs) for electric access to the network. However, currently used glass MEAs are limited to 256 electrodes and pose a limitation to the spatial resolution as well as the design of more complex microstructures. The use of high density complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) MEAs greatly increases the spatiotemporal resolution, enabling sub-cellular readout and stimulation of neurons in defined neural networks. Unfortunately, the non-planar surface of CMOS MEAs complicates the attachment of PDMS microstructures. To overcome the problem of axons escaping the microstructures through the ridges of the CMOS MEA, we stamp-transferred a thin film of hexane-diluted PDMS onto the array such that the PDMS filled the ridges at the contact surface of the microstructures without clogging the axon guidance channels. Moreover, we provide an impedance-based method to visualize the exact location of the microstructures on the MEA and show that our method can confine axonal growth within the PDMS microstructures. Finally, the high spatiotemporal resolution of the CMOS MEA enabled us to show that we can guide action potentials using the unidirectional topology of our circular multi-node microstructure.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Rewarded extinction increases amygdalar connectivity and stabilizes long-term memory traces in the vmPFC</a></h4>

              
                Neurobiological evidence in rodents indicates that threat extinction incorporates reward neurocircuitry. Consequently, incorporating reward associations with an extinction memory may be an effective strategy to persistently attenuate threat responses. Moreover, while there is considerable research on the short-term effects of extinction strategies in humans, the long-term effects of extinction are rarely considered. In a within-subjects fMRI study, we compared counterconditioning (a form of rewarded-extinction) to standard extinction, at recent (24 hours) and remote (~1 month) retrieval tests. Relative to standard extinction, counterconditioning diminished 24-hour relapse of arousal and threat expectancy, and reduced activity in brain regions associated with the appraisal and expression of threat (e.g., thalamus, insula, periaqueductal gray). The retrieval of reward-associated extinction memory was accompanied by functional connectivity between the amygdala and the ventral striatum, whereas the retrieval of standard-extinction memories was associated with connectivity between the amygdala and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC). One-month later, the retrieval of both standard- and rewarded-extinction was associated with amygdala-vmPFC connectivity. However, only rewarded extinction created a stable memory trace in the vmPFC, identified through overlapping multivariate patterns of fMRI activity from extinction to 24-hour and 1-month retrieval. These findings provide new evidence that reward may generate a more stable and enduring memory trace of attenuated threat in humans.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Seeing the future: predictive control in neural models of ocular accommodation</a></h4>

              
                Ocular accommodation is the process of adjusting the eye's crystalline lens so as to bring the retinal image into sharp focus. The major stimulus to accommodation is therefore retinal defocus, and in essence, the job of accommodative control is to send a signal to the ciliary muscle which will minimise the magnitude of defocus. In this paper, we first provide a tutorial introduction to control theory to aid vision scientists without this background. We then present a unified model of accommodative control that explains properties of the accommodative response for a wide range of accommodative stimuli. Following previous work, we conclude that most aspects of accommodation are well explained by dual integral control, with a "fast" or "phasic" integrator enabling response to rapid changes in demand, which hands over control to a "slow" or "tonic" integrator which maintains the response to steady demand. Control is complicated by the sensorimotor latencies within the system, which delay both information about defocus and the accommodation changes made in response, and by the sluggish response of the motor plant. These can be overcome by incorporating a Smith predictor, whereby the system predicts the delayed sensory consequences of its own motor actions. For the first time, we show that critically-damped dual integral control with a Smith predictor accounts for adaptation effects as well as for the gain and phase for sinusoidal oscillations in demand. In addition, we propose a novel proportional-control signal to account for the power spectrum of accommodative microfluctuations during steady fixation, which may be important in hunting for optimal focus, and for the nonlinear resonance observed for low-amplitude, high-frequency input. Complete Matlab/Simulink code implementing the model is provided at https://doi.org/10.25405/data.ncl.14945550

                The objective of this research was to explore the efficacy of integrating 1) using multi-task learning, 2) neuroimaging data and common risk factors to predict the ADAS-cog 11 score in Alzheimer's patients. We studied the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of 798 participants ranging between 0 and 96 months from the initial diagnosis. This enabled us to exploit the benefits of the U-Net architecture, a structure historically known to perform well on medical imaging tasks using limited data with heavy image augmentations. The multi-task model simultaneously performed segmentation of white matter, gray matter, and cerebrospinal fluid on the MRI input and regression to predict the ADAS-cog 11 score. There is a body of literature highlighting the independent relationships between gray and white matter volumes and dementia severity; the trajectory was to explore if the multi-task model structure for these interrelated tasks would boost performance for each individual task. The final model integrates the deep learning results with a Gradient Boosting model trained on demographic data. A considerable performance improvement from the initial multi-task U-Net on the ADAS-cog 11 prediction task was achieved across our experiments.

                Are leaders made or born? Leader-follower roles have been well characterized in social science, but they remain somewhat obscure in sensory-motor coordination. Furthermore, it is unknown how and why leader-follower relationships are acquired, including innate versus acquired controversies. We developed a novel asymmetrical coordination task in which two participants (dyad) need to collaborate in transporting a simulated beam while maintaining its horizontal attitude. This experimental paradigm was implemented by twin robotic manipulanda, simulated beam dynamics, haptic interactions, and a projection screen. Clear leader-follower relationships were learned despite participants not being informed that they were interacting with each other, but only when strong haptic feedback was introduced. For the first time, we demonstrate the emergence of consistent leader-follower relationships in sensory-motor coordination, and further show that haptic interaction is essential for dyadic co-adaptation. These results provide insights into neural mechanisms responsible for the formation of leader-follower relationships in our society.

                Targeted memory reactivation (TMR) is a technique in which sensory cues associated with memories during wake are used to trigger memory reactivation during subsequent sleep. The characteristics of such cued reactivation, and the optimal placement of TMR cues, remain to be determined. We built an EEG classification pipeline that discriminated reactivation of right- and left-handed movements and found that cues which fall on the up-going transition of the slow oscillation (SO) are more likely to elicit a classifiable reactivation. We also used a novel machine learning pipeline to predict the likelihood of eliciting a classifiable reactivation after each TMR cue using the presence of spindles and features of SOs. Finally, we found that reactivations occurred either immediately after the cue or one second later. These findings greatly extend our understanding of memory reactivation and pave the way for development of wearable technologies to efficiently enhance memory through cueing in sleep.

                Systematic analysis of rich behavioral recordings is being used to uncover how circuits encode complex behaviors. Here we apply the approach to embryos. What are the first embryonic behaviors and how do they evolve as early neurodevelopment ensues? To address these questions, we present a systematic description of behavioral maturation for Caenorhabditis elegans embryos. Posture libraries were derived from a genetically encoded motion capture suit imaged with light-sheet microscopy and annotated using custom semi-automated tracking software (Multiple Hypothesis Hypergraph Tracking; MHHT). Analysis of cell trajectories, postures, and behavioral motifs revealed a stereotyped developmental progression. Early movement is dominated by flipping between dorsal and ventral coiling, which gradually slows into a period of reduced motility. Late-stage embryos exhibit sinusoidal waves of dorsoventral bends, prolonged bouts of directed motion, and a rhythmic pattern of pausing, which we designate slow wave twitch (SWT). Synaptic transmission is required for late-stage motion but not for early flipping or the intervening inactive phase. A high-throughput behavioral assay and calcium imaging revealed that SWT is elicited by the rhythmic activity of a quiescence-promoting neuron (RIS). Similar periodic quiescent states are seen prenatally in divergent animals and may play an important role in promoting normal developmental outcomes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Speech Sound Discrimination by Mongolian Gerbils</a></h4>

              
                The present study establishes the Mongolian gerbil (Meriones unguiculatus) as a model for investigating the perception of human speech sounds. We report data on the discrimination of logatomes (CVCs - consonant-vowel-consonant combinations with outer consonants /b/, /d/, /s/ and /t/ and central vowels /a/, /a[tricolon]/, /{varepsilon}/, /e[tricolon]/, /O_SCPLOWIC_SCPLOW/, /i[tricolon]/, /[o]/, /o[tricolon]/, /{upsilon}/ and /u[tricolon]/, VCVs - vowel-consonant-vowel combinations with outer vowels /a/, /O_SCPLOWIC_SCPLOW/ and /{upsilon}/ and central consonants /b/, /d/, /f/, /g/, /k/, /l/, /m/, /n/, /p/, /s/, /t/ and /v/) by young gerbils. Four young gerbils were trained to perform an oddball target detection paradigm in which they were required to discriminate a deviant CVC or VCV in a sequence of CVC or VCV standards, respectively. The experiments were performed with an ICRA-1 noise masker with speech-like spectral properties, and logatomes of multiple speakers were presented at various signal-to-noise ratios. Response latencies were measured to generate perceptual maps employing multidimensional scaling, which visualize the gerbils' internal representations of the sounds. The dimensions of the perceptual maps were correlated to multiple phonetic features of the speech sounds for evaluating which features of vowels and consonants are most important for the discrimination. The perceptual representation of vowels and consonants in gerbils was similar to that of humans, although gerbils needed higher signal-to-noise ratios for the discrimination of speech sounds than humans. The gerbils' discrimination of vowels depended on differences in the frequencies of the first and second formant determined by tongue height and position. Consonants were discriminated based on differences in combinations of their articulatory features. The similarities in the perception of logatomes by gerbils and humans renders the gerbil a suitable model for human speech sound discrimination.

                Bottom-up neuroscience, which consists of building and studying controlled networks of neurons in vitro, is a promising method to investigate information processing at the neuronal level. However, in vitro studies tend to use cells of animal origin rather than human neurons, leading to conclusions that might not be generalizable to humans and limiting the possibilities for relevant studies on neurological disorders. Here we present a method to build arrays of topologically controlled circuits of human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons. The circuits consist of 4 to 50 neurons with mostly unidirectional connections, confined by microfabricated polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) membranes. Such circuits were characterized using optical imaging and microelectrode arrays (MEAs). Electrophysiology recordings were performed on circuits of human iPSC-derived neurons for at least 4.5 months. We believe that the capacity to build small and controlled circuits of human iPSC-derived neurons holds great promise to better understand the fundamental principles of information processing and storing in the brain.

                Synapses maintain both action potential-evoked and spontaneous neurotransmitter release, however, organization of these two forms of release within an individual synapse remains unclear. Here, we used photobleaching properties of iGluSnFR, a fluorescent probe that detects glutamate, to investigate the subsynaptic organization of evoked and spontaneous release. In non-neuronal cells and neuronal dendrites, iGluSnFR fluorescence is intensely photobleached and recovers via diffusion of non-photobleached probes within 10-seconds. After photobleaching, while evoked iGluSnFR events could be rapidly suppressed, their recovery required several hours. In contrast, iGluSnFR responses to spontaneous release were comparatively resilient to photobleaching, unless the complete pool of iGluSnFR was activated by glutamate perfusion. This differential effect of photobleaching on different modes of neurotransmission is consistent with a subsynaptic organization where sites of evoked glutamate release are clustered and corresponding iGluSnFR probes are diffusion restricted, while spontaneous release sites are broadly spread across a synapse with readily diffusible iGluSnFR probes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">4-phenylbutyrate restored GABA uptake and reduced seizures in SLC6A1 variants-mediated disorders</a></h4>

              
                We have previously studied the molecular mechanisms of solute carrier family 6 member 1 (SLC6A1) associated with a continuum of neurodevelopmental disorders, including various epilepsy syndromes, autism, and intellectual disability. Based on functional assays of variants in a large cohort with heterogenous clinical phenotypes, we conclude that partial or complete loss of GABA uptake function in the mutant GAT-1 is the primary etiology as identified in GABAA receptor mutation-mediated epilepsy and in cystic fibrosis. Importantly, we identified that there are common patterns of the mutant protein trafficking from biogenesis, oligomerization, glycosylation, and translocation to the cell membrane across variants with the conservation of this process across cell types. Conversely any approach to facilitate membrane trafficking would increase presence of the functional protein in the targeted destination in all involved cells. PBA is an FDA-approved drug for pediatric use and is orally bioavailable so it can be quickly translated to patient use. It has been demonstrated that PBA can correct protein misfolding, reduce ER stress, and attenuate unfolded protein response in neurodegenerative diseases, it has also showed promise in treatment of cystic fibrosis. The common cellular mechanisms shared by the mutant GAT-1 and the mutant cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator led us to test if PBA and other pharmaco-chaperones could be a potential treatment option for SLC6A1 mutations. We examined the impact of PBA and other small molecules in a library of variants and in cell and knockin mouse models. Because of the critical role of astrocytic GAT-1 deficit in seizures, we focused on astrocytes, and demonstrated that the existence of the mutant GAT-1 retained the wildtype GAT-1, suggesting aberrant protein oligomerization and trafficking caused by the mutant GAT-1. PBA increased GABA uptake in both mouse and human astrocytes bearing the mutations. Importantly, PBA increased GAT-1 expression and suppressed spike wave discharges (SWDS) in the heterozygous knockin mice. Although the detailed mechanisms of action for PBA are ambiguous, it is likely that PBA can facilitate the forward trafficking of the wildtype GAT-1 favoring over the mutant GAT-1, thus increasing GABA uptake. Since all patients with SLC6A1 mutations are heterozygous and carry one wildtype functional allele, this suggests a great opportunity for treatment development by leveraging the endogenous protein trafficking pathway to promote forward trafficking of the wildtype in combination with enhancing the disposal of the mutant allele as treatment mode. The study opens a novel avenue of treatment development for genetic epilepsy via drug repurposing.

                Leucine-rich Glioma Inactivated protein 1 (LGI1) is expressed in the central nervous and genetic loss of function is associated with epileptic disorders. Also, patients with LGI1-directed autoantibodies have frequent focal seizures as a key feature of their disease. LGI1 is composed of a Leucine Rich Repeat (LRR) and an Epitempin (EPTP) domain. These domains are reported to interact with different aspects of the transsynaptic complex formed by LGI1 at excitatory synapses, including presynaptic Kv1 potassium channels. Patient-derived monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are ideal reagents to study whether domain-specific LGI1-autoantibodies induce epileptiform activities in neurons, and their downstream mechanisms. To address this question, we measured the intrinsic excitability of CA3 pyramidal neurons in organotypic cultures from rat hippocampus treated with either a LRR- or an EPTP- reactive patient-derived mAb. The antibodies induced changes in neuronal intrinsic excitability which led us to measure their effects on Kv1-type potassium currents. We found an increase of intrinsic excitability correlated with a reduction of the sensitivity to a selective Kv1.1-channel blocker in neurons treated with the LRR mAb compared to the control, but not in neurons treated with the EPTP mAb. Our findings suggest LRR mAbs are able to modulate neuronal excitability that could account for epileptiform activities observed in patients.

                Age-related changes in cognition, brain morphology, and behavior are exhibited in several primate species. Baboons, like humans, naturally develop Alzheimer's disease-like pathology and cognitive declines with age and are an underutilized model for studies of aging. To determine age-related differences in gray matter covariation of 89 olive baboons (Papio anubis), we used source-based morphometry (SBM) to analyze data from magnetic resonance images. We hypothesized that we would find significant age effects in one or more SBM components, particularly those which include regions influenced by age in humans and other nonhuman primates (NHPs). A multivariate analysis of variance revealed that individual weighted gray matter covariation scores differed across the age classes. Elderly baboons contributed significantly less to gray matter covariation components including the brainstem, superior parietal cortex, thalamus, and pallidum compared to juveniles, and middle and superior frontal cortex compared to juveniles and young adults (p<0.05). Future studies should the relationship between the changes in gray matter covariation reported here and age-related cognitive decline.

                Serotonin is implicated in the valuation of aversive costs, such as delay or physical effort. However, its role in governing sensitivity to cognitive effort, for example deliberation costs during information gathering, is unclear. We show that week-long treatment with a serotonergic antidepressant enhances a willingness to gather information when trying to maximize reward. Using computational modelling, we show this arises from a diminished sensitivity to subjective deliberation costs during the sampling process. This result is consistent with the notion that serotonin alleviates sensitivity to aversive costs in a domain-general fashion, with implications for its potential contribution to a positive impact on motivational deficits in psychiatric disorders.

                Which part of the brain contributes to our complex cognitive processes? Studies have revealed contributions of the cerebellum and subcortex to higher-order cognitive functions; however it is unclear whether such functional representations are preserved across the cortex, cerebellum, and subcortex. In this study, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging data with 103 cognitive tasks and constructed three voxel-wise encoding and decoding models independently using cortical, cerebellar, and subcortical voxels. Representational similarity analysis revealed that the structure of task representations is preserved across the three brain parts. Principal component analysis visualized distinct organizations of abstract cognitive functions in each part of the cerebellum and subcortex. More than 90% of the cognitive tasks were decodable from the cerebellum and subcortical activities, even for the novel tasks not included in model training. Furthermore, we discovered that the cerebellum and subcortex have sufficient information to reconstruct activity in the cerebral cortex.

                Songbirds and humans share the ability to adaptively modify their vocalizations based on sensory feedback. Prior studies have focused primarily on the role that auditory feedback plays in shaping vocal output throughout life. In contrast, it is unclear whether and how non-auditory information drives vocal plasticity. Here, we first used a reinforcement learning paradigm to establish that non-auditory feedback can drive vocal learning in adult songbirds. We then assessed the role of a songbird basal ganglia-thalamocortical pathway critical to auditory vocal learning in this novel form of vocal plasticity. We found that both this circuit and its dopaminergic inputs are necessary for non-auditory vocal learning, demonstrating that this pathway is not specialized exclusively for auditory-driven vocal learning. The ability of this circuit to use both auditory and non-auditory information to guide vocal learning may reflect a general principle for the neural systems that support vocal plasticity across species.

                The human brain is a complex, integrative and segregative network that exhibits dynamic fluctuations in activity across space and time. A canonical set of large-scale networks has been historically identified from resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI), including the default mode, visual, somatomotor, salience, attention, and executive control. However, the methods used in identification of these networks have relied on assumptions that may inadvertently constrain their properties and consequently our understanding of the human connectome. Here we define a brain "network" as a functional component that jointly describes its spatial distribution and temporal dynamics, where neither domain suffers from unrealistic constraints. Using our recently developed BrainSync algorithm and the Nadam-Accelerated SCAlable and Robust (NASCAR) tensor decomposition, we identified twenty-three brain networks using rs-fMRI data from a large group of healthy subjects acquired by the Human Connectome Project. These networks are spatially overlapped, temporally correlated, and highly reproducible across two independent groups and sessions. We show that these networks can be clustered into six distinct functional categories and naturally form a representative functional network atlas for a healthy population. Using this atlas, we demonstrate that individuals with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder display disproportionate brain activity increases, relative to neurotypical subjects, in visual, auditory, and somatomotor networks concurrent with decreases in the default mode and higher-order cognitive networks. Thus, this work not only yields a highly reproducible set of spatiotemporally overlapped functional brain networks, but also provides convergent evidence that individual differences in these networks can be used to explain individual differences in neurocognitive functioning.

	<p>Aggression is highly prevalent in borderline personality disorder (BPD). Previous studies have identified specific biobehavioral mechanisms underlying aggression in BPD, threat sensitivity being among them. We composited the mechanism-based anti-aggression psychotherapy (MAAP) in order to target these specific mechanisms, and MAAP was found to be superior to non-specific supportive psychotherapy (NSSP) in reducing aggressive behavior. In the present study, we investigated whether underlying brain mechanisms expected to be involved were affected by MAAP. To this end, n = 33 patients with BPD and overt aggressive behavior (n = 20 in MAAP, n = 13 in NSSP) and n = 25 healthy participants took part in a functional magnetic resonance imaging emotional face-matching task before and after treatment, or at a similar time interval for controls. Overt aggressive behavior was assessed using the overt aggression scale, modified. Results showed a decrease in amygdala activation in response to facial stimuli after MAAP, whereas an increase in amygdala activation was found after NSSP. Furthermore, in the MAAP group, connectivity between amygdala and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex increased from pre- to post-treatment compared to the NSSP group. Hence, the results suggest an impact of MAAP on brain mechanisms underlying the salience circuit in response to threat cues.</p>

	<p>Depression is one of the leading causes of disability, and, if left unmanaged, it can increase the risk for suicide. The evidence base on the determinants of depression is fragmented, which makes the interpretation of the results across studies difficult. The objective of this study is to conduct a thorough synthesis of the literature assessing the biological, psychological, and social determinants of depression in order to piece together the puzzle of the key factors that are related to this condition. Titles and abstracts published between 2017 and 2020 were identified in PubMed, as well as Medline, Scopus, and PsycInfo. Key words relating to biological, social, and psychological determinants as well as depression were applied to the databases, and the screening and data charting of the documents took place. We included 470 documents in this literature review. The findings showed that there are a plethora of risk and protective factors (relating to biological, psychological, and social determinants) that are related to depression; these determinants are interlinked and influence depression outcomes through a web of causation. In this paper, we describe and present the vast, fragmented, and complex literature related to this topic. This review may be used to guide practice, public health efforts, policy, and research related to mental health and, specifically, depression.</p>

	<p>The upper extremities limitation represents one of the essential functional impairments in patients with cervical spinal cord injury. Electromechanics assisted devices and robots are increasingly used in neurorehabilitation to help functional improvement in patients with neurological diseases. This review aimed to systematically report the evidence-based, state-of-art on clinical applications and robotic-assisted arm training (RAT) in motor and functional recovery in subjects affected by cervical spinal cord injury. The present study has been carried out within the framework of the Italian Consensus Conference on &amp;amp;ldquo;Rehabilitation assisted by robotic and electromechanical devices for persons with disability of neurological origin&amp;amp;rdquo; (CICERONE). PubMed/MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, and Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) databases were systematically searched from inception to September 2021. The 10-item PEDro scale assessed the study quality for the RCT and the AMSTAR-2 for the systematic review. Two different authors rated the studies included in this review. If consensus was not achieved after discussion, a third reviewer was interrogated. The five-item Oxford CEBM scale was used to rate the level of evidence. A total of 11 studies were included. The selected studies were: two systematic reviews, two RCTs, one parallel-group controlled trial, one longitudinal intervention study and five case series. One RCT was scored as a high-quality study, while the systematic review was of low quality. RAT was reported as feasible and safe. Initial positive effects of RAT were found for arm function and quality of movement in addition to conventional therapy. The high clinical heterogeneity of treatment programs and the variety of robot devices could severely affect the generalizability of the study results. Therefore, future studies are warranted to standardize the type of intervention and evaluate the role of robotic-assisted training in subjects affected by cervical spinal cord injury.</p>

	<p>Neurocognitive deficits and negative symptoms (NS) have a pivotal role in subjects with schizophrenia (SCZ) due to their impact on patients’ functioning in everyday life and their influence on goal-directed behavior and decision-making. P3b is considered an optimal electrophysiological candidate biomarker of neurocognitive impairment for its association with the allocation of attentional resources to task-relevant stimuli, an important factor for efficient decision-making, as well as for motivation-related processes. Furthermore, associations between P3b deficits and NS have been reported. The current research aims to fill the lack of studies investigating, in the same subjects, the associations of P3b with multiple cognitive domains and the expressive and motivation-related domains of NS, evaluated with state-of-the-art instruments. One hundred and fourteen SCZ and 63 healthy controls (HCs) were included in the study. P3b amplitude was significantly reduced and P3b latency prolonged in SCZ as compared to HCs. In SCZ, a positive correlation was found between P3b latency and age and between P3b amplitude and the Attention-vigilance domain, while no significant correlations were found between P3b and the two NS domains. Our results indicate that the effortful allocation of attention to task-relevant stimuli, an important component of decision-making, is compromised in SCZ, independently of motivation deficits or other NS.</p>

	<p>Recent studies have shown that people make more utilitarian decisions when dealing with a moral dilemma in a foreign language than in their native language. Emotion, cognitive load, and psychological distance have been put forward as explanations for this foreign language effect. The question that arises is whether a similar effect would be observed when processing a dilemma in one&amp;amp;rsquo;s own language but spoken by a foreign-accented speaker. Indeed, foreign-accented speech has been shown to modulate emotion processing, to disrupt processing fluency and to increase psychological distance due to social categorisation. We tested this hypothesis by presenting 435 participants with two moral dilemmas, the trolley dilemma and the footbridge dilemma online, either in a native accent or a foreign accent. In Experiment 1, 184 native Spanish speakers listened to the dilemmas in Spanish recorded by a native speaker, a British English or a Cameroonian native speaker. In Experiment 2, 251 Dutch native speakers listened to the dilemmas in Dutch in their native accent, in a British English, a Turkish, or in a French accent. Results showed an increase in utilitarian decisions for the Cameroonian- and French-accented speech compared to the Spanish or Dutch native accent, respectively. When collapsing all the speakers from the two experiments, a similar increase in the foreign accent condition compared with the native accent condition was observed. This study is the first demonstration of a foreign accent effect on moral judgements, and despite the variability in the effect across accents, the findings suggest that a foreign accent, like a foreign language, is a linguistic context that modulates (neuro)cognitive mechanisms, and consequently, impacts our behaviour. More research is needed to follow up on this exploratory study and to understand the influence of factors such as emotion reduction, cognitive load, psychological distance, and speaker&amp;amp;rsquo;s idiosyncratic features on moral judgments.</p>

	<p>Orexin-A (OX-A) and orexin-B (OX-B) are neuropeptides produced in the hypothalamus. Preclinical and clinical studies suggest that depression and anxiety are associated with the orexin system. In the current study, we used the learned helplessness (LH) animal model of depression to identify rats displaying LH behaviors (LH rats) and those that did not (No-LH rats). We compared the number of orexin-containing neurons in the hypothalamus of LH, No-LH, and control rats. Orexin peptides, orexin receptor 1 (OXR1) and 2 (OXR2) in brain areas involved in major depression and serum OX-A and corticosterone (CORT) concentrations were quantified and compared between rat groups. We found that LH and No-LH rats displayed higher serum OX-A concentrations compared with control rats. Comparison between LH and No-LH rats revealed that No-LH rats had significantly higher OX-A levels in the brain, more OX-A neurons, and more OX-A neuron activation. LH rats had more OX-B neurons and more OX-B neuron activation. Orexin peptides and receptors in the brain areas involved in major depression exhibited different patterns in LH and NoLH rats. Our findings revealed that activation of OX-A neurons could promote resilient behaviors under stressful situations and OX-A and OX-B neuropeptides exhibit dissimilar functions in LH behaviors.</p>

	<p>For persons with Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease, the loss of autonomy in daily life leads to a high level of dependency on relatives&amp;amp;rsquo; support. Such dependency strongly correlates with high levels of perceived stress and psychosocial burden in informal caregivers. Global developments, such as demographic change and the associated thinning infrastructure in rural areas cause a continuously growing need for medical and nursing care. However, this need is not being adequately met. The resulting care gap is being made up by unpaid or underpaid work of informal caregivers. The double burden of care work and gainful employment creates enormous health-related impairments of the informal caregivers, so that they eventually become invisible patients themselves. Expectedly, those invisible patients do not receive the best care, leading to a decrease in quality of life and, in the end, to worse care for PD patients. Suggested solutions to relieve relatives, such as moving the person affected by Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s to a nursing home, often do not meet the wishes of patients and informal caregivers, nor does it appear as a structural solution in the light of demographic change against an economic background. Rather, it requires the development, implementation and evaluation of new, holistic approaches to care that make invisible patients visible.</p>

	<p>Cognitive network science is an emerging approach that uses the mathematical tools of network science to map the relationships among representations stored in memory to examine how that structure might influence processing. In the present study, we used computer simulations to compare the ability of a well-known model of spoken word recognition, TRACE, to the ability of a cognitive network model with a spreading activation-like process to account for the findings from several previously published behavioral studies of language processing. In all four simulations, the TRACE model failed to retrieve a sufficient number of words to assess if it could replicate the behavioral findings. The cognitive network model successfully replicated the behavioral findings in Simulations 1 and 2. However, in Simulation 3a, the cognitive network did not replicate the behavioral findings, perhaps because an additional mechanism was not implemented in the model. However, in Simulation 3b, when the decay parameter in spreadr was manipulated to model this mechanism the cognitive network model successfully replicated the behavioral findings. The results suggest that models of cognition need to take into account the multi-scale structure that exists among representations in memory, and how that structure can influence processing.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Internal affective states produce external manifestations such as facial expressions. In humans, the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) is widely used to objectively quantify the elemental facial action units (AUs) that build complex facial expressions. A similar system has been developed for macaque monkeys&mdash;the Macaque FACS (MaqFACS); yet, unlike the human counterpart, which is already partially replaced by automatic algorithms, this system still requires labor-intensive coding. Here, we developed and implemented the first prototype for automatic MaqFACS coding. We applied the approach to the analysis of behavioral and neural data recorded from freely interacting macaque monkeys. The method achieved high performance in the recognition of six dominant AUs, generalizing between conspecific individuals (<I>Macaca mulatta</I>) and even between species (<I>Macaca fascicularis</I>). The study lays the foundation for fully automated detection of facial expressions in animals, which is crucial for investigating the neural substrates of social and affective states.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>The local circuitry within olfactory bulb (OB) glomeruli filters, transforms, and facilitates information transfer from olfactory sensory neurons to bulb output neurons. Two key elements of this circuit are glutamatergic tufted cells (TCs) and GABAergic periglomerular (PG) cells, both of which actively shape mitral cell activity and bulb output. A subtype of TCs, the external TCs (eTCs), can synaptically excite PG cells, but there are unresolved questions about other aspects of the glomerular connections, including the extent of connectivity between eTCs and the precise nature of reciprocal interactions between TCs and PG cells. We combined patch-clamp recordings in OB slices and optophysiological tools to investigate local functional connections within glomeruli of mice and rats. When TCs that express cholecystokinin (CCK) were optically suppressed, excitatory inputs to "uniglomerular" PG cells that extend dendrites to one glomerulus were decreased, consistent with TC activation being required for most excitation of these PG cells. However, TC suppression had no effect on EPSCs in eTCs, arguing that TCs make few, if any, direct glutamatergic synaptic connections with eTCs. The absence of synaptic connections among eTCs was also supported by recordings in eTC pairs. Last, we show using similar optical suppression methods that GAD65-expressing PG cells, mainly uniglomerular cells, provide strong inhibition in eTCs. Our results imply that the local network of CCK-expressing TCs form potent reciprocal chemical synaptic connections with GAD65-expressing uniglomerular PG cells but not eTCs. This configuration favors local inhibition over recurrent excitation within a glomerulus, limiting its output.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Endothelial cells (ECs) are key players in the development and maintenance of the vascular tree, the establishment of the blood–brain barrier and control of blood flow. Disruption in ECs is an early and active component of vascular pathogenesis. However, our ability to selectively target ECs in the CNS for identification and manipulation is limited. Here, in the mouse retina, a tractable model of the CNS, we utilized a recently developed AAV-BR1 system to identify distinct classes of ECs along the vascular tree using a GFP reporter. We then developed an inducible EC-specific ectopic Connexin 43 (Cx43) expression system using AAV-BR1-CAG-DIO-Cx43-P2A-DsRed2 in combination with a mouse line carrying inducible CreERT2 in ECs. We targeted Cx43 because its loss has been implicated in microvascular impairment in numerous diseases such as diabetic retinopathy and vascular edema. GFP-labeled ECs were numerous, evenly distributed along the vascular tree and their morphology was polarized with respect to the direction of blood flow. After tamoxifen induction, ectopic Cx43 was specifically expressed in ECs. Similarly to endogenous Cx43, ectopic Cx43 was localized at the membrane contacts of ECs and it did not affect tight junction proteins. The ability to enhance gap junctions in ECs provides a precise and potentially powerful tool to treat microcirculation deficits, an early pathology in numerous diseases.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Cannabis use during pregnancy has increased over the past few decades, with recent data indicating that, in youth and young adults especially, up to 22% of people report using cannabis during pregnancy. Animal models provide the ability to study prenatal cannabis exposure (PCE) with control over timing and dosage; however, these studies utilize both injection and inhalation approaches. While it is known that Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC; primary psychoactive component of cannabis) can cross the placenta, examination of the transmission and concentration of THC and its metabolites from maternal blood into the placenta and fetal brain remains relatively unknown, and the influence of route of administration has never been examined. Pregnant female rats were exposed to either vaporized THC-dominant cannabis extract for pulmonary consumption or subcutaneous injection of THC repeatedly during the gestational period. Maternal blood, placenta, and fetal brains were collected following the final administration of THC for analysis of THC and its metabolites, as well as endocannabinoid concentrations, through mass spectrometry. Both routes of administration resulted in the transmission of THC and its metabolites in placenta and fetal brain. Repeated exposure to inhaled THC vapor resulted in fetal brain THC concentrations that were about 30% of those seen in maternal blood, whereas repeated injections resulted in roughly equivalent concentrations of THC in maternal blood and fetal brain. Neither inhalation nor injection of THC during pregnancy altered fetal brain endocannabinoid concentrations. Our data provide the first characterization of maternal-fetal transmission of THC and its metabolites following both vaporized delivery and injection routes of administration. These data are important to establish the maternal-fetal transmission in preclinical injection and inhalation models of PCE and may provide insight into predicting fetal exposure in human studies.</p>

<p>Normal brain aging is associated with decreased anti-inflammatory cytokine levels IL-10 and FGF-2, whereas several cytokines are elevated in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and MND. In particular, fibroblast growth factor-2 is elevated almost 10-fold in AD compared to controls and MND.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The role of increased brain inflammation in the development of neurodegenerative diseases is unclear. Here, we have compared cytokine changes in normal aging, motor neurone disease (MND), and Alzheimer's disease (AD). After an initial analysis, six candidate cytokines, interleukin (IL)- 4, 5, 6, 10, macrophage inhibitory protein (MIP)-1α, and fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-2, showing greatest changes were assayed in postmortem frozen human superior frontal gyri (<i>n</i> = 12) of AD patients, aging and young adult controls along with the precentral gyrus (<i>n</i> = 12) of MND patients. Healthy aging was associated with decreased anti-inflammatory IL-10 and FGF-2 levels. AD prefrontal cortex was associated with increased levels of IL-4, IL-5, and FGF-2, with the largest increase seen for FGF-2. Notwithstanding differences in the specific frontal lobe gyrus sampled, MND patients’ primary motor cortex (precentral gyrus) was associated with increased levels of IL-5, IL-6, IL-10, and FGF-2 compared to the aging prefrontal cortex (superior frontal gyrus). Immunocytochemistry showed that FGF-2 is expressed in neurons, astrocytes, and microglia in normal aging prefrontal cortex, AD prefrontal cortex, and MND motor cortex. We report that healthy aging and age-related neurodegenerative diseases have different cortical inflammatory signatures that are characterized by increased levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines and call into question the view that increased inflammation underlies the development of age-related neurodegenerative diseases.</p>

<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>This study aims to investigate the association between long-term donepezil treatment and brain neuropathological burden and cognitive function in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients. Preprocessed <sup>18</sup>F-AV-45 amyloid and <sup>18</sup>F-AV-1451 tau positron emission tomography (PET) images, magnetic resonance imaging images (MRIs), demographic information, and donepezil use status were downloaded from 255 MCI participants enrolled in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database. Partial volume correction was applied to all PET images. Structural MRIs were used for PET spatial normalization. Regions of interest (ROIs) were defined in standard space, and standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) images relative to the cerebellum were computed. Multiple linear regression with the least absolute shrinkage selector operator was performed to analyze the effect of long-term donepezil treatment on (a) the SUVR of each <sup>18</sup>F-AV-45 or <sup>18</sup>F-AV-1451 brain PET ROI after adjusting for age, sex, education, ApoE ε4 status, and AD-associated disease risk factors; and (b) cognitive performance after adjusting for age, sex education, ApoE ε4 status, AD-associated disease risk factors, and regional amyloid or tau burden. In adjusted models, long-term donepezil treatment was associated with greater amyloid load in the orbital frontal, superior frontal, parietal, posterior precuneus, posterior cingulate, lateral temporal, inferior temporal and fusiform regions, and tau burden in the posterior cingulate, entorhinal and parahippocampal gyrus. Long-term donepezil treatment was also associated with worse performance on the 13-item Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive subscale after adjusting for AD-related risk factors and regional brain amyloid or tau load. These results indicate that long-term donepezil treatment is associated with increased regional amyloid and tau burden and worse cognitive performance among individuals with MCI. Our study highlights the importance of using noninvasive and quantitative <sup>18</sup>F-AV-45 and <sup>18</sup>F-AV-1451 PET to elucidate the consequences of drug administration in AD studies.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Transcranial direct current stimulation of cerebellum alters spiking precision in cerebellar cortex: A modeling study of cellular responses</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Xu Zhang, Roeland Hancock, Sabato Santaniello</p>

Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) of the cerebellum has rapidly raised interest but the effects of tDCS on cerebellar neurons remain unclear. Assessing the cellular response to tDCS is challenging because of the uneven, highly stratified cytoarchitecture of the cerebellum, within which cellular morphologies, physiological properties, and function vary largely across several types of neurons. In this study, we combine MRI-based segmentation of the cerebellum and a finite element model of the tDCS-induced electric field (EF) inside the cerebellum to determine the field imposed on the cerebellar neurons throughout the region. We then pair the EF with multicompartment models of the Purkinje cell (PC), deep cerebellar neuron (DCN), and granule cell (GrC) and quantify the acute response of these neurons under various orientations, physiological conditions, and sequences of presynaptic stimuli. We show that cerebellar tDCS significantly modulates the postsynaptic spiking precision of the PC, which is expressed as a change in the spike count and timing in response to presynaptic stimuli. tDCS has modest effects, instead, on the PC tonic firing at rest and on the postsynaptic activity of DCN and GrC. In Purkinje cells, anodal tDCS shortens the repolarization phase following complex spikes (-14.7 ± 6.5% of baseline value, mean ± S.D.; max: -22.7%) and promotes burstiness with longer bursts compared to resting conditions. Cathodal tDCS, instead, promotes irregular spiking by enhancing somatic excitability and significantly prolongs the repolarization after complex spikes compared to baseline (+37.0 ± 28.9%, mean ± S.D.; max: +84.3%). tDCS-induced changes to the repolarization phase and firing pattern exceed 10% of the baseline values in Purkinje cells covering up to 20% of the cerebellar cortex, with the effects being distributed along the EF direction and concentrated in the area under the electrode over the cerebellum. Altogether, the acute effects of tDCS on cerebellum mainly focus on Purkinje cells and modulate the precision of the response to synaptic stimuli, thus having the largest impact when the cerebellar cortex is active. Since the spatiotemporal precision of the PC spiking is critical to learning and coordination, our results suggest cerebellar tDCS as a viable therapeutic option for disorders involving cerebellar hyperactivity such as ataxia.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Ten simple rules for creating a scientific web application</a></h4>

The use of scientific web applications (SWApps) across biological and environmental sciences has grown exponentially over the past decade or so. Although quantitative evidence for such increased use in practice is scant, collectively, we have observed that these tools become more commonplace in teaching, outreach, and in science coproduction (e.g., as decision support tools). Despite the increased popularity of SWApps, researchers often receive little or no training in creating such tools. Although rolling out SWApps can be a relatively simple and quick process using modern, popular platforms like R shiny apps or Tableau dashboards, making them useful, usable, and sustainable is not. These 10 simple rules for creating a SWApp provide a foundation upon which researchers with little to no experience in web application design and development can consider, plan, and carry out SWApp projects.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Noise-trained deep neural networks effectively predict human vision and its neural responses to challenging images</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Hojin Jang, Devin McCormack, Frank Tong</p>

Deep neural networks (DNNs) for object classification have been argued to provide the most promising model of the visual system, accompanied by claims that they have attained or even surpassed human-level performance. Here, we evaluated whether DNNs provide a viable model of human vision when tested with challenging noisy images of objects, sometimes presented at the very limits of visibility. We show that popular state-of-the-art DNNs perform in a qualitatively different manner than humans—they are unusually susceptible to spatially uncorrelated white noise and less impaired by spatially correlated noise. We implemented a noise training procedure to determine whether noise-trained DNNs exhibit more robust responses that better match human behavioral and neural performance. We found that noise-trained DNNs provide a better qualitative match to human performance; moreover, they reliably predict human recognition thresholds on an image-by-image basis. Functional neuroimaging revealed that noise-trained DNNs provide a better correspondence to the pattern-specific neural representations found in both early visual areas and high-level object areas. A layer-specific analysis of the DNNs indicated that noise training led to broad-ranging modifications throughout the network, with greater benefits of noise robustness accruing in progressively higher layers. Our findings demonstrate that noise-trained DNNs provide a viable model to account for human behavioral and neural responses to objects in challenging noisy viewing conditions. Further, they suggest that robustness to noise may be acquired through a process of visual learning.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Quantitative image analysis in COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome: a cohort observational study. [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a severe form of acute lung injury commonly associated with pneumonia, including coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19). The resultant effect can be persistent lung damage, but its extent is not known. We used quantitative high resolution computed tomography (QHR-CT) lung scans to radiographically characterize the lung damage in COVID-19 ARDS (CARDS) survivors. Methods Patients with CARDS (N=20) underwent QHR-CT lung scans 60 to 90 days after initial diagnosis, while hospitalized at a long-term acute care hospital (LTACH). QHR-CT assessed for mixed disease (QMD), ground glass opacities (QGGO), consolidation (QCON) and normal lung tissue (QNL). QMD was correlated with respiratory support on admission, tracheostomy decannulation and supplementary oxygen need on discharge. Results Sixteen patients arrived with tracheostomy requiring invasive mechanical ventilation. Four patients arrived on nasal oxygen support. Of the patients included in this study 10 had the tracheostomy cannula removed, four remained on invasive ventilation, and two died. QHR-CT showed 45% QMD, 28.1% QGGO, 3.0% QCON and QNL=23.9%. Patients with mandatory mechanical ventilation had the highest proportion of QMD when compared to no mechanical ventilation. There was no correlation between QMD and tracheostomy decannulation or need for supplementary oxygen at discharge. Conclusions Our data shows severe ongoing lung injury in patients with CARDS, beyond what is usually expected in ARDS. In this severely ill population, the extent of mixed disease correlates with mechanical ventilation, signaling formation of interstitial lung disease. QHR-CT analysis can be useful in the post-acute setting to evaluate for interstitial changes in ARDS.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Simulation framework for connected vehicles: a scoping review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: V2V (Vehicle-to-Vehicle) is a booming research field with a diverse set of services and applications. Most researchers rely on vehicular simulation tools to model traffic and road conditions and evaluate the performance of network protocols. We conducted a scoping review to consider simulators that have been reported in the literature based on successful implementation of V2V systems, tutorials, documentation, examples, and/or discussion groups. Methods: Simulators that have limited information were not included. The selected simulators are described individually and compared based on their requirements and features, i.e., origin, traffic model, scalability, and traffic features. This scoping review was reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR). The review considered only research published in English (in journals and conference papers) completed after 2015. Further, three reviewers initiated the data extraction phase to retrieve information from the published papers. Results: Most simulators can simulate system behaviour by modelling the events according to pre-defined scenarios. However, the main challenge faced is integrating the three components to simulate a road environment in either microscopic, macroscopic or mesoscopic models. These components include mobility generators, VANET simulators and network simulators. These simulators require the integration and synchronisation of the transportation domain and the communication domain. Simulation modelling can be run using a different types of simulators that are cost-effective and scalable for evaluating the performance of V2V systems in urban environments. In addition, we also considered the ability of the vehicular simulation tools to support wireless sensors. Conclusions: The outcome of this study may reduce the time required for other researchers to work on other applications involving V2V systems and as a reference for the study and development of new traffic simulators.

                Background: Since adsorption is a complex process, numerous models and theories have been devised to gain general understanding of its underlying mechanisms. The interaction between the adsorbates and adsorbents can be identified via modelling of the adsorption data with different adsorption isotherms as well as kinetic models. Many studies are also focused on developing predictive modelling techniques to facilitate accurate prediction of future adsorption trends. Methods: In this study, a predictive model was developed based on a multiple linear regression technique using existing data of As(V) adsorption onto several coated and uncoated magnetite samples. To understand the mechanisms and interactions involved, the data was first modelled using either Temkin or Freundlich linear isotherms.  The predicted value is a single data point extension from the training data set. Subsequently, the predicted outcome and the experimental values were compared using multiple error functions to assess the predictive model’s performance. Results: In addition, certain values were compared to that obtained from the literature, and the results were found to have low error margins. Conclusion: To further gauge the effectiveness of the proposed model in accurately predicting future adsorption trends, it should be further tested on different adsorbent and adsorbate combinations.

                Background: Lockdown due to Covid-19 pandemic brought deep changes to the daily lives of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), greatly increasing their amount of time spent at home. Methods: A cohort of 243 parents of children with ASD (2-15 years old) completed an original online survey regarding the child’s screen time and the modification of the ASD symptomatology during lockdown to investigate the relationship between them. Results: The data show that high solitary screen time is related with the worsening of ASD core symptoms. Conclusions: This study may help to increase awareness in the excessive use of screen in children with ASD during the lockdown, both during the pandemic as well as after it ends.

                Background: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a global public health problem. To avoid disease complications, diabetic patients have to control their blood glucose and maintain a healthy lifestyle including a healthy diet, weight control, moderate exercise, and smoking cessation. Methods: This study aimed to survey sleep, eating, and exercise behaviors of diabetic patients in Bang Rakam district, a rural community in Phitsanulok province, Thailand. The data on sleep and other health behaviors were taken from 1,385 T2DM patients and 1,394 non-T2DM controls, who were aged 30 - 85 years and were free from other chronic diseases. The data were collected using a structured questionnaire. Results: Compared to the control group, the diabetes group had a significantly higher body mass index (BMI).  However, fewer of them were found to smoke cigarettes and drink alcohol. Most of the participants were ‘morning people’ who slept 7-9 hours per day. It was found that sleep ≥8 hours increased the risk of diabetes among women (OR = 1.27, 95% CI 1.03 - 1.56). The diabetes group reported eating chicken and vegetables more than the control group. They also avoided eating beef and eating more than a cup of rice per meal. However, the T2DM group did fewer physical activities, such as walking, biking, or playing sports, during their leisure time. Conclusions: Compared to the control group, diabetic patients in a rural community of Thailand had healthier sleep, lifestyle, and eating behaviors but not healthier exercise behaviors, especially among obese women. Diabetes prevention programs should emphasize and promote weight control and increasing levels of exercise.

                Zutshi et al. perform simultaneous silencing of major afferents into the hippocampal CA1 to address whether CA1 spiking can be sustained by local computations. These manipulations reveal that coordinated CA1 place cell assemblies persist with minimal input but that each input has distinct effects on spatial tuning and field potentials.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A helicase-tethered ORC flip enables bidirectional helicase loading</a></h4>

              
                Replication origins are licensed by loading two Mcm2‑7 helicases around DNA in a head-to-head conformation poised to initiate bidirectional replication. This process requires ORC, Cdc6, and Cdt1. Although different Cdc6 and Cdt1 molecules load each helicase, whether two ORC proteins are required is unclear. Using colocalization single-molecule spectroscopy combined with FRET, we investigated interactions between ORC and Mcm2‑7 during helicase loading. In the large majority of events, we observed a single ORC molecule recruiting both Mcm2‑7/Cdt1 complexes via similar interactions that end upon Cdt1 release. Between first and second helicase recruitment, a rapid change in interactions between ORC and the first Mcm2-7 occurs. Within seconds, ORC breaks the interactions mediating first Mcm2-7 recruitment, releases from its initial DNA-binding site, and forms a new interaction with the opposite face of the first Mcm2-7. This rearrangement requires release of the first Cdt1 and tethers ORC as it flips over the first Mcm2-7 to form an inverted Mcm2‑7-ORC-DNA complex required for second-helicase recruitment. To ensure correct licensing, this complex is maintained until head-to-head interactions between the two helicases are formed. Our findings reconcile previous observations and reveal a highly-coordinated series of events through which a single ORC molecule can load two oppositely-oriented helicases.

                Dopamine is implicated in representing model-free (MF) reward prediction errors a as well as influencing model-based (MB) credit assignment and choice. Putative cooperative interactions between MB and MF systems include a guidance of MF credit assignment by MB inference. Here, we used a double-blind, placebo-controlled, within-subjects design to test an hypothesis that enhancing dopamine levels boosts the guidance of MF credit assignment by MB inference. In line with this, we found that levodopa enhanced guidance of MF credit assignment by MB inference, without impacting MF and MB influences directly. This drug effect correlated negatively with a dopamine-dependent change in purely MB credit assignment, possibly reflecting a trade-off between these two MB components of behavioural control. Our findings of a dopamine boost in MB inference guidance of MF learning highlights a novel DA influence on MB-MF cooperative interactions.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">How the insect central complex could coordinate multimodal navigation</a></h4>

              
                The central complex of the insect midbrain is thought to coordinate insect guidance strategies. Computational models can account for specific behaviours but their applicability across sensory and task domains remains untested. Here we assess the capacity of our previous model (Sun et al., 2020) of visual navigation to generalise to olfactory navigation and its coordination with other guidance in flies and ants. We show that fundamental to this capacity is the use of a biologically-plausible neural copy-and-shift mechanism that ensures sensory information is presented in a format compatible with the insect steering circuit regardless of its source. Moreover, the same mechanism is shown to allow the transfer cues from unstable/egocentric to stable/geocentric frames of reference providing a first account of the mechanism by which foraging insects robustly recover from environmental disturbances. We propose that these circuits can be flexibly repurposed by different insect navigators to address their unique ecological needs.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Cytoplasmic dynein-1 cargo diversity is mediated by the combinatorial assembly of FTS-Hook-FHIP complexes</a></h4>

              
                In eukaryotic cells, intracellular components are organized by the microtubule motors cytoplasmic dynein-1 (dynein) and kinesins, which are linked to cargos via adaptor proteins. While ~40 kinesins transport cargo toward the plus end of microtubules, a single dynein moves cargo in the opposite direction. How dynein transports a wide variety of cargos remains an open question. The FTS-Hook-FHIP ('FHF') cargo adaptor complex links dynein to cargo in mammals and fungi. As human cells have three Hooks and four FHIP proteins, we hypothesized that the combinatorial assembly of different Hook and FHIP proteins could underlie dynein cargo diversity. Using proteomic approaches, we determine the protein 'interactome' of each FHIP protein. Live-cell imaging and biochemical approaches show that different FHF complexes associate with distinct motile cargos. These complexes also move with dynein and its cofactor dynactin in single-molecule in vitro reconstitution assays. Complexes composed of FTS, FHIP1B, and Hook1/Hook3 co-localize with Rab5-tagged early endosomes via a direct interaction between FHIP1B and GTP-bound Rab5. In contrast, complexes composed of FTS, FHIP2A and Hook2 colocalize with Rab1A-tagged ER-to-Golgi cargos and FHIP2A is involved in the motility of Rab1A tubules. Our findings suggest that combinatorial assembly of different FTS-Hook-FHIP complexes is one mechanism dynein uses to achieve cargo specificity.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">ZAF, the first open source fully automated feeder for aquatic facilities</a></h4>

              
                In the past few decades, aquatic animals have become popular model organisms in biology, spurring a growing need for establishing aquatic facilities. Zebrafish are widely studied and relatively easy to culture using commercial systems. However, a challenging aspect of maintaining aquatic facilities is animal feeding, which is both time- and resourceconsuming. We have developed an open-source fully automatic daily feeding system, Zebrafish Automatic Feeder (ZAF). ZAF is reliable, provides a standardized amount of food to every tank, is cost-efficient and easy to build. The advanced version, ZAF+, allows for the precise control of food distribution as a function of fish density per tank, and has a user-friendly interface. Both ZAF and ZAF+ are adaptable to any laboratory environment and facilitate the implementation of aquatic colonies. Here we provide all blueprints and instructions for building the mechanics, electronics, fluidics, as well as to setup the control software and its user-friendly graphical interface. Importantly, the design is modular and can be scaled to meet different user needs. Furthermore, our results show that ZAF and ZAF+ do not adversely affect zebrafish culture, enabling fully automatic feeding for any aquatic facility.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Bidirectional synaptic plasticity rapidly modifies hippocampal representations</a></h4>

              
                Learning requires neural adaptations thought to be mediated by activity-dependent synaptic plasticity. A relatively non-standard form of synaptic plasticity driven by dendritic calcium spikes, or plateau potentials, has been reported to underlie place field formation in rodent hippocampal CA1 neurons. Here we found that this behavioral timescale synaptic plasticity (BTSP) can also reshape existing place fields via bidirectional synaptic weight changes that depend on the temporal proximity of plateau potentials to pre-existing place fields. When evoked near an existing place field, plateau potentials induced less synaptic potentiation and more depression, suggesting BTSP might depend inversely on postsynaptic activation. However, manipulations of place cell membrane potential and computational modeling indicated that this anti-correlation actually results from a dependence on current synaptic weight such that weak inputs potentiate and strong inputs depress. A network model implementing this bidirectional synaptic learning rule suggested that BTSP enables population activity, rather than pairwise neuronal correlations, to drive neural adaptations to experience.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Reverting the mode of action of the mitochondrial FOF1-ATPase by Legionella pneumophila preserves its replication niche</a></h4>

              
                <i>Legionella pneumophila</i>, the causative agent of Legionnaires'; disease, a severe pneumonia, injects <i>via</i> a type-IV-secretion-system (T4SS) more than 300 proteins into macrophages, its main host cell in humans. Certain of these proteins are implicated in reprogramming the metabolism of infected cells by reducing mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) early after infection. Here we show that despite reduced OXPHOS, the mitochondrial membrane potential (Δ<i>ψ</i><sub>m</sub>) is maintained during infection of primary human monocyte-derived macrophages (hMDMs). We reveal that <i>L. pneumophila</i> reverses the ATP-synthase activity of the mitochondrial F<sub>O</sub>F<sub>1</sub>-ATPase to ATP-hydrolase activity in a T4SS-dependent manner, which leads to a conservation of the Δ<i>ψ</i><sub>m</sub>, preserves mitochondrial polarization and prevents macrophage cell death. Analyses of T4SS effectors known to target mitochondrial functions revealed that <i>Lp</i>Spl is partially involved in conserving the Δ<i>ψ</i><sub>m</sub>, but not LncP and MitF. The inhibition of the <i>L. pneumophila</i>-induced 'reverse mode' of the F<sub>O</sub>F<sub>1</sub>-ATPase collapsed the Δ<i>ψ</i><sub>m</sub> and caused cell death in infected cells. Single-cell analyses suggested that bacterial replication occurs preferentially in hMDMs that conserved the Δ<i>ψ</i><sub>m</sub> and showed delayed cell death. This direct manipulation of the mode of activity of the F<sub>O</sub>F<sub>1</sub>-ATPase is a newly identified feature of <i>L. pneumophila</i> allowing to delay host cell death and thereby to preserve the bacterial replication niche during infection.

                Neurons in the primate Middle Temporal (MT) area signal information about visual motion and work together with the lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) to support memory-guided comparisons of visual motion direction. These areas are reciprocally connected and both contain neurons that signal visual motion direction in the strength of their responses. Previously, LPFC was shown to display marked changes in stimulus coding with altered task demands. Since MT and LPFC work together, we sought to determine if MT neurons display similar changes with heightened task demands. We hypothesized that heightened working-memory task demands would improve the task-relevant information and precipitate memory-related signals in MT. Here we show that engagement in a motion direction comparison task altered non-sensory activity and improved stimulus encoding by MT neurons. We found that this improvement in stimulus information transmission was largely due to preferential reduction in trial-to-trial variability within a sub-population of highly direction-selective neurons. We also found that a divisive normalization mechanism accounted for seemingly contradictory effects of task-demands on a heterogeneous population of neurons.

                Human cellular models of neurodegeneration require reproducibility and longevity, which is necessary for simulating these age-dependent diseases. Such systems are particularly needed for TDP-43 proteinopathies, which involve human-specific mechanisms that cannot be directly studied in animal models. To explore the emergence and consequences of TDP-43 pathologies, we generated iPSC-derived, colony morphology neural stem cells (iCoMoNSCs) via manual selection of neural precursors. Single-cell transcriptomics (scRNA-seq) and comparison to independent NSCs, showed that iCoMoNSCs are uniquely homogenous and self-renewing. Differentiated iCoMoNSCs formed a self-organized multicellular system consisting of synaptically connected and electrophysiologically active neurons, which matured into long-lived functional networks. Neuronal and glial maturation in iCoMoNSC-derived cultures was similar to that of cortical organoids. Overexpression of wild-type TDP-43 in a minority of iCoMoNSC-derived neurons led to progressive fragmentation and aggregation, resulting in loss of function and neurotoxicity. scRNA-seq revealed a novel set of misregulated RNA targets coinciding in both TDP-43 overexpressing neurons and patient brains exhibiting loss of nuclear TDP-43. The strongest misregulated target encoded for the synaptic protein NPTX2, which was consistently misaccumulated in ALS and FTLD patient neurons with TDP-43 pathology. Our work directly links TDP-43 misregulation and NPTX2 accumulation, thereby highlighting a new pathway of neurotoxicity.

Whether directional rate codes and the directionality of place field correlations are related, however, has so far not been explored and therefore the nature of how directional information is encoded in the cornu ammonis remains unresolved. Here, using a previously published dataset that contains the spike activity of rat hippocampal place cells in the CA1, CA2 and CA3 subregions during free foraging of male Long-Evans rats in a 2D environment, we found that rate and spike timing codes are related. Opposite to a place field's preferred firing rate direction spikes are more likely to undergo theta phase precession and, hence, more strongly impact paired correlations. Furthermore, we identified a subset of field pairs whose theta correlations are intrinsic in that they maintain the same firing order when the running direction is reversed. Both effects are associated with differences in theta phase distributions, and are more prominent in CA3 than CA1. We thus hypothesize that intrinsic spiking is most prominent when the directionally modulated sensory-motor drive of hippocampal firing rates is minimal, suggesting that extrinsic and intrinsic sequences contribute to phase precession as two distinct mechanisms.

                The neural mechanisms of visual conscious perception have been investigated for decades. However, the spatiotemporal dynamics associated with the earliest neural responses following consciously perceived stimuli are still poorly understood. Using a dataset of intracranial EEG recordings, the current study aims to investigate the neural activity changes associated with the earliest stages of visual conscious perception. Subjects (N=10, 1,693 grey matter electrode contacts) completed a continuous performance task in which individual letters were presented in series and subjects were asked to press a button when they saw a target letter. Broadband gamma power (40-115Hz) dynamics were analyzed in comparison to baseline prior to stimulus and contrasted for target trials with button presses and non-target trials without button presses. Regardless of event type, we observed early gamma power changes within 30-150 ms from stimulus onset in a network including increases in bilateral occipital, fusiform, frontal (including frontal eye fields), and medial temporal cortex, increases in left lateral parietal-temporal cortex, and decreases in the right anterior medial occipital cortex. No significant differences were observed between target and non-target stimuli until >150 ms post-stimulus, when we saw greater gamma power increases in left motor and premotor areas, suggesting a possible role of these later signals in perceptual decision making and/or motor responses with the right hand. The early gamma power findings suggest a broadly distributed cortical visual detection network that is engaged at early times tens of milliseconds after signal transduction from the retina.

                Bayesian models of autism suggest that disruptions in context-sensitive prediction error weighting may underpin sensory perceptual alterations, such as hypersensitivities. We used an auditory oddball paradigm with pure tones arising from high or low uncertainity contexts to determine whether autistic individuals display differences in context adjustment relative to neurotypicals. We did not find group differences in early prediction error responses indexed by mismatch negativity. However, the autism group had larger evoked responses to outliers, at 300ms latency suggesting a greater reorienting of attention to surprising sounds. A dimensional approach revealed a positive correlation between context-dependent prediction errors and auditory sensitivities, but not with autistic traits. These findings suggest that autism studies may benefit from accounting for sensory sensitivities in group comparisons.

                Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are lipid bilayer enclosed structures that not only represent a newly discovered means for cell-to-cell communication but may also serve as promising disease biomarkers and therapeutic tools. Apart from proteins, lipids, and metabolites, EVs can deliver genetic information such as mRNA eliciting a response in the recipient cells. In the present study, we have analyzed the mRNA content of brain-derived EVs (BDEVs) isolated 72 hours after experimental stroke in mice and compared them to controls (shams) using the nCounter(R) Nanostring panels, with or without prior RNA isolation from BDEVs. We found that both panels show similar results when comparing upregulated mRNA in stroke. Notably, the higher upregulated mRNAs were related to processes of stress and immune system responses, but also to anatomical structure development, cell differentiation, and extracellular matrix organization, indicating that regenerative mechanisms are already taking place at this time-point. The five top overexpressed mRNAs in stroke mice compared to shams were confirmed by RT-qPCR and, interestingly, were found to be present as full-length open-reading frame in BDEVs. We could reveal that the majority of the mRNA cargo in BDEVs was of microglial origin and probably predominantly present in small BDEVs ([&le;]200 nm in diameter). However, the EV population with the highest increase in the total BDEVs pool at 72 h after stroke was of oligodendrocytic origin. Our study shows that nCounter(R) panels are a good tool to study mRNA content in tissue-derived EVs as they can be carried out even without previous mRNA isolation and that the mRNA cargo of BDEVs indicates their participation in inflammatory but also recovery processes after stroke.

                TDP-43 proteinopathy is the major pathological hallmark of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and tau-negative frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Mounting evidence implicates a loss of normal TDP-43 function in neurodegeneration, either resultant from or independent of TDP-43 aggregation. TDP-43 knockdown is therefore a common paradigm for modelling ALS and FTD. However, because TDP-43 can interact directly with thousands of mRNA targets and regulate the function of other RNA binding proteins, the phenotype of TDP-43 depletion is likely to differ depending on the proteomic and transcriptomic profile of the model cell type. Here, we conducted a meta-analysis of publicly available RNA-sequencing datasets that utilized TDP-43 knockdown to model ALS or FTD, and validated these against RNA-sequencing data from TDP-43-immunonegative neuronal nuclei from ALS/FTD brain. We present these analyses as easy-to-use interactive graphical databases. Of 9 TDP-43-knockdown datasets identified, 4 showed significant depletion of TARDBP (human HeLa and SH-SY5Y cell lines, induced human motor neurons, and mouse striatal tissue). There was little overlap in differentially expressed genes between TDP-43-knockdown model cell types, but PFKP, RANBP1, KIAA1324, ELAVL3, and STMN2 were among the common TDP-43 targets. Of these, only STMN2 was validated as a differentially expressed gene in TDP-43-immunonegative neuronal nuclei in ALS/FTD brain. Similarly, there were few genes that showed common patterns of differential exon usage between cell types and which validated in TDP-43-immunonegative neurons, but these included well-known targets POLDIP3, RANBP1, STMN2, and UNC13A, and novel targets EXD3, CEP290, KPNA4, and MMAB. Enrichment analysis showed that TDP-43 knockdown in different cell types affected a unique range of biological pathways. Together, these data identify novel TDP-43 targets, validate known TDP-43 targets, and show that TDP-43 plays both conserved and cell-type-specific roles in the regulation of gene expression and splicing. Identification of cell-type-specific TDP-43 targets will enable sensitive mapping of cell-autonomous TDP-43 dysfunction beyond just neurons, while shared TDP-43 targets are likely to have therapeutic value across myriad cell types.

                2-arachidonoyl-glycerol (2-AG), the most abundant endocannabinoid (eCB) in the brain, regulates diverse neural functions. However, whether 2-AG deficiency contributes to Parkinson's disease (PD) and nigral dopaminergic neurons (DANs) dysfunction is unclear. Diacylglycerol lipase A and B (DAGLA and DAGLB) mediate the biosynthesis of 2-AG. Using homozygosity mapping and whole-exome sequencing, we linked multiple homozygous loss-of-function mutations in DAGLB to a form of early-onset autosomal recessive PD. We then used RNA sequencing and fiber photometry with genetically encoded eCB sensors to demonstrate that DAGLB is the main 2-AG synthase in nigral DANs. Genetic knockdown of Daglb by CRISPR/Cas9 in mouse nigral DANs substantially reduces 2-AG levels in the substantia nigra (SN). The SN 2-AG levels are markedly correlated with the vigor of movement during the acquisition of motor skills, while Daglb-deficiency impairs motor learning. Conversely, pharmacological enhancement of 2-AG levels increases nigral DAN activity and dopamine release and improves motor learning. Together, we demonstrate that DAGLB-deficiency contributes to the etiopathogenesis of PD, reveal the importance of DAGLB-mediated 2-AG biosynthesis in nigral DANs in regulating neural activity and dopamine release, and provide preclinical evidence for the beneficial effects of 2-AG augmentation in PD treatment.

                Dopamine facilitates approach to reward via its actions on dopamine receptors in the nucleus accumbens. For example, blocking either D1 or D2 dopamine receptors in the accumbens reduces the proportion of reward-predictive cues to which rats respond with cued approach. Recent evidence indicates that accumbens dopamine also promotes wakefulness and arousal, but the relationship between dopamine's roles in arousal and reward seeking remains unexplored. Here, we show that the ability of systemic or intra-accumbens injections of the D1 antagonist SCH23390 to reduce cued approach to reward depends on the animal's state of arousal. Handling the animal, a manipulation known to increase arousal, was sufficient to reverse the behavioral effects of the antagonist. In addition, SCH23390 reduced spontaneous locomotion and increased time spent in sleep postures, both consistent with reduced arousal, but also increased time spent immobile in postures inconsistent with sleep. In contrast, the ability of the D2 antagonist haloperidol to reduce cued approach was not reversible by handling. Haloperidol reduced spontaneous locomotion but did not increase sleep postures, instead increasing immobility in non-sleep postures. We place these results in the context of the extensive literature on dopamine's contributions to behavior, and propose the arousal-motor hypothesis, a novel synthesis that accounts both for our findings and many previous results that have drawn disparate and conflicting conclusions.

                Serotonin (5-Hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) 2A receptor (5-HT2AR) signaling is essential for the actions of classical psychedelic drugs. In this study, we examined whether random sequence variations in the gene (single nucleotide polymorphisms, SNPs) encoding the 5-HT2AR affect the signaling of four commonly used psychedelic drugs. We examined the in vitro pharmacology of seven non-synonymous SNPs, which give rise to S12N, T25N, D48N, I197V, A230T, A447V, and H452Y variant 5-HT2A serotonin receptors. We found that these non-synonymous SNPs exert statistically significant, although modest, effects on the efficacy and potency of four therapeutically relevant hallucinogens. Significantly, the in vitro pharmacological effects of the SNPs drug actions at 5-HT2AR are drug specific.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Escape Steering by Cholecystokinin Peptidergic Signaling</a></h4>

              
                Escape is an evolutionarily conserved and essential avoidance response. Considered to be innate, most studies on escape responses focused on hard-wired circuits. We report here that peptidergic signaling is an integral and necessary component of the Caenorhabditis elegans escape circuit. Combining genetic screening, electrophysiology, and calcium imaging, we reveal that a neuropeptide NLP-18 and its cholecystokinin receptor CKR-1 enable the escape circuit to execute a full omega turn, the last motor step where the animal robustly steers away from its original trajectory. We demonstrate in vivo and in vitro that CKR-1 is a Gq protein-coupled receptor for NLP-18. in vivo, NLP-18 is mainly secreted by the gustatory sensory neuron (ASI) to activate CKR-1 in the head motor neuron (SMD) and the turn-initiating interneuron (AIB). Removal of NLP-18, removal of CKR-1, or specific knockdown of CKR-1 in SMD or AIB neurons lead to shallower turns hence less robust escape steering. Consistently, the Ca2+ transients elevation of head motor neuron SMD during escape steering is attenuated upon the removal of NLP-18 or CKR-1. in vitro, synthetic NLP-18 directly evokes CKR-1-dependent currents in oocytes and CKR-1-dependent Ca2+ transients in SMD. Thus, cholecystokinin signaling modulates an escape circuit to generate robust escape steering.

                During fear learning, defensive behaviors need to be finely balanced, to allow animals to return to normal behaviors after the termination of threat-indicating sensory cues. Nevertheless, the circuits underlying such balancing are largely unknown. Here, we investigate the role of direct (D1R+) - and indirect (Adora+) pathway neurons of the amygdala-striatal transition zone (AStria) in fear learning. In-vivo Ca2+ imaging revealed that fear learning increased the responses of D1R+ AStria neurons to an auditory CS, given that the animal moved. In Adora+ neurons, fear learning also induced a differential activity during freezing and movement, albeit with little influence of the CS. In-vivo optogenetic silencing during the training day showed that plasticity in D1R+ AStria neurons contributes to auditory-cued fear memories, whereas Adora+ neurons suppressed learned freezing when no CS was present. Circuit tracing experiments identified cortical input structures to the AStria, and recording of optogenetically-evoked EPSCs at the corresponding projection revealed different forms of long-term plasticity at synapses onto D1R+ and Adora+ AStria neurons. Taken together, direct- and indirect pathways neurons of the AStria show differential signs of in-vivo and ex-vivo plasticity after fear learning, and balance defensive behaviors in the presence and absence of aversively motivated sensory cues.

                Female sexual behavior as an innate behavior is of prominent biological importance for survival and reproduction. However, molecular and circuit mechanisms underlying female sexual behavior is not well understood. Here, we identify the Cholecystokinin-like peptide Drosulfakinin (DSK) promotes female sexual behavior in Drosophila. Manipulation both Dsk and DSK neuronal activity impact female sexual receptivity. In addition, we reveal that Dsk-expressing neurons receive input signal from R71G01GAL4 neurons to promote female sexual receptivity. Based on intersectional technique, we further found the regulation of female sexual behavior relies mainly on medial DSK neurons rather than lateral DSK neurons, and medial DSK neurons modulate female sexual behavior by acting on its receptor CCKLR-17D3. Thus, we characterized DSK/CCKLR-17D3 as R71G01GAL4 neurons downstream signaling to regulate female sexual behavior.

                Gustatory sensory neurons detect caloric and harmful compounds in potential food and convey this information to the brain to inform feeding decisions. To examine the signals that gustatory neurons transmit and receive, we reconstructed gustatory axons and their synaptic sites in the adult Drosophila melanogaster brain, utilizing a whole-brain electron microscopy volume. We reconstructed 87 gustatory projections from the proboscis labellum in the right hemisphere and 57 in the left, representing the majority of labellar gustatory axons. Morphology- and connectivity-based clustering revealed six distinct clusters, likely representing neurons recognizing different taste modalities. Gustatory neurons contain a nearly equal number of interspersed pre-and post-synaptic sites, with extensive synaptic connectivity among gustatory axons. The vast majority of synaptic connections are between morphologically similar neurons, although connections also exist between distinct neuronal subpopulations. This study resolves the anatomy of labellar gustatory projections, reveals that gustatory projections are likely segregated based on taste modality, and uncovers synaptic connections that may alter the transmission of gustatory signals.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Role of anterior insula cortex in context-induced relapse of nicotine-seeking</a></h4>

              
                Tobacco use is the leading cause of preventable death worldwide, and relapse during abstinence remains the key barrier to successful treatment of tobacco addiction. During abstinence, environmental contexts associated with nicotine use can induce craving and contribute to relapse. The insular cortex (IC) is thought to be a critical substrate of nicotine addiction and relapse. However, its specific role in context-induced relapse of nicotine-seeking is not fully known. In this study, we report a novel rodent model of context-induced relapse to nicotine-seeking after punishment-imposed abstinence, which models self-imposed abstinence through increasing negative consequences of excessive drug use. Using the neuronal activity marker Fos we find that the anterior (aIC), but not the middle or posterior IC, shows increased activity during context-induced relapse. Combining Fos with retrograde labelling of aIC inputs, we show projections to aIC from contralateral aIC and basolateral amygdala exhibit increased activity during context-induced relapse. Next, we used fiber photometry in aIC and observed phasic increases in aIC activity around nicotine-seeking responses during self-administration, punishment, and the context-induced relapse tests. Next, we used chemogenetic inhibition in both male and female rats to determine whether activity in aIC is necessary for context-induced relapse. We found that chemogenetic inhibition of aIC decreased context-induced nicotine-seeking after either punishment- or extinction-imposed abstinence. These findings highlight the critical role nicotine-associated contexts play in promoting relapse, and they show that aIC activity is critical for this context-induced relapse following both punishment and extinction imposed abstinence.

                Extensive serotonin (5-HT) innervation throughout the brain corroborates 5-HTs modulatory role in numerous cognitive activities. Volume transmission is the major mode for 5-HT transmission but mechanisms underlying 5-HT signaling are still largely unknown. Abnormal brain 5-HT levels and function have been implicated in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Neurexin (Nrxn) genes encode presynaptic cell adhesion molecules important for the regulation of synaptic neurotransmitter release, notably glutamatergic and GABAergic transmission. Mutations in Nrxn genes are associated with neurodevelopmental disorders including ASD. However, the role of Nrxn genes in the 5-HT system is poorly understood. Here, we generated a mouse model with all three Nrxn genes disrupted specifically in 5-HT neurons to study how Nrxns affect 5-HT transmission. Loss of Nrxns in 5-HT neurons impaired 5-HT release in the dorsal raphe nucleus and dorsal hippocampus and decreased serotonin transporter distribution in specific brain areas. Furthermore, 5-HT neuron-specific Nrxn knockout reduced sociability and increased depressive-like behavior. Our results highlight functional roles for Nrxns in 5-HT neurotransmission and the execution of complex behaviors.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Stress-impaired reward pathway promotes distinct feeding behavior patterns</a></h4>

              
                Psychosocial stress can impact feeding behavior outcomes. Although many studies have examined alterations to food intake, little is known about how stress affects feeding behavior patterns. To determine the impact of psychological stress on feeding behavior patterns, mice were subjected to various psychosocial stressors (social isolation, intermittent high-fat-diet, or physical restraint) prior to timed observations in a feeding arena that incorporated multiple bait loci. In addition, in vivo microdialysis was used to assess the effects of stressors on the reward system by measuring dopamine levels in the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) shell. Impaired feeding behavior patterns characterized by significant deviations in bait selection (i.e. fixated feeding) and prolonged periods of eating (i.e. protracted feeding) were observed in stressed mice relative to non-stressed controls. In addition to clear behavioral effects, the stressors also negatively impacted dopamine levels at the nucleus accumbens shell. Normalization of dopamine reversed the fixated feeding behavior, whereas specifically inhibiting neuronal activity in the dopaminergic neurons of the ventral tegmental area that project to the nucleus accumbens shell caused similar impairments in feeding. Given that the deviations were not consistently accompanied by changes in the amount of bait consumed, body weight, or metabolic factors, the qualitative effects of psychosocial stressors on feeding behavior likely reflect perturbations to a critical pathway in the mesolimbic dopamine system. These findings provide compelling evidence that aberrations in feeding behavior patterns can be developed as sensitive biomarkers of psychosocial stress and possibly a prodromal state of neuropsychiatric diseases.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">High-Speed Low-Light In Vivo Two-Photon Voltage Imaging of Large Neuronal Populations</a></h4>

              
                Monitoring spiking activity across large neuronal populations at behaviorally relevant timescales is critical for understanding neural circuit function. Unlike calcium imaging, voltage imaging requires kilohertz sampling rates which reduces fluorescence detection to near shot noise levels. High-photon flux excitation can overcome photon-limited shot noise but photo-bleaching and photo-damage restricts the number and duration of simultaneously imaged neurons. We investigated an alternative approach aimed at low two-photon flux, voltage imaging below the shot noise limit. This framework involved developing: a positive-going voltage indicator with improved spike detection (SpikeyGi); an ultra-fast two-photon microscope for kilohertz frame-rate imaging across a 0.4x0.4mm2 field of view, and; a self-supervised denoising algorithm (DeepVID) for inferring fluorescence from shot-noise limited signals. Through these combined advances, we achieved simultaneous high-speed, deep-tissue imaging of more than one hundred densely-labeled neurons over one hour in awake behaving mice. This demonstrates a scalable approach for voltage imaging across increasing neuronal populations.

                Sleep inertia is the brief period of impaired alertness and performance experienced immediately after waking. While the neurobehavioral symptoms of sleep inertia are well-described, less is known about the neural mechanisms underlying this phenomenon. A better understanding of the neural processes during sleep inertia may offer insight into the cognitive impairments observed and the awakening process generally. We observed brain activity following abrupt awakening from slow wave sleep during the biological night. Using electroencephalography (EEG) and a network science approach, we evaluated power, clustering coefficient, and path length across frequency bands under both a control condition and a blue-enriched light intervention condition in a within-subject design. We found that under control conditions, the awakening brain is typified by an immediate reduction in global theta, alpha, and beta power. Simultaneously, we observed a decrease in the clustering coefficient and an increase in path length within the delta band. Exposure to blue-enriched light immediately after awakening ameliorated these changes, but only for clustering. Our results suggest that long-range network communication within the brain is crucial to the waking process and that the brain may prioritize these long-range connections during this transitional state. Our study highlights a novel neurophysiological signature of the awakening brain and provides a potential mechanistic explanation for the effect of light in improving performance after waking.

                Central nervous system macroglia (astrocytes and oligodendrocytes) are required for normal brain development and function, and are among the last cells to emerge during neurodevelopment. Many questions remain about their emergence in the brain and spinal cord, including how early glial fates are specified during development or differen- tiation, and similarly when subtypes of glia are specified. Here, we used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) to analyze ~90,000 cells across multiple timepoints during the differentiation of astrocytes and oligodendrocytes from human induced pluripotent stem cells and mouse embryonic stem cells. Using time series analysis of gene expres- sion, we uncovered multiple genes involved in fate specification of glial subtypes in both species. We examined gene expression changes during intermediate states of glial specification, and were able to identify genes that were correlated with the choice between neuron versus glia in both species. Using our scRNAseq data we optimized previous mouse astrocyte differentiation protocols by highlighting and removing non-required transition states and decreasing the overall protocol from 3 weeks to less than 12 days. Our data will be useful for researchers interested in optimizing glial differentiations in either species, and provide a window into human glial differentiation, which is difficult to study given its lateness in development.

                Interpreting the influx of microscopy and neuroimaging data is bottlenecked by neuronal reconstruction's long-standing issues in accuracy, automation, and scalability. Rapidly increasing data size is particularly concerning for modern computing infrastructure due to the wall in memory bandwidth which historically has witnessed the slowest rate of technological advancement. Recut is an end to end reconstruction pipeline that takes raw large-volume light microscopy images and yields filtered or tuned automated neuronal reconstructions that require minimal proofreading and no other manual intervention. By leveraging adaptive grids and other methods, Recut also has a unified data representation with up to a 509x reduction in memory footprint resulting in an 89.5x throughput increase and enabling an effective 64x increase in the scale of volumes that can be skeletonized on servers or resource limited devices. Recut also employs coarse and fine-grained parallelism to achieve speedup factors beyond CPU core count in sparse settings when compared to the current fastest reconstruction method. By leveraging the sparsity in light microscopy datasets, this can allow full brains to be processed in-memory, a property which may significantly shift the compute needs of the neuroimaging community. The scale and speed of Recut fundamentally changes the reconstruction process, allowing an interactive yet deeply automated workflow.

                GABA is canonically known as the principal inhibitory neurotransmitter in the nervous system, usually acting by hyper-polarizing membrane potential. However, GABAergic currents can also exhibit non-inhibitory effects, depending on the brain region, developmental stage or pathological condition. Here, we investigate the diverse effects of GABA on the firing rate of several single neuron models, using both analytical calculations and numerical simulations. We find that the relationship between GABAergic synaptic conductance and output firing rate exhibits three qualitatively different regimes as a function of GABA reversal potential, {nu}GABA: monotonically decreasing for sufficiently low {nu}GABA (inhibitory), monotonically increasing for {nu}GABA above firing threshold (excitatory); and a non-monotonic region for intermediate values of {nu}GABA. In the non-monotonic regime, small GABA conductances have an excitatory effect while large GABA conductances show an inhibitory effect. We provide a phase diagram of different GABAergic effects as a function of GABA reversal potential and glutamate conductance. We find that noisy inputs increase the range of {nu}GABA for which the non-monotonic effect can be observed. We also construct a micro-circuit model of striatum to explain observed effects of GABAergic fast spiking interneurons on spiny projection neurons, including non-monotonicity, as well as the heterogeneity of the effects. Our work provides a mechanistic explanation of paradoxical effects of GABAergic synaptic inputs, with implications for understanding the effects of GABA in neural computation and development.

                Surrounding context influences speech listening, resulting in dynamic shifts to category percepts. To examine its neural basis, event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded during vowel identification with continua presented in random, forward, and backward orders to induce perceptual nonlinearities. Behaviorally, sequential order shifted listeners' categorical boundary vs. random delivery revealing perceptual warping (biasing) of the heard phonetic category dependent on recent stimulus history. ERPs revealed later (~300 ms) activity localized to superior temporal and middle/inferior frontal gyri that predicted listeners' hysteresis magnitudes. Findings demonstrate that top-down, stimulus history effects on speech categorization are governed by interactions between frontotemporal brain regions.

                There are multiple levels of processing relevant to reading that vary in their visual, sublexical and lexical orthographic processing demands. Segregating distinct cortical sources for each of these levels has been challenging in EEG studies of early readers. To address this challenge, we applied recent advances in analyzing high-density EEG using Steady-State Visual Evoked Potentials (SSVEPs) via data-driven Reliable Components Analysis (RCA) in a group of early readers spanning from kindergarten to second grade. Three controlled stimulus contrasts---familiar words versus unfamiliar pseudofonts, familiar words versus orthographically legal pseudowords, and orthographically legal pseudowords versus orthographically illegal nonwords---were used to isolate visual print/letter selectivity, sublexical processing, and lexical processing, respectively. We found robust responses specific to each of these processing levels, even in kindergarteners who have limited knowledge of print. Moreover, comparing amplitudes of these three stimulus contrasts across three reading fluency-based groups and three grade-based groups revealed fluency group and grade group main effects only for lexical contrast (i.e., words versus orthographically legal pseudowords). Furthermore, we found that sublexical orthography-related responses shifted their topographic distribution from the right to left hemisphere from kindergarten to first and second grades. Results suggest that, with more sensitive measures, the sublexical and lexical fine tuning for words---as a bio-marker of reading ability---can be detected at a much earlier stage than previously assumed.

                Diet induced obesity is one of the major causes of obesity, which affects 13% of the world's adult population. Obesity is correlated to chronic pain regardless of other components of the metabolic syndrome. Our study focuses on investigating the effect of high-fat diet induced obesity on peripheral sensory neurons activity and pain perception, followed by deciphering the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms that involve Acid-Sensing Ion Channel 3 (ASIC3). We show here that heat sensitive C-fibers from mice made obese by consumption of a high-fat diet exhibited an increased activity during baseline and upon heating. Obese mice showed long-lasting heat pain hypersensitivity once obesity was well established, while mechanical sensitivity was not affected. We found that the serum of obese mice was enriched in lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) species (LPC16:0, LPC18:0 and LPC18:1), which activate ASIC3 channels and increased peripheral neuron excitability. Genetic deletion and in vivo pharmacological inhibition of ASIC3 protected and rescued mice from obesity-induced thermal hypersensitivity. Our results identify ASIC3 channels in DRG neurons and circulating LPC species that activate them as a mechanism contributing to heat pain hypersensitivity associated with high-fat diet induced obesity.

                Since their development, social media has grown as a source of information and has a significant impact on opinion formation. Individuals interact with others and content via social media platforms in a variety of ways but it remains unclear how decision making and associated neural processes are impacted by the online sharing of informational content, from factual to fabricated. Here, we use EEG to estimate dynamic reconfigurations of brain networks and probe the neural changes underlying opinion change (or formation) within individuals interacting with a simulated social media platform. Our findings indicate that the individuals who show more malleable opinions are characterized by less frequent network reconfigurations while those with more rigid opinions tend to have more flexible brain networks with frequent reconfigurations. The nature of these frequent network configurations suggests a fundamentally different thought process between the individuals who are more easily influenced by social media and those who are not. We also show that these reconfigurations are distinct to the brain dynamics during an in-person discussion with strangers on the same content. Together, these findings suggest that network reconfigurations in the brain may not only be diagnostic to the informational context but also the underlie opinion formation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neural Oscillatory Characteristics of Feedback Associated Activity in Globus Pallidus Interna</a></h4>

              
                Neural oscillatory activities in basal ganglia have prominent roles in cognitive processes on local and global scales. However, the characteristics of high frequency oscillatory activities during cognitive tasks have not been extensively explored in human Globus Pallidus internus (GPi). This study aimed to investigate amplitude and interhemispheric coupling of bilateral GPi high gamma bursts in dystonia and Parkinson's Disease (PD) patients, in on and off medication states, after feedback during the Intra-Extra-Dimension shift (IED) task. Bilateral GPi Local Field Potentials (LFP) activity was recorded via externalized DBS electrodes during the IED task. Inter hemisphere phase synchrony was assessed using Inter-Site Phase Clustering (ISPC). Transient high gamma activity (~100-150Hz) was observed immediately after feedback in the dystonia patient. Moreover, these bursts were phase synchronous between left and right GPis with an antiphase clustering of phase differences. In contrast, no synchronous high gamma activity was detected in the PD patient with or without dopamine administration. The off-med PD patient displayed enhanced low frequency clusters ameliorated by medication in the on-med state. Furthermore, an increased low frequency activity was observed after feedback of incorrect trials in both disease states. The current study provides a rare report of antiphase homotopic synchrony in human GPi, potentially related to incorporating and processing feedback information. The absence of these activities in off and on-med PD indicates the potential presence of impaired medication independent circuits related to feedback processing. Together, these findings are helpful in pointing to the potential role of GPi's synchronized high frequency activity in cognitive tasks and feedback information processing.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Transparent and Conformal Microcoil Arrays for Spatially Selective Neuronal Activation</a></h4>

              
                Magnetic stimulation represents a compelling modality for achieving neuronal activation with high spatial resolution and low toxicity. Stimulation coils can be designed to achieve localized, spatially asymmetric fields that target neurons of a particular orientation. Furthermore, these devices may be encapsulated within biopolymers thereby avoiding direct metal/tissue interfaces that could induce chronic inflammation and glial scarring. Herein, we report a multiplexed microcoil array for localized activation of cortical neurons and retinal ganglion cells. We designed a computational model that related the activation function to the geometry and arrangement of coils, and selected a geometry with a region of activation <50 microns wide. We then fabricated SU8/Cu/SU8 tri-layer devices which were flexible, transparent and conformal and featured four individually-addressable microcoil stimulation elements. Interfaced with ex vivo cortex or retina slices from GCaMP6-transfected mice, we observed that individual neurons located within 40 microns of the element tip could be activated repeatedly and in a dose (power) dependent fashion. Taken together, these results highlight the potential of magnetic stimulation devices for brain-machine interfaces and could open new routes toward bioelectronic therapies including prosthetic vision devices.

                Loss-of-function variants in SYNAGP1 cause a developmental encephalopathy defined by cognitive impairment, autistic features, and epilepsy. SYNAGP1 splicing leads to expression of distinct functional protein isoforms. Splicing imparts pleiotropic cellular functions of SynGAP proteins through coding of distinct C-terminal motifs. However, it remains unknown how these different splice sequences function in vivo to regulate neuronal function and behavior. Reduced expression of SynGAP-1/2 C-terminal splice variants in mice caused severe phenotypes, including reduced survival, impaired learning, and reduced seizure latency. In contrast, upregulation of 1/2 expression improved learning and increased seizure latency. Mice expressing 1-specific mutations, which disrupted SynGAP cellular functions without altering protein expression, promoted seizure, disrupted synapse plasticity, and impaired learning. These findings demonstrate that endogenous SynGAP isoforms with 1/2 spliced sequences promote cognitive function and impart seizure protection. Regulation of SynGAP- expression or function may be a viable therapeutic strategy to broadly improve cognitive function and mitigate seizure.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The Spatial Reach of Neuronal Coherence and Spike-field Coupling across the Human Neocortex</a></h4>

              
                Neuronal coherence is thought to be a fundamental mechanism of communication in the brain, where synchronized field potentials coordinate synaptic and spiking events to support plasticity and learning. Although the spread of field potentials has garnered great interest, little is known about the spatial reach of phase synchronization, or neuronal coherence. Functional connectivity between different brain regions is known to occur across long distances, but the locality of coherence within a brain region is understudied. Here we used simultaneous recordings from electrocorticography (ECoG) grids and high-density microelectrode arrays to estimate the spatial reach of neuronal coherence and spike-field coherence (SFC) across frontal, temporal, and occipital cortices during cognitive tasks in humans. We observed the strongest coherence within a 2-3 cm distance from the microelectrode arrays, potentially defining an effective range for local communication. This range was relatively consistent across brain regions, spectral frequencies, and cognitive tasks. The magnitude of coherence showed power law decay with increasing distance from the microelectrode arrays, where the highest coherence occurred between ECoG contacts, followed by coherence between ECoG and deep cortical LFP, and then SFC (i.e., ECoG > LFP > SFC). The spectral frequency of coherence also affected its magnitude. Alpha coherence (8-14 Hz) was generally higher than other frequencies for signals nearest the microelectrode arrays, whereas delta coherence (1-3 Hz) was higher for signals that were farther away. Action potentials in all brain regions were most coherent with the phase of alpha oscillations, which suggests that alpha waves could play a larger, more spatially local role in spike timing than other frequencies. These findings provide a deeper understanding of the spatial and spectral dynamics of neuronal coherence, further advancing knowledge about how activity propagates across the human brain.

	<p>Aggressive behavior is modulated by many factors, including personality and cognition, as well as endocrine and neural changes. To study the potential effects on the reaction to provocation, which was realized by an ostensible opponent subtracting money from the participant, we administered testosterone (T) and arginine vasopressin (AVP) or a respective placebo (PL). Forty males underwent a functional magnetic resonance imaging session while performing a provocation paradigm. We investigated differential hormone effects and the potential influence of Machiavellian traits on punishment choices (monetary subtractions by the participant) in the paradigm. Participants in the T/AVP group subtracted more money when they were not provoked but showed increased activation in the inferior frontal gyrus and inferior parietal lobule during feedback compared to PL. Higher Machiavellian traits significantly increased punishing behavior independent of provocation only in this group. The pilot study shows that T/AVP affects neural and behavioral responses during a provocation paradigm while personality characteristics, such as Machiavellian trait patterns, specifically interact with hormonal influences (T/AVP) and their effects on behavior.</p>

	<p>Nasal breathing is a dynamic cortical organizer involved in various behaviors and states, such as locomotion, exploration, memory, emotion, introspection. However, the effect of sensory deprivation of nasal respiratory breath (NRD) on behavior remain poorly understood. Herein, general locomotor activity, emotion, learning and memory, social interaction, and mechanical pain were evaluated using a zinc sulfate nasal irrigation induced nasal respiratory sensory deprivation animal model (ZnSO4-induced mouse model). In the open field test, the elevated O-maze test, and forced swim test, NRD mice exhibited depressive and anxiety-like behaviors. In memory-associated tests, NRD mice showed cognitive impairments in the hippocampal-dependent memory (Y maze, object recognition task, and contextual fear conditioning (CFC)) and amygdala-dependent memory (the tone-cued fear conditioning test (TFC)). Surprisingly, NRD mice did not display deficits in the acquisition of conditional fear in both CFC and TFC tests. Still, they showed significant memory retrieval impairment in TFC and enhanced memory retrieval in CFC. At the same time, in the social novelty test using a three-chamber setting, NRD mice showed impaired social and social novelty behavior. Lastly, in the von Frey filaments test, we found that the pain sensitivity of NRD mice was reduced. In conclusion, this NRD mouse model showed a variety of behavioral phenotypic changes, which could offer an important insight into the behavioral impacts of patients with anosmia or those with an impaired olfactory bulb (OB) (e.g., in COVID-19, Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease, Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease, etc.).</p>

	<p>Purpose: the evaluation of body image perception, pain coping strategies, and dream content, together with phantom limb and telescoping phenomena in patients with sarcoma who underwent surgery for limb amputation. Material and Methods: consecutive outpatients were evaluated at T0 (within 3 weeks after surgery) and T1 (4&amp;amp;ndash;6 months after surgery) as follows: demographic and clinical data collection; the Groningen Questionnaire Problems after Arm Amputation; the West Haven-Yale Multidimensional Pain Inventory; the Body Image Concern Inventory, a clinical trial to identify telescoping; and a weekly diary of dreams. Dream contents were coded according to the Hall and Van de Castle coding system. Results: Twenty patients completed the study (15 males and 5 females, mean age: 53.9 &amp;amp;plusmn; 24.6, education: 7.8 &amp;amp;plusmn; 3.4). All subjects experienced phantom limb and 35% of them experienced telescoping soon after surgery, and 25% still after 4&amp;amp;ndash;6 months. Both at T0 and T1, that half of the subjects reported dreams about still having their missing limbs. At T1 the patients&amp;amp;rsquo; perceptions of being able to deal with problems were lower, and pain and its interference in everyday life were higher yet associated with significant engagement in everyday activities and an overall good mood. The dream content analysis highlighted that males were less worried about health problems soon after amputation, and women showed more initial difficulties that seemed to be resolved after 4&amp;amp;ndash;6 months after surgery. Conclusions: The dream content analysis may improve clinicians&amp;amp;rsquo; ability to support their patients during their therapeutic course.</p>

With some, but not all, neurological symptoms subsiding after transplantation, the presence of brain damage can impair both the short and long-term outcome. We tested if Cerebrolysin can prevent brain injury in an experimental model of non-viral liver damage in mice. Behavior, abdominal ultrasound evaluation and immunohistochemistry were used to evaluate the animals. No ultrasound or behavior differences were found between the control and treated animals, with both groups displaying more anxiety and no short-term memory benefit compared to sham mice. Cerebrolysin treatment was able to maintain a normal level of cortical NeuN+ cells and induced an increase in the area occupied by BrdU+ cells. Surprisingly, no difference was observed when investigating Iba1+ cells. With neurological complications of end-stage liver disease impacting the rehabilitation of patients receiving liver grafts, a neuroprotective treatment of patients on the waiting lists might improve their rehabilitation outcome by ensuring a minimal cerebral damage.</p>

	<p>After reviewing seminal studies using optogenetics to interrogate the functional role of the locus coeruleus in behavior, we conclude that differences in firing rates and firing patterns of locus coeruleus neurons contribute to locus coeruleus nucleus heterogeneity by recruiting different output circuitry, and differentially modifying behavior. The outcomes initiated by different optogenetic input activation patterns and frequencies can have opposite consequences for behavior, activate different neurons in the same target structure, be supported by distinct adrenoceptors and vary with behavioral state.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Many receptive fields in the early visual system show standard (center-surround) structure and can be analyzed using simple drifting patterns and a difference-of-Gaussians (DoG) model, which treats the receptive field as a linear filter of the visual image. But many other receptive fields show nonlinear properties such as selectivity for direction of movement. Such receptive fields are typically studied using discrete stimuli (moving or flashed bars and edges) and are modelled according to the features of the visual image to which they are most sensitive. Here, we harness recent advances in tomographic image analysis to characterize rapidly and simultaneously both the linear and nonlinear components of visual receptive fields. Spiking and intracellular voltage potential responses to briefly flashed bars are analyzed using non-negative matrix factorization (NNMF) and iterative reconstruction tomography (IRT). The method yields high-resolution receptive field maps of individual neurons and neuron ensembles in primate (marmoset, both sexes) lateral geniculate and rodent (mouse, male) retina. We show that the first two IRT components correspond to DoG-equivalent center and surround of standard [magnocellular (M) and parvocellular (P)] receptive fields in primate geniculate. The first two IRT components also reveal the spatiotemporal receptive field structure of nonstandard (on/off-rectifying) receptive fields. In rodent retina we combine NNMF-IRT with patch-clamp recording and dye injection to directly map spatial receptive fields to the underlying anatomy of retinal output neurons. We conclude that NNMF-IRT provides a rapid and flexible framework for study of receptive fields in the early visual system.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Untreated age-related hearing loss increases audiovisual integration and impacts resting state functional brain connectivity. Further, there is a relation between crossmodal plasticity and audiovisual integration strength in cochlear implant patients. However, it is currently unclear whether amplification of the auditory input by hearing aids influences audiovisual integration and resting state functional brain connectivity. We conducted a randomized controlled pilot study to investigate how the McGurk illusion, a common measure for audiovisual integration, and resting state functional brain connectivity of the auditory cortex are altered by six-month hearing aid use. Thirty-two older participants with slight-to-moderate, symmetric, age-related hearing loss were allocated to a treatment or waiting control group and measured one week before and six months after hearing aid fitting with functional magnetic resonance imaging. Our results showed a statistical trend for an increased McGurk illusion after six months of hearing aid use. We further demonstrated that an increase in McGurk susceptibility is related to a decreased hearing aid benefit for auditory speech intelligibility in noise. No significant interaction between group and time point was obtained in the whole-brain resting state analysis. However, a region of interest (ROI)-to-ROI analysis indicated that hearing aid use of six months was associated with a decrease in resting state functional connectivity between the auditory cortex and the fusiform gyrus and that this decrease was related to an increase of perceived McGurk illusions. Our study, therefore, suggests that even short-term hearing aid use alters audiovisual integration and functional brain connectivity between auditory and visual cortices.</p>

                <p>Traumatic brain injury (TBI) results in disrupted brain function following impact from an external force and is a risk factor for sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although neurologic symptoms triggered by mild traumatic brain injuries (mTBI), the most common form of TBI, typically resolve rapidly, even an isolated mTBI event can increase the risk to develop AD. Aberrant accumulation of amyloid &beta; peptide (A&beta;), a cleaved fragment of amyloid precursor protein (APP), is a key pathologic outcome designating the progression of AD following mTBI and has also been linked to impaired axonal transport. However, relationships among mTBI, amyloidogenesis, and axonal transport remain unclear, in part because of the dearth of human models to study the neuronal response following mTBI. Here, we implemented a custom-microfabricated device to deform neurons derived from human-induced pluripotent stem cells, derived from a cognitively unimpaired male individual, to mimic the mild stretch experienced by neurons during mTBI. Although no cell lethality or cytoskeletal disruptions were observed, mild stretch was sufficient to stimulate rapid amyloidogenic processing of APP. This processing led to abrupt cessation of APP axonal transport and progressive formation of aberrant axonal accumulations that contained APP, its processing machinery, and amyloidogenic fragments. Consistent with this sequence of events, stretch-induced defects were abrogated by reducing amyloidogenesis either pharmacologically or genetically. In sum, we have uncovered a novel and manipulable stretch-induced amyloidogenic pathway directly responsible for APP axonal transport dysregulation. Our findings may help to understand and ultimately mitigate the risk of developing AD following mTBI.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Mild traumatic brain injury is a risk factor for sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD). Increased amyloid &beta; peptide generation after injury may drive this risk. Here, by using a custom-built device to impose mild stretch to human neurons, we found that stretch triggers amyloid precursor protein (APP) cleavage, and thus amyloid &beta; peptide generation, consequently disrupting APP axonal transport. Compellingly, protecting APP from cleavage was sufficient to spare axonal transport dysregulation and the consequent aberrant axonal accumulation of APP. Supporting such protective mechanism, the expression of the AD-protective APP<sup>A673T</sup> genetic variant conferred protection against stretch-induced APP axonal transport phenotypes. Our data reveal potential subcellular pathways contributing to the development of AD-associated phenotypes following mild traumatic brain injury, and putative strategies for intervening in these pathways.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">A Proinflammatory Stimulus Disrupts Hippocampal Plasticity and Learning via Microglial Activation and 25-Hydroxycholesterol</a></h4>

              
                <p>Inflammatory cells, including macrophages and microglia, synthesize and release the oxysterol 25-hydroxycholesterol (25HC), which has antiviral and immunomodulatory properties. Here, we examined the effects of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), an activator of innate immunity, on 25HC production in microglia, and the effects of LPS and 25HC on CA1 hippocampal synaptic plasticity and learning. In primary microglia, LPS markedly increases the expression of cholesterol 25-hydroxylase (Ch25h), the key enzyme involved in 25HC synthesis, and increases the levels of secreted 25HC. Wild-type microglia produced higher levels of 25HC than <I>Ch25h</I> knock-out (KO) microglia with or without LPS. LPS treatment also disrupts long-term potentiation (LTP) in hippocampal slices via induction of a form of NMDA receptor-dependent metaplasticity. The inhibitory effects of LPS on LTP were mimicked by exogenous 25HC, and were not observed in slices from <I>Ch25h</I> KO mice. <I>In vivo</I>, LPS treatment also disrupts LTP and inhibits one-trial learning in wild-type mice, but not <I>Ch25h</I> KO mice. These results demonstrate that the oxysterol 25HC is a key modulator of synaptic plasticity and memory under proinflammatory stimuli.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Neuroinflammation is thought to contribute to cognitive impairment in multiple neuropsychiatric illnesses. In this study, we found that a proinflammatory stimulus, LPS, disrupts hippocampal LTP via a metaplastic mechanism. The effects of LPS on LTP are mimicked by the oxysterol 25-hydroxycholesterol (25HC), an immune mediator synthesized in brain microglia. Effects of LPS on both synaptic plasticity and one-trial inhibitory avoidance learning are eliminated in mice deficient in Ch25h (cholesterol 25-hydroxylase), the primary enzyme responsible for endogenous 25HC synthesis. Thus, these results indicate that 25HC is a key mediator of the effects of an inflammatory stimulus on hippocampal function and open new potential avenues to overcome the effects of neuroinflammation on brain function.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Balanced Enhancements of Synaptic Excitation and Inhibition Underlie Developmental Maturation of Receptive Fields in the Mouse Visual Cortex</a></h4>

              
                <p>Neurons in the developing visual cortex undergo progressive functional maturation as indicated by the refinement of their visual feature selectivity. However, changes of the synaptic architecture underlying the maturation of spatial visual receptive fields (RFs) per se remain largely unclear. Here, loose-patch as well as single-unit recordings in layer 4 of mouse primary visual cortex (V1) of both sexes revealed that RF development following an eye-opening period is marked by an increased proportion of cortical neurons with spatially defined RFs, together with the increased signal-to-noise ratio of spiking responses. By exploring excitatory and inhibitory synaptic RFs with whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings, we observed a balanced enhancement of both synaptic excitation and inhibition, and while the excitatory subfield size remains relatively constant during development, the inhibitory subfield is broadened. This balanced developmental strengthening of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs results in enhanced visual responses, and with a reduction of spontaneous firing rate, contributes to the maturation of visual cortical RFs. Visual deprivation by dark rearing impedes the normal strengthening of excitatory inputs but leaves the apparently normal enhancement of inhibition while preventing the broadening of the inhibitory subfield, leading to weakened RF responses and a reduced fraction of neurons exhibiting a clear RF, compared with normally reared animals. Our data demonstrate that an experience-dependent and coordinated maturation of excitatory and inhibitory circuits underlie the functional development of visual cortical RFs.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The organization of synaptic RFs is a fundamental determinant of feature selectivity functions in the cortex. However, how changes of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs lead to the functional maturation of visual RFs during cortical development remains not well understood. In layer 4 of mouse V1, we show that a coordinated, balanced enhancement of synaptic excitation and inhibition contributes to the developmental maturation of spatially defined visual RFs. Visual deprivation by dark rearing partially interferes with this process, resulting in a relatively more dominant inhibitory tone and a reduced fraction of neurons exhibiting clear RFs at the spike level. These data provide an unprecedented understanding of the functional development of visual cortical RFs at the synaptic level.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Overexpressing Histone Deacetylase 5 in Rat Dorsal Striatum Alters Reward-Guided Decision-Making and Associated Neural Encoding</a></h4>

              
                <p>Accumulating evidence in the past decade implicates histone-modifying enzymes, such as class I histone deacetylases (HDACs), in learning and memory and, recently, habit formation. However, it is unclear whether HDACs play roles in complex cognitive function. To address this issue, we examined the role of dorsal striatal HDAC5, a class II HDAC, in reward-guided decision-making and associated neural encoding in rats. We first injected adeno-associated virus to overexpress a nuclear-localized HDAC5 in dorsal striatum (DS). We then recorded neural correlates from dorsolateral striatum (DLS) as rats performed two reward-guided choice tasks, in which we manipulated either the size of or delay to reward. During these tasks, rats first learned which of two options led to the better reward and then reversed those contingencies in a second block of trials. We found that rats with HDAC5 overexpression in DS responded faster and chose higher value reward more often during the first block of trials but were less able to reverse those contingencies in the second block of trials. At the neural level, HDAC5 overexpression in DS elevated and reduced the number of cells in DLS that increased firing to stimuli and reward, respectively, and shifted encoding toward cues that predicted more immediate reward. These results suggest that the HDAC5 overexpression in DS contributes to inflexible decision-making, demonstrating a role of histone-modifying enzymes in complex cognitive function.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> HDACs are important for learning and habit formation. Here, we expanded on these functions and found that overexpression of HDAC5 produced faster and more automatic behavior, and related changes in dorsolateral striatal neural firing in rats performing a value-based decision-making task. These results implicate HDAC5 as a potential therapeutic target for psychiatric conditions that impair decision-making and executive function.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Distinct Fastigial Output Channels and Their Impact on Temporal Lobe Seizures</a></h4>

              
                <p>Despite being canonically considered a motor control structure, the cerebellum is increasingly recognized for important roles in processes beyond this traditional framework, including seizure suppression. Excitatory fastigial neurons project to a large number of downstream targets, and it is unclear whether this broad targeting underlies seizure suppression, or whether a specific output may be sufficient. To address this question, we used the intrahippocampal kainic acid mouse model of temporal lobe epilepsy, male and female animals, and a dual-virus approach to selectively label and manipulate fastigial outputs. We examined fastigial neurons projecting to the superior colliculus, medullary reticular formation, and central lateral nucleus of the thalamus, and found that these comprise largely nonoverlapping populations of neurons that send collaterals to unique sets of additional, somewhat overlapping, thalamic and brainstem regions. We found that neither optogenetic stimulation of superior colliculus nor reticular formation output channels attenuated hippocampal seizures. In contrast, on-demand stimulation of fastigial neurons targeting the central lateral nucleus robustly inhibited seizures. Our results indicate that fastigial control of hippocampal seizures does not require simultaneous modulation of many fastigial output channels. Rather, selective modulation of the fastigial output channel to the central lateral thalamus, specifically, is sufficient for seizure control. More broadly, our data highlight the concept of specific cerebellar output channels, whereby discrete cerebellar nucleus neurons project to specific aggregates of downstream targets, with important consequences for therapeutic interventions.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The cerebellum has an emerging relationship with nonmotor systems and may represent a powerful target for therapeutic intervention in temporal lobe epilepsy. We find, as previously reported, that fastigial neurons project to numerous brain regions via largely segregated output channels, and that projection targets cannot be predicted simply by somatic locations within the nucleus. We further find that on-demand optogenetic excitation of fastigial neurons projecting to the central lateral nucleus of the thalamus&mdash;but not fastigial neurons projecting to the reticular formation, superior colliculus, or ventral lateral thalamus&mdash;is sufficient to attenuate hippocampal seizures.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Supervised Multisensory Calibration Signals Are Evident in VIP But Not MSTd</a></h4>

              
                <p>Multisensory plasticity enables our senses to dynamically adapt to each other and the external environment, a fundamental operation that our brain performs continuously. We searched for neural correlates of adult multisensory plasticity in the dorsal medial superior temporal area (MSTd) and the ventral intraparietal area (VIP) in 2 male rhesus macaques using a paradigm of supervised calibration. We report little plasticity in neural responses in the relatively low-level multisensory cortical area MSTd. In contrast, neural correlates of plasticity are found in higher-level multisensory VIP, an area with strong decision-related activity. Accordingly, we observed systematic shifts of VIP tuning curves, which were reflected in the choice-related component of the population response. This is the first demonstration of neuronal calibration, together with behavioral calibration, in single sessions. These results lay the foundation for understanding multisensory neural plasticity, applicable broadly to maintaining accuracy for sensorimotor tasks.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Timescales of Local and Cross-Area Interactions during Neuroprosthetic Learning</a></h4>

              
                <p>How does the brain integrate signals with different timescales to drive purposeful actions? Brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) offer a powerful tool to causally test how distributed neural networks achieve specific neural patterns. During neuroprosthetic learning, actuator movements are causally linked to primary motor cortex (M1) neurons, i.e., "direct" neurons that project to the decoder and whose firing is required to successfully perform the task. However, it is unknown how such direct M1 neurons interact with both "indirect" local (in M1 but not part of the decoder) and across area neural populations (e.g., in premotor cortex/M2), all of which are embedded in complex biological recurrent networks. Here, we trained male rats to perform a M1-BMI task and simultaneously recorded the activity of indirect neurons in both M2 and M1. We found that both M2 and M1 indirect neuron populations could be used to predict the activity of the direct neurons (i.e., "BMI-potent activity"). Interestingly, compared with M1 indirect activity, M2 neural activity was correlated with BMI-potent activity across a longer set of time lags, and the timescale of population activity patterns evolved more slowly. M2 units also predicted the activity of both M1 direct and indirect neural populations, suggesting that M2 population dynamics provide a continuous modulatory influence on M1 activity as a whole, rather than a moment-by-moment influence solely on neurons most relevant to a task. Together, our results indicate that longer timescale M2 activity provides modulatory influence over extended time lags on shorter-timescale control signals in M1.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> A central question in the study of motor control is whether primary motor cortex (M1) and premotor cortex (M2) interact through task-specific subpopulations of neurons, or whether tasks engage broader correlated networks. Brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) are powerful tools to study cross-area interactions. Here, we performed simultaneous recordings of M1 and M2 in a BMI task using a subpopulation of M1 neurons (direct neurons). We found that activity outside of direct neurons in M1 and M2 was predictive of M1-BMI task activity, and that M2 activity evolved at slower timescales than M1. These findings suggest that M2 provides a continuous modulatory influence on M1 as a whole, supporting a model of interactions through broad correlated networks rather than task-specific neural subpopulations.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Predictive Feedback, Early Sensory Representations, and Fast Responses to Predicted Stimuli Depend on NMDA Receptors</a></h4>

              
                <p>Learned associations between stimuli allow us to model the world and make predictions, crucial for efficient behavior (e.g., hearing a siren, we expect to see an ambulance and quickly make way). While there are theoretical and computational frameworks for prediction, the circuit and receptor-level mechanisms are unclear. Using high-density EEG, Bayesian modeling, and machine learning, we show that inferred "causal" relationships between stimuli and frontal alpha activity account for reaction times (a proxy for predictions) on a trial-by-trial basis in an audiovisual delayed match-to-sample task which elicited predictions. Predictive &beta; feedback activated sensory representations in advance of predicted stimuli. Low-dose ketamine, an NMDAR blocker, but not the control drug dexmedetomidine, perturbed behavioral indices of predictions, their representation in higher-order cortex, feedback to posterior cortex, and pre-activation of sensory templates in higher-order sensory cortex. This study suggests that predictions depend on alpha activity in higher-order cortex, &beta; feedback, and NMDARs, and ketamine blocks access to learned predictive information.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> We learn the statistical regularities around us, creating associations between sensory stimuli. These associations can be exploited by generating predictions, which enable fast and efficient behavior. When predictions are perturbed, it can negatively influence perception and even contribute to psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia. Here we show that the frontal lobe generates predictions and sends them to posterior brain areas, to activate representations of predicted sensory stimuli before their appearance. Oscillations in neural activity (&alpha; and &beta; waves) are vital for these predictive mechanisms. The drug ketamine blocks predictions and the underlying mechanisms. This suggests that the generation of predictions in the frontal lobe, and the feedback pre-activating sensory representations in advance of stimuli, depend on NMDARs.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Basal Forebrain Cholinergic Neurons Selectively Drive Coordinated Motor Learning in Mice</a></h4>

              
                <p>Motor control requires precise temporal and spatial encoding across distinct motor centers that is refined through the repetition of learning. The recruitment of motor regions requires modulatory input to shape circuit activity. Here, we identify a role for the baso-cortical cholinergic pathway in the acquisition of a coordinated motor skill in mice. Targeted depletion of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons results in significant impairments in training on the rotarod task of coordinated movement. Cholinergic neuromodulation is required during training sessions as chemogenetic inactivation of cholinergic neurons also impairs task acquisition. Rotarod learning is known to drive refinement of corticostriatal neurons arising in both medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and motor cortex, and we have found that cholinergic input to both motor regions is required for task acquisition. Critically, the effects of cholinergic neuromodulation are restricted to the acquisition stage, as depletion of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons after learning does not affect task execution. Our results indicate a critical role for cholinergic neuromodulation of distant cortical motor centers during coordinated motor learning.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Acetylcholine release from basal forebrain cholinergic neuron terminals rapidly modulates neuronal excitability, circuit dynamics, and cortical coding; all processes required for processing complex sensory information, cognition, and attention. We found that depletion or transient silencing of cholinergic inputs to anatomically isolated motor areas, medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and motor cortex, selectively led to significant impairments on coordinated motor learning; disrupting this baso-cortical network after acquisition elicited no effect on task execution. Our results indicate a pivotal role for cholinergic neuromodulation of distant cortical motor centers during coordinated motor learning. These findings support the concept that cognitive components (such as attention) are indispensable in the adjustment of motor output and training-induced improvements in motor performance.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Interaural Place-of-Stimulation Mismatch Estimates Using CT Scans and Binaural Perception, But Not Pitch, Are Consistent in Cochlear-Implant Users</a></h4>

              
                <p>Bilateral cochlear implants (BI-CIs) or a CI for single-sided deafness (SSD-CI; one normally functioning acoustic ear) can partially restore spatial-hearing abilities, including sound localization and speech understanding in noise. For these populations, however, interaural place-of-stimulation mismatch can occur and thus diminish binaural sensitivity that relies on interaurally frequency-matched neurons. This study examined whether plasticity&mdash;reorganization of central neural pathways over time&mdash;can compensate for peripheral interaural place mismatch. We hypothesized differential plasticity across two systems: none for binaural processing but adaptation for pitch perception toward frequencies delivered by the specific electrodes. Interaural place mismatch was evaluated in 19 BI-CI and 23 SSD-CI human subjects (both sexes) using binaural processing (interaural-time-difference discrimination with simultaneous bilateral stimulation), pitch perception (pitch ranking for single electrodes or acoustic tones with sequential bilateral stimulation), and physical electrode-location estimates from computed-tomography (CT) scans. On average, CT scans revealed relatively little BI-CI interaural place mismatch (26&deg; insertion-angle mismatch) but a relatively large SSD-CI mismatch, particularly at low frequencies (166&deg; for an electrode tuned to 300 Hz, decreasing to 14&deg; at 7000 Hz). For BI-CI subjects, the three metrics were in agreement because there was little mismatch. For SSD-CI subjects, binaural and CT measurements were in agreement, suggesting little binaural-system plasticity induced by mismatch. The pitch measurements disagreed with binaural and CT measurements, suggesting place-pitch plasticity or a procedural bias. These results suggest that reducing interaural place mismatch and potentially improving binaural processing by reprogramming the CI frequency allocation would be better done using CT-scan than pitch information.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Electrode-array placement for cochlear implants (bionic prostheses that partially restore hearing) does not explicitly align neural representations of frequency information. The resulting interaural place-of-stimulation mismatch can diminish spatial-hearing abilities. In this study, adults with two cochlear implants showed reasonable interaural alignment, whereas those with one cochlear implant but normal hearing in the other ear often showed mismatch. In cases of mismatch, binaural sensitivity was best when the same cochlear locations were stimulated in both ears, suggesting that binaural brainstem pathways do not experience plasticity to compensate for mismatch. In contrast, interaurally pitch-matched electrodes deviated from cochlear-location estimates and did not optimize binaural sensitivity. Clinical correction of interaural place mismatch using binaural or computed-tomography (but not pitch) information may improve spatial-hearing benefits.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Global and Regional Damages in Retinal Ganglion Cell Axon Bundles Monitored Non-Invasively by Visible-Light Optical Coherence Tomography Fibergraphy</a></h4>

              
                <p>Retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) exhibit compartmentalized organization, receiving synaptic inputs through their dendrites and transmitting visual information from the retina to the brain through the optic nerve. Little is known about the structure of RGC axon bundles extending from individual RGC somas to the optic nerve head (ONH) and how they respond to disease insults. We recently introduced visible-light optical coherence tomography fibergraphy (vis-OCTF), a technique for directly visualizing and analyzing mouse RGC axon bundles <I>in vivo</I>. In this study, we validated vis-OCTF's ability to quantify RGC axon bundles with an increased number of RGCs using mice deficient in BCL2-associated X protein (BAX<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup>). Next, we performed optic nerve crush (ONC) injury on wild-type (WT) mice and showed that the changes in RGC axon bundle width and thickness were location-dependent. Our work demonstrates the potential of vis-OCTF to longitudinally quantify and track RGC damage at single axon bundle level in optic neuropathies.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Nearly all clinical and preclinical studies measure the retinal nerve fiber (RNFL) thickness as the sole indicator of retinal ganglion cell (RGC) damage without investigating RGC axon bundles directly. We demonstrated visible-light optical coherence tomography fibergraphy (vis-OCTF) to directly quantify global and regional RGC axon bundle organizations <I>in vivo</I> as a new biomarker for RGC health. We validated <I>in vivo</I> vis-OCTF measures using both confocal microscopy of the immunostained flat-mounted retina and numerical simulations. Vis-OCTF for monitoring RGC axon bundle organization has the potential to bring new insight into RGC damage in optic neuropathies.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Hyperexcitability and Pharmacological Responsiveness of Cortical Neurons Derived from Human iPSCs Carrying Epilepsy-Associated Sodium Channel Nav1.2-L1342P Genetic Variant</a></h4>

              
                <p>With the wide adoption of genomic sequencing in children having seizures, an increasing number of <I>SCN2A</I> genetic variants have been revealed as genetic causes of epilepsy. Voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.2, encoded by gene <I>SCN2A</I>, is predominantly expressed in the pyramidal excitatory neurons and supports action potential (AP) firing. One recurrent <I>SCN2A</I> genetic variant is L1342P, which was identified in multiple patients with epileptic encephalopathy and intractable seizures. However, the mechanism underlying L1342P-mediated seizures and the pharmacogenetics of this variant in human neurons remain unknown. To understand the core phenotypes of the L1342P variant in human neurons, we took advantage of a reference human-induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) line from a male donor, in which L1342P was introduced by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing. Using patch-clamping and microelectrode array (MEA) recordings, we revealed that cortical neurons derived from hiPSCs carrying heterozygous L1342P variant have significantly increased intrinsic excitability, higher sodium current density, and enhanced bursting and synchronous network firing, suggesting hyperexcitability phenotypes. Interestingly, L1342P neuronal culture displayed a degree of resistance to the anticonvulsant medication phenytoin, which recapitulated aspects of clinical observation of patients carrying the L1342P variant. In contrast, phrixotoxin-3 (PTx3), a Nav1.2 isoform-specific blocker, can potently alleviate spontaneous and chemically-induced hyperexcitability of neurons carrying the L1342P variant. Our results reveal a possible pathogenic underpinning of Nav1.2-L1342P mediated epileptic seizures and demonstrate the utility of genome-edited hiPSCs as an <I>in vitro</I> platform to advance personalized phenotyping and drug discovery.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> A mounting number of <I>SCN2A</I> genetic variants have been identified from patients with epilepsy, but how <I>SCN2A</I> variants affect the function of human neurons contributing to seizures is still elusive. This study investigated the functional consequences of a recurring <I>SCN2A</I> variant (L1342P) using human iPSC-derived neurons and revealed both intrinsic and network hyperexcitability of neurons carrying a mutant Nav1.2 channel. Importantly, this study recapitulated elements of clinical observations of drug-resistant features of the L1342P variant, and provided a platform for <I>in vitro</I> drug testing. Our study sheds light on cellular mechanism of seizures resulting from a recurring Nav1.2 variant, and helps to advance personalized drug discovery to treat patients carrying pathogenic <I>SCN2A</I> variant.</p>
