Abstract: Mapping of human brain structural connectomes via diffusion MRI offers a unique opportunity to understand brain structural connectivity and relate it to various human traits, such as cognition. However, head displacement during image acquisition can compromise the accuracy of connectome reconstructions and subsequent inference results. We develop a generative model to learn low-dimensional representations of structural connectomes invariant to motion-induced artifacts, so that we can link brain networks and human traits more accurately, and generate motion-adjusted connectomes. We apply the proposed model to data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study and the Human Connectome Project (HCP) to investigate how our motion-invariant connectomes facilitate understanding of the brain network and its relationship with cognition. Empirical results demonstrate that the proposed motion-invariant variational auto-encoder (inv-VAE) outperforms its competitors in various aspects. In particular, motion-adjusted structural connectomes are more strongly associated with a wide array of cognition-related traits than other approaches without motion adjustment.

                arXiv:2402.10251v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural electrical activity is fundamental to brain function, underlying a range of cognitive and behavioral processes, including movement, perception, decision-making, and consciousness. Abnormal patterns of neural signaling often indicate the presence of underlying brain diseases. The variability among individuals, the diverse array of clinical symptoms from various brain disorders, and the limited availability of diagnostic classifications, have posed significant barriers to formulating reliable model of neural signals for diverse application contexts. Here, we present BrainWave, the first foundation model for both invasive and non-invasive neural recordings, pretrained on more than 40,000 hours of electrical brain recordings (13.79 TB of data) from approximately 16,000 individuals. Our analysis show that BrainWave outperforms all other competing models and consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance in the diagnosis and identification of neurological disorders. We also demonstrate robust capabilities of BrainWave in enabling zero-shot transfer learning across varying recording conditions and brain diseases, as well as few-shot classification without fine-tuning, suggesting that BrainWave learns highly generalizable representations of neural signals. We hence believe that open-sourcing BrainWave will facilitate a wide range of clinical applications in medicine, paving the way for AI-driven approaches to investigate brain disorders and advance neuroscience research.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15176">Brain-aligning of semantic vectors improves neural decoding of visual stimuli</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2403.15176v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The development of algorithms to accurately decode of neural information is a long-standing effort in the field of neuroscience. Brain decoding is typically employed by training machine learning models to map neural data onto a preestablished vector representation of stimulus features. These vectors are usually derived from image- and/or text-based feature spaces. Nonetheless, the intrinsic characteristics of these vectors might be fundamentally different than those encoded by the brain, limiting the ability of algorithms to accurately learn this mapping. To address this issue, here, we propose a representation learning framework, called brain-aligning of semantic vectors, that fine-tunes pretrained feature vectors to better align with the structure of neural representations of visual stimuli in the human brain. We trained this model with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data representing 150 visual stimulus categories; then, we performed zero-shot brain decoding on 1) fMRI, 2) magnetoencephalography (MEG), and 3) electrocorticography (ECoG) data reflecting neural representations of visual stimuli. By using fMRI-based brain-aligned vectors, the zero-shot decoding accuracy all three neuroimaging datasets increased. This finding underscores the potential of leveraging a richer array of brainderived features to increase the performance of brain decoding algorithms.

                arXiv:2409.02241v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In visual decision making, high-level features, such as object categories, have a strong influence on choice. However, the impact of low-level features on behavior is less understood partly due to the high correlation between high- and low-level features in the stimuli presented (e.g., objects of the same category are more likely to share low-level features). To disentangle these effects, we propose a method that de-correlates low- and high-level visual properties in a novel set of stimuli. Our method uses two Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) as candidate models of the ventral visual stream: the CORnet-S that has high neural predictivity in high-level, IT-like responses and the VGG-16 that has high neural predictivity in low-level responses. Triplets (root, image1, image2) of stimuli are parametrized by the level of low- and high-level similarity of images extracted from the different layers. These stimuli are then used in a decision-making task where participants are tasked to choose the most similar-to-the-root image. We found that different networks show differing abilities to predict the effects of low-versus-high-level similarity: while CORnet-S outperforms VGG-16 in explaining human choices based on high-level similarity, VGG-16 outperforms CORnet-S in explaining human choices based on low-level similarity. Using Brain-Score, we observed that the behavioral prediction abilities of different layers of these networks qualitatively corresponded to their ability to explain neural activity at different levels of the visual hierarchy. In summary, our algorithm for stimulus set generation enables the study of how different representations in the visual stream affect high-level cognitive behaviors.

                arXiv:2408.16570v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address the linguistic problem of the sequential arrangement of a head and its dependents from an information theoretic perspective. In particular, we consider the optimal placement of a head that maximizes the predictability of the sequence. We assume that dependents are statistically independent given a head, in line with the open-choice principle and the core assumptions of dependency grammar. We demonstrate the optimality of harmonic order, i.e., placing the head last maximizes the predictability of the head whereas placing the head first maximizes the predictability of dependents. We also show that postponing the head is the optimal strategy to maximize its predictability while bringing it forward is the optimal strategy to maximize the predictability of dependents. We unravel the advantages of the strategy of maximizing the predictability of the head over maximizing the predictability of dependents. Our findings shed light on the placements of the head adopted by real languages or emerging in different kinds of experiments.

Abstract: Diffusion-weighted MRI is increasingly used to study the normal and abnormal development of fetal brain in-utero. Recent studies have shown that dMRI can offer invaluable insights into the neurodevelopmental processes in the fetal stage. However, because of the low data quality and rapid brain development, reliable analysis of fetal dMRI data requires dedicated computational methods that are currently unavailable. The lack of automated methods for fast, accurate, and reproducible data analysis has seriously limited our ability to tap the potential of fetal brain dMRI for medical and scientific applications. In this work, we developed and validated a unified computational framework to (1) segment the brain tissue into white matter, cortical/subcortical gray matter, and cerebrospinal fluid, (2) segment 31 distinct white matter tracts, and (3) parcellate the brain's cortex and delineate the deep gray nuclei and white matter structures into 96 anatomically meaningful regions. We utilized a set of manual, semi-automatic, and automatic approaches to annotate 97 fetal brains. Using these labels, we developed and validated a multi-task deep learning method to perform the three computations. Our evaluations show that the new method can accurately carry out all three tasks, achieving a mean Dice similarity coefficient of 0.865 on tissue segmentation, 0.825 on white matter tract segmentation, and 0.819 on parcellation. The proposed method can greatly advance the field of fetal neuroimaging as it can lead to substantial improvements in fetal brain tractography, tract-specific analysis, and structural connectivity assessment.

                arXiv:2409.07466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces an artificial neural network (ANN) for image classification task, inspired by the aversive olfactory learning circuits of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans). Despite the remarkable performance of ANNs in a variety of tasks, they face challenges such as excessive parameterization, high training costs and limited generalization capabilities. C. elegans, with its simple nervous system comprising only 302 neurons, serves as a paradigm in neurobiological research and is capable of complex behaviors including learning. This research identifies key neural circuits associated with aversive olfactory learning in C. elegans through behavioral experiments and high-throughput gene sequencing, translating them into an image classification ANN architecture. Additionally, two other image classification ANNs with distinct architectures were constructed for comparative performance analysis to highlight the advantages of bio-inspired design. The results indicate that the ANN inspired by the aversive olfactory learning circuits of C. elegans achieves higher accuracy, better consistency and faster convergence rates in image classification task, especially when tackling more complex classification challenges. This study not only showcases the potential of bio-inspired design in enhancing ANN capabilities but also provides a novel perspective and methodology for future ANN design.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07776">Training Spiking Neural Networks via Augmented Direct Feedback Alignment</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2409.07776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs), the models inspired by the mechanisms of real neurons in the brain, transmit and represent information by employing discrete action potentials or spikes. The sparse, asynchronous properties of information processing make SNNs highly energy efficient, leading to SNNs being promising solutions for implementing neural networks in neuromorphic devices. However, the nondifferentiable nature of SNN neurons makes it a challenge to train them. The current training methods of SNNs that are based on error backpropagation (BP) and precisely designing surrogate gradient are difficult to implement and biologically implausible, hindering the implementation of SNNs on neuromorphic devices. Thus, it is important to train SNNs with a method that is both physically implementatable and biologically plausible. In this paper, we propose using augmented direct feedback alignment (aDFA), a gradient-free approach based on random projection, to train SNNs. This method requires only partial information of the forward process during training, so it is easy to implement and biologically plausible. We systematically demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed aDFA-SNNs scheme, propose its effective working range, and analyze its well-performing settings by employing genetic algorithm. We also analyze the impact of crucial features of SNNs on the scheme, thus demonstrating its superiority and stability over BP and conventional direct feedback alignment. Our scheme can achieve competitive performance without accurate prior knowledge about the utilized system, thus providing a valuable reference for physically training SNNs.

Abstract: In the present paper, it is shown how the columnar/layered CoLaNET spiking neural network (SNN) architecture can be used in supervised learning image classification tasks. Image pixel brightness is coded by the spike count during image presentation period. Image class label is indicated by activity of special SNN input nodes (one node per class). The CoLaNET classification accuracy is evaluated on the MNIST benchmark. It is demonstrated that CoLaNET is almost as accurate as the most advanced machine learning algorithms (not using convolutional approach).

                arXiv:2312.08134v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Evolutionary multitasking (EMT) has emerged as a popular topic of evolutionary computation over the past years. It aims to concurrently address multiple optimization tasks within limited computing resources, leveraging inter-task knowledge transfer techniques. Despite the abundance of multitask evolutionary algorithms (MTEAs) proposed for multitask optimization (MTO), there remains a comprehensive software platform to help researchers evaluate MTEA performance on benchmark MTO problems as well as explore real-world applications. To bridge this gap, we introduce the first open-source optimization platform, named MTO-Platform (MToP), for EMT. MToP incorporates over 40 MTEAs, more than 150 MTO problem cases with real-world applications, and over 20 performance metrics. Moreover, to facilitate comparative analyses between MTEAs and traditional evolutionary algorithms, we adapted over 40 popular single-task evolutionary algorithms to address MTO problems. MToP boasts a user-friendly graphical interface, facilitating results analysis, data export, and schematics visualization. More importantly, MToP is designed with extensibility in mind, allowing users to develop new algorithms and tackle emerging problem domains. The source code of MToP is available at https://github.com/intLyc/MTO-Platform.

Abstract: In the present paper, I describe a spiking neural network (SNN) architecture which, can be used in wide range of supervised learning classification tasks. It is assumed, that all participating signals (the classified object description, correct class label and SNN decision) have spiking nature. The distinctive feature of this architecture is a combination of prototypical network structures corresponding to different classes and significantly distinctive instances of one class (=columns) and functionally differing populations of neurons inside columns (=layers). The other distinctive feature is a novel combination of anti-Hebbian and dopamine-modulated plasticity. The plasticity rules are local and do not use the backpropagation principle. Besides that, as in my previous studies, I was guided by the requirement that the all neuron/plasticity models should be easily implemented on modern neurochips. I illustrate the high performance of my network on a task related to model-based reinforcement learning, namely, evaluation of proximity of an external world state to the target state.

                arXiv:2302.10763v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In response to an object presentation, supervised learning schemes generally respond with a parsimonious label. Upon a similar presentation we humans respond again with a label, but are flooded, in addition, by a myriad of associations. A significant portion of these consist of the presented object attributes. Contrastive learning is a semi-supervised learning scheme based on the application of identity preserving transformations on the object input representations. It is conjectured in this work that these same applied transformations preserve, in addition to the identity of the presented object, also the identity of its semantically meaningful attributes. The corollary of this is that the output representations of such a contrastive learning scheme contain valuable information not only for the classification of the presented object, but also for the presence or absence decision of any attribute of interest. Simulation results which demonstrate this idea and the feasibility of this conjecture are presented.

Abstract: Robotic technologies have been an indispensable part for improving human productivity since they have been helping humans in completing diverse, complex, and intensive tasks in a fast yet accurate and efficient way. Therefore, robotic technologies have been deployed in a wide range of applications, ranging from personal to industrial use-cases. However, current robotic technologies and their computing paradigm still lack embodied intelligence to efficiently interact with operational environments, respond with correct/expected actions, and adapt to changes in the environments. Toward this, recent advances in neuromorphic computing with Spiking Neural Networks (SNN) have demonstrated the potential to enable the embodied intelligence for robotics through bio-plausible computing paradigm that mimics how the biological brain works, known as "neuromorphic artificial intelligence (AI)". However, the field of neuromorphic AI-based robotics is still at an early stage, therefore its development and deployment for solving real-world problems expose new challenges in different design aspects, such as accuracy, adaptability, efficiency, reliability, and security. To address these challenges, this paper will discuss how we can enable embodied neuromorphic AI for robotic systems through our perspectives: (P1) Embodied intelligence based on effective learning rule, training mechanism, and adaptability; (P2) Cross-layer optimizations for energy-efficient neuromorphic computing; (P3) Representative and fair benchmarks; (P4) Low-cost reliability and safety enhancements; (P5) Security and privacy for neuromorphic computing; and (P6) A synergistic development for energy-efficient and robust neuromorphic-based robotics. Furthermore, this paper identifies research challenges and opportunities, as well as elaborates our vision for future research development toward embodied neuromorphic AI for robotics.

                arXiv:2405.07541v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The L\'evy walk, a type of random walk characterized by linear step lengths that follow a power-law distribution, is observed in the migratory behaviors of various organisms, ranging from bacteria to humans. Notably, L\'evy walks with power exponents close to two, also known as Cauchy walks, are frequently observed, though their underlying causes remain elusive. This study proposes a walk model in which agents move toward a destination in multi-dimensional space and their movement strategy is parameterized by the extent to which they pursue the shortest path to the destination. This parameter is taken to represent the attractiveness of the destination to the agents. Our findings reveal that if the destination is very attractive, agents intensively search the area around it using Brownian walks, whereas if the destination is unattractive, they explore a distant region away from the point using L\'evy walks with power exponents less than two. In the case where agents are unable to determine whether the destination is attractive or unattractive, Cauchy walks emerge. The Cauchy walker searches the region with a probability inversely proportional to the distance from the destination. This suggests that it preferentially searches the area close to the destination, while concurrently having the potential to extend the search area much further. Our model, which can change the search method and search area depending on the attractiveness of the destination, has the potential to be utilized for exploring the parameter space of optimization problems.

Abstract: As a promising framework for resolving partial differential equations (PDEs), Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have received widespread attention from industrial and scientific fields. However, lack of expressive ability and initialization pathology issues are found to prevent the application of PINNs in complex PDEs. In this work, we propose Deeper Physics-Informed Neural Network (Deeper-PINN) to resolve these issues. The element-wise multiplication operation is adopted to transform features into high-dimensional, non-linear spaces. Benefiting from element-wise multiplication operation, Deeper-PINNs can alleviate the initialization pathologies of PINNs and enhance the expressive capability of PINNs. The proposed structure is verified on various benchmarks. The results show that Deeper-PINNs can effectively resolve the initialization pathology and exhibit strong expressive ability.

                arXiv:2407.11698v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantization has become increasingly pivotal in addressing the steadily increasing computational and memory requirements of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). By reducing the number of bits used to represent weights and activations (typically from 32-bit floating-point to 16-bit or 8-bit integers), quantization reduces the memory footprint, energy consumption, and execution time of DNN models. However, traditional quantization methods typically focus on the inference of DNNs, while the training process still relies on floating-point operations. To date, only one work in the literature has addressed integer-only training for Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) architectures. This work introduces NITRO-D, a new framework for training arbitrarily deep integer-only Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) that operate entirely in the integer-only domain for both training and inference. NITRO-D is the first framework in the literature enabling the training of integer-only CNNs without the need to introduce a quantization scheme. Specifically, NITRO-D introduces a novel architecture integrating multiple integer local-loss blocks, which include the proposed NITRO Scaling Layer and the NITRO-ReLU activation function. Additionally, it introduces a novel integer-only learning algorithm derived from Local Error Signals (LES), utilizing IntegerSGD, an optimizer specifically designed to operate in an integer-only context. NITRO-D is implemented in an open-source Python library. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate its effectiveness across several state-of-the-art image recognition datasets. Results show significant performance improvements from 2.47% to 5.96% for integer-only MLP architectures over the state-of-the-art solution, and the capability of training integer-only CNN architectures with minimal accuracy degradation from -0.15% to -4.22% compared to floating-point LES.

	<p>Background: As one of the leading causes of disability in the world, stroke can determine a reduction of balance performance with a negative impact on daily activity and social life. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the effects of sensor-based balance training with exergaming feedback on balance skills in chronic stroke patients. Methods: 21 individuals (11F, 57.14 &amp;amp;plusmn; 13.82 years) with a single event of ischemic stroke were randomly assigned to the sensor-based balance training group (SB-group) or the usual care balance training group (UC-group). Both groups received 10 add-on sessions with exergaming feedback (SB-group) or conventional training (UC-group). Clinical and instrumental evaluation was performed before (t0), after (t1), and after one month (t2) from intervention. Participation level was assessed using the Pittsburgh Rehabilitation Participation Scale at the end of each session. Results: The SB-group showed an improvement in postural stability (p = 0.02) when compared to the UC-group. In the evaluation of motivational level, the score was statistically higher in the SB-group with respect to the UC-group (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01). Conclusion: Except for the improvement in postural stability, no difference was recorded in clinical score, suggesting a comparable gain in both groups. However, patients undergoing sensor-based training exhibited a higher participation score, ultimately indicating the use of this training to improve the adherence to rehabilitation settings, especially in patients with lower compliance.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/11/9/ENEURO.0243-24.2024?rss=1">Presaccadic Attention Enhances and Reshapes the Contrast Sensitivity Function Differentially around the Visual Field</a></h4>

              
                <p>Contrast sensitivity (CS), which constrains human vision, decreases from fovea to periphery, from the horizontal to the vertical meridian, and from the lower vertical to the upper vertical meridian. It also depends on spatial frequency (SF), and the contrast sensitivity function (CSF) depicts this relation. To compensate for these visual constraints, we constantly make saccades and foveate on relevant objects in the scene. Already before saccade onset, presaccadic attention shifts to the saccade target and enhances perception. However, it is unknown whether and how it modulates the interplay between CS and SF, and if this effect varies around polar angle meridians. CS enhancement may result from a horizontal or vertical shift of the CSF, increase in bandwidth, or any combination. In addition, presaccadic attention could enhance CS similarly around the visual field, or it could benefit perception more at locations with poorer performance (i.e., vertical meridian). Here, we investigated these possibilities by extracting key attributes of the CSF of human observers. The results reveal that presaccadic attention (1) increases CS across SF, (2) increases the most preferred and the highest discernable SF, and (3) narrows the bandwidth. Therefore, presaccadic attention helps bridge the gap between presaccadic and postsaccadic input by increasing visibility at the saccade target. Counterintuitively, this CS enhancement was more pronounced where perception is better&mdash;along the horizontal than the vertical meridian&mdash;exacerbating polar angle asymmetries. Our results call for an investigation of the differential neural modulations underlying presaccadic perceptual changes for different saccade directions.</p>

                <p>When presented shortly after another, discrete pictures are naturally perceived as continuous. The neuronal mechanism underlying such continuous or discrete perception is not well understood. While continuous alpha oscillations are a candidate for orchestrating such neuronal mechanisms, recent evidence is mixed. In this study, we investigated the influence of prestimulus alpha oscillation on visual temporal perception. Specifically, we were interested in whether prestimulus alpha phase modulates neuronal and perceptual processes underlying discrete or continuous perception. Participants had to report the location of a missing object in a visual temporal integration task, while simultaneously MEG data were recorded. Using source reconstruction, we evaluated local phase effects by contrasting phase angle values between correctly and incorrectly integrated trials. Our results show a phase opposition cluster between &ndash;0.8 and &ndash;0.5&nbsp;s (relative to stimulus presentation) and between 6 and 20&nbsp;Hz. These momentary phase angle values were correlated with behavioral performance and event-related potential amplitude. There was no evidence that frequency defined a window of temporal integration.</p>

                Background Case detection for Tuberculosis remains low in high-burden communities. Community Health Workers (CHWs) are the first point of contact for many rural Nigerians and have been useful in active case finding. This study assessed the effectiveness of cash incentives and training on tuberculosis case detection by CHWs in six Local Government Areas in Nigeria. Materials and Methods A cluster randomized control trial with three arms was conducted. Arm A received cash incentives and training, Arm B received only training, and the control arm (C) received neither. CHWs already working in the communities participated. TB case notification and number of community outreaches held were used to assess intervention effects. Data were analyzed using STATA (v.13) and GraphPad Prism (v.8). Effect sizes were calculated using odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals. Associations were tested using Chi-square (ÏÂ²) tests, with significance set at P=0.05. Results Arm A had a 14.4% increase in case notification, Arm B showed a 7.4% increase, and the control arm showed a 39.7% increase from the previous year. Arms A and B had lower odds of TB case notification post-intervention, compared to the control (OR = 0.819 and 0.769, respectively), with no significant difference between them. Arm A also saw a 144.8% increase in community outreaches, compared to 46.7% in Arm B and 22.7% in Control Arm C. Arms A and B had higher odds of carrying out community outreaches post-intervention compared to the control (OR = 1.995 and 1.195, respectively), but no significant differences were found between the groups regarding community outreach. Conclusion While the interventions resulted in an increased number of community outreaches compared to the control, case notification improved more in the control arm than in the intervention arms. Nevertheless, the findings highlight the potential of combining cash incentives with training to improve TB control efforts at the community level. Further exploration of the implementation process may shed light on the observed outcomes and guide future intervention strategies.

                Background The process of preparing a scientific manuscript is intricate, encompassing several critical stages, including pre-writing, research development, drafting, peer review, editing, publication, dissemination, and access. Among these, the peer review process (PRP) stands out as a pivotal component requiring seamless collaboration among editors, reviewers, and authors. Reviewers play a crucial role in assessing the manuscriptâs quality and providing constructive feedback, which authors must adeptly navigate to enhance their work and meet journal standards. This process can often appear daunting and time-consuming, as authors are required to address numerous comments and requested changes. Authors are encouraged to perceive reviewers as consultants rather than adversaries, viewing their critiques as opportunities for improvement rather than personal attacks. Methods Opinion article. Aim To equip authors with practical strategies for engaging effectively in the PRP and improving their publication acceptance rates. Results Key guidelines include thoroughly understanding and prioritizing feedback, maintaining professionalism, and systematically addressing each comment. In cases of significant disagreement or misunderstanding, authors have the option to refer the issue to the editor. Crafting a well-organized and scientific âresponse to reviewsâ along with the revised manuscript can substantially increase the likelihood of acceptance. Best practices for writing an effective response to reviews include expressing gratitude, addressing major revisions first, seeking opinions from co-authors and colleagues, and adhering strictly to journal guidelines. Emphasizing the importance of planning responses, highlighting changes in the revised manuscript, and conducting a final review ensures all corrections are properly documented. Conclusion By following these guidelines, authors can enhance their manuscriptsâ quality, foster positive relationships with reviewers, and ultimately contribute to scholarly advancement.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1052/v1?src=rss">Retrospective study on pain management pathway for patients with suspected renal/ ureteric colic in a U.K. accidents and emergency department: A quality improvement project [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background In acute settings around the globe, renal/ureteric colic remains one of the most common diagnoses for patients presenting with loin-to-groin pain. Even though management spans from medical expulsive therapies to surgical options, pain as a significant component of a patientâs presentation must be dealt with quickly, decisively, and safely, as it can be excruciating and its effects on overall health are dire. This study aimed to explore compliance with the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines for pain management in patients with suspected renal/ureteric colic. It includes the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), intravenous paracetamol, and opioids as first-, second-, and third-line analgesics, respectively, and does not offer antispasmodics. In the event of deviations from the standard, the aim was to put in corrective measures, followed by re-exploration of compliance with patient care. Methods This study involved a single healthcare facility with the study type being retrospective before interventions and prospective after interventions. In the first cycle, we retrieved and analysed 78 patients records whom had been suspected to have renal/ureteric colic between July and September 2022. The inclusion criteria were documented complaints of âflank/loin-to-groin painâ and diagnosis prior to performing diagnostic tests. We surveyed the first-, second-, and third-line painkillers issued, and whether an antispasmodic was given. We collected and entered data into a Microsoft Excel file and correlated it with NICE standards. Having found deviations from the standard, we conducted interventions, allowed time for clinicians to adapt, and re-explored compliance using patient case records [n=58] between February and May 2023. Results In the 1st cycle, 78 patients were suspected of having renal/ureteric colic. M: F = 1.2:1. Non-contrast computerized tomography of the kidney ureters and bladder (NC-CTKUB) confirmed 87% of patients with stones and 3% had no stones. NC-CTKUB was not performed in 9% of patients because they were young, and urinalysis showed no microscopic hematuria. One patient had discharged against medical advise before the NC-CTKUB was performed. Compliance with the NICE pain management guidelines for suspected renal/ureteric colic was full in 23% of cases but unsatisfactory in 78% of cases. In the 2nd cycle, M: F = 1.5:1, NC-CTKUB was not re-audited, as the first cycle study yielded excellent results, and our action plan resulted in an NICE pain management compliance rate of 56%. Although our interventions resulted in improvements of more than twice the initial results, work still needs to be performed. Conclusion Cliniciansâ ability to correctly diagnose renal/ureteric colic is remarkable. However, the pain management compliance rate indicates room for improvement. This may be due to the limited awareness of the NICE guideline or the fact that the clinical team has an affinity for certain analgesics compared to others. We propose the need to consider select variables to existing standard guidelines to enhance compliance for improved patient care.

                Background: With the tremendous increase in the usage of smart meters for industrial/ household purposes, their implementation is considered a crucial challenge in the Internet of Things (IoT) world, leading to a demand for emerging 5G technology. In addition, a large amount of data has to be communicated by smart meters efficiently, which needs a significant enhancement in bandwidth. The power amplifier (PA) plays a major role in deciding the efficiency and bandwidth of the entire communication system. Among the various modes of PAs, a newly developed Class-J mode PA has been proven to achieve high efficiency over a wide bandwidth by maintaining linearity. Methods: This paper proposes a Class-J mode PA design methodology using a CGH40010F-GaN device that operates at a 3.5 GHz frequency to meet the requirements of 5G wireless communication technology for the replacement of existing 4G/LTE technology used for advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) in smart grids. This research's main objective is to design the proper matching networks (M.Ns) to achieve Class-J mode operation that satisfies the bandwidth requirements of 5G smart grid applications. With the target impedances obtained using the load-pull simulation, lumped element matching networks are analyzed and designed in 3 ways using the ADS EDA tool. Results: The simulation results reveal that the proposed Class-J PA provides a maximum drain efficiency (D.E) of 82%, power added efficiency (PAE) of 67% with 13 dB small-signal gain at 3.5 GHz, and output power of 40 dBm (41.4 dBm peak) with a power gain of approximately 7 dB over a bandwidth of approximately 400 MHz with a 28 V power supply into a 50 Î© load. Conclusion: The efficiency and bandwidth of the proposed Class-J PA can be enhanced further by fine-tuning the matching network design to make it more suitable for 5G smart meter/grid applications.

                Background Sudden and unexpected deaths are increasing drastically. The main cause of sudden death is cardiovascular disease, out of which coronary artery disease predominates forming 80% of the cases. Most of the time, detecting early changes in myocardial infarction during the autopsy is challenging since gross infarct changes do not appear until after 24 to 48 hours of myocardial ischemia injury. So, the aim of this study was to compare two test to detect early changes of Myocardial Infarction one by using Triphenyl Tetrazolium Chloride (TTC) staining of the myocardial tissue, during autopsy and other by histopathological examination. Methods The sample size of 60 hearts taken from all the sudden deaths cases brought to Mortuary with suspected cause of death due to cardiac origin. The heart was obtained from the deceased by standard post-mortem technique. Serial full-thickness transverse sections of the heart were taken at 2 cm intervals from the apex to the atrioventricular groove. All the serial slices of heart are taken for histochemical staining and TTC staining. Results In histopathological examination 34 hearts were diagnosed with myocardial infarction and 26 hearts reported non myocardial infarction. With TTC 40 hearts remained unstained suggestive of myocardial infarction and 20 hearts were stained suggestive of non-infarcted hearts. TTC staining in our study shows an accuracy of 88.33%. Conclusion The result of this study shows that the Triphenyl Tetrazolium Chloride test, a histochemical staining technique of heart, is reliable approach for forensic pathologists to diagnose early myocardial infarction during the post-mortem examination.

The involvement of non-coding RNAs in biological processes and diseases has made the exploration of their functions crucial. Most non-coding RNAs have yet to be studied, creating the need for methods that can rapidly classify large sets of non-coding RNAs into functional groups, or classes. In recent years, the success of deep learning in various domains led to its application to non-coding RNA classification. Multiple novel architectures have been developed, but these advancements are not covered by current literature reviews. We present an exhaustive comparison of the different methods proposed in the state-of-the-art and describe their associated datasets. Moreover, the literature lacks objective benchmarks. We perform experiments to fairly evaluate the performance of various tools for non-coding RNA classification on popular datasets. The robustness of methods to non-functional sequences and sequence boundary noise is explored. We also measure computation time and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. With regard to these results, we assess the relevance of the different architectural choices and provide recommendations to consider in future methods.

Cyanobacteria hold great potential to revolutionize conventional industries and farming practices with their light-driven chemical production. To fully exploit their photosynthetic capacity and enhance product yield, it is crucial to investigate their intricate interplay with the environment including the light intensity and spectrum. Mathematical models provide valuable insights for optimizing strategies in this pursuit. In this study, we present an ordinary differential equation-based model for the cyanobacterium <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC 6803 to assess its performance under various light sources, including monochromatic light. Our model can reproduce a variety of physiologically measured quantities, e.g. experimentally reported partitioning of electrons through four main pathways, O<sub>2</sub> evolution, and the rate of carbon fixation for ambient and saturated CO<sub>2</sub>. By capturing the interactions between different components of a photosynthetic system, our model helps in understanding the underlying mechanisms driving system behavior. Our model qualitatively reproduces fluorescence emitted under various light regimes, replicating Pulse-amplitude modulation (PAM) fluorometry experiments with saturating pulses. Using our model, we test four hypothesized mechanisms of cyanobacterial state transitions for ensemble of parameter sets and found no physiological benefit of a model assuming phycobilisome detachment. Moreover, we evaluate metabolic control for biotechnological production under diverse light colors and irradiances. We suggest gene targets for overexpression under different illuminations to increase the yield. By offering a comprehensive computational model of cyanobacterial photosynthesis, our work enhances the basic understanding of light-dependent cyanobacterial behavior and sets the first wavelength-dependent framework to systematically test their producing capacity for biocatalysis.

                <p>by Justin Lin, Julia Fukuyama</p>

The goal of dimension reduction tools is to construct a low-dimensional representation of high-dimensional data. These tools are employed for a variety of reasons such as noise reduction, visualization, and to lower computational costs. However, there is a fundamental issue that is discussed in other modeling problems that is often overlooked in dimension reductionâoverfitting. In the context of other modeling problems, techniques such as feature-selection, cross-validation, and regularization are employed to combat overfitting, but rarely are such precautions taken when applying dimension reduction. Prior applications of the two most popular non-linear dimension reduction methods, t-SNE and UMAP, fail to acknowledge data as a combination of signal and noise when assessing performance. These methods are typically calibrated to capture the entirety of the data, not just the signal. In this paper, we demonstrate the importance of acknowledging noise when calibrating hyperparameters and present a framework that enables users to do so. We use this framework to explore the role hyperparameter calibration plays in overfitting the data when applying t-SNE and UMAP. More specifically, we show previously recommended values for perplexity and n_neighbors are too small and overfit the noise. We also provide a workflow others may use to calibrate hyperparameters in the presence of noise.

                <p>by Daniel Steiert, Corey Wittig, Priyanka Banerjee, Robert Preissner, Robert Szulcek</p>
Background <p>In the modern era, the growth of scientific literature presents a daunting challenge for researchers to keep informed of advancements across multiple disciplines.</p> Objective <p>We apply natural language processing (NLP) and embedding learning concepts to design PubDigest, a tool that combs PubMed literature, aiming to pinpoint potential drugs that could be repurposed.</p> Methods <p>Using NLP, especially term associations through word embeddings, we explored unrecognized relationships between drugs and diseases. To illustrate the utility of PubDigest, we focused on chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH), a rare disease with an overall limited number of scientific publications.</p> Results <p>Our literature analysis identified key clinical features linked to CTEPH by applying term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) scoring, a technique measuring a termâs significance in a text corpus. This allowed us to map related diseases. One standout was venous thrombosis (VT), which showed strong semantic links with CTEPH. Looking deeper, we discovered potential repurposing candidates for CTEPH through large-scale neural network-based contextualization of literature and predictive modeling on both the CTEPH and the VT literature corpora to find novel, yet unrecognized associations between the two diseases. Alongside the anti-thrombotic agent caplacizumab, benzofuran derivatives were an intriguing find. In particular, the benzofuran derivative amiodarone displayed potential anti-thrombotic properties in the literature. Our <i>in vitro</i> tests confirmed amiodaroneâs ability to reduce platelet aggregation significantly by 68% (p = 0.02). However, real-world clinical data indicated that CTEPH patients receiving amiodarone treatment faced a significant 15.9% higher mortality risk (p<0.001).</p> Conclusions <p>While NLP offers an innovative approach to interpreting scientific literature, especially for drug repurposing, it is crucial to combine it with complementary methods like <i>in vitro</i> testing and real-world evidence. Our exploration with benzofuran derivatives and CTEPH underscores this point. Thus, blending NLP with hands-on experiments and real-world clinical data can pave the way for faster and safer drug repurposing approaches, especially for rare diseases like CTEPH.</p>

As genomics technologies advance, there is a growing demand for computational biologists trained for genomics analysis but instructors face significant hurdles in providing formal training in computer programming, statistics, and genomics to biology students. Fully online learners represent a significant and growing community that can contribute to meet this need, but they are frequently excluded from valuable research opportunities which mostly do not offer the flexibility they need. To address these opportunity gaps, we developed an asynchronous course-based undergraduate research experience (CURE) for computational genomics specifically for fully online biology students. We generated custom learning materials and leveraged remotely accessible computational tools to address 2 novel research questions over 2 iterations of the genomics CURE, one testing bioinformatics approaches and one mining cancer genomics data. Here, we present how the instructional team distributed analysis needed to address these questions between students over a 7.5-week CURE and provided concurrent training in biology and statistics, computer programming, and professional development. Scores from identical learning assessments administered before and after completion of each CURE showed significant learning gains across biology and coding course objectives. Open-response progress reports were submitted weekly and identified self-reported adaptive coping strategies for challenges encountered throughout the course. Progress reports identified problems that could be resolved through collaboration with instructors and peers via messaging platforms and virtual meetings. We implemented asynchronous communication using the Slack messaging platform and an asynchronous journal club where students discussed relevant publications using the Perusall social annotation platform. The online genomics CURE resulted in unanticipated positive outcomes, including students voluntarily discussing plans to continue research after the course. These outcomes underscore the effectiveness of this genomics CURE for scientific training, recruitment and student-mentor relationships, and student successes. Asynchronous genomics CUREs can contribute to a more skilled, diverse, and inclusive workforce for the advancement of biomedical science.

                <p>by Peter S. Back, Vignesh Senthilkumar, Charles P. Choi, Justin J. Quan, Qing Lou, Anne K. Snyder, Andrew M. Ly, Justin G. Lau, Z. Hong Zhou, Gary E. Ward, Peter J. Bradley</p>

Apicomplexan parasites possess several specialized structures to invade their host cells and replicate successfully. One of these is the inner membrane complex (IMC), a peripheral membrane-cytoskeletal system underneath the plasma membrane. It is composed of a series of flattened, membrane-bound vesicles and a cytoskeletal subpellicular network (SPN) comprised of intermediate filament-like proteins called alveolins. While the alveolin proteins are conserved throughout the Apicomplexa and the broader Alveolata, their precise functions and interactions remain poorly understood. Here, we describe the function of one of these alveolin proteins in <i>Toxoplasma</i>, IMC6. Disruption of IMC6 resulted in striking morphological defects that led to aberrant invasion and replication but surprisingly minor effects on motility. Deletion analyses revealed that the alveolin domain alone is largely sufficient to restore localization and partially sufficient for function. As this highlights the importance of the IMC6 alveolin domain, we implemented unnatural amino acid photoreactive crosslinking to the alveolin domain and identified multiple binding interfaces between IMC6 and 2 other cytoskeletal IMC proteinsâIMC3 and ILP1. This provides direct evidence of proteinâprotein interactions in the alveolin domain and supports the long-held hypothesis that the alveolin domain is responsible for filament formation. Collectively, our study features the conserved alveolin proteins as critical components that maintain the parasiteâs structural integrity and highlights the alveolin domain as a key mediator of SPN architecture.

                Background Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin condition that has a significant impact on quality of life. The immune response and allergy symptoms in AD are triggered by the recognition of specific allergens by IgE antibodies. Cross-reactivity can lead to auto-IgE responses, potentially worsening AD symptoms. Our research aimed to enhance our understanding of allergenic sources, including A. fumigatus, and their role in AD. We focused on molecular mimicry between human AQP3 and A. fumigatus aquaporin. Methods In our in-silico analysis, we compared the amino acid sequences of human aquaporin 3 (AQP3) and A. fumigatus aquaporin with 25 aquaporins from various allergenic sources, sourced from the UniProt and NCBI databases. Phylogenetic relationship analysis and homology-based modeling were conducted. We identified conserved antigenic regions located within the 3D structures. Results The global identity levels among the studied aquaporins averaged 32.6%. One antigenic site exhibited a remarkable local region, with a conserved identity of 71.4%. We categorized the aquaporins into five monophyletic clades (AâE), with group B showing the highest identity (95%), including six mammalian aquaporins, including AQP3. When comparing A. fumigatus aquaporins, the highest identity was observed with Malassezia sympodialis at 35%. Both human and A. fumigatus aquaporins have three linear and three discontinuous epitopes. Conclusions We identified potential linear and conformational epitopes of AQP3, indicating a possible molecular mimicry between humans and A. fumigatus aquaporins. This suggests autoreactivity and potential cross-reactivity, although further validation using in vitro and in vivo experiments is required.

                We present the results of the human genomic small variant calling benchmarking initiative of the German Research Foundation (DFG) funded Next Generation Sequencing Competence Network (NGS-CN) and the German Human Genome-Phenome Archive (GHGA). In this effort, we developed NCBench, a continuous benchmarking platform for the evaluation of small genomic variant callsets in terms of recall, precision, and false positive/negative error patterns. NCBench is implemented as a continuously re-evaluated open-source repository. We show that it is possible to entirely rely on public free infrastructure (Github, Github Actions, Zenodo) in combination with established open-source tools. NCBench is agnostic of the used dataset and can evaluate an arbitrary number of given callsets, while reporting the results in a visual and interactive way. We used NCBench to evaluate over 40 callsets generated by various variant calling pipelines available in the participating groups that were run on three exome datasets from different enrichment kits and at different coverages. While all pipelines achieve high overall quality, subtle systematic differences between callers and datasets exist and are made apparent by NCBench.These insights are useful to improve existing pipelines and develop new workflows. NCBench is meant to be open for the contribution of any given callset. Most importantly, for authors, it will enable the omission of repeated re-implementation of paper-specific variant calling benchmarks for the publication of new tools or pipelines, while readers will benefit from being able to (continuously) observe the performance of tools and pipelines at the time of reading instead of at the time of writing.

While project planning and scheduling tools are already available to support traditional project management approaches, flexible project management approaches, such as agile, extreme, and hybrid project planning, are less well supported by software tools, especially freely available software packages. To our knowledge, no existing R package for project planning and scheduling can support flexible projects. This paper aims to fill this gap by introducing and describing the R package mfpp for matrix-based flexible project planning/scheduling. This package includes a comprehensive set of tools for project managers to schedule both traditional and flexible project plans. The use of the package is illustrated through examples.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27060?af=R">Clinical, Radiological and Pathological Features of a Large American Cohort of Spinocerebellar Ataxia (SCA27B)</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>Spinocerebellar ataxia 27B due to GAA repeat expansions in the fibroblast growth factor 14 (<i>FGF14</i>) gene has recently been recognized as a common cause of late-onset hereditary cerebellar ataxia. Here we present the first report of this disease in the US population, characterizing its clinical manifestations, disease progression, pathological abnormalities, and response to 4-aminopyridine in a cohort of 102 patients bearing GAA repeat expansions.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We compiled a series of patients with SCA27B, recruited from 5 academic centers across the United States. Clinical manifestations and patient demographics were collected retrospectively from clinical records in an unblinded approach using a standardized form. Post-mortem analysis was done on 4 brains of patients with genetically confirmed SCA27B.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In our cohort of 102 patients with SCA27B, we found that SCA27B was a late-onset (57âÂ±â12.5âyears) slowly progressive ataxia with an episodic component in 51% of patients. Balance and gait impairment were almost always present at disease onset. The principal finding on post-mortem examination of 4 brain specimens was loss of Purkinje neurons that was most severe in the vermis most particularly in the anterior vermis. Similar to European populations, a high percent of patients 21/28 (75%) reported a positive treatment response with 4-aminopyridine.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our study further estimates prevalence and further expands the clinical, imaging and pathological features of SCA27B, while looking at treatment response, disease progression, and survival in patients with this disease. Testing for SCA27B should be considered in all undiagnosed ataxia patients, especially those with episodic onset. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1049/v1?src=rss">A guide to selecting high-performing antibodies for STING1 (Uniprot ID: Q86WV6) for use in western blot, immunoprecipitation, and immunofluorescence [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                STING1 is an immune adaptor protein which promotes innate immune defense mechanisms against pathogens. Its role in modulating inflammation links STING1 to various pathologic conditions, positioning it as a key target for therapeutic interventions aimed at regulating immune responses. To advance our understanding of STING1-associated diseases, it is essential to make high-performing antibodies readily accessible to the scientific community. This study aims to improve reliability of STING1 research as we have characterized sixteen STING1 commercial antibodies for western blot, immunoprecipitation, and immunofluorescence using a standardized experimental protocol based on comparing read-outs in knockout cell lines and isogenic parental controls. These studies are part of a larger, collaborative initiative seeking to address antibody reproducibility issues by characterizing commercially available antibodies for human proteins and publishing the results openly as a resource for the scientific community. While use of antibodies and protocols vary between laboratories, we encourage readers to use this report as a guide to select the most appropriate antibodies for their specific needs.

                Migraine is highly prevalent and debilitating. The persistent headaches in this condition are thought to arise from the activation and sensitization of the trigeminovascular pathway. Both clinical and animal model studies have suggested that neuroimmune interactions contribute to the pathophysiology of migraine headache. In this review, we first summarize the findings from human studies implicating the dysregulation of the immune system in migraine, including genetic analyses, measurement of circulatory factors, and neuroimaging data. We next discuss recent advances from rodent studies aimed at elucidating the neuroimmune interactions that manifest at various levels of the trigeminovascular pathway and lead to the recruitment of innate and adaptive immune cells as well as immunocompetent glial cells. These cells reciprocally modulate neuronal activity via multiple pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators, thereby regulating peripheral and central sensitization. Throughout the discussions, we highlight the potential clinical and translational implications of the findings.

                Why do we âchoke under pressure,â underperforming when we want to succeed the most? Smoulder etÂ al. identify a neural basis of this paradoxical phenomenon in the motor cortex, where greater rewards influence movement preparatory neural states to be closer to, then farther from, an optimal zone for upcoming movements.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95412">Altered firing output of VIP interneurons and early dysfunctions in CA1 hippocampal circuits in the 3xTg mouse model of Alzheimerâs disease</a></h4>

              
                Alzheimerâs disease (AD) leads to progressive memory decline, and alterations in hippocampal function are among the earliest pathological features observed in human and animal studies. GABAergic interneurons (INs) within the hippocampus coordinate network activity, among which type 3 interneuron-specific (I-S3) cells expressing vasoactive intestinal polypeptide and calretinin play a crucial role. These cells provide primarily disinhibition to principal excitatory cells (PCs) in the hippocampal CA1 region, regulating incoming inputs and memory formation. However, it remains unclear whether AD pathology induces changes in the activity of I-S3 cells, impacting the hippocampal network motifs. Here, using young adult 3xTg-AD mice, we found that while the density and morphology of I-S3 cells remain unaffected, there were significant changes in their firing output. Specifically, I-S3 cells displayed elongated action potentials and decreased firing rates, which was associated with a reduced inhibition of CA1 INs and their higher recruitment during spatial decision-making and object exploration tasks. Furthermore, the activation of CA1 PCs was also impacted, signifying early disruptions in CA1 network functionality. These findings suggest that altered firing patterns of I-S3 cells might initiate early-stage dysfunction in hippocampal CA1 circuits, potentially influencing the progression of AD pathology.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/89470">Improved inference of population histories by integrating genomic and epigenomic data</a></h4>

              
                With the availability of high-quality full genome polymorphism (SNPs) data, it becomes feasible to study the past demographic and selective history of populations in exquisite detail. However, such inferences still suffer from a lack of statistical resolution for recent, for example bottlenecks, events, and/or for populations with small nucleotide diversity. Additional heritable (epi)genetic markers, such as indels, transposable elements, microsatellites, or cytosine methylation, may provide further, yet untapped, information on the recent past population history. We extend the Sequential Markovian Coalescent (SMC) framework to jointly use SNPs and other hyper-mutable markers. We are able to (1) improve the accuracy of demographic inference in recent times, (2) uncover past demographic events hidden to SNP-based inference methods, and (3) infer the hyper-mutable marker mutation rates under a finite site model. As a proof of principle, we focus on demographic inference in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> using DNA methylation diversity data from 10 European natural accessions. We demonstrate that segregating single methylated polymorphisms (SMPs) satisfy the modeling assumptions of the SMC framework, while differentially methylated regions (DMRs) are not suitable as their length exceeds that of the genomic distance between two recombination events. Combining SNPs and SMPs while accounting for site- and region-level epimutation processes, we provide new estimates of the glacial age bottleneck and post-glacial population expansion of the European <i>A. thaliana</i> population. Our SMC framework readily accounts for a wide range of heritable genomic markers, thus paving the way for next-generation inference of evolutionary history by combining information from several genetic and epigenetic markers.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96907">Dysfunction of Calcyphosine-Like gene impairs retinal angiogenesis through the MYC axis and is associated with familial exudative vitreoretinopathy</a></h4>

              
                Familial exudative vitreoretinopathy (FEVR) is a severe genetic disorder characterized by incomplete vascularization of the peripheral retina and associated symptoms that can lead to vision loss. However, the underlying genetic causes of approximately 50% of FEVR cases remain unknown. Here, we report two heterozygous variants in calcyphosine-like gene (<i>CAPSL</i>) that is associated with FEVR. Both variants exhibited compromised CAPSL protein expression. Vascular endothelial cell (EC)-specific inactivation of <i>Capsl</i> resulted in delayed radial/vertical vascular progression, compromised endothelial proliferation/migration, recapitulating the human FEVR phenotypes. <i>CAPSL</i>-depleted human retinal microvascular endothelial cells (HRECs) exhibited impaired tube formation, decreased cell proliferation, disrupted cell polarity establishment, and filopodia/lamellipodia formation, as well as disrupted collective cell migration. Transcriptomic and proteomic profiling revealed that <i>CAPSL</i> abolition inhibited the MYC signaling axis, in which the expression of core MYC targeted genes were profoundly decreased. Furthermore, a combined analysis of <i>CAPSL</i>-depleted HRECs and <i>c-MYC</i>-depleted human umbilical vein endothelial cells uncovered similar transcription patterns. Collectively, this study reports a novel FEVR-associated candidate gene, <i>CAPSL</i>, which provides valuable information for genetic counseling of FEVR. This study also reveals that compromised CAPSL function may cause FEVR through MYC axis, shedding light on the potential involvement of MYC signaling in the pathogenesis of FEVR.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98181">Upregulated expression of ubiquitin ligase TRIM21 promotes PKM2 nuclear translocation and astrocyte activation in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis</a></h4>

              
                Reactive astrocytes play critical roles in the occurrence of various neurological diseases such as multiple sclerosis. Activation of astrocytes is often accompanied by a glycolysis-dominant metabolic switch. However, the role and molecular mechanism of metabolic reprogramming in activation of astrocytes have not been clarified. Here, we found that PKM2, a rate-limiting enzyme of glycolysis, displayed nuclear translocation in astrocytes of EAE (experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis) mice, an animal model of multiple sclerosis. Prevention of PKM2 nuclear import by DASA-58 significantly reduced the activation of mice primary astrocytes, which was observed by decreased proliferation, glycolysis and secretion of inflammatory cytokines. Most importantly, we identified the ubiquitination-mediated regulation of PKM2 nuclear import by ubiquitin ligase TRIM21. TRIM21 interacted with PKM2, promoted its nuclear translocation and stimulated its nuclear activity to phosphorylate STAT3, NF-ÎºB and interact with c-myc. Further single-cell RNA sequencing and immunofluorescence staining demonstrated that TRIM21 expression was upregulated in astrocytes of EAE. TRIM21 overexpressing in mice primary astrocytes enhanced PKM2-dependent glycolysis and proliferation, which could be reversed by DASA-58. Moreover, intracerebroventricular injection of a lentiviral vector to knockdown TRIM21 in astrocytes or intraperitoneal injection of TEPP-46, which inhibit the nuclear translocation of PKM2, effectively decreased disease severity, CNS inflammation and demyelination in EAE. Collectively, our study provides novel insights into the pathological function of nuclear glycolytic enzyme PKM2 and ubiquitination-mediated regulatory mechanism that are involved in astrocyte activation. Targeting this axis may be a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of astrocyte-involved neurological disease.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95549">Fine-scale tracking reveals visual field use for predator detection and escape in collective foraging of pigeon flocks</a></h4>

              
                During collective vigilance, it is commonly assumed that individual animals compromise their feeding time to be vigilant against predators, benefiting the entire group. One notable issue with this assumption concerns the unclear nature of predator âdetectionâ, particularly in terms of vision. It remains uncertain how a vigilant individual utilizes its high-acuity vision (such as the fovea) to detect a predator cue and subsequently guide individual and collective escape responses. Using fine-scale motion-capture technologies, we tracked the head and body orientations of pigeons (hence reconstructed their visual fields and foveal projections) foraging in a flock during simulated predator attacks. Pigeons used their fovea to inspect predator cues. Earlier foveation on a predator cue was linked to preceding behaviors related to vigilance and feeding, such as head-up or down positions, head-scanning, and food-pecking. Moreover, earlier foveation predicted earlier evasion flights at both the individual and collective levels. However, we also found that relatively long delay between their foveation and escape responses in individuals obscured the relationship between these two responses. While our results largely support the existing assumptions about vigilance, they also underscore the importance of considering vision and addressing the disparity between detection and escape responses in future research.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94302">S-acylation of NLRP3 provides a nigericin sensitive gating mechanism that controls access to the Golgi</a></h4>

              
                NLRP3 is an inflammasome seeding pattern recognition receptor activated in response to multiple danger signals which perturb intracellular homeostasis. Electrostatic interactions between the NLRP3 polybasic (PB) region and negatively charged lipids on the trans-Golgi network (TGN) have been proposed to recruit NLRP3 to the TGN. In this study, we demonstrate that membrane association of NLRP3 is critically dependant on S-acylation of a highly conserved cysteine residue (Cys-130), which traps NLRP3 in a dynamic S-acylation cycle at the Golgi, and a series of hydrophobic residues preceding Cys-130 which act in conjunction with the PB region to facilitate Cys-130 dependent Golgi enrichment. Due to segregation from Golgi localised thioesterase enzymes caused by a nigericin induced breakdown in Golgi organisation and function, NLRP3 becomes immobilised on the Golgi through reduced de-acylation of its Cys-130 lipid anchor, suggesting that disruptions in Golgi homeostasis are conveyed to NLRP3 through its acylation state. Thus, our work defines a nigericin sensitive S-acylation cycle that gates access of NLRP3 to the Golgi.

">Adrenergic C1 neurons enhance anxiety via projections to PAG</a></h4>

              
                Anxiety is an emotional state precipitated by the anticipation of real or potential threats. Anxiety disorders are the most prevalent psychiatric illnesses globally and increase the risk of developing comorbid conditions that negatively impact the brain and body. The etiology of anxiety disorders remains unresolved, limiting improvement of therapeutic strategies to alleviate anxiety-related symptoms with increased specificity and efficacy. Here, we applied novel intersectional tools to identify a discrete population of brainstem adrenergic neurons, named C1 cells, that promote aversion and anxiety-related behaviors via projections to the periaqueductal gray matter (PAG). While C1 cells have traditionally been implicated in modulation of autonomic processes, rabies tracing revealed that they receive input from brain areas with diverse functions. Calcium-based in vivo imaging showed that activation of C1 cells enhances excitatory responses in vlPAG, activity that is exacerbated in times of heightened stress. Furthermore, inhibition of C1 cells impedes the development of anxiety-like behaviors in response to stressful situations. Overall, these findings suggest that C1 neurons are positioned to integrate complex information from the brain and periphery for the promotion of anxiety-like behaviors.

">Anatomically distinct regions in the inferior frontal cortex are modulated by task and reading skill</a></h4>

              
                Inferior frontal cortex (IFC) is a critical region for reading and language. This part of the cortex is highly heterogeneous in its structural and functional organization and shows high variability across individuals. Despite decades of research, the relationship between specific IFC regions and reading skill remains unclear. To shed light on the function of IFC in reading, we aim to (1) characterize the functional landscape of text-selective responses in the IFC, while accounting for interindividual variability; and (2) examine how text-selective regions in the IFC relate to reading proficiency. To this end, children with a wide range of reading ability (N=66; age 7-14 years, 34 female, 32 male) completed functional MRI scans while performing two tasks on text and non-text visual stimuli. Importantly, both tasks do not explicitly require reading, and can be performed on all visual stimuli. This design allows us to tease apart stimulus-driven responses from task-driven responses and examine where in the IFC task and stimulus interact. We were able to identify three anatomically-distinct, text-selective clusters of activation in the IFC, in the inferior frontal sulcus (IFS), and dorsal and ventral precentral gyrus (PrG). These three regions showed a strong task effect that was highly specific to text. Furthermore, text-selectivity in the IFS and dorsal PrG was associated with reading proficiency, such that better readers showed higher selectivity to text. These findings suggest that text-selective regions in the IFC are sensitive to both stimulus and task, and highlight the importance of this region for proficient reading.

Evidence shows that impaired somatostatin (SST) expression, particularly in SST-expressing GABAergic neurons, significantly contributes to AD-related pathophysiology and may increase cognitive burden. Additionally, SST+ interneurons in cortical layers and the hippocampus inhibit the dendrites of excitatory neurons, primarily through 5-GABAA receptors involved in cognitive regulation. Leveraging the potential of a newly developed small molecule that targets the 5-GABAA receptors via positive allosteric modulation (5-PAM), we aim to assess its effects on tau phosphorylation-related neuronal morphology, cognitive deficits and protein expression. Methods: In the PS19 transgenic mouse mode, we administered the 5-PAM, GL-II-73, either acutely or chronically at 3 and 6 months. We assessed spatial working memory using the Y-maze. Golgi staining analyzed dendritic morphology in chronically exposed mice to 5-PAM. Western blotting was used to quantify p-Tau and Tau expression. Results: 5-PAM effectively reverses spatial working memory deficits induced by tau phosphorylation both acutely and chronically. Chronic treatment at 3and 6 months mitigates tau-induced loss of spine density. However, 5-PAM does not directly influence p-Tau levels, suggesting cognitive and neurotrophic benefits of GL-II-73s are independent of Tau burden. Conclusions: These results demonstrate the potential for both symptomatic and disease-modifying effects, highlighting the promise of 5-GABAA receptor positive allosteric modulation as a novel therapeutic strategy for addressing cognitive deficits associated with tau phosphorylation in AD pathology.

">Single cone photoreceptors experience global image statistics through gaze shifts</a></h4>

              
                Our visual experience does not merely reflect a static view of the world but is a dynamic consequence of our actions, most notably our continuously shifting gaze. These shifts determine the spectral diet of any individual cone photoreceptor. The aim of this study was to characterize that diet and its relationship to scene adaptation. Gaze shifts were recorded from observers freely viewing scenes outdoors for five minutes. Hyperspectral images of the scenes were also recorded from the eye position of observers. As a control, gaze shifts were also recorded from observers viewing the images on a computer-controlled display in the laboratory. From the hyperspectral data, spatially local histograms of estimated excitations in long-, medium-, and short-wavelength-sensitive cones were accumulated over time at different retinal locations. A global illuminant change was then introduced to test how well local retinal adaptation discounted its effects. The results suggest that over short periods individual cones tend to experience the statistics of full scenes, with local adaptation compensating for illumination changes almost as well as global adaptation. This compensation may help to maintain our stable local perception of scene colour despite changes in scene illumination.

">Inhibition mediated by group III mGluRs regulates habenula activity and defensive behaviors</a></h4>

              
                Inhibition contributes to various brain computations from sensory motor transformations to cognitive operations. While most studies on inhibition focus on GABA, the main excitatory neurotransmitter of the brain, glutamate, can also elicit inhibition via metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs). The function of mGluR-mediated inhibition remains largely elusive. Here, we investigated the role of group III mGluR-dependent inhibition in the habenula. This primarily glutamatergic and conserved forebrain region acts as a hub between multiple forebrain inputs and neuromodulatory mid- and hindbrain targets that regulate adaptive behaviors. We showed that both zebrafish and mice habenula express group III mGluRs. We identified that group III mGluRs regulate the membrane potential and calcium activity of zebrafish dorsal habenula. Pharmacological and genetic perturbation of group III mGluRs increased sensory-evoked excitation and reduced selectivity of habenular neurons to different sensory modalities. We also observed that inhibition is the main channel of communication between primarily glutamatergic habenula neurons. Blocking group III mGluRs reduced inhibition within habenula and increased correlations during spontaneous activity. In line with such inhibition within habenula, we identified that multi-sensory information is integrated mainly through competition and suppression across habenular neurons, which in part relies on group III mGluRs. Finally, genetic perturbation of a habenula-specific group III mGluR, mGluR6a, amplified neural responses and defensive behaviors evoked by sensory stimulation and environmental changes. Altogether, our results revealed that mGluR driven inhibition is essential in encoding, integration, and communication of information between Hb neurons, ultimately playing a critical role in regulating defensive and adaptive behaviors.

">The serotonergic psychedelic DOI impairs deviance detection in the auditory cortex</a></h4>

              
                Psychedelics are known to induce profound perceptual distortions, yet the neural mechanisms underlying these effects, particularly within the auditory system, remain poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the effects of the psychedelic compound 2,5-Dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine (DOI), a serotonin 2A receptor agonist, on the activity of neurons in the auditory cortex of awake mice. We examined whether DOI administration alters sound-frequency tuning, variability in neural responses, and deviance detection (a neural process reflecting the balance between top-down and bottom-up processing). Our results show that while DOI does not alter the frequency selectivity of auditory cortical neurons in a consistent manner, it increases trial-by-trial variability in responses and consistently diminishes the neural distinction between expected (standard) and unexpected (oddball) stimuli. This reduction in deviance detection was primarily driven by a decrease in the response to oddball sounds, suggesting that DOI dampens the auditory cortex's sensitivity to unexpected events. These findings provide insights into how psychedelics disrupt sensory processing and shed light on the neural mechanisms underlying the altered perception of auditory stimuli observed in the psychedelic state.

">Neural Dynamics Underlying False Alarms in Extrastriate Cortex</a></h4>

              
                The unfolding of neural population activity can be approximated as a dynamical system. Stability in the latent dynamics that characterize neural population activity has been linked with consistency in animal behavior, such as motor control or value-based decision-making. However, whether similar dynamics characterize perceptual activity and decision-making in the visual cortex is not well understood. To test this, we recorded V4 populations in monkeys engaged in a non-match-to-sample visual change-detection task that required sustained engagement. We measured how the stability in the latent dynamics in V4 might affect monkeys' perceptual behavior. Specifically, we reasoned that unstable sensory neural activity around dynamic attractor boundaries may make animals susceptible to taking incorrect actions when withholding action would have been correct ("false alarms"). We made three key discoveries: 1) greater stability was associated with longer trial sequences; 2) false alarm rate decreased (and reaction times slowed) when neural dynamics were more stable; and, 3) low stability predicted false alarms on a single-trial level, and this relationship depended on the elapsed time during the trial, consistent with the latent neural state approaching an attractor boundary. Our results suggest the same outward false alarm behavior can be attributed to two different potential strategies that can be disambiguated by examining neural stability: 1) premeditated false alarms that might lead to greater stability in population dynamics and faster reaction time and 2) false alarms due to unstable sensory activity consistent with misperception.

">The epitranscriptomic m6A RNA modification modulates synaptic function in ageing and in a mouse model of synucleinopathy</a></h4>

              
                N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most abundant and conserved transcriptional modification in eukaryotic RNA, regulating RNA fate. While the functions of m6A in the development of the mammalian brain have been extensively studied, its roles in synaptic plasticity, cognitive decline, motor function, or other brain circuits remain underexplored. To date, the role of this modification in Parkinson's disease (PD) and other synucleinopathies has been largely unknown. Here, we investigated the m6A epitranscriptome in a mouse model of synucleinopathy. We performed m6A RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (meRIP-seq) to obtain the m6A epitranscriptome of the midbrain in young (3 mo) and aged (15 mo) A30P-aSyn transgenic mice (aSyn Tg) and C57BL6 control wild type (Wt) mice. We observed hypermethylation of synaptic genes in 3 mo aSyn Tg mice compared to age-matched Wt mice. This methylation was reduced during ageing, with synaptic genes becoming increasingly hypomethylated. Using immunofluorescence imaging alongside biochemical analysis, we further investigated the expression of m6A regulatory enzymes writer, N6-Adenosine-Methyltransferase Complex Catalytic Subunit (METTL3); reader, YTH N6-methyladenosine RNA-binding protein (YTHDF1); and eraser, fat mass and obesity-associated protein (FTO) in the cortex, striatum, hippocampus, and cerebellum of Wt and aSyn Tg mice, as well as in primary cortical neuronal cultures. We observed that the levels of METTL3, YTHDF1 and FTO were similar between Wt and aSyn Tg mice. Interestingly, the writer protein METTL3 was found in both the nucleus and in the post-synaptic compartment in neuronal cultures. Our findings suggest that alterations in the regulation of m6A RNA methylation may be associated with neurodegeneration and ageing and that this level of epitranscriptomic regulation plays a significant role at the synapse.

">Integration of binocular vision and motor state to promote prey pursuit</a></h4>

              
                Most animals with two eyes combine the inputs to achieve binocular vision, which can serve numerous functions, and is particularly useful in hunting prey. However, the mechanisms by which visual information from the two eyes are combined remain largely unknown. To address this question, we identified the binocular neurons that respond to prey in zebrafish (bino-PRNs). These neurons respond specifically to prey, and their activity is enhanced during hunting. To explore the relationship between bino-PRNs and hunting, we optogenetically induced hunting and found that the bino-PRNs receive excitatory input during hunting. To determine the role of the bino-PRNs in behavior, we optogenetically activated them, and found that they promote forward prey capture swims. Our results support a model where bino-PRNs integrate sensory information from the two eyes with hunting state information to drive approach toward prey in the binocular zone.

">Loss of neuropeptidergic regulation of cholinergic transmission induces CaV1-mediated homeostatic compensation in muscle cells</a></h4>

              
                Chemical synaptic transmission at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) is regulated by electrical activity of the motor circuit, but may also be affected by neuromodulation. Here, we assess the role of neuropeptide signaling in the plasticity of NMJ function in Caenorhabditis elegans. We show that the CAPS (Ca2+-dependent activator protein for secretion) ortholog UNC-31, which regulates the exocytosis of dense core vesicles (DCVs), affects both pre- and post-synaptic functional properties, as well as NMJ-mediated locomotion. Despite reduced evoked acetylcholine transmission, the loss of unc-31 results in a more vigorous response to presynaptic stimulation, i.e., enhanced muscle contraction and Ca2+ transients. Based on expression profiles, we identified neuropeptides involved in both cholinergic (FLP-6, NLP-9, NLP-21 and NLP-38) and GABAergic motor neurons (FLP-15, NLP-15), that mediate normal transmission at the NMJ. In the absence of these peptides, neurons fail to upregulate their transmitter output in response to increased cAMP signaling. We also identified proprotein convertases encoded by aex-5/kpc-3 and egl-3/kpc-2 that act synergistically to generate these neuropeptides. We propose that postsynaptic homeostatic scaling, mediated by increased muscle excitability, could compensate for the reduced cholinergic transmission in mutants affected for neuropeptide signaling, thus maintaining net synaptic strength. We show that in the absence of UNC-31 muscle excitability is modulated by upregulating the expression of the muscular L-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channel EGL-19 (CaV1). Collectively, our results unveil a role for neuropeptidergic regulation in synaptic plasticity, linking changes in presynaptic transmission to compensatory changes in muscle excitability.

">Multiple mechanisms of action of an extremely painful venom</a></h4>

              
                Evolutionary arms races between predator and prey can lead to extremely specific and effective defense mechanisms. Such defenses include venoms that deter predators by targeting nociceptive (pain-sensing) pathways. Through co-evolution, venom toxins can become extremely efficient modulators of their molecular targets. The venom of velvet ants (Hymenoptera: Mutillidae) is notoriously painful. The intensity of a velvet ant sting has been described as "Explosive and long lasting, you sound insane as you scream. Hot oil from the deep fryer spilling over your entire hand." The effectiveness of the velvet ant sting as a deterrent against potential predators has been shown across vertebrate orders, including mammals, amphibians, reptiles, and birds. The venom's low toxicity suggests it has a targeted effect on nociceptive sensory mechanisms. This leads to the hypothesis that velvet ant venom targets a conserved nociception mechanism, which we sought to uncover using Drosophila melanogaster as a model system. Drosophila larvae have peripheral sensory neurons that sense potentially damaging (noxious) stimuli such as high temperature, harsh mechanical touch, and noxious chemicals. These polymodal nociceptors are called class IV multidendritic dendritic arborizing (cIV da) neurons, and they share many features with vertebrate nociceptors, including conserved sensory receptor channels. We found that velvet ant venom strongly activated Drosophila nociceptors through heteromeric Pickpocket/Balboa (Ppk/Bba) ion channels. Furthermore, we found a single venom peptide (Do6a) that activated larval nociceptors at nanomolar concentrations through Ppk/Bba. Drosophila Ppk/Bba is homologous to mammalian Acid Sensing Ion Channels (ASICs). However, the Do6a peptide did not produce behavioral signs of nociception in mice, which was instead triggered by other non-specific, less potent, peptides within the venom. This suggests that Do6a is an insect-specific venom component that potently activates insect nociceptors. Consistent with this, we showed that the velvet ant's defensive sting produced aversive behavior in a predatory praying mantis. Together, our results indicate that velvet ant venom evolved to target nociceptive systems of both vertebrates and invertebrates, but through different molecular mechanisms.

">Harnessing Synaptic Vesicle Release and Recycling Mechanism for Molecule Delivery to Neurons</a></h4>

              
                Neurodegenerative clinical trials often fail due to insufficient drug doses in reaching targeted cells and the unintended delivery to non-targeted cells. This study demonstrates an alternative neuron-selective drug delivery system, which utilizes the synaptic vesicle release and recycling mechanism (SVRM) by antibody shuttles targeting synaptic vesicle transmembrane proteins for molecule delivery. Using Synaptotagmin-2 (SYT2), we exemplify that intravenously administered anti-SYT2 antibodies localize to neuromuscular junctions, undergo uptake, and retrograde transport to ChAT-positive motor neurons (MNs) in the spinal cord and brainstem. The delivery of anti-microtubule agent and Malat1 gapmer antisense oligonucleotide to MNs with anti-SYT2 antibodies induces axon degeneration and reduction of Malat1 RNA expression, respectively. This approach circumvents the blood-spinal cord barrier, enabling selective delivery of therapeutic molecules to neurons while minimizing effects in non-targeted cells. Thus harnessing SVRM presents a promising strategy for enhancing drug concentrations in neurons and improving treatment efficacy for neurodegenerative diseases.

                Pheromone signaling is pivotal in driving social and reproductive behaviors of rodents. Learning and memorizing the pheromone locations involve olfactory subsystems. To study the neural basis of this behavior, we trained female heterozygous knockouts of GluA2 (AMPAR subunit) and NR1 (NMDAR subunit), targeting GAD65 interneuron population, in a pheromone place preference learning assay. We observed memory loss of pheromone locations on early and late recall periods, pointing towards the possible role of ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs), and thereby the synaptic inhibition in pheromone location learning. Correlated changes were observed in the expression levels of activity-regulated cytoskeletal (Arc) protein, which is critical for memory consolidation, in the associated brain areas. Further, to probe the involvement of main olfactory bulb (MOB) and accessory olfactory bulb (AOB) in pheromone location learning, we knocked out NR1 and GluA2 from MOB and/or AOB neuronal circuits by stereotaxic injection of Cre-dependent AAV5 viral particles. Perturbing the inhibitory circuits of MOB and AOB & AOB-alone resulted in the loss of pheromone location memory. These results confirm the role of iGluRs and the synaptic inhibition exerted by the interneuron network of AOB in regulating learning and memory of pheromone locations.

">Spontaneously regenerative corticospinal neurons in mice</a></h4>

              
                The spinal cord receives inputs from the cortex via corticospinal neurons (CSNs). While predominantly a contralateral projection, a less-investigated minority of its axons terminate in the ipsilateral spinal cord. We analyzed the spatial and molecular properties of these ipsilateral axons and their post-synaptic targets in mice and found they project primarily to the ventral horn, including directly to motor neurons. Barcode-based reconstruction of the ipsilateral axons revealed a class of primarily bilaterally-projecting CSNs with a distinct cortical distribution. The molecular properties of these ipsilaterally-projecting CSNs (IP-CSNs) are strikingly similar to the previously described molecular signature of embryonic-like regenerating CSNs. Finally, we show that IP-CSNs are spontaneously regenerative after spinal cord injury. The discovery of a class of spontaneously regenerative CSNs may prove valuable to the study of spinal cord injury. Additionally, this work suggests that the retention of juvenile-like characteristics may be a widespread phenomenon in adult nervous systems.

">Synapse-to-synapse plasticity variability balanced to generate input-wide constancy of transmitter release</a></h4>

              
                Basal synaptic strength can vary greatly between synapses formed by an individual neuron because of diverse probabilities of action potential (AP) evoked transmitter release (Pr). Optical quantal analysis on large numbers of identified Drosophila larval glutamatergic synapses shows that short-term plasticity (STP) also varies greatly between synapses made by an individual type I motor neuron (MN) onto a single body wall muscle. Synapses with high and low Pr and different forms and level of STP have a random spatial distribution in the MN nerve terminal, and ones with very different properties can be located within 200 nm of one other. While synapses start off with widely diverse basal Pr at low MN AP firing frequency and change Pr differentially when MN firing frequency increases, the overall distribution of Pr remains remarkably constant due to a balance between the numbers of synapses that facilitate and depress as well as their degree of change and basal synaptic weights. This constancy in transmitter release can ensure robustness across changing behavioral conditions.

">Role of ERK2 dimerization in synaptic plasticity and memory</a></h4>

              
                Extensive research has focused on extracellular-signal regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK) phosphorylation in different memory and plasticity models. However, the precise mechanism by which ERK activity leads to memory stabilization and restabilization remains largely elusive, and little is known about the role of ERK 1/2 dimerization in those processes. ERK dimerization is critical for the binding and activation of extranuclear targets, some of which have been strongly associated with these processes. Here we report for the first time that ERK2 dimerization occurs in the context of the rodent nervous system and plays a critical role in plasticity and memory processes. ERK2 dimerization was blocked by DEL-22379 (DEL), a recently developed specific ERK dimerization inhibitor in mice hippocampus in vivo. Moreover, DEL impaired high frequency stimulation-induced long-term potentiation in acute hippocampal slices. However, inhibitory avoidance (IA) memory reactivation induced a significant decrease of ERK2 dimerization in hippocampi from weak IA-trained mice. Noteworthily, intrahippocampal infusion of the inhibitor after memory reactivation had a surprising bidirectional effect: while it blocked reconsolidation of a strong IA memory, the opposite effect was observed on reconsolidation of a weak IA memory, resulting in its enhancement. Although more research is needed, these initial findings suggest a relevant role of ERK dimerization in plasticity and memory.

">Distinct input-specific mechanisms enable presynaptic homeostatic plasticity</a></h4>

              
                Synapses are endowed with the flexibility to change through experience, but must be sufficiently stable to last a lifetime. This tension is illustrated at the Drosophila neuromuscular junction (NMJ), where two motor inputs that differ in structural and functional properties co-innervate most muscles to coordinate locomotion. To stabilize NMJ activity, motor neurons augment neurotransmitter release following diminished postsynaptic glutamate receptor functionality, termed presynaptic homeostatic potentiation (PHP). How these distinct inputs contribute to PHP plasticity remains enigmatic. We have used a botulinum neurotoxin to selectively silence each input and resolve their roles in PHP, demonstrating that PHP is input-specific: Chronic (genetic) PHP selectively targets the tonic MN-Ib, where active zone remodeling enhances Ca2+ influx to promote increased glutamate release. In contrast, acute (pharmacological) PHP selectively increases vesicle pools to potentiate phasic MN-Is. Thus, distinct homeostatic modulations in active zone nanoarchitecture, vesicle pools, and Ca2+ influx collaborate to enable input-specific PHP expression.

">Dynamic imaging of myelin pathology in physiologically preserved human brain tissue using third harmonic generation microscopy</a></h4>

              
                Myelin pathology is known to play a central role in disorders such as multiple sclerosis (MS) among others. Despite this, the pathological mechanisms underlying these conditions are often difficult to unravel. Conventional techniques like immunohistochemistry or dye-based approaches, do not provide a temporal characterization of the pathophysiological aberrations responsible for myelin changes in human specimens. Here, to circumvent this curb, we present a label-free, live-cell imaging approach of myelin using recent advancements in nonlinear harmonic generation microscopy applied to physiologically viable human brain tissue from post-mortem donors. Gray and white matter brain tissue from epilepsy surgery and post-mortem donors was excised. To sustain viability of the specimens for several hours, they were subjected to either acute or organotypic slice culture protocols in artificial cerebral spinal fluid. Imaging was performed using a femtosecond pulsed 1060 nm laser to generate second harmonic generation (SHG) and third harmonic generation (THG) signals directly from myelin and axon-like structures without the need to add any labels. Experiments on acute human brain slices and post-mortem human slice cultures reveal that myelin, along with lipid bodies, are the prime sources of THG signal. We show that tissue viability is maintained over extended periods during THG microscopy, and that prolonged THG imaging is able to detect experimentally induced subtle alterations in myelin morphology. Finally, we provide practical evidence that live-cell imaging of myelin with THG microscopy is a sensitive tool to investigate subtle changes in white matter of neurological donors. Overall, our findings support that nonlinear live-cell imaging is a suitable setup for researching myelin morphology in neurological conditions like MS.

">Association between maternal depressive symptoms and hair cortisol concentration during pregnancy with corpus callosum integrity in newborns</a></h4>

              
                Maternal prenatal depressive symptoms are linked to neurodevelopmental impairments in offspring. Maternal cortisol levels are hypothesized to moderate this association, but its relationship with depressive symptoms is inconsistent. This study examined how maternal prenatal depressive symptoms and cortisol levels predict infant brain development, focusing on neonatal corpus callosum (CC) integrity. Using data from the FinnBrain Birth Cohort Study, we analyzed 37 mother-infant dyads. MRI data were collected from 2 to 5 weeks old infants, and DTI imaging estimated fractional anisotropy (FA) in CC regions (Genu, Body, and Splenium). Maternal cortisol levels were assessed through hair cortisol concentration (HCC) from a 5cm hair segment, reflecting cortisol over the last five months of pregnancy. A factor score of maternal depressive symptoms was computed from EPDS questionnaire data collected at gestational weeks 14, 24, and 34. We employed multivariate regression models with a Bayesian approach for statistical testing, controlling for maternal and infant attributes. Results indicated that maternal prenatal depressive symptoms and HCC interact negatively in predicting infants' FA across all CC regions. Infants exposed to high prenatal depressive symptoms and low HCC (1 SD below the mean) showed higher FA in all CC regions. These findings highlight the complex dynamics between maternal prenatal cortisol levels and depressive symptoms, revealing a nuanced impact of those factors on the structural integrity of infants' CC.

">Adaptive protein synthesis in genetic models of copper deficiency and childhood neurodegeneration</a></h4>

              
                Rare inherited diseases caused by mutations in the copper transporters SLC31A1 (CTR1) or ATP7A induce copper deficiency in the brain and throughout the body, causing seizures and neurodegeneration in infancy. The mechanistic underpinnings of such neuropathology remains unclear. Here, we characterized the molecular mechanisms by which neuronal cells respond to copper depletion in multiple genetic model systems. Targeted deletion of CTR1 in neuroblastoma clonal cell lines produced copper deficiency that was associated with compromised copper-dependent Golgi and mitochondrial enzymes and a metabolic shift favoring glycolysis over oxidative phosphorylation. Proteomic and transcriptomic analysis revealed simultaneous upregulation of mTORC1 and S6K signaling, along with reduced PERK signaling in CTR1 KO cells. Patterns of gene and protein expression and pharmacogenomics show increased activation of the mTORC1-S6K pathway as a pro-survival mechanism, ultimately resulting in increased protein synthesis as measured by puromycin labeling. These effects of copper depletion were corroborated by spatial transcriptomic profiling of the cerebellum of Atp7aflx/Y :: Vil1Cre/+ mice, in which copper-deficient Purkinje cells exhibited upregulated protein synthesis machinery and expression of mTORC1-S6K pathway genes. We tested whether increased activity of mTOR in copper-deficient neurons was adaptive or deleterious by genetic epistasis experiments in Drosophila. Copper deficiency dendritic phenotypes in class IV neurons are partially rescued by increased S6k expression or 4E-BP1 (Thor) RNAi, while epidermis phenotypes are exacerbated by Akt, S6k, or raptor RNAi. Overall, we demonstrate that increased mTORC1-S6K pathway activation and protein synthesis is an adaptive mechanism by which neuronal cells respond to copper depletion.

">Adaptive arousal regulation: Pharmacologically shifting the peak of the Yerkes-Dodson curve by catecholaminergic enhancement of arousal</a></h4>

              
                Performance typically peaks at moderate arousal levels, consistent with the Yerkes-Dodson law, as confirmed by recent human and mouse pupillometry studies. Arousal states are influenced by neuromodulators like catecholamines (noradrenaline; NA and dopamine; DA) and acetylcholine (ACh). To explore their causal roles in this law, we pharmacologically enhanced arousal while measuring human decision-making and spontaneous arousal fluctuations via pupil size. The catecholaminergic agent atomoxetine (ATX) increased overall arousal and shifted the entire arousal-performance curve, suggesting a relative arousal mechanism where performance adapts to arousal fluctuations within arousal states. In contrast, the cholinergic agent donepezil (DNP) did not affect arousal or the curve. We modeled these findings in a neurobiologically plausible computational framework, showing how catecholaminergic modulation alters a disinhibitory neural circuit that encodes sensory evidence for decision-making. This work suggests that performance adapts flexibly to arousal fluctuations, ensuring optimal performance in each and every arousal state.

	<p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune demyelinating disease of the central nervous system with unknown etiology, resulting in various impairments that necessitate continuous rehabilitation to enhance functionality, quality of life, and motor function, including through Virtual Reality (VR) therapy. Comparing tasks in virtual environments and their potential skill transfer to real-world settings could aid in optimizing treatment programs to improve motor performance in individuals with MS. This study aimed to determine whether practicing acquisition and retention phases using two distinct interfaces (concrete&amp;amp;mdash;Touch Screen or abstract&amp;amp;mdash;Kinect system) affects performance in a subsequent task using a different interface (transfer phase). A randomized clinical trial was conducted with 56 volunteers with MS and 41 controls. Participants engaged in a computer game where they burst as many bubbles as possible within 10 s per attempt. After the acquisition and retention phases, all participants switched interfaces (e.g., those using Kinect switched to Touchscreen and vice versa). Significant performance improvements were observed in both groups during the acquisition phase, which were maintained in the retention phase. Although the abstract interface was more challenging for both groups, only the MS group that practiced with the abstract interface successfully transferred their improvements to the concrete interface. Thus, despite the increased difficulty of the abstract task during practice, it led to better performance transfer when required to complete a subsequent concrete task, suggesting that abstract devices may be beneficial in clinical practice for improving motor function in people with MS.</p>

                <p>The neural mechanisms of motor planning have been extensively studied in rodents. Preparatory activity in the frontal cortex predicts upcoming choice, but limitations of typical tasks have made it challenging to determine whether the spatial information is in a self-centered direction reference frame or a world-centered position reference frame. Here, we trained male rats to make delayed visually guided orienting movements to six different directions, with four different target positions for each direction, which allowed us to disentangle direction versus position tuning in neural activity. We recorded single unit activity from the rat frontal orienting field (FOF) in the secondary motor cortex, a region involved in planning orienting movements. Population analyses revealed that the FOF encodes two separate 2D maps of space. First, a 2D map of the planned and ongoing movement in a self-centered direction reference frame. Second, a 2D map of the animal&rsquo;s current position on the port wall in a world-centered reference frame. Thus, preparatory activity in the FOF represents self-centered upcoming movement directions, but FOF neurons multiplex both self- and world-reference frame variables at the level of single neurons. Neural network model comparison supports the view that despite the presence of world-centered representations, the FOF receives the target information as self-centered input and generates self-centered planning signals.</p>

                <p>The act of recalling memories can paradoxically lead to the forgetting of other associated memories, a phenomenon known as retrieval-induced forgetting (RIF). Inhibitory control mechanisms, primarily mediated by the prefrontal cortex, are thought to contribute to RIF. In this study, we examined whether stimulating the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) with transcranial direct current stimulation modulates RIF and investigated the associated electrophysiological correlates. In a randomized study, 50 participants (27 males and 23 females) received either real or sham stimulation before performing retrieval practice on target memories. After retrieval practice, a final memory test to assess RIF was administered. We found that stimulation selectively increased the retrieval accuracy of competing memories, thereby decreasing RIF, while the retrieval accuracy of target memories remained unchanged. The reduction in RIF was associated with a more pronounced beta desynchronization within the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (left-DLPFC), in an early time window (&lt;500&nbsp;ms) after cue onset during retrieval practice. This led to a stronger beta desynchronization within the parietal cortex in a later time window, an established marker for successful memory retrieval. Together, our results establish the causal involvement of the mPFC in actively suppressing competing memories and demonstrate that while forgetting arises as a consequence of retrieving specific memories, these two processes are functionally independent. Our findings suggest that stimulation potentially disrupted inhibitory control processes, as evidenced by reduced RIF and stronger beta desynchronization in fronto-parietal brain regions during memory retrieval, although further research is needed to elucidate the specific mechanisms underlying this effect.</p>

                <p>The cerebellum plays an important role in diverse brain functions, ranging from motor learning to cognition. Recent studies have suggested that molecular and cellular heterogeneity within cerebellar lobules contributes to functional differences across the cerebellum. However, the specific relationship between molecular and cellular heterogeneity and diverse functional outputs of different regions of the cerebellum remains unclear. Here, we describe a previously unappreciated form of synaptic heterogeneity at parallel fiber synapses to Purkinje cells in the mouse cerebellum (both sexes). In contrast to uniform fast synaptic transmission, we found that the properties of slow synaptic transmission varied by up to threefold across different lobules of the mouse cerebellum, resulting in surprising heterogeneity. Depending on the location of a Purkinje cell, the time of peak of slow synaptic currents varied by hundreds of milliseconds. The duration and decay time of these currents also spanned hundreds of milliseconds, based on lobule. We found that, as a consequence of the heterogeneous synaptic dynamics, the same brief input stimulus was transformed into prolonged firing patterns over a range of timescales that depended on Purkinje cell location.</p>

                <p>To test a Chinese character version of the phonemic verbal fluency task in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) and assess the verbal fluency deficiency pattern in TLE with and without hippocampal sclerosis, a cross-sectional study was conducted including 30 patients with TLE and hippocampal sclerosis (TLE-HS), 28 patients with TLE and without hippocampal sclerosis (TLE-NHS), and 29 demographically matched healthy controls (HC). Both sexes were enrolled. Participants finished a Chinese character verbal fluency (VFC) task during functional MRI. The activation/deactivation maps, functional connectivity, degree centrality, and community features of the left frontal and temporal regions were compared. A neural network classification model was applied to differentiate TLE-HS and TLE-NHS using functional statistics. The VFC scores were correlated with semantic fluency in HC while correlated with phonemic fluency in TLE-NHS. Activation and deactivation deficiency was observed in TLE-HS and TLE-NHS (<I>p </I>&lt; 0.001, <I>k</I> &ge; 10). Functional connectivity, degree centrality, and community features of anterior inferior temporal gyri were impaired in TLE-HS and retained or even enhanced in TLE-NHS (<I>p </I>&lt; 0.05, FDR-corrected). The functional connectivity was correlated with phonemic fluency (<I>p </I>&lt; 0.05, FDR-corrected). The neural network classification reached an area under the curve of 0.90 in diagnosing hippocampal sclerosis. The VFC task is a Chinese phonemic verbal fluency task suitable for clinical application in TLE. During the VFC task, functional connectivity of phonemic circuits was impaired in TLE-HS and was enhanced in TLE-NHS, representing a compensative phonemic searching strategy applied by patients with TLE-NHS.</p>

                <p>Our repertoire of motor skills is filled with sequential movements that need to be performed in a specific order. Here, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate whether the human hippocampus, a region known to support temporal order in non-motor memory, represents information about the order of sequential motor actions in human participants (both sexes). We also examined such representations in other regions of the motor network (i.e., the premotor cortex, supplementary motor area, anterior superior parietal lobule, and striatum) already known for their critical role in motor sequence learning. Results showed that the hippocampus represents information about movements in their learned temporal position in the sequence, but not about movements or temporal positions in random movement patterns. Other regions of the motor network coded for movements in their learned temporal position, as well as movements and positions in random movement patterns. Importantly, movement coding contributed to sequence learning patterns in primary, supplementary, and premotor cortices but not in striatal and parietal regions. Our findings deepen our understanding of how striatal and cortical regions contribute to motor sequence learning and point to the capacity of the hippocampus to represent movements in their temporal context, an ability possibly explaining its contribution to motor learning.</p>

                <p>Neuronal excitatory synapses are primarily located on small dendritic protrusions called spines. During synaptic plasticity underlying learning and memory, Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through postsynaptic NMDA-type glutamate receptors (NMDARs) initiates signaling pathways that coordinate changes in dendritic spine structure and synaptic function. During long-term potentiation (LTP), high levels of NMDAR Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx promote increases in both synaptic strength and dendritic spine size through activation of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent protein kinases. In contrast, during long-term depression (LTD), low levels of NMDAR Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx promote decreased synaptic strength and spine shrinkage and elimination through activation of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent protein phosphatase calcineurin (CaN), which is anchored at synapses via the scaffold protein A-kinase anchoring protein (AKAP)150. In Alzheimer's disease (AD), the pathological agent amyloid-&beta; (A&beta;) may impair learning and memory through biasing NMDAR Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling pathways toward LTD and spine elimination. By employing AKAP150 knock-in mice of both sexes with a mutation that disrupts CaN anchoring to AKAP150, we revealed that local, postsynaptic AKAP&ndash;CaN&ndash;LTD signaling was required for A&beta;-mediated impairment of NMDAR synaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, inhibition of LTP, and dendritic spine loss. Additionally, we found that A&beta; acutely engages AKAP&ndash;CaN signaling through activation of G-protein-coupled metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 (mGluR1) leading to dephosphorylation of NMDAR GluN2B subunits, which decreases Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx to favor LTD over LTP, and cofilin, which promotes F-actin severing to destabilize dendritic spines. These findings reveal a novel interplay between NMDAR and mGluR1 signaling that converges on AKAP-anchored CaN to coordinate dephosphorylation of postsynaptic substrates linked to multiple aspects of A&beta;-mediated synaptic dysfunction.</p>

                <p>Although the locus ceruleus (LC) is recognized as a crucial modulator for attention and perception by releasing norepinephrine into various cortical regions, the impact of LC&ndash;noradrenergic (LC&ndash;NE) modulation on auditory discrimination behavior remains elusive. In this study, we firstly recorded local field potential and single-unit activity in multiple cortical regions associated with auditory&ndash;motor processing, including the auditory cortex, posterior parietal cortex, secondary motor cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, prefrontal cortex, and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), in response to optogenetic activation (40&nbsp;Hz and 0.5&nbsp;s) of the LC&ndash;NE neurons in awake mice (male). We found that phasic LC stimulation induced a persistent high gamma oscillation (50&ndash;80&nbsp;Hz) in the OFC. Phasic activation of LC&ndash;NE neurons also resulted in a corresponding increase in norepinephrine levels in the OFC, accompanied by a pupillary dilation response. Furthermore, when mice were performing a go/no-go auditory discrimination task, we optogeneticaly activated the neural projections from LC to OFC and revealed a shortened latency in behavioral responses to sound stimuli and an increased false alarm rate. These impulsive behavioral responses may be associated with the gamma neural activity in the OFC. These findings have broadened our understanding of the neural mechanisms involved in the role of LC in auditory&ndash;motor processing.</p>

                <p>For better decisions in social interactions, humans often must understand the thinking of others and predict their actions. Since such predictions are uncertain, multiple predictions may be necessary for better decision-making. However, the neural processes and computations underlying such social decision-making remain unclear. We investigated this issue by developing a behavioral paradigm and performing functional magnetic resonance imaging and computational modeling. In our task, female and male participants were required to predict others&rsquo; choices in order to make their own value-based decisions, as the outcome depended on others&rsquo; choices. Results showed, to make choices, the participants mostly relied on a value difference (primary) generated from the case where others would make a likely choice, but sometimes they additionally used another value difference (secondary) from the opposite case where others make an unlikely choice. We found that the activations in the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) correlated with the primary difference while the activations in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (rdlPFC) correlated with the secondary difference. Analysis of neural coupling and temporal dynamics suggested a three-step processing network, beginning with the left amygdala signals for predictions of others&rsquo; choices. Modulated by these signals, the PCC and rdlPFC reflect the respective value differences for self-decisions. Finally, the medial prefrontal cortex integrated these decision signals for a final decision. Our findings elucidate the neural process of constructing value-based decisions by predicting others and illuminate their key variables with social modulations, providing insight into the differential functional roles of these brain regions in this process.</p>

                <p>Familial dysautonomia (FD) is a rare sensory and autonomic neuropathy that results from a mutation in the <I>ELP1</I> gene. Virtually all patients report gastrointestinal (GI) dysfunction and we have recently shown that FD patients have a dysbiotic gut microbiome and altered metabolome. These findings were recapitulated in an FD mouse model and moreover, the FD mice had reduced intestinal motility, as did patients. To understand the cellular basis for impaired GI function in FD, the enteric nervous system (ENS; both female and male mice) from FD mouse models was analyzed during embryonic development and adulthood. We show here that not only is <I>Elp1</I> required for the normal formation of the ENS, but it is also required in adulthood for the regulation of both neuronal and non-neuronal cells and for target innervation in both the mucosa and in intestinal smooth muscle. In particular, CGRP innervation was significantly reduced as was the number of dopaminergic neurons. Examination of an FD patient's gastric biopsy also revealed reduced and disoriented axons in the mucosa. Finally, using an FD mouse model in which <I>Elp1</I> was deleted exclusively from neurons, we found significant changes to the colon epithelium including reduced E-cadherin expression, perturbed mucus layer organization, and infiltration of bacteria into the mucosa. The fact that deletion of <I>Elp1</I> exclusively in neurons is sufficient to alter the intestinal epithelium and perturb the intestinal epithelial barrier highlights a critical role for neurons in regulating GI epithelium homeostasis.</p>

                <p>During infancy and adolescence, language develops from a predominantly interhemispheric control&mdash;through the corpus callosum (CC)&mdash;to a predominantly intrahemispheric control, mainly subserved by the left arcuate fasciculus (AF). Using multimodal neuroimaging, we demonstrate that human left-handers (both male and female) with an atypical language lateralization show a rightward participation of language areas from the auditory cortex to the inferior frontal cortex when contrasting speech to tone perception and an enhanced interhemispheric anatomical and functional connectivity. Crucially, musicianship determines two different structural pathways to this outcome. Nonmusicians present a relation between atypical lateralization and intrahemispheric underdevelopment across the anterior AF, hinting at a dysregulation of the ontogenetic shift from an interhemispheric to an intrahemispheric brain. Musicians reveal an alternative pathway related to interhemispheric overdevelopment across the posterior CC and the auditory cortex. We discuss the heterogeneity in reaching atypical language lateralization and the relevance of early musical training in altering the normal development of language cognitive functions.</p>

                Chemoprophylactic prevention of veterinary heartworm disease in companion animals, caused by the vector-borne nematode parasite Dirofilaria immitis, is a multi-billion-dollar global market. Experimental use of cats and dogs in preclinical heartworm drug testing is increasing due to evolving drug-resistance to frontline macrocyclic lactones and renewed investment in alternative preventative drug research. We and others recently published data demonstrating proof-of-concept of utilising lymphopenic severe-combined immunodeficient (SCID) or Recombination Activating Gene (RAG)2 deficient mice with additional knockout of the IL-2/7 receptor gamma chain (Î³c) as alternative preventative drug screening research models of dirofilariasis. Here we summarise the current knowledge of candidate immunodeficient mouse models tested, including a comparison of susceptibility using different background strains of mice, different D. immitis isolates, following use of anti-inflammatory treatments to further suppress residual innate immunity, and efficacies achieved against different reference anthelmintics. We supplement this precis with new data on treatment response to the veterinary anthelmintic, oxfendazole, and initial evaluation of D. immitis susceptibility in CB.17 SCID and C57BL/6 RAG2-/-Î³c-/- mice. We conclude that in addition to NSG and NXG mice, RAG2-/-Î³c-/- mice on either a BALB/c or C57BL/6 background offer an alternative screening model option, widening access to academic and commercial laboratories wishing to pursue initial rapid in vivo drug screening whilst avoiding potentially unnecessary cat or dog testing.

                <p>by Mario Grassi, Barbara Tarantino</p>

Large-scale studies of gene expression are commonly influenced by biological and technical sources of expression variation, including batch effects, sample characteristics, and environmental impacts. Learning the causal relationships between observable variables may be challenging in the presence of unobserved confounders. Furthermore, many high-dimensional regression techniques may perform worse. In fact, controlling for unobserved confounding variables is essential, and many deconfounding methods have been suggested for application in a variety of situations. The main contribution of this article is the development of a two-stage deconfounding procedure based on Bow-free Acyclic Paths (BAP) search developed into the framework of Structural Equation Models (SEM), called SEMbap(). In the first stage, an exhaustive search of missing edges with significant covariance is performed via Shipley d-separation tests; then, in the second stage, a Constrained Gaussian Graphical Model (CGGM) is fitted or a low dimensional representation of bow-free edges structure is obtained via Graph Laplacian Principal Component Analysis (gLPCA). We compare four popular deconfounding methods to BAP search approach with applications on simulated and observed expression data. In the former, different structures of the hidden covariance matrix have been replicated. Compared to existing methods, BAP search algorithm is able to correctly identify hidden confounding whilst controlling false positive rate and achieving good fitting and perturbation metrics.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012429">Oscillations in an artificial neural network convert competing inputs into a temporal code</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Katharina Duecker, Marco Idiart, Marcel van Gerven, Ole Jensen</p>

The field of computer vision has long drawn inspiration from neuroscientific studies of the human and non-human primate visual system. The development of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), for example, was informed by the properties of simple and complex cells in early visual cortex. However, the computational relevance of oscillatory dynamics experimentally observed in the visual system are typically not considered in artificial neural networks (ANNs). Computational models of neocortical dynamics, on the other hand, rarely take inspiration from computer vision. Here, we combine methods from computational neuroscience and machine learning to implement multiplexing in a simple ANN using oscillatory dynamics. We first trained the network to classify individually presented letters. Post-training, we added temporal dynamics to the hidden layer, introducing refraction in the hidden units as well as pulsed inhibition mimicking neuronal alpha oscillations. Without these dynamics, the trained network correctly classified individual letters but produced a mixed output when presented with two letters simultaneously, indicating a bottleneck problem. When introducing refraction and oscillatory inhibition, the output nodes corresponding to the two stimuli activate sequentially, ordered along the phase of the inhibitory oscillations. Our model implements the idea that inhibitory oscillations segregate competing inputs in time. The results of our simulations pave the way for applications in deeper network architectures and more complicated machine learning problems.

                <p>by Janice Yang, Neil J. Daily, Taylor K. Pullinger, Tetsuro Wakatsuki, Eric A. Sobie</p>

Human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) have gained traction as a powerful model in cardiac disease and therapeutics research, since iPSCs are self-renewing and can be derived from healthy and diseased patients without invasive surgery. However, current iPSC-CM differentiation methods produce cardiomyocytes with immature, fetal-like electrophysiological phenotypes, and the variety of maturation protocols in the literature results in phenotypic differences between labs. Heterogeneity of iPSC donor genetic backgrounds contributes to additional phenotypic variability. Several mathematical models of iPSC-CM electrophysiology have been developed to help to predict cell responses, but these models individually do not capture the phenotypic variability observed in iPSC-CMs. Here, we tackle these limitations by developing a computational pipeline to calibrate cell preparation-specific iPSC-CM electrophysiological parameters. We used the genetic algorithm (GA), a heuristic parameter calibration method, to tune ion channel parameters in a mathematical model of iPSC-CM physiology. To systematically optimize an experimental protocol that generates sufficient data for parameter calibration, we created <i>in silico</i> datasets by simulating various protocols applied to a population of models with known conductance variations, and then fitted parameters to those datasets. We found that calibrating to voltage and calcium transient data under 3 varied experimental conditions, including electrical pacing combined with ion channel blockade and changing buffer ion concentrations, improved model parameter estimates and model predictions of unseen channel block responses. This observation also held when the fitted data were normalized, suggesting that normalized fluorescence recordings, which are more accessible and higher throughput than patch clamp recordings, could sufficiently inform conductance parameters. Therefore, this computational pipeline can be applied to different iPSC-CM preparations to determine cell line-specific ion channel properties and understand the mechanisms behind variability in perturbation responses.

                <p>by Wen Wen, Shrey Grover, Douglas Hazel, Peyton Berning, Frederik Baumgardt, Vighnesh Viswanathan, Olivia Tween, Robert M. G. Reinhart</p>

Maintaining and removing information in mind are 2 fundamental cognitive processes that decline sharply with age. Using a combination of beta-band neural oscillations, which have been implicated in the regulation of working memory contents, and cross-trial neural variability, an undervalued property of brain dynamics theorized to govern adaptive cognitive processes, we demonstrate an age-related dissociation between distinct working memory functionsâinformation maintenance and post-response deletion. Load-dependent decreases in beta variability during maintenance predicted memory performance of younger, but not older adults. Surprisingly, the post-response phase emerged as the predictive locus of working memory performance for older adults, with post-response beta variability correlated with memory performance of older, but not younger adults. Single-trial analysis identified post-response beta power elevation as a frequency-specific signature indexing memory deletion. Our findings demonstrate the nuanced interplay between age, beta dynamics, and working memory, offering valuable insights into the neural mechanisms of cognitive decline in agreement with the inhibition deficit theory of aging.

                Background Entomopathogenic fungi exists naturally in plants as an asymptote and have the potential to reduce the population of insect pests through indirect interactions. This study was conducted to detect and characterize the endophytic fungi Beauveria bassiana and Metarhizium robertsii from the rhizosphere soil of tomato plants and their virulence effect on Galleria melonella. Methods From the rhizosphere soil of 40 tomato fields, three Beauveria bassiana and seven Metarhizium robertsii isolates were isolated using the galleria bait method. All fungi isolate were morphologically characterized by their colony color, shape, and surface texture. Isolates with the highest percentages of germination, conidial yield, and radial growth were selected, and their virulence was evaluated on second instar larvae of Galleria melonella under laboratory conditions. Results In this study, Beauveria bassiana showed white colony color and aseptate hyphae, whereas Metarhizium robertsii showed dark green to light green colony color and septate hyphal structures. Maximum spore production and conidial length were obtained by Beauveria bassiana isolate APPRC-27 with 2.67x107 spores ml-1 and 3.24 Âµm, respectively. Colony radial growth rates ranged from 1.73 to 3.24 mm day-1. The results revealed that the highest mortality rate of Galleria melonella (100%) was obtained by Metarhizium robertsii isolates K-61 and K-102 at a concentration of 1x108 conidial ml-1 at 7 days post-inoculation. The lowest mortality rate was registered by Metarhizium robertsii isolate RST-11. Conclusions In the present study, isolates that produced the most spores and had the highest germination rates were the most virulent to Galleria mellonella second instar larvae. Therefore, virulent entomopathogenic fungi, Beauveria bassiana and Metarhizium robertsii, are promising bioagents for the control of insect pests.

                Background Xylene, a common solvent in painting, printing, and shoemaking, enters the body through inhalation of vapors. Methods This observational analytic study aimed to examine the relationship between xylene concentration, xylene RQ, and liver function in industrial workers in Surabaya, especially in shoe industries. The chi-square method was utilized for data analysis. To ensure the validity and reliability of the study results, air and blood sampling procedures were implemented. Air sampling was conducted to measure xylene concentrations in the workplace environment, while blood samples were collected from workers to assess Serum Glutamic Oxaloacetic Transaminase (SGOT) and Serum Glutamic Pyruvate Transaminase (SGPT) levels. The study was conducted in five regions in Surabaya, namely Kalijudan, Ketintang, Jemursari, AUP, and Romokalisari. The population includes a total of 90 workers with 77 of them taken as samples using the accidental sampling method. Results The results show that there is a relationship between xylene concentration and Serum Glutamic Oxaloacetic Transaminase (SGOT) levels (p> 0.05); (r = 0,65) and there is no relationship between xylene concentrations and Serum Glutamic Pyruvate Transaminase (SGPT) levels (p> 0.05); (r = -0,12). There was no relationship between RQ and SGOT levels (p> 0.05) and there was no relationship between RQ and SGPT levels (p> 0.05). However, from the calculation of the prevalence ratio, workers with unsafe RQ (RQ>1) have a 7.09x greater chance of experiencing damage to SGOT levels and a 1.06x greater chance of experiencing damage to SGPT levels. Conclusions Xylene exposure (concentration & RQ) affects liver enzyme levels (SGOT/SGPT) in workers. Industries should consider providing nutritious food to aid xylene removal and stricter safety policies are needed. This study highlights the importance of a holistic approach to worker health and safety when dealing with hazardous chemicals.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Hippocampal subfields perform specific roles in normal cognitive functioning and have distinct vulnerabilities in neurological disorders. However, measurement of subfields with MRI is technically difficult in the head and tail of the hippocampus. Recent studies have utilized curved multiplanar reconstruction (CMPR) to improve subfield visualization in the head and tail, but this method has not yet been applied to histological data.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We utilized BigBrain data, an open-source database of serially sectioned histological data for our analyses. The left hippocampus was segmented according to histological criteria by two raters in order to evaluate intra- and inter-rater reliability of histology-based segmentation throughout the long axis. Segmentation according to our previous protocol for the hippocampal body was then compared to these histological measurements to evaluate for histological validity. Agreement between segmentations was evaluated using Dice similarity coefficients (DSCs).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Intra-rater reliability (DSCs) of histological segmentation was excellent for all subfields: CA1 (0.8599), CA2 (0.7586), CA3/CA4/DG (0.8907), SLM (0.9123), subiculum (0.8149). Similarly, inter-rater reliability analysis demonstrated excellent agreement (DSCs) for all subfield locations: CA1 (0.8203), CA2 (0.7253), CA3/CA4/DG (0.8439), SLM (0.8700), subiculum (0.7794). Finally, histological accuracy (DSCs) for our previous protocol was excellent for all subfields: CA1 (0.8821), CA2 (0.8810), CA3/CA4/DG (0.9802), SLM (0.9879), subiculum (0.8774). When subfields in the hippocampus head, body, and tail were analyzed independently, DSCs also showed excellent agreement.</p>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>CMPR allows reliable subfield segmentation based on histological criteria throughout the hippocampal head, body, and tail. Our previous protocol for the hippocampal body can be applied to provide histologically valid subfield measurements throughout the entire hippocampal long axis.</p>

                The concept of secondary range symmetric matrices is introduced here. Some characterizations as well as the equivalent conditions for a range symmetric matrix to be secondary range symmetric matrix is given. The idea of range symmetric matrices, range symmetric matrices over Minkowski space and secondary range symmetric matrices are different, and is depicted with the help of suitable examples. Finally, a necessary and sufficient condition for a secondary range symmetric matrix to have a secondary generalized inverse has been obtained.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1045/v1?src=rss">Systematic review of inquiry-based learning: assessing impact and best practices in education [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Inquiry-based learning (IBL) is a student-centred pedagogical approach that promotes critical thinking, creativity, and active engagement. IBL encourages students to explore, question, and construct their own understanding, making it an effective method for enhancing educational experiences. This systematic review aims to assess the impact of IBL on educational outcomes and identify best practices for its implementation across different disciplines and educational levels. Methods The review involved a comprehensive analysis of peer-reviewed articles focusing on IBL across various educational settings. The selected studies encompassed a wide range of disciplines, educational levels, and geographic contexts. Criteria for inclusion involved examining the impact of IBL on studentsâ critical thinking, motivation, academic achievement, and overall learning experiences. Results Findings indicate that IBL positively impacts studentsâ critical thinking skills, motivation, and academic performance. Effective integration of IBL into curricula requires several key strategies: comprehensive teacher training, the creation of supportive learning environments, and the use of technology to facilitate inquiry-based activities. However, challenges were noted, such as the need for substantial instructional support and varying levels of student readiness for self-directed learning. Conclusions This systematic review confirms the benefits of IBL in enhancing educational outcomes and provides a synthesized overview of effective practices for its implementation. While IBL fosters critical thinking, creativity, and academic achievement, its success relies on adequate teacher training, supportive environments, and technological integration. Addressing the challenges related to instructional support and student readiness is crucial for optimizing IBL. The findings offer valuable insights for educators, researchers, and policymakers to enhance educational practices and outcomes through inquiry-based approaches.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1044/v1?src=rss">Methodology used to develop the minimum common data elements for surveillance and Reporting of Musculoskeletal Injuries in the MILitary (ROMMIL) statement [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background The objective was to summarize the methodology used to reach consensus for recommended minimum data elements that should be collected and reported when conducting injury surveillance research in military settings. This paper summarizes the methodology used to develop the international Minimum Data Elements for surveillance and Reporting of Musculoskeletal Injuries in the MILitary (ROMMIL) statement. Methods A Delphi methodology was employed to reach consensus for minimum reporting elements. Preliminary steps included conducting a literature review and surveying a convenience sample of military stakeholders to 1) identify barriers and facilitators of military musculoskeletal injury (MSKI) prevention programs, 2) identify relevant knowledge/information gaps and 3) establish future research priorities. The team then led a sequential three-round Delphi consensus survey, including relevant stakeholders from militaries around the world, and then conducted asynchronous mixed knowledge user meeting to explore level of agreement among subject matter experts. Knowledge users, including former and current military service members, civil servant practitioners, and global-wide subject matter experts having experience with policy, execution, or clinical investigation of MSKI mitigation programs, MSKI diagnoses, and MSKI risk factors in military settings. For each round, participants scored each question on a Likert scale of 1-5. Scores ranged from No Importance (1) to Strong Importance (5). Results Literature review and surveys helped informed the scope of potential variables to vote on. Three rounds were necessary to reach minimum consensus. Ninety-five, 65 and 42 respondents participated in the first, second and third rounds of the Delphi consensus, respectively. Ultimately, consensus recommendations emerged consisting of one data principle and 33 minimum data elements. Conclusions Achieving consensus across relevant stakeholders representing military organizations globally can be challenging. This paper details the methodology employed to reach consensus for a core minimum data elements checklist for conducting MSKI research in military settings and improve data harmonization and scalability efforts. These methods can be used as a resource to assist in future consensus endeavors of similar nature.

<p>Clinicians fear thrombolysis after direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) use due to experience with warfarin. In contrast to vitamin K antagonists such as warfarin, DOACs prevent thrombosis by blocking thrombin. Clinical observational data suggest that thrombolysis may be safe in the setting of DOAC use. Thrombin, a serine protease, acts on the PAR1 receptor of brain cells, resulting in cell killing. Thrombin injury to endothelial cells can lead to blood-brain barrier disruption and hemorrhagic transformation. DOACs such as argatroban and dabigatran, by inhibiting thrombin, prevent PAR1 activation leading to cell protection, blood-brain barrier protection, and reduced risk of hemorrhage.

<p>Direct oral anticoagulants are the primary stroke prevention option in patients with atrial fibrillation. Anticoagulant use before stroke, however, might inhibit clinician comfort with thrombolysis if a stroke does occur. Resuming anticoagulants after ischemic stroke is also problematic for fear of hemorrhage. We describe extensive literature showing that thrombolysis is safe after stroke with direct anticoagulant use. Early reinstitution of direct anticoagulant treatment is associated with lower risk of embolic recurrence and lower hemorrhage risk. The use of direct anticoagulants before, during, and after thrombolysis appears to be safe and is likely to promote improved outcomes after ischemic stroke. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

                Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) contributes significantly to chemotherapy resistance and remains a critical challenge in treating advanced breast cancer. The complexity of EMT, involving redundant pro-EMT signaling pathways and its paradox reversal process, mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET), has hindered the development of effective treatments. In this study, we utilized a Tri-PyMT EMT lineage-tracing model in mice and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to comprehensively analyze the EMT status of tumor cells. Our findings revealed elevated ribosome biogenesis (RiBi) during the transitioning phases of both EMT and MET processes. RiBi and its subsequent nascent protein synthesis mediated by ERK and mTOR signalings are essential for EMT/MET completion. Importantly, inhibiting excessive RiBi genetically or pharmacologically impaired the EMT/MET capability of tumor cells. Combining RiBi inhibition with chemotherapy drugs synergistically reduced metastatic outgrowth of epithelial and mesenchymal tumor cells under chemotherapies. Our study suggests that targeting the RiBi pathway presents a promising strategy for treating patients with advanced breast cancer.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/90854">Cannabinoid combination targets NOTCH1-mutated T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia through the integrated stress response pathway</a></h4>

              
                In T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), more than 50% of cases display autoactivation of Notch1 signaling, leading to oncogenic transformation. We have previously identified a specific chemovar of Cannabis that induces apoptosis by preventing Notch1 maturation in leukemia cells. Here, we isolated three cannabinoids from this chemovar that synergistically mimic the effects of the whole extract. Two were previously known, cannabidiol (CBD) and cannabidivarin (CBDV), whereas the third cannabinoid, which we termed 331-18A, was identified and fully characterized in this study. We demonstrated that these cannabinoids act through cannabinoid receptor type 2 and TRPV1 to activate the integrated stress response pathway by depleting intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>. This is followed by increased mRNA and protein expression of ATF4, CHOP, and CHAC1, which is hindered by inhibiting the upstream initiation factor eIF2Î±. The increased abundance of CHAC1 prevents Notch1 maturation, thereby reducing the levels of the active Notch1 intracellular domain, and consequently decreasing cell viability and increasing apoptosis. Treatment with the three isolated molecules resulted in reduced tumor size and weight in vivo and slowed leukemia progression in mice models. Altogether, this study elucidated the mechanism of action of three distinct cannabinoids in modulating the Notch1 pathway, and constitutes an important step in the establishment of a new therapy for treating <i>NOTCH1</i>-mutated diseases and cancers such as T-ALL.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95524">Identifying images in the biology literature that are problematic for people with a color-vision deficiency</a></h4>

              
                To help maximize the impact of scientific journal articles, authors must ensure that article figures are accessible to people with color-vision deficiencies (CVDs), which affect up to 8% of males and 0.5% of females. We evaluated images published in biology- and medicine-oriented research articles between 2012 and 2022. Most included at least one color contrast that could be problematic for people with deuteranopia (âdeuteranopesâ), the most common form of CVD. However, spatial distances and within-image labels frequently mitigated potential problems. Initially, we reviewed 4964 images from <i>eLife</i>, comparing each against a simulated version that approximated how it might appear to deuteranopes. We identified 636 (12.8%) images that we determined would be difficult for deuteranopes to interpret. Our findings suggest that the frequency of this problem has decreased over time and that articles from cell-oriented disciplines were most often problematic. We used machine learning to automate the identification of problematic images. For a hold-out test set from <i>eLife</i> (n=879), a convolutional neural network classified the images with an area under the precision-recall curve of 0.75. The same network classified images from PubMed Central (n=1191) with an area under the precision-recall curve of 0.39. We created a Web application (<a href="https://bioapps.byu.edu/colorblind_image_tester">https://bioapps.byu.edu/colorblind_image_tester</a>); users can upload images, view simulated versions, and obtain predictions. Our findings shed new light on the frequency and nature of scientific images that may be problematic for deuteranopes and motivate additional efforts to increase accessibility.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98818">Developmental stage shapes the realized energy landscape for a flight specialist</a></h4>

              
                The heterogeneity of the physical environment determines the cost of transport for animals, shaping their energy landscape. Animals respond to this energy landscape by adjusting their distribution and movement to maximize gains and reduce costs. Much of our knowledge about energy landscape dynamics focuses on factors external to the animal, particularly the spatio-temporal variations of the environment. However, an animalâs internal state can significantly impact its ability to perceive and utilize available energy, creating a distinction between the âfundamentalâ and the ârealizedâ energy landscapes. Here, we show that the realized energy landscape varies along the ontogenetic axis. Locomotor and cognitive capabilities of individuals change over time, especially during the early life stages. We investigate the development of the realized energy landscape in the Central European Alpine population of the golden eagle <i>Aquila chrysaetos</i>, a large predator that requires negotiating the atmospheric environment to achieve energy-efficient soaring flight. We quantified weekly energy landscapes using environmental features for 55 juvenile golden eagles, demonstrating that energetic costs of traversing the landscape decreased with age. Consequently, the potentially flyable area within the Alpine region increased 2170-fold during their first three years of independence. Our work contributes to a predictive understanding of animal movement by presenting ontogeny as a mechanism shaping the realized energy landscape.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97069">Dysregulated Ca2+ signaling, fluid secretion, and mitochondrial function in a mouse model of early SjÃ¶grenâs disease</a></h4>

              
                The molecular mechanisms leading to saliva secretion are largely established, but factors that underlie secretory hypofunction, specifically related to the autoimmune disease SjÃ¶grenâs syndrome (SS) are not fully understood. A major conundrum is the lack of association between the severity of salivary gland immune cell infiltration and glandular hypofunction. SS-like disease was induced by treatment with DMXAA, a small molecule agonist of murine STING. We have previously shown that the extent of salivary secretion is correlated with the magnitude of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals (Takano et al., 2021). Contrary to our expectations, despite a significant reduction in fluid secretion, neural stimulation resulted in enhanced Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals with altered spatiotemporal characteristics in vivo. Muscarinic stimulation resulted in reduced activation of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated Cl<sup>-</sup> channel, TMEM16a, although there were no changes in channel abundance or absolute sensitivity to Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Super-resolution microscopy revealed a disruption in the colocalization of Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor Ca<sup>2+</sup> release channels with TMEM16a, and channel activation was reduced when intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffering was increased. These data indicate altered local peripheral coupling between the channels. Appropriate Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling is also pivotal for mitochondrial morphology and bioenergetics. Disrupted mitochondrial morphology and reduced oxygen consumption rate were observed in DMXAA-treated animals. In summary, early in SS disease, dysregulated Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals lead to decreased fluid secretion and disrupted mitochondrial function contributing to salivary gland hypofunction.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91420">Revealing a hidden conducting state by manipulating the intracellular domains in KV10.1 exposes the coupling between two gating mechanisms</a></h4>

              
                The <i>KCNH</i> family of potassium channels serves relevant physiological functions in both excitable and non-excitable cells, reflected in the massive consequences of mutations or pharmacological manipulation of their function. This group of channels shares structural homology with other voltage-gated K<sup>+</sup> channels, but the mechanisms of gating in this family show significant differences with respect to the canonical electromechanical coupling in these molecules. In particular, the large intracellular domains of <i>KCNH</i> channels play a crucial role in gating that is still only partly understood. Using <i>KCNH1</i>(K<sub>V</sub>10.1) as a model, we have characterized the behavior of a series of modified channels that could not be explained by the current models. With electrophysiological and biochemical methods combined with mathematical modeling, we show that the uncovering of an open state can explain the behavior of the mutants. This open state, which is not detectable in wild-type channels, appears to lack the rapid flicker block of the conventional open state. Because it is accessed from deep closed states, it elucidates intermediate gating events well ahead of channel opening in the wild type. This allowed us to study gating steps prior to opening, which, for example, explain the mechanism of gating inhibition by Ca<sup>2+</sup>-Calmodulin and generate a model that describes the characteristic features of <i>KCNH</i> channels gating.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/84385">Neuroelectrophysiology-compatible electrolytic lesioning</a></h4>

              
                Lesion studies have historically been instrumental for establishing causal connections between brain and behavior. They stand to provide additional insight if integrated with multielectrode techniques common in systems neuroscience. Here, we present and test a platform for creating electrolytic lesions through chronically implanted, intracortical multielectrode probes without compromising the ability to acquire neuroelectrophysiology. A custom-built current source provides stable current and allows for controlled, repeatable lesions in awake-behaving animals. Performance of this novel lesioning technique was validated using histology from ex vivo and in vivo testing, current and voltage traces from the device, and measurements of spiking activity before and after lesioning. This electrolytic lesioning method avoids disruptive procedures, provides millimeter precision over the extent and submillimeter precision over the location of the injury, and permits electrophysiological recording of single-unit activity from the remaining neuronal population after lesioning. This technique can be used in many areas of cortex, in several species, and theoretically with any multielectrode probe. The low-cost, external lesioning device can also easily be adopted into an existing electrophysiology recording setup. This technique is expected to enable future causal investigations of the recorded neuronal populationâs role in neuronal circuit function, while simultaneously providing new insight into local reorganization after neuron loss.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/90559">Different coexistence patterns between apex carnivores and mesocarnivores based on temporal, spatial, and dietary niche partitioning analysis in Qilian Mountain National Park, China</a></h4>

              
                Carnivores play key roles in maintaining ecosystem structure and function as well as ecological processes. Understanding how sympatric species coexist in natural ecosystems is a central research topic in community ecology and biodiversity conservation. In this study, we explored intra- and interspecific niche partitioning along spatial, temporal, and dietary niche partitioning between apex carnivores (wolf <i>Canis lupus</i>, snow leopard <i>Panthera uncia</i>, Eurasian lynx <i>Lynx lynx</i>) and mesocarnivores (Pallasâs cat <i>Otocolobus manul</i>, red fox <i>Vulpes vulpes</i>, Tibetan fox <i>Vulpes ferrilata</i>) in Qilian Mountain National Park, China, using camera trapping data and DNA metabarcoding sequencing data. Our study showed that apex carnivore species had more overlap temporally (coefficients of interspecific overlap ranging from 0.661 to 0.900) or trophically (Piankaâs index ranging from 0.458 to 0.892), mesocarnivore species had high dietary overlap with each other (Piankaâs index ranging from 0.945 to 0.997), and apex carnivore and mesocarnivore species had high temporal overlap (coefficients of interspecific overlap ranging from 0.497 to 0.855). Large dietary overlap was observed between wolf and snow leopard (Piankaâs index = 0.892) and Pallasâs cat and Tibetan fox (Piankaâs index = 0.997), suggesting the potential for increased resource competition for these species pairs. We concluded that spatial niche partitioning is likely to key driver in facilitating the coexistence of apex carnivore species, while spatial and temporal niche partitioning likely facilitate the coexistence of mesocarnivore species, and spatial and dietary niche partitioning facilitate the coexistence between apex and mesocarnivore species. Our findings consider partitioning across temporal, spatial, and dietary dimensions while examining diverse coexistence patterns of carnivore species in Qilian Mountain National Park, China. These findings will contribute substantially to current understanding of carnivore guilds and effective conservation management in fragile alpine ecosystems.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95406">Embryonic origins of forebrain oligodendrocytes revisited by combinatorial genetic fate mapping</a></h4>

              
                Multiple embryonic origins give rise to forebrain oligodendrocytes (OLs), yet controversies and uncertainty exist regarding their differential contributions. We established intersectional and subtractional strategies to genetically fate map OLs produced by medial ganglionic eminence/preoptic area (MGE/POA), lateral/caudal ganglionic eminences (LGE/CGE), and dorsal pallium in the mouse brain. We found that, contrary to the canonical view, LGE/CGE-derived OLs make minimum contributions to the neocortex and corpus callosum, but dominate piriform cortex and anterior commissure. Additionally, MGE/POA-derived OLs, instead of being entirely eliminated, make small but sustained contribution to cortex with a distribution pattern distinctive from those derived from the dorsal origin. Our study provides a revised and more comprehensive view of cortical and white matter OL origins, and established valuable new tools and strategies for future OL studies.
