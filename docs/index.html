              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22216">Representation biases: will we achieve complete understanding by analyzing representations?</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2507.22216v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A common approach in neuroscience is to study neural representations as a means to understand a system -- increasingly, by relating the neural representations to the internal representations learned by computational models. However, a recent work in machine learning (Lampinen, 2024) shows that learned feature representations may be biased to over-represent certain features, and represent others more weakly and less-consistently. For example, simple (linear) features may be more strongly and more consistently represented than complex (highly nonlinear) features. These biases could pose challenges for achieving full understanding of a system through representational analysis. In this perspective, we illustrate these challenges -- showing how feature representation biases can lead to strongly biased inferences from common analyses like PCA, regression, and RSA. We also present homomorphic encryption as a simple case study of the potential for strong dissociation between patterns of representation and computation. We discuss the implications of these results for representational comparisons between systems, and for neuroscience more generally.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08922">Neural correlates of learned categorical perception of visual stimuli with local features</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2508.08922v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Learning to categorize requires distinguishing category members from non-members by detecting the features that covary with membership. Whether this process can induce changes in perception is still a matter of debate. In prior studies, we reported Learned Categorical Perception (Learned CP) effects in the form of between-category separation and within-category compression in perceived similarity after training subjects to categorize visual stimuli with distributed, holistic features.These effects were correlated with changes in an early, perceptual component of Event Related Potentials (ERPs). Using the same methodology, in this experiment we trained 96 subjects to sort line drawings of fish with local, verbalizable features into two categories by trial and error with corrective feedback. We tested for Learned CP effects and their neural correlates by measuring subjects' pairwise dissimilarity judgments and(ERPs) before and after the training. With the same frequency of trials and feedback,about 40% of the participants succeeded in learning the categories ("learners") while the rest did not ("non-learners"). Learners showed a) significant between-category separation and within-category compression after training compared to before and b) an increase in a late parietal ERP positivity (LPC; 400-600 ms) and an early, occipital positivity (P1; 80-140 ms), correlated with categorization accuracy and degree of Learned CP. These behavioral and neural changes after learning a category, absent in Non Learners, provide further evidence that category learning can modulate perceptual processes, regardless of the nature of the visual features. We complement our experimental results with a neural net model using the same stimuli.

Abstract: Mechanical reasoning is a hallmark of human intelligence, defined by its ubiquitous yet irreplaceable role in human activities ranging from routine tasks to civil engineering. Embedding machines with mechanical reasoning is therefore an important step towards building human-level artificial intelligence. Here, we leveraged 155 cognitive experiments to test the understanding of system stability, gears and pulley systems, leverage principle, inertia and motion, and fluid mechanics in 26 Vision Language Models (VLMs). Results indicate that VLMs consistently perform worse than humans on all domains, while demonstrate significant difficulty in reasoning about gear systems and fluid mechanics. Notably, their performance on these tasks do not improve as number of parameters increase, suggesting that current attention-based architecture may fail to grasp certain underlying mechanisms required for mechanical reasoning, particularly those pertaining to mental simulations.

                arXiv:2508.09852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neurological conditions affecting visual perception create profound experiential divides between affected individuals and their caregivers, families, and medical professionals. We present the Perceptual Reality Transformer, a comprehensive framework employing six distinct neural architectures to simulate eight neurological perception conditions with scientifically-grounded visual transformations. Our system learns mappings from natural images to condition-specific perceptual states, enabling others to experience approximations of simultanagnosia, prosopagnosia, ADHD attention deficits, visual agnosia, depression-related changes, anxiety tunnel vision, and Alzheimer's memory effects. Through systematic evaluation across ImageNet and CIFAR-10 datasets, we demonstrate that Vision Transformer architectures achieve optimal performance, outperforming traditional CNN and generative approaches. Our work establishes the first systematic benchmark for neurological perception simulation, contributes novel condition-specific perturbation functions grounded in clinical literature, and provides quantitative metrics for evaluating simulation fidelity. The framework has immediate applications in medical education, empathy training, and assistive technology development, while advancing our fundamental understanding of how neural networks can model atypical human perception.

                arXiv:2508.09618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Training highly recurrent networks in continuous action spaces is a technical challenge: gradient-based methods suffer from exploding or vanishing gradients, while purely evolutionary searches converge slowly in high-dimensional weight spaces. We introduce a hybrid, derivative-free optimization framework that implements reinforcement learning by coupling global evolutionary exploration with local direct search exploitation. The method, termed ENOMAD (Evolutionary Nonlinear Optimization with Mesh Adaptive Direct search), is benchmarked on a suite of food-foraging tasks instantiated in the fully mapped neural connectome of the nematode \emph{Caenorhabditis elegans}. Crucially, ENOMAD leverages biologically derived weight priors, letting it refine--rather than rebuild--the organism's native circuitry. Two algorithmic variants of the method are introduced, which lead to either small distributed adjustments of many weights, or larger changes on a limited number of weights. Both variants significantly exceed the performance of the untrained connectome (in what can be interpreted as an example of transfer learning) and of existing training strategies. These findings demonstrate that integrating evolutionary search with nonlinear optimization provides an efficient, biologically grounded strategy for specializing natural recurrent networks towards a specified set of tasks.

                arXiv:2508.09466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robust fitting of geometric models is a fundamental task in many computer vision pipelines. Numerous innovations have been produced on the topic, from improving the efficiency and accuracy of random sampling heuristics to generating novel theoretical insights that underpin new approaches with mathematical guarantees. However, one aspect of robust fitting that has received little attention is energy efficiency. This performance metric has become critical as high energy consumption is a growing concern for AI adoption. In this paper, we explore energy-efficient robust fitting via the neuromorphic computing paradigm. Specifically, we designed a novel spiking neural network for robust fitting on real neuromorphic hardware, the Intel Loihi 2. Enabling this are novel event-driven formulations of model estimation that allow robust fitting to be implemented in the unique architecture of Loihi 2, and algorithmic strategies to alleviate the current limited precision and instruction set of the hardware. Results show that our neuromorphic robust fitting consumes only a fraction (15%) of the energy required to run the established robust fitting algorithm on a standard CPU to equivalent accuracy.

                arXiv:2508.09765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, we can observe a significant increase of the phishing attacks in the Internet. In a typical phishing attack, the attacker sets up a malicious website that looks similar to the legitimate website in order to obtain the end-users' information. This may cause the leakage of the sensitive information and the financial loss for the end-users. To avoid such attacks, the early detection of these websites' URLs is vital and necessary. Previous researchers have proposed many machine learning algorithms to distinguish the phishing URLs from the legitimate ones. In this paper, we would like to enhance these machine learning algorithms from the perspective of feature selection. We propose a novel method to incorporate the keyword features with the traditional features. This method is applied on multiple traditional machine learning algorithms and the experimental results have shown this method is useful and effective. On average, this method can reduce the classification error by 30% for the large dataset. Moreover, its enhancement is more significant for the small dataset. In addition, this method extracts the information from the URL and does not rely on the additional information provided by the third-part service. The best result for the machine learning algorithm using our proposed method has achieved the accuracy of 99.68%.

                arXiv:2508.09768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Elementary Cellular Automata (ECAs) exhibit diverse behaviours often categorized by Wolfram's qualitative classification. To provide a quantitative basis for understanding these behaviours, we investigate the global dynamics of such automata and we describe a method that allows us to compute the number of all configurations leading to short attractors in a limited number of time steps. This computation yields exact results in the thermodynamic limit (as the CA grid size grows to infinity), and is based on the Transfer Matrix Method (TMM) that we adapt for our purposes. Specifically, given two parameters $(p, c)$ we are able to compute the entropy of all initial configurations converging to an attractor of size $c$ after $p$ time-steps. By calculating such statistics for various ECA rules, we establish a quantitative connection between the entropy and the qualitative Wolfram classification scheme. Class 1 rules rapidly converge to maximal entropy for stationary states ($c=1$) as $p$ increases. Class 2 rules also approach maximal entropy quickly for appropriate cycle lengths $c$, potentially requiring consideration of translations. Class 3 rules exhibit zero or low finite entropy that saturates after a short transient. Class 4 rules show finite positive entropy, similar to some Class 3 rules. This method provides a precise framework for quantifying trajectory statistics, although its exponential computational cost in $p+c$ restricts practical analysis to short trajectories.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05816">Learning Characteristics of Reverse Quaternion Neural Network</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2411.05816v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to propose a new multi-layer feedforward quaternion neural network model architecture, Reverse Quaternion Neural Network which utilizes the non-commutative nature of quaternion products, and to clarify its learning characteristics. While quaternion neural networks have been used in various fields, there has been no research report on the characteristics of multi-layer feedforward quaternion neural networks where weights are applied in the reverse direction. This paper investigates the learning characteristics of the Reverse Quaternion Neural Network from two perspectives: the learning speed and the generalization on rotation. As a result, it is found that the Reverse Quaternion Neural Network has a learning speed comparable to existing models and can obtain a different rotation representation from the existing models.

Abstract: Criticality is a behavioral state in dynamical systems that is known to present the highest computation capabilities, i.e., information transmission, storage, and modification. Therefore, such systems are ideal candidates as a substrate for reservoir computing, a subfield in artificial intelligence. Our choice of a substrate is a cellular automaton (CA) governed by an artificial neural network, also known as neural cellular automaton (NCA). We apply evolution strategy to optimize the NCA to achieve criticality, demonstrated by power law distributions in structures called avalanches. With an evolved critical NCA, the substrate is tested for reservoir computing. Our evaluation of the substrate is performed with two benchmarks, 5-bit memory task and image classification of handwritten digits. The result of the 5-bit memory task achieved a perfect score and the system managed to remember all 5 bits. The result for the image classification task matched and sometimes surpassed the performance of the best elementary CA for this task. Moreover, the proposed critical NCA may operate as a self-organized critical system, due to its robustness to extreme initial conditions.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15462">CTRQNets & LQNets: Continuous Time Recurrent and Liquid Quantum Neural Networks</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2408.15462v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural networks have continued to gain prevalence in the modern era for their ability to model complex data through pattern recognition and behavior remodeling. However, the static construction of traditional neural networks inhibits dynamic intelligence. This makes them inflexible to temporal changes in data and unfit to capture complex dependencies. With the advent of quantum technology, there has been significant progress in creating quantum algorithms. In recent years, researchers have developed quantum neural networks that leverage the capabilities of qubits to outperform classical networks. However, their current formulation exhibits a static construction limiting the system's dynamic intelligence. To address these weaknesses, we develop a Liquid Quantum Neural Network (LQNet) and a Continuous Time Recurrent Quantum Neural Network (CTRQNet). Both models demonstrate a significant improvement in accuracy compared to existing quantum neural networks (QNNs), achieving accuracy increases as high as 40\% on CIFAR 10 through binary classification. We propose LQNets and CTRQNets might shine a light on quantum machine learning's black box.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01330">Accelerating Linear Recurrent Neural Networks for the Edge with Unstructured Sparsity</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2502.01330v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Linear recurrent neural networks enable powerful long-range sequence modeling with constant memory usage and time-per-token during inference. These architectures hold promise for streaming applications at the edge, but deployment in resource-constrained environments requires hardware-aware optimizations to minimize latency and energy consumption. Unstructured sparsity offers a compelling solution, enabling substantial reductions in compute and memory requirements--when accelerated by compatible hardware platforms. In this paper, we conduct a scaling study to investigate the Pareto front of performance and efficiency across inference compute budgets. We find that highly sparse linear RNNs consistently achieve better efficiency-performance trade-offs than dense baselines, with 2x less compute and 36% less memory at iso-accuracy. Our models achieve state-of-the-art results on a real-time streaming task for audio denoising. By quantizing our sparse models to fixed-point arithmetic and deploying them on the Intel Loihi 2 neuromorphic chip for real-time processing, we translate model compression into tangible gains of 42x lower latency and 149x lower energy consumption compared to a dense model on an edge GPU. Our findings showcase the transformative potential of unstructured sparsity, paving the way for highly efficient recurrent neural networks in real-world, resource-constrained environments.

                <p>Sensory-motor control requires the integration and monitoring of sensory feedback resulting from our behaviors. This self-monitoring is thought to result from comparisons between predictions about the expected sensory consequences of action and the feedback actually received, resulting in activity that encodes feedback error. Although similar mechanisms have been proposed during speech and vocal production, including sensitivity to experimentally perturbed auditory feedback, evidence for a vocal "error signal" has been limited. Here, we recorded from the auditory cortex of vocalizing nonhuman primates, using real-time frequency shifts to introduce feedback errors of varying magnitude and direction. We found neural activity that scaled with the magnitude of feedback error in both directions, consistent with vocal error monitoring at both the individual unit and population levels. This feedback sensitivity was greater than expected based upon passive sensory responses and was specific for units in the vocal frequency range. Feedback responses also predicted subsequent compensatory changes in vocal production. These results provide evidence that the auditory cortex encodes the degree of vocal feedback error using both unit-level error calculations and changes in the population of neurons involved. These mechanisms may provide critical error information necessary for feedback-dependent vocal control.</p>

                <p>Rapsyn is a scaffold protein that is thought to anchor acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ). We showed that it may be an E3 ligase that regulates NMJ development by neddylation. To obtain genetical evidence, we mutated Nae1 (APP-BP1), an obligatory subunit of the neddylation E1 enzyme specifically in muscle cells. The mutation decreased the stability of acetylcholine receptor (AChR)&alpha;, reduced AChR clustering, and impaired NMJ development in <I>Pax7-Cre;Nae1f/f</I> mice (of either sex) and caused neonatal lethality. Moreover, while NMJs were normal in heterozygous mutant mice of Nae1 or rapsyn C366A (a knock-in mutation that eliminates E3 ligase activity), double heterozygous mutant mice (of either sex) displayed NMJ deficits, indicative of a genetic interaction between Nae1 and rapsyn. These results provide genetic evidence for a role of neddylation in NMJ formation and support the notion that rapsyn serves as a neddylation E3 ligase in NMJ formation.</p>

                <p>Learning new sequential movements is a fundamental skill for many animals. Motor sequence learning may arise from three distinct processes: (1) improved execution of individual movements independent of their sequential context; (2) enhanced anticipation of "what" movement should be executed next, enabling faster initiation; and (3) the development of motoric sequence-specific representations that encode "how" movements should be optimally performed within a sequence. However, many existing paradigms conflate the "what" and "how" components of learning, as participants often acquire both the sequence content (what to do) and its execution (how to do it). This overlap obscures the distinct contributions of each mechanism to motor sequence learning. In this study, we disentangled these mechanisms in a continuous reaching task by varying how many upcoming targets were visible. When participants (<I>n</I> = 14, 8F) could only see one future target, improvements were mostly due to them learning which target would come next. When they could see four future targets, participants immediately demonstrated faster movement times and increased movement smoothness, surpassing late-stage performance in the one-target condition. Crucially, even with full visibility of future targets, participants showed further sequence-specific learning driven by a continuous optimization of movement trajectories. Follow-up experiments (<I>n</I> = 42, 21F) revealed that the learned sequence representations did not generalize in extrinsic coordinates across limbs and encoded contextual information of four movements or longer. Our paradigm dissociates between the "what" and "how" components of motor sequence learning and provides evidence for the development of motoric sequence representations that guide optimal movement execution.</p>

                <p>Rhythms at a population level are a defining characteristic of both normal and pathological cortical activities, but it is unclear how such rhythms interact with the activity of specific neurons to impact task performance on a trial-by-trial basis. We address this by employing a challenging visual detection task in which male rhesus macaques must signal the presentation of a shape embedded in a noisy background. We analyzed the rhythmic activity in the local field potential (LFP) and single neuron activity in area V4, a brain area strongly implicated in shape perception, prior to such presentations and focused on two different frequency ranges: alpha/beta (10&ndash;30 Hz), in which coherence was particularly strong and spatially extensive, and gamma (50&ndash;70 Hz), which has traditionally been strongly associated with single unit activity. We find that within sessions, there were periods of time during which successful detection was associated with the absence of rhythmic activity prior to shape presentation in either frequency range. During these periods, rhythmic quiescence prior to shape presentation could predict whether the shape would be detected by the animal with high accuracy. Importantly, for both frequency ranges, the individual neurons carrying the most relevant information with regard to the task had the weakest coupling to LFP rhythms. These results are consistent with spatially distributed rhythmic activity acting as a source of decision noise in the context of rapid visual detection by reducing the moment-to-moment reliability of task-relevant information carried by individual neurons.</p>

                <p>Dopamine is an important neuromodulator found throughout the central nervous system that can influence neural circuits involved in sensory, motor, and cognitive functions. In the retina, dopamine is released by specific amacrine cells and plays a role in reconfiguring circuits for photopic vision. This adaptation takes place both in photoreceptors and at postreceptoral sites. The AII amacrine cell, which plays a crucial role for transmission of both scotopic and photopic visual signals, has been considered an important target of dopaminergic modulation, expressed as a change in the strength of electrical coupling mediated by gap junctions between the AIIs. It has been difficult, however, to find clear evidence for expression of dopamine receptors by AII amacrines. Here, we combined injection of fluorescent dye in AIIs with immunolabeling of type 1 dopamine receptors (D1Rs) and made the surprising observation that D1Rs, along with KCNQ2, an M-type K<sup>+</sup> channel, are expressed at the AII axon initial segment-like process (AII-AIS) that also expresses voltage-gated Na<sup>+</sup> (Na<SUB>v</SUB>) channels and generates action potentials. With current-clamp recording of AIIs in rat (male, female) retinal slices, we found that D1R activation reduced spike frequency and increased spike threshold. Taken together with experiments using immunolabeling, pharmacological manipulation, and computational modeling, our results suggest that activation of D1Rs on AIIs reduces the intrinsic excitability of these cells, likely mediated by an intracellular signal transduction pathway involving cAMP, PKA, and phosphorylation of Na<SUB>v</SUB> channels in the AII-AIS. These results suggest a novel mechanism for the role of dopamine in retinal adaptation.</p>

                <p>Primary cilia are conserved sensory hubs essential for signaling transduction and embryonic development. Ciliary dysfunction causes a variety of developmental syndromes with neurological features and cognitive impairment whose basis mostly remains unknown. Despite connections to neural function, the primary cilium remains an overlooked organelle in the brain. Most neurons have a primary cilium; however, it is still unclear how this organelle modulates brain architecture and function, given the lack of any systemic dissection of neuronal ciliary signaling. Here, we present the first in vivo glance at the molecular composition of cilia in the mouse brain. We have adapted in vivo proximity-dependent biotin identification (iBioID), targeting the biotin ligase BioID2 to primary cilia in neurons of male and female mice. We identified tissue-specific signaling networks residing in neuronal cilia, including Eph/Ephrin signaling. We also uncovered a novel connection between primary cilia and gamma-aminobutyric acid signaling. Our iBioID ciliary network presents a wealth of new and neural-specific ciliary signaling proteins and yields new insights into neurological disorders. Our findings are a promising first step in defining the fundamentals of ciliary signaling and their roles in shaping neural circuits and behavior. In the future, this work can be extended to pathological conditions of the brain, with the goal of identifying ciliary signaling pathways disrupted in these disorders and the ultimate aim of finding novel therapeutic strategies.</p>

                <p><I>N</I>-Methyl-<scp>d</scp>-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) control synaptic plasticity and brain development in a manner determined by receptor subunit composition. Pathogenic variants in <I>GRIN2A</I> gene, encoding the NMDAR GluN2A subunit, can cause gain or loss of function of receptors containing the affected subunit and are associated with intellectual disability and epilepsy in patients. While in vitro studies of recombinant receptors have yielded some insights, animal experimental models are essential to better understand the relationship between the molecular pathology of the variants and the disease. Here we introduce a zebrafish model of GluN2A loss of function to study system-level effects of zebrafish <I>grin2Aa</I> and <I>grin2Ab</I> gene deletion. Our electrophysiological analysis revealed functional differences between receptors containing zebrafish GluN2Aa/b and GluN2Bb paralogs comparable with mammalian receptors containing GluN2A versus GluN2B subunits. Both <I>grin2Aa<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup></I> and <I>grin2Ab<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup></I> as well as double-knock-out <I>grin2A<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup></I> zebrafish larvae showed increased locomotor activity in a novel environment. Proteomic analysis suggested that the relative proportion of GluN2B-containing NMDARs may be increased in <I>grin2A</I> mutant fish. Our results highlight fundamental similarities between zebrafish and mammalian NMDAR signaling and validate the use of zebrafish as a model organism to study the neurodevelopmental role of NMDARs. The newly created transgenic zebrafish strains complement the rodent models of GluN2A loss of function and can be used for high-throughput testing of pharmacological or genetic treatment strategies for patients with <I>GRIN2A</I> gene variants.</p>

                <p>Nitrous oxide use disorder (NUD) has recently received increasing social concern for its sharp rise among young people. However, the underlying mechanisms of NUD remain largely unexplored, which obstructs treatment strategy development and may exacerbate the epidemic of N<SUB>2</SUB>O abuse. Thus, specifying the essential mechanisms and targets in NUD are desperately needed. Here we unveiled a series of molecular adaptations regarding N<SUB>2</SUB>O reward memory in nucleus accumbens (NAc) of mice through multi-omics approaches comprising transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics approaches. Our miRNA transcriptomics and pull-down proteomics analyzes uncovered that miR-7220-5p regulated N<SUB>2</SUB>O-induced conditioned-place preference (CPP) and associated increase of dendritic spine density in NAc of male mice. Our pull-down proteomics and metabolomics analyses revealed that miR-7220-5p modulated ERK signaling pathway by directly binding with NR2B receptor. In summary, our work confirmed that restoring miR-7220-5p expression in NAc protected against synaptic abnormality via the NR2B/ERK/CREB signaling, thereby attenuating CPP behaviors in NUD. Selective inhibition of NR2B or ERK signaling blocked the reward memory of N<SUB>2</SUB>O-CPP via NAc microinjection. Our study proposed a potential therapeutic strategy for NUD and provided comprehensive resources of biological data to support future investigations of NUD treatment.</p>

                <p>The dynamics of social dominance play a significant role in regulating access to resources and influencing reproductive success and survival in nonhuman primates. These dynamics are based on aggressive and submissive interactions that create distinct, hierarchically organized social structures. In humans, whose social behavior is similarly organized, the use of brain imaging based on tractography has identified key neuronal networks of the limbic system underlying social behavior. Among them, the uncinate fasciculus and the cingulum bundle have been associated with aggression and some disorders such as psychopathy. In this study, we have used advanced tractography to study the anatomy of connections underlying social dominance in a colony of 15 female squirrel monkeys (<I>Saimiri sciureus</I>). We correlated the biostructural properties of the uncinate fasciculus and cingulum with behavioral hierarchy measures while controlling for factors such as age, weight, handedness, brain size, and hormonal influences. The fornix, a limbic connection involved in memory, was also included as the control tract. Our findings indicate a significant correlation between the integrity of the right uncinate fasciculus and social dominance measures, including normalized David's scores, aggressive behaviors, and submissive behaviors. Trends observed in the left uncinate fasciculus hint at potential bilateral involvement with a right hemispheric lateralization. These results are consistent with human studies linking the uncinate fasciculus to social aggression and disorders, suggesting an evolutionary continuity in the neuroanatomical substrates of social dominance back to at least 35 million years.</p>

                <p>Traumatic brain injury (TBI) can lead to long-lasting cognitive deficits in the human brain, with a considerable contribution of secondary morphological and functional sequela in cortical regions distant to the lesion site. In order to uncover the role of early functional alterations in parvalbumin-positive basket cells (PV-BCs), an interneuron population required to maintain inhibition of neocortical circuits, to this dysfunctional plasticity, we investigated anatomical and electrophysiological properties of PV-BCs in PV-IRES-Cre-tdTomato mice of both sexes 24&nbsp;h after a cortical impact. These experiments revealed that the number of PV-BCs was moderately decreased around the cortical impact site, while their morphology was unaffected. Patch-clamp experiments demonstrated that TBI increased the input resistance of PV-BCs and the amplitude of hyperpolarization-activated inward currents (<I>I</I><SUB>h</SUB>). In addition, the maximal firing frequency upon depolarizing stimuli was decreased. The increase in <I>I</I><SUB>h</SUB> amplitude was paralleled by the appearance of somatic HCN channels in immunohistochemical staining and the occurrence of somatic <I>I</I><SUB>h</SUB> in nucleated patch recordings, suggesting that TBI induced a redistribution of HCN channels from a purely axonal to an additional somatodendritic expression. Pharmacological experiments showed that inhibition of axonal HCN-mediated currents impairs the maximal firing frequency of PV-BCs. Additional in silico simulations disclosed the general importance of axonal HCN channels to maintain high-frequency firing of PV-BCs by counteracting Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup>-pump associated hyperpolarizing currents. In summary, our results suggest that the early loss of PV-BCs and the TBI-induced distinct alterations in their electrophysiological properties can contribute to the establishment of disturbed network activity following TBI.</p>

                <p>by Dimitrios Chalkiadakis, Jaime Sánchez-Claros, Víctor J. López-Madrona, Santiago Canals, Claudio R. Mirasso</p>

Interactions among brain rhythms play a crucial role in organizing neuronal firing sequences during specific cognitive functions. In memory formation, the coupling between the phase of the theta rhythm and the amplitude of gamma oscillations has been extensively studied in the hippocampus. Prevailing perspectives suggest that the phase of the slower oscillation modulates the fast activity. However, recent metrics, such as Cross-Frequency Directionality (CFD), indicate that these electrophysiological interactions can be bidirectional. Using a computational model, we demonstrate that feedforward inhibition modeled by a theta-modulated ING (Interneuron Network Gamma) mechanism induces fast-to-slow interactions, while feedback inhibition through a theta-modulated PING (Pyramidal Interneuron Network Gamma) model drives slow-to-fast interactions. Importantly, in circuits combining both feedforward and feedback motifs, as commonly found experimentally, directionality is flexibly modulated by synaptic strength within biologically realistic ranges. A signature of this interaction is that fast-to-slow dominance in feedforward motifs is associated with gamma oscillations of higher frequency, and <i>vice versa</i>. Using previously acquired electrophysiological data from the hippocampus of rats freely navigating in a familiar environment or in a novel one, we show that CFD is dynamically regulated and linked to the frequency of the gamma band, as predicted by the model. Finally, the model attributes each theta-gamma interaction scheme, determined by the balance between feedforward and feedback inhibition, to distinct modes of information transmission and integration, adding computational flexibility. Our results offer a plausible neurobiological interpretation for cross-frequency directionality measurements associated with the activation of different underlying motifs that serve distinct computational needs.

                <p>by R. Tucker Gilman, CD Durrant, Lucy Malpas, Rebecca N. Lewis</p>

In human languages, words that are used more frequently tend to be shorter than words that are used less frequently. This pattern is known as Zipf’s law of abbreviation. It has been attributed to the principle of least effort – communication is more efficient when words that are used more frequently are easier to produce. Zipf’s law of abbreviation appears to hold in all human languages, and recently attention has turned to whether it also holds in animal communication. In birdsong, which has been used as a model for human language learning and development, researchers have focused on whether more frequently used notes or phrases are shorter than those that are used less frequently. Because birdsong can be highly stereotyped, have high interindividual variation, and have phrase repertoires that are small relative to human language lexicons, studying Zipf’s law of abbreviation in birdsong presents challenges that do not arise when studying human languages. In this paper, we describe a new method for assessing evidence for Zipf’s law of abbreviation in birdsong, and we introduce the R package ZLAvian to implement this method. We used ZLAvian to study Zipf’s law of abbreviation in the songs of 11 bird populations archived in the open-access repository Bird-DB. We did not find strong evidence for Zipf’s law of abbreviation in any population when studied alone, but we found evidence for Zipf’s law in a synthetic analysis across all populations. Overall, the negative concordance between phrase length and frequency of use in birdsong was several times weaker than the negative concordance between word length and frequency of use in written human languages. The method and the results we present here offer a new foundation for researchers studying if or how the principle of least effort shapes animal communication.

                <p>by N. Ezgi Wood, Anıl Cengiz, Ming Gao, Alexander V. Ratushny, Ronny Straube</p>

Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are gaining increasing traction in the treatment of oncological diseases; however, many clinical failures have also been observed. One key factor limiting ADC effectiveness is the heterogeneous expression of their target antigen. While the vast majority of ADCs in clinical development target antigens on cancer cells (cancer-targeting), they can also target antigens expressed on non-cancerous stromal cells in the tumor microenvironment (stroma-targeting). It remains unclear if ADCs targeting stromal cells can outperform cancer-targeting ADCs. Here, we present three related mathematical models to evaluate: (1) cancer-targeting ADCs with homogeneous target antigen expression, (2) cancer-targeting ADCs with heterogeneous target antigen expression, and (3) stroma-targeting ADCs. Our simulations suggest that cancer-targeting ADCs can achieve high efficacy when their target antigen is homogenously expressed. However, in cases of heterogeneous antigen expression, cancer-targeting ADCs may lead to an initial reduction in tumor size, followed by regrowth due to the elimination of antigen-positive cells and expansion of antigen-negative cells. This limitation could potentially be overcome by stroma-targeting ADCs, as antigen-positive stromal cells may continue to be recruited into the tumor by the oncogenic factors produced by the remaining cancer cells. Furthermore, we demonstrate that ADCs with more permeable payloads and less stable linkers may offer improved efficacy in the context of heterogeneous target expression.

<i>Campylobacter spp.</i> resistant to fluoroquinolones and macrolides are serious public health threats. Studies aiming to identify risk factors for drug-resistant <i>Campylobacter</i> have narrowly focused on antimicrobial use at the farm level. Using chain graphs, we quantified risk factors for fluoroquinolones- and macrolide-resistance in <i>Campylobacter coli</i> isolated from two distinctive swine production systems, conventional and antibiotic-free (ABF). The chain graphs were learned using genotypic and antimicrobial susceptibility data from 1082 isolates and host exposures obtained through surveys for 14 cohorts of pigs. The gyrA T86I point mutation alone explained at least 58% of the variance in ciprofloxacin minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for ABF and 79% in conventional farms. For macrolides, genotype and host exposures explained similar variance in azithromycin and erythromycin MIC. Among host exposures, heavy metal exposures were identified as risk factors in both conventional and ABF. Chain graph models can generate insights into the complex epidemiology of antimicrobial resistance by characterizing context-specific risk factors and facilitating causal discovery.

                <p>by Daniel Sobrido-Cameán, Bramwell Coulson, Michael Miller, Matthew C. W. Oswald, Tom Pettini, David M. D. Bailey, Richard A. Baines, Matthias Landgraf</p>

As developing networks transition from spontaneous irregular to patterned activity, they undergo plastic tuning phases, termed “critical periods”; “critical” because disturbances during these phases can lead to lasting changes in network development and output. Critical periods are common to developing nervous systems, with analogous features shared from insects to mammals, yet the core signaling mechanisms that underlie cellular critical period plasticity have remained elusive. To identify these, we exploited the <i>Drosophila</i> larval locomotor network as an advantageous model system. It has a defined critical period and offers unparalleled access to identified network elements, including the neuromuscular junction as a model synapse. We find that manipulations of a single motoneuron or muscle cell during the critical period lead to predictable, and permanent, cell-specific changes. This demonstrates that critical period adjustments occur at a single-cell level. Mechanistically, we identified mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) as causative. Specifically, we show that ROS produced by Complex-I of the mitochondrial electron transport chain, generated by the reverse flow of electrons, is necessary and instructive for critical period-regulated plasticity. Downstream of ROS, we identified the <i>Drosophila</i> homologue of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF-1α), as required for transducing the mitochondrial ROS signal to the nucleus. This signaling axis is also sufficient to cell autonomously specify changes in neuronal properties and animal behavior but, again, only when activated during the embryonic critical period. Thus, we have identified specific mitochondrial ROS and HIF-1α as primary signals that mediate critical period plasticity.

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Synaptic spine loss is an early pathophysiologic hallmark of Alzheimer disease (AD) that precedes overt loss of dendritic architecture and frank neurodegeneration. While spine loss signifies a decreased engagement of postsynaptic neurons by presynaptic targets, the degree to which loss of spines and their passive components impacts the excitability of postsynaptic neurons and responses to surviving synaptic inputs is unclear. Using passive multicompartmental models of CA1 pyramidal neurons (PNs), implicated in early AD, we find that spine loss alone drives a boosting of remaining inputs to their proximal and distal dendrites, targeted by CA3 and entorhinal cortex (EC), respectively. This boosting effect is higher in distal versus proximal dendrites and can be mediated by spine loss restricted to the distal compartment, enough to impact synaptic input integration, somatodendritic backpropagation, and plateau potential generation. This has particular relevance to very early stages of AD in which pathophysiology extends from EC to CA1.</p>

                The retention and use of long-term memories is crucial for adaptive behavior. While stable memories help organisms anticipate outcomes, they may become maladaptive if not updated to reflect new conditions as the environment changes. Accumulating evidence suggests that forgetting reflects altered activation of engram cells, with memories persisting in a latent state rather than being erased. One explanation for the forgetting of particular memories is active competition between memory engrams for expression in the brain. Behavioral studies reveal that various forms of forgetting stem from this competition. Here we synthesize behavioral research through the lens of engram competition, focusing on its biological substrates and driving factors. We propose a framework to better understand diverse forms of natural forgetting as well as associated pathological conditions.

                Noninvasive brain stimulation (NIBS) methods can modulate brain plasticity, the fundamental process by which synaptic connections are strengthened or weakened in response to synaptic activity or external stimuli. This review synthesizes current knowledge regarding how NIBS techniques induce long-lasting synaptic changes resembling long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD). We place special emphasis on metaplasticity, the process by which prior neural activity influences subsequent plasticity responses. We highlight how various stimulation parameters, brain state, and individual differences shape plasticity outcomes, and emphasize the challenges in achieving consistent therapeutic effects. Additionally, we discuss the potential clinical impact of applying metaplasticity concepts in the treatment of neurological and psychiatric disorders. We outline critical areas for future research and emphasize the importance of developing personalized NIBS protocols that are closely aligned with underlying biological mechanisms to improve therapeutic outcomes.

                Chadwick et al. report that intermittent fasting sensitizes leptin signaling in sensory neurons supporting regeneration. This contrasts with a high-fat diet that induces leptin resistance and neuropathy. Leptin promotes regeneration after a spinal cord and sciatic nerve injury via an endocrine or autocrine mechanism by enhancing cAMP and transcription.

                Fei et al. observe enriched motion selectivity in colliculogeniculate boutons in the mouse primary visual thalamus. These collicular boutons often share visual preferences with nearby retinal boutons. Silencing collicular input suppresses visual responses and reduces motion selectivity in thalamic neurons, indicating the significant roles of non-retinal input in shaping thalamic visual representation.

                Cabaj et al. find that the RNA-binding protein PUM1 regulates α-synuclein levels by binding two Pumilio recognition elements in the SNCA 3′ UTR in mice and human neurons. The long SNCA isoform, which contains both PUM1 recognition elements (PREs), is upregulated in Parkinson’s disease and responsive to PUM1 suppression.

Bureaucratic action to punish farmers deters future fires by a further 13%. Thus, using administrator incentives to control crop burning could guide policy towards improving air quality and reducing infant and child mortality.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/105236">Impacts of structural properties of myosin II filaments on force generation</a></h4>

              
                Cells need intracellular forces for their physiological functions, such as migration, cytokinesis, and morphogenesis. The actin cytoskeleton generates a large fraction of the forces via interactions between cytoskeletal components, such as actin filament (F-actin), myosin, and actin cross-linking proteins. Myosin II plays the most important role in cellular force generation. Myosin II molecules self-assemble into filaments with different structures depending on myosin II isoforms and other conditions such as pH and ionic concentration. It has remained elusive how force generation in actomyosin structures is affected by the architecture of myosin II filaments. In this study, we employed an agent-based model to investigate the effects of the structural properties of myosin II filaments on force generation in disorganized actomyosin structures. We demonstrated that the magnitude of forces and the efficiency of force generation can vary over a wide range depending on the number and spatial distribution of myosin II filaments. Further, we showed that the number of myosin heads and the length of a bare zone at the center of myosin II filaments without heads highly affect the force generation process in bundles and networks. Our study provides insights into understanding the roles of the structural properties of myosin II filaments in actomyosin contractility.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96908">CD81+ senescent-like fibroblasts exaggerate inflammation and activate neutrophils via C3/C3aR1 axis in periodontitis</a></h4>

              
                Periodontitis, a prevalent inflammatory disease worldwide, poses a significant economic burden on society and the country. Previous research has established a connection between cellular senescence and periodontitis. However, the role and mechanism of cell senescence in the progression of periodontitis have not been thoroughly investigated. This study aimed to explore the involvement of cellular senescence in the pathogenesis of periodontitis and determine the underlying mechanisms. Our findings demonstrated that senescent cells accumulated during the progress of periodontitis in both human samples and mice models. Moreover, several scRNA-seq analyses suggested that gingival fibroblasts were the main cell population undergoing cellular senescence during human periodontitis, which helps mitigate tissue damage and bone loss. Furthermore, we identified a high expression of CD81 in the senescent gingival fibroblast population. These cells were found to actively contribute to inflammation through their potent pro-inflammatory metabolic activity and secretion of senescence-associated secretory phenotype factors. Additionally, they recruited neutrophils via the C3/C3aR1 pathway, indirectly sustaining the inflammatory response. Senolytics via Navitoclax successfully alleviated inflammation and bone loss in periodontitis, and administration of metformin could alleviate inflammation and bone loss in periodontitis through inhibiting cellular senescence. These results provide valuable insights into the cellular and molecular basis of periodontitis-induced tissue damage, highlighting the significance of fibroblast senescence. In conclusion, our study sheds light on the relationship between CD81 and cellular senescence, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target for periodontitis.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/105318">PRMT1-mediated metabolic reprogramming promotes leukemogenesis</a></h4>

              
                Copious expression of protein arginine methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1) is associated with poor survival in many types of cancers, including acute myeloid leukemia. We observed that a specific acute megakaryocytic leukemia (AMKL) cell line (6133) derived from RBM15-MKL1 knock-in mice exhibited heterogeneity in Prmt1 expression levels. Interestingly, only a subpopulation of 6133 cells expressing high levels of Prmt1 caused leukemia when transplanted into congenic mice. The PRMT1 inhibitor, MS023, effectively cured this PRMT1-driven leukemia. Seahorse analysis revealed that PRMT1 increased the extracellular acidification rate and decreased the oxygen consumption rate. Consistently, PRMT1 accelerated glucose consumption and led to the accumulation of lactic acid in the leukemia cells. The metabolomic analysis supported that PRMT1 stimulated the intracellular accumulation of lipids, which was further validated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis with BODIPY 493/503. In line with fatty acid accumulation, PRMT1 downregulated the protein level of CPT1A, which is involved in the rate-limiting step of fatty acid oxidation. Furthermore, administering the glucose analog 2-deoxy-<span class="small-caps">D</span>-glucose delayed AMKL progression and promoted cell differentiation. Ectopic expression of Cpt1a rescued the proliferation of 6133 cells ectopically expressing PRMT1 in the glucose-minus medium. In conclusion, PRMT1 upregulates glycolysis and downregulates fatty acid oxidation to enhance the proliferation capability of AMKL cells.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/105834">Transcriptional dynamics uncover the role of BNIP3 in mitophagy during muscle remodeling in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Differentiated muscle cells contain myofibrils and well-organized organelles, enabling powerful contractions. Muscle cell reorganization occurs in response to various physiological stimuli; however, the mechanisms behind this remodeling remain enigmatic due to the lack of a genetically trackable system. Previously, we reported that a subset of larval muscle cells is remodeled into adult abdominal muscle through an autophagy-dependent mechanism in <i>Drosophila</i>. To unveil the underlying mechanisms of this remodeling, we performed a comparative time-course RNA-seq analysis of isolated muscle cells with or without autophagy. It revealed both transcriptional dynamics independent of autophagy and highlighted the significance of BNIP3-mediated mitophagy in muscle remodeling. Mechanistically, we found that BNIP3 recruits autophagic machinery to mitochondria through its LC3-interacting motif and minimal essential region, which interact with Atg8a and Atg18a, respectively. Loss of BNIP3 leads to a substantial accumulation of larval mitochondria, ultimately impairing muscle remodeling. In summary, this study demonstrates that BNIP3-dependent mitophagy is critical for orchestrating the dynamic process of muscle remodeling.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100890">A pair of dopaminergic neurons DAN-c1 mediate Drosophila larval aversive olfactory learning through D2-like receptors</a></h4>

              
                The intricate relationship between the dopaminergic system and olfactory associative learning in <i>Drosophila</i> has been an intense scientific inquiry. Leveraging the formidable genetic tools, we conducted a screening of 57 dopaminergic drivers, leading to the discovery of DAN-c1 driver, uniquely targeting a pair of dopaminergic neurons (DANs) in the larval brain. While the involvement of excitatory D1-like receptors is well established, the role of D2-like receptors (D2Rs) remains underexplored. Our investigation reveals the expression of D2Rs in both DANs and the mushroom body (MB) of third-instar larval brains. Silencing D2Rs in DAN-c1 via microRNA disrupts aversive learning, further supported by optogenetic activation of DAN-c1 during training, affirming the inhibitory role of D2R autoreceptor. Intriguingly, D2R knockdown in the MB impairs both appetitive and aversive learning. These findings elucidate the distinct contributions of D2Rs in diverse brain structures, providing novel insights into the molecular mechanisms governing associative learning in <i>Drosophila</i> larvae.

">Experience-dependent reconfiguration of receptors at a sensory compartment regulates neuronal plasticity</a></h4>

              
                Neurons continuously adjust their properties as a function of experience. Precise modulation of neuronal responses is achieved by multiple cellular mechanisms that operate over a range of timescales. Primary sensory neurons rapidly adapt their sensitivities via posttranslational mechanisms including regulated trafficking of sensory molecules but also alter their transcriptional profiles on longer timescales to adapt to persistent sensory stimuli. How diverse transcriptional and posttranscriptional pathways are coordinated in individual sensory neurons to accurately adjust their functions and drive behavioral plasticity is unclear. Here we show that temperature experience modulates both transcription and trafficking of thermoreceptors on different timescales in the C. elegans AFD thermosensory neurons to regulate response plasticity. Expression of the PY motif-containing adaptor protein (PYT-1) as well as the GCY-18 warm temperature-responsive guanylyl cyclase thermoreceptor is transcriptionally upregulated in AFD upon a temperature upshift. We find that as GCY-18 begins to accumulate at the AFD sensory endings, the GCY-23 cooler temperature-responsive thermoreceptor9 exhibits altered subcellular localization and increased retrograde trafficking, thereby increasing the functional GCY-18 to GCY-23 ratio in the AFD sensory compartment. Altered GCY-23 localization and trafficking requires PYT-1-dependent endocytosis, and we show that PYT-1-mediated modulation of the GCY-18 to GCY-23 protein ratio at the AFD sensory endings is necessary to shift the AFD response threshold towards warmer values following the temperature upshift. Our results describe a mechanism by which transcriptional and posttranscriptional mechanisms are temporally coordinated across sensory receptors to fine tune experience-dependent plasticity in the response of a single sensory neuron type.

">Astrocytic Regulation of aberrant perineuronal net formation in Mecp2-null Neocortex</a></h4>

              
                Rett syndrome (RTT), caused by mutations in MECP2, is a complex neurological disorder characterized by myriad physiological disruptions, including early closure of the critical period of developmental plasticity and precocious formation of perineuronal nets (PNNs). PNNs are lattice-like substructures of extracellular matrix (ECM) that enwrap specific subpopulations of neurons. PNNs are essential in the modulation of neuronal plasticity and brain maturation, and their enzymatic disruption can partially restore plasticity in adults and improve memory. Although precocious PNN formation is well-established in RTT, little is known of the cellular, molecular, or biochemical underpinnings of their precocious formation, or whether precocious PNN formation is due to cell-autonomous or non-cell-autonomous mechanisms. While PNNs form on subsets of neurons throughout the brain, astrocytes secrete many ECM components that form PNNs, and they play a central role in controlling closure of the critical period. We find that Mecp2-null astrocyte conditioned media induces the expression of the key PNN component Hapln1 and causes enhanced PNN formation on wildtype neurons, suggesting that Mecp2-null astrocytes play a key role in the precocious formation of PNNs in RTT. Further, we identify increased expression of HAPLN1 and other PNN / ECM components in the developing Mecp2-null cortex, and demonstrate that PNNs are structurally and biochemically mature at an earlier developmental stage. These results provide essential insight into the mechanisms and structure of aberrant PNNs in Mecp2-null cortex and identify potential new avenues for targeted rescue or reversal of the precocious closing of the critical period in RTT.

">Neural Oscillations during Perceptual Grouping: Insights from Alpha and Theta Bands in Visual Perception Tasks</a></h4>

              
                Perceptual grouping, the brain ability to organize visual stimuli into coherent objects and patterns, is thought to rely on distinct neural oscillations across various frequency bands. However, the specific contributions of these frequency bands to perceptual grouping remain a central question in cognitive neuroscience. Our study employs spectral analysis and time- frequency analysis techniques to analyze EEG data collected during visual perception tasks. By examining the temporal dynamics and frequency-specific activity, particularly focusing on the alpha and theta bands immediately following stimulus onset, our goal is to uncover the neural processes underlying perceptual grouping. Our findings indicate significant changes in alpha and theta band activity associated with perceptual grouping in the brain. These results suggest that alpha band oscillations may play a role in directing attention and filtering relevant visual information, while theta band oscillations might facilitate the integration of visual elements into coherent percepts by engaging memory processes and enhancing neural communication across brain regions. This research contributes to a deeper understanding of how neural oscillations coordinate to support perceptual organization, potentially informing future studies and therapeutic approaches aimed at enhancing visual perception and cognitive function.

                Local synthesis and action of neuro-estrogen and neuro-androgen (including neuro-estradiol (nE2) and neuro-testosterone (nT) have become recognized as key mechanisms in modulation of neural plasticity and cognitive performance, in addition to the contribution of circulating sex steroids. However, still several methodological problems are left to be solved in order to get an better understanding of functions of neural sex steroids in the brain. Here we describe and discuss important improvements in the methods for determination of accurate concentrations of nE2 and nT in rat hippocampus (Section 1), and in methods for analysis of the dendritic spine density in castrated male rat hippocampus (Section 2). The improvements are discussed in order to solve the following two problems. One problem is that the previously reported nE2 concentrations in the hippocampus were widely distributed between ~3 pg/g tissue and ~2 ng/g tissue (i.e., between ~11 pM and ~7 nM) (Section 1). The other problem is that the degree of decrease in hippocampal spine density by castration in male rat hippocamps was strongly dependent on surgical skills of operators (surgeons) (Section 2).

">BIOPHYSICAL MECHANISMS UNDERLYING THE GENERATION AND MAINTENANCE OF RULE-LEARNING ENGRAM</a></h4>

              
                Training rodents in a particularly difficult olfactory-discrimination task results with acquisition of high skill to perform the task superbly, termed rule-learning. We show that rule-learning occurs abruptly, in a "light bulb moment". Using whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in the piriform cortex of Fos2A-iCreER/TRAP2 mice, we targeted activated neurons, expressing immediate early genes (IEG). From the onset of training, IEG-positive neurons from trained animals display enhanced intrinsic excitability. Subsequently, synaptic excitation and inhibition is enhanced in these neurons, in a coordinated, cell-wide process. In parallel, the density of IEG-expressing neurons sharply declines. Double labeling with TRAP and c-Fos reveals that nearly two-thirds of the rule-memory engram neurons were engaged from the beginning of training. Silencing TRAP-expressing neurons using DREADDs leads to a complete loss of rule memory. We propose that rule learning occurs at a discrete moment, and is developed through a gradual process that stabilizes the memory of the rule.

">Guided by Noise: Correlated Variability Channels Task-Relevant Information in Sensory Neurons</a></h4>

              
                Shared trial-to-trial variability across sensory neurons is reliably reduced when perceptual performance improves, yet this variability is low-dimensional, so it could be ignored by an optimal readout mechanism. Why then is it so consistently related to behavior? We propose that shared variability reflects the information communicated to downstream areas, rather than noise to be avoided. Using a circuit model, we show that when sensory signals align with shared variability, behaviorally relevant information is amplified without compromising coding fidelity. Analyses of neural population recordings from multiple brain areas and tasks reveal that the dominant axis of shared variability consistently aligns with task-relevant stimulus features and action plans. Finally, the behavioral impact of microstimulation can be explained by the extent to which it changes projections onto the shared variability axis. These findings suggest that shared variability may illuminate, rather than obscure, the neural dimensions that guide behavior.

                Intracortical brain-computer interfaces (iBCIs) for decoding intended speech have provided individuals with ALS and severe dysarthria an intuitive method for high-throughput communication. These advances have been demonstrated in individuals who are still able to vocalize and move speech articulators. Here, we decoded intended speech from an individual with longstanding anarthria, locked-in syndrome, and ventilator dependence due to advanced symptoms of ALS. We found that phonemes, words, and higher-order language units could be decoded well above chance. While sentence decoding accuracy was below that of demonstrations in participants with dysarthria, we are able to attain an extensive characterization of the neural signals underlying speech in a person with locked-in syndrome and through our results identify several directions for future improvement. These include closed-loop speech imagery training and decoding linguistic (rather than phonemic) units from neural signals in middle precentral gyrus. Overall, these results demonstrate that speech decoding from motor cortex may be feasible in people with anarthria and ventilator dependence. For individuals with longstanding anarthria, a purely phoneme-based decoding approach may lack the accuracy necessary to support independent use as a primary means of communication; however, additional linguistic information embedded within neural signals may provide a route to augment the performance of speech decoders.

">Disentangling the influences of pre- and postnatal periods on human cortical microstructure</a></h4>

              
                During late gestation and early postnatal development a combination of intrinsic and extrinsic factors drive the maturation of the human cortex. This process is regionally heterogeneous, with cortical areas developing at different paces and trajectories. Leveraging submillimetre T1-weighted/T2w-weighted (T1w/T2w) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) from pre- and full-term neonates (n = 599, 0-7 weeks), we sampled intracortical microstructure profiles across the cortex and characterised the profiles' shapes according to their central moments. We found that gestational age at birth dominated the effects on early cortical development, with significant, global increases in microstructural density, increasing intracortical homogeneity and a bimodal change of the microstructural balance between superficial and deeper cortical layers. On the other hand, weeks since birth (i.e. postnatal age) exhibited different effects on microstructure, with density increasing at a slower pace, increasing intracortical heterogeneity, and intracortical balance only shifting towards deeper layers in posterior temporal, occipital, medial parietal areas and some prefrontal areas. These effects align with low spatial-frequency geometric eigenmodes of the human cortex, specifically the anterior-posterior, superior-inferior and central-polar axes. Our findings demonstrate that separating prenatal from postnatal influences, and analysing intracortical profiles rather than macroscale features, provides finer-grained insights into how human cortical microstructure changes during perinatal development and lays the groundwork for investigating the biological underpinnings that govern normative cortical maturation.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Making context-dependent decisions incurs cognitive costs. Cognitive control studies have investigated the nature of such costs from both computational and neural perspectives. In this paper, we offer an information-theoretic account of the costs associated with context-dependent decisions. According to this account, the brain’s limited capacity to store context-dependent policies necessitates “compression” of policies into internal representations with an upper bound on codelength, quantified by an information-theoretic measure (policy complexity). These representations are decoded into actions by sequentially inspecting each bit, such that longer codes take more time to decode. When a response deadline is imposed, the account predicts that policy complexity should increase with the deadline. Higher policy complexity is associated with several behavioral signatures: (i) higher accuracy; (ii) lower variability; and (iii) lower perseveration. Analyzing electroencephalograpy data from a rule-based action selection task, we found evidence supporting all of these predictions. We further hypothesized that complex policies require higher neural dimensionality (which constrains the code space). Consistent with this hypothesis, we found that policy complexity correlates with a measure of neural dimensionality in a rule-based decision task. This finding brings us a step closer to understanding the neural implementation of policy compression and its implications for cognitive control.</span>

Shape analysis offers a sensitive approach to detecting subtle alterations, and when applied across variants, may reveal distinct neuroanatomical signatures. We acquired anatomical magnetic resonance imaging scans from 104 children with Noonan syndrome spectrum (ages 5 to 17, mean = 10.0) and 80 age- and sex-matched typically developing children (ages 4 to 16, mean = 9.54). Our comprehensive analysis examined local thickness and surface dilation/contraction (Jacobian), including genetic variant-specific analyses.

                <p>Interoception and associated subjective states shape adaptive behaviors. In humans, interoceptive information is hierarchically processed in the insular cortex (IC), being integrated first in the posterior IC (PIC) and then processed in the anterior IC (AIC) to generate subjective states. However, it has not been established whether this is the case in other species nor whether utilization of interoceptive states to guide behavior is also specifically associated with functional engagement of the AIC, as suggested by this hierarchical model. We investigated in male Sprague Dawley rats whether the use of pharmacologically induced internal states to guide instrumental behavior in a discrimination task functionally engages the AIC as opposed to the mere experience of such states. Rats trained to use the interoceptive state produced by the centrally acting GABA<SUB>A</SUB> receptor antagonist pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) or the peripherally acting &beta;-adrenoreceptor agonist isoproterenol to guide their behavior performed as well in a discrimination task as those trained to use an exteroceptive visual discriminative stimulus. While interoceptive internal states were as potent as exteroceptive cues to guide instrumental behavior, only the former were associated with an increase in mRNA levels of the cellular plasticity marker, zif268 in the PIC, as assessed using qPCR. In contrast, zif268 mRNA levels increased in the AIC only after rats had used PTZ-induced interoceptive states to guide behavior, not simply in response to PTZ administration. These results show that in rats, the utilization of interoceptive states to guide behavior is associated with functional engagement of the AIC.</p>

                <p>Despite the vivid experience of homogeneous vision, our visual system is inherently endowed with highly inhomogeneous structures. Although the temporal characteristics of visual responses vary with eccentricity, the connection between this variation, the speed of visual processing, and its underlying neurophysiological mechanisms remains a topic of debate. Here, we performed simultaneous recordings of high-precision gaze positions and EEG activity to investigate how foveal and perifoveal stimulations impact reaction times (RTs) and visual evoked potentials (VEPs). Volunteers discriminated the position and orientation of a U-shaped figure with the aperture facing either upward or downward. Stimuli were presented briefly (50 ms) either in the foveola (0.33&deg;) or perifovea (6.5&deg;), to the right or left of the fixation point. Stimulus size in the perifovea condition was adjusted according to the cortical magnification factor (stimulus size: 0.2&deg; and 0.75&deg; for the foveola and perifovea conditions, respectively). When stimuli were equated for sensitivity and cortical area of stimulation, we observed faster RTs in the perifovea condition (16.8 &plusmn; 4 ms) compared to the foveola. The analysis of the VEP revealed a similar effect for the N1 response (11.0 &plusmn; 4 ms), a parieto-occipital component associated with discriminative processing and influenced by spatial attention. Overall, our findings suggest that visual discrimination speeds vary across eccentricities, with faster processing and shorter latency of early visual responses in the perifovea compared to the foveola.</p>

                <p>by Sunyoung Park, John T. Serences</p>

Top-down feedback from prefrontal cortex (PFC) can enhance the gain of feature selective neurons in early sensory areas that are tuned to behaviorally relevant stimuli (termed <i>feature-based attention</i>). Importantly, feature-based attention can even modulate the gain of neurons that do not respond directly to the spatial location of the relevant stimulus, a phenomenon that is thought to globally prime sensitivity to detect relevant features – irrespective of their location – during visual search. However, the neurons in PFC that are thought to provide top-down feedback typically have high-dimensional tuning for multiple features, so it is unclear how feedback selectively modulates responses in neurons tuned to a relevant stimulus without incidentally causing interference by co-modulating neurons tuned to irrelevant features. To investigate this issue, we adapted a spiking neural network model with a first ‘sensory’ layer composed of neurons selective for single features. Neurons in a second ‘control’ layer formed random and reciprocal connections with different sensory neurons, giving rise to PFC-like high-dimensional feature tuning. Stimulating second layer neurons that responded robustly to a relevant stimulus led to corresponding gain modulations in sensory neurons that were directly driven by a relevant stimulus. Importantly, no spurious stimulus-like representations arose in unstimulated sensory neurons – despite high-dimensional tuning in second layer neurons – because the random connections averaged out feedback targeted on irrelevant features. Next, we show that subtly increasing the probability that similarly tuned sensory neurons converge on the same second layer neurons can yield most of the noise-cancelling benefits of completely random connections while simultaneously producing spatially global feature-selective modulations in unstimulated sensory neurons. Collectively, these results suggest that a delicate balance between randomness and structure can support top-down feedback signals that globally enhance sensory neurons tuned to relevant features, without leading to spurious stimulus representations that might interfere with perceptual processing.

                <p>by Eric C. Dykeman</p>

Efficient functioning of the prokaryotic translational system depends on a steady supply of aminoacylated tRNAs to be delivered to translating ribosomes via ternary complex. As such, tRNA synthetases play a crucial role in maintaining efficient and accurate translation in the cell, as they are responsible for aminoacylating the correct amino acid to its corresponding tRNA. Moreover, the kinetic rate at which they perform this reaction will dictate the overall rate of supply of aminoacylated tRNAs to the ribosome and will have consequences for the average translational speed of ribosomes in the cell. In this work, I develop an empirical kinetic model for the 20 aminoacyl tRNA synthetase enzymes in <i>E. coli</i> enabling the study of the effects of tRNA charging dynamics on translational efficiency. The model is parametrised based on <i>in vitro</i> experimental measurements of substrate <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> and <i>k</i><sub>cat</sub> values for both pyrophosphate exchange and aminoacylation. The model also reproduces the burst kinetics observed in class I enzymes and the transfer rates measured in single turnover experiments. Stochastic simulation of <i>in vivo</i> translation shows the kinetic model is able to support the tRNA charging demand resulting from translation in exponentially growing <i>E. coli</i> cells at a variety of different doubling times. This work provides a basis for the theoretical study of the amino acid starvation and the stringent response, as well as the complex behaviour of tRNA charging and translational dynamics in response to cellular stresses.

                <p>by Tomoko Sakiyama, Akihiro Takahara</p>

Many studies have proposed spatial game theory on network systems. Heterogeneous structures seem to contribute to population dynamics. However, few studies have addressed both dynamical population evolution and network growth events, especially incorporating individual players’ decision-making processes into the model. In this study, we considered a spatial prisoner’s dilemma (SPD) on a random network. In our model, the players were allowed to access the recent past information on themselves and neighboring players. In the “unlikely to happen” scenario, players adopted a strategy that rarely happens, which may have brought some risks to players. Moreover, the players in our model evolved their link with other players by altering their neighborhood when they received a low payoff. As a result, we found that our model spontaneously evolved as an approximate scale-free network around a critical parameter. Interestingly, hub players sometimes decreased their node degree; thus, these players are changeable in our system.

A mechanistic understanding of how intracellular pathogens evade the intrinsic defenses of their host cells could open up intriguing therapeutic opportunities. Here, we applied a genome-wide genetic screening approach to investigate the nature of the defensive host cell death response suppressed by the membrane trafficking modulator CpoS, an effector protein secreted by the obligate intracellular bacterial pathogen <i>Chlamydia trachomatis</i>. Initially, this work revealed a CpoS-deficient mutant to exhibit a markedly increased dependence on host cellular synthesis of ceramides, the precursors of complex sphingolipids. Using novel microscopic reporters, we then established CpoS’ role in defense evasion to occur by preserving the integrity of <i>Chlamydia</i>’s parasitophorous vacuole (the inclusion) via ensuring an adequate sphingolipid supply. More specifically, we observed CpoS deficiency to destabilize inclusions, initially characterized by a release of individual bacteria into the host cell cytosol, then followed by inclusion rupture concomitant with host cell death. Exogenous addition of sphingosine stabilized CpoS-deficient inclusions, whereas disruption of host cellular ceramide synthesis destabilized wild-type inclusions. In combination, CpoS deficiency and impaired ceramide synthesis – presumably disrupting both <i>Chlamydia</i>’s vesicular and non-vesicular sphingolipid supply routes – destabilized inclusions even earlier, resulting in infection clearance and host cell survival rather than host cell death. Overall, this study highlights how the vacuolar pathogen <i>C. trachomatis</i> maintains vacuole integrity by ensuring a steady sphingolipid supply, potentially offering inspiration and directions for future therapeutic strategies targeting parasitophorous vacuoles.

                Noxious heat sensation involves multiple molecular receptors that operate under complex regulatory mechanisms. In a recent study, Gao, Yan, and colleagues identified Copine-6 as a calcium-sensitive phospholipid-binding protein that promotes TRPM3 trafficking to the plasma membrane in thermal sensory neurons and thereby enhances noxious heat sensitivity in mice. These findings expand current understanding of the mechanisms regulating thermal sensation.

                The regulation of type I interferon signaling is essential for fine-tuning innate immunity against infections, cancer, and autoimmunity. Xu et al. uncover how PARP7 suppresses this pathway through mono-ADP-ribosylation of STAT1/STAT2, leading to their degradation. Inhibiting PARP7 restores interferon activity, offering a potential therapeutic approach for multiple sclerosis.

                Fu et al. revealed that H4K20me2 facilitated the recruitment of 53BP1 on E2F7 TSS in unstressed cells. 53BP1 could inhibit p53 binding on E2F7 TSS through modulating epigenetic modifications status. 53BP1 depletion led to p53-E2F7 upregulation and FANC genes downregulation, which promoted the cellular sensitivity to ICLs.

                Testen et al. show that rat cocaine self-administration leads to decreased nucleus accumbens astrocyte branching, which occurs by CR3-mediated engulfment of astrocyte membranes by microglia. Results indicate that microglial pruning of astrocytes is a biological phenomenon that is increased across cocaine abstinence and contributes to prolonged vulnerability to cocaine use.

                Valbuena et al. investigate how parvalbumin (PV) and principal neuron (PN) subpopulations affect hippocampal memory formation and consolidation. They show that Syt2+PV+ interneurons are required during an early time window to allocate the proper PN subpopulation to forming memory ensembles, whereas Syt2−/PV+ are required subsequently to consolidate and retrieve memories.

                Brown et al. demonstrate methods for large-scale voltage imaging of inhibitory interneurons in the cerebellum of awake mice. Optical voltage recordings show that sensory input synchronizes interneurons on a millisecond timescale, with synchronization covarying with movement. Briefly photostimulating interneurons drives movement, suggesting a causal role of synchrony in motor control.
