	<p>Idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) is the most common form of hydrocephalus in the adult population, and is often treated with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) drainage using a ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt. Symptoms of iNPH include gait impairment, cognitive decline, and urinary incontinence. The pathophysiology behind the symptoms of iNPH is still unknown, and no reliable biomarkers have been established to date. The aim of this study was to investigate the possible use of the oxysterols as biomarkers in this disease. CSF levels of the oxysterols 24S- and 27-hydroxycholesterol, as well as the major metabolite of 27-hydroxycholesterol, 7 alpha hydroxy-3-oxo-4-cholestenoic acid (7HOCA), were measured in iNPH-patients before and after treatment with a VP-shunt. Corresponding measurements were also performed in healthy controls. VP-shunt treatment significantly increased the levels of 7HOCA and 24S-hydroxycholesterol in CSF (p = 0.014 and p = 0.037, respectively). The results are discussed in relation to the beneficial effects of VP-shunt treatment. Furthermore, the possibility that CSF drainage may reduce an inhibitory effect of transiently increased pressure on the metabolic capacity of neuronal cells in the brain is discussed. This capacity includes the elimination of cholesterol by the 24S-hydroxylase mechanisms.</p>

	<p>There is large intersubject variability in cerebrovascular hemodynamic and systemic physiological responses induced by a verbal fluency task (VFT) under colored light exposure (CLE). We hypothesized that machine learning would enable us to classify the response patterns and provide new insights into the common response patterns between subjects. In total, 32 healthy subjects (15 men and 17 women, age: 25.5 &amp;amp;plusmn; 4.3 years) were exposed to two different light colors (red vs. blue) in a randomized cross-over study design for 9 min while performing a VFT. We used the systemic physiology augmented functional near-infrared spectroscopy (SPA-fNIRS) approach to measure cerebrovascular hemodynamics and oxygenation at the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and visual cortex (VC) concurrently with systemic physiological parameters. We found that subjects were suitably classified by unsupervised machine learning into different groups according to the changes in the following parameters: end-tidal carbon dioxide, arterial oxygen saturation, skin conductance, oxygenated hemoglobin in the VC, and deoxygenated hemoglobin in the PFC. With hard clustering methods, three and five different groups of subjects were found for the blue and red light exposure, respectively. Our results highlight the fact that humans show specific reactivity types to the CLE-VFT experimental paradigm.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Regulation of Diacylglycerol Content in Olfactory Neurons Determines Forgetting or Retrieval of Olfactory Memory in Caenorhabditis elegans</a></h4>

              
                <p>Proper management of memories by forgetting and retrieval is essential for animals to adapt their behavior to changing environments. To elucidate the mechanisms underlying forgetting, we use olfactory learning to an attractive odorant, diacetyl, in <I>Caenorhabditis elegans</I> hermaphrodites as a model. In this learning paradigm, the TIR-1/JNK-1 pathway in AWC sensory neurons accelerates forgetting of the olfactory memory, which is stored as a sensory memory trace in AWA sensory neurons. Our genetic screening revealed that increased neuronal diacylglycerol in the olfactory neuronal circuit, by mutations in diacylglycerol kinase-1, <I>egl-30</I> or <I>goa-1</I>, Gq and Go type G-proteins, suppresses the forgetting defect in the behavior of <I>tir-1</I> mutants, although the calcium imaging analyses of the olfactory neurons revealed that the sensory memory trace to the odorant was maintained. In contrast, the expression of a gain-of-function <I>goa-1</I> gene exclusively in AWC neurons caused a forgetting defect in behavior, although their sensory memory trace declined. Furthermore, the behavioral analysis of animals applied with diacylglycerol analog and measurement of diacylglycerol content by fluorescent imaging suggested that diacylglycerol content in AWC is important for the proper forgetting. These findings raise a possibility that diacylglycerol signaling plays a crucial role in determining whether to forget or to recall in olfactory learning.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Forgetting and retrieval are important processes for proper management of memories, although the mechanisms underlying these processes remain largely unclear. We found that, in <I>Caenorhabditis elegans</I>, diacylglycerol signaling works in a forgetting mechanism downstream of TIR-1/JNK-1 pathway. Mutations that change diacylglycerol content in the olfactory neurons affect behavioral forgetting, although they did not alter the sensory memory trace. This suggests that diacylglycerol in specific neurons may determine the occurrence of retrieving, rather than modifying, the memory traces. Consistent with this hypothesis, application of diacylglycerol analog to animals suggests that diacylglycerol content until memory acquisition decides whether to retrieve or to forget the memory.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Axon Initial Segments Are Required for Efficient Motor Neuron Axon Regeneration and Functional Recovery of Synapses</a></h4>

              
                <p>The axon initial segment (AIS) generates action potentials and maintains neuronal polarity by regulating the differential trafficking and distribution of proteins, transport vesicles, and organelles. Injury and disease can disrupt the AIS, and the subsequent loss of clustered ion channels and polarity mechanisms may alter neuronal excitability and function. However, the impact of AIS disruption on axon regeneration after injury is unknown. We generated male and female mice with AIS-deficient multipolar motor neurons by deleting AnkyrinG, the master scaffolding protein required for AIS assembly and maintenance. We found that after nerve crush, neuromuscular junction reinnervation was significantly delayed in AIS-deficient motor neurons compared with control mice. In contrast, loss of AnkyrinG from pseudo-unipolar sensory neurons did not impair axon regeneration into the intraepidermal nerve fiber layer. Even after AIS-deficient motor neurons reinnervated the neuromuscular junction, they failed to functionally recover because of reduced synaptic vesicle protein 2 at presynaptic terminals. In addition, mRNA trafficking was disrupted in AIS-deficient axons. Our results show that, after nerve injury, an intact AIS is essential for efficient regeneration and functional recovery of axons in multipolar motor neurons. Our results also suggest that loss of polarity in AIS-deficient motor neurons impairs the delivery of axonal proteins, mRNAs, and other cargoes necessary for regeneration. Thus, therapeutic strategies for axon regeneration must consider preservation or reassembly of the AIS.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Disruption of the axon initial segment is a common event after nervous system injury. For multipolar motor neurons, we show that axon initial segments are essential for axon regeneration and functional recovery after injury. Our results may help explain injuries where axon regeneration fails, and suggest strategies to promote more efficient axon regeneration.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">{micro}-Opioid Receptor Activation Reduces Glutamate Release in the PreBo&#x0308;tzinger Complex in Organotypic Slice Cultures</a></h4>

              
                <p>The inspiratory rhythm generator, located in the brainstem preBo&#x0308;tzinger complex (preBo&#x0308;tC), is dependent on glutamatergic signaling and is affected profoundly by opioids. Here, we used organotypic slice cultures of the newborn mouse brainstem of either sex in combination with genetically encoded sensors for Ca<sup>2+</sup>, glutamate, and GABA to visualize Ca<sup>2+</sup>, glutamatergic and GABAergic signaling during spontaneous rhythm and in the presence of DAMGO. During spontaneous rhythm, the glutamate sensor SF-iGluSnFR.A184S revealed punctate synapse-like fluorescent signals along dendrites and somas in the preBo&#x0308;tC with decay times that were prolonged by the glutamate uptake blocker (TFB-TBOA). The GABA sensor iGABASnFR showed a more diffuse fluorescent signal during spontaneous rhythm. Rhythmic Ca<sup>2+</sup>- and glutamate transients had an inverse relationship between the spontaneous burst frequency and the burst amplitude of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> and glutamate signals. A similar inverse relationship was observed when bath applied DAMGO reduced spontaneous burst frequency and increased the burst amplitude of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, glutamate, and GABA transient signals. However, a hypoxic challenge reduced both burst frequency and Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient amplitude. Using a cocktail that blocked glutamatergic, GABAergic, and glycinergic transmission to indirectly measure the release of glutamate/GABA in response to an electrical stimulus, we found that DAMGO reduces the release of glutamate in the preBo&#x0308;tC but has no effect on GABA release. This suggest that the opioid mediated slowing of respiratory rhythm involves presynaptic reduction of glutamate release, which would impact the ability of the network to engage in recurrent excitation, and may result in the opioid-induced slowing of inspiratory rhythm.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Opioids slow down breathing rhythm by affecting neurons in the preBo&#x0308;tzinger complex (preBo&#x0308;tC) and other brainstem regions. Here, we used cultured slices of the preBo&#x0308;tC to better understand this effect by optically recording Ca<sup>2+</sup>, glutamate, and GABA transients during preBo&#x0308;tC activity. Spontaneous rhythm showed an inverse relationship between burst frequency and burst amplitude in the Ca<sup>2+</sup> and glutamate signals. Application of the opioid DAMGO slowed the rhythm, with a concomitant increase in Ca<sup>2+</sup>, glutamate, and GABA signals. When rhythm was blocked pharmacologically, DAMGO reduced the presynaptic release of glutamate, but not GABA. These data suggest the mechanism of action of opioids involves presynaptic reduction of glutamate release, which may play an important role in the opioid-induced slowing of inspiratory rhythm.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">The Tail of the Mouse Striatum Contains a Novel Large Type of GABAergic Neuron Incorporated in a Unique Disinhibitory Pathway That Relays Auditory Signals to Subcortical Nuclei</a></h4>

              
                <p>The most caudal part of the striatum in rodents, the tail of the striatum (TS), has many features that distinguish it from the rostral striatum, such as its biased distributions of dopamine receptor subtypes, lack of striosomes and matrix compartmentalization, and involvement in sound-driven behaviors. However, information regarding the TS is still limited. We demonstrate in this article that the TS of the male mouse contains GABAergic neurons of a novel type that were detected immunohistochemically with the neurofilament marker SMI-32. Their somata were larger than cholinergic giant aspiny neurons, were located in a narrow space adjacent to the globus pallidus (GP), and extended long dendrites laterally toward the intermediate division (ID) of the trilaminar part of the TS, the region targeted by axons from the primary auditory cortex (A1). Although vesicular glutamate transporter 1-positive cortical axon terminals rarely contacted these TS large (TSL) neurons, glutamic acid decarboxylase-immunoreactive and enkephalin-immunoreactive boutons densely covered somata and dendrites of TSL neurons, forming symmetrical synapses. Analyses of GAD67-CrePR knock-in mice revealed that these axonal boutons originated from nearby medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in the ID. All MSNs examined in the ID in turn received inputs from the A1. Retrograde tracers injected into the rostral zona incerta and ventral medial nucleus of the thalamus labeled somata of TSL neurons. TSL neurons share many morphological features with GP neurons, but their strategically located dendrites receive inputs from closely located MSNs in the ID, suggesting faster responses than distant GP neurons to facilitate auditory-evoked, prompt disinhibition in their targets.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> This study describes a newly found population of neurons in the mouse striatum, the brain region responsible for appropriate behaviors. They are large GABAergic neurons located in the most caudal part of the striatum [tail of the striatum (TS)]. These TS large (TSL) neurons extended dendrites toward a particular region of the TS where axons from the primary auditory cortex (A1) terminated. These dendrites received direct synaptic inputs heavily from nearby GABAergic neurons of the striatum that in turn received inputs from the A1. TSL neurons sent axons to two subcortical regions outside basal ganglia, one of which is related to arousal. Specialized connectivity of TSL neurons suggests prompt disinhibitory actions on their targets to facilitate sound-evoked characteristic behaviors.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Organization of Cortical and Thalamic Input to Inhibitory Neurons in Mouse Motor Cortex</a></h4>

              
                <p>Intracortical inhibition in motor cortex (M1) regulates movement and motor learning. If cortical and thalamic inputs target different inhibitory cell types in different layers, then these afferents may play different roles in regulating M1 output. Using mice of both sexes, we quantified input to two main classes of M1 interneurons, parvalbumin+ (PV+) cells and somatostatin+ (SOM+) cells, using monosynaptic rabies tracing. We then compared anatomic and functional connectivity based on synaptic strength from sensory cortex and thalamus. Functionally, each input innervated M1 interneurons with a unique laminar profile. Different interneuron types were excited in a distinct, complementary manner, suggesting feedforward inhibition proceeds selectively via distinct circuits. Specifically, somatosensory cortex (S1) inputs primarily targeted PV+ neurons in upper layers (L2/3) but SOM+ neurons in middle layers (L5). Somatosensory thalamus [posterior nucleus (PO)] inputs targeted PV+ neurons in middle layers (L5). In contrast to sensory cortical areas, thalamic input to SOM+ neurons was equivalent to that of PV+ neurons. Thus, long-range excitatory inputs target inhibitory neurons in an area and a cell type-specific manner, which contrasts with input to neighboring pyramidal cells. In contrast to feedforward inhibition providing generic inhibitory tone in cortex, circuits are selectively organized to recruit inhibition matched to incoming excitatory circuits.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> M1 integrates sensory information and frontal cortical inputs to plan and control movements. Although inputs to excitatory cells are described, the synaptic circuits by which these inputs drive specific types of M1 interneurons are unknown. Anatomical results with rabies tracing and physiological quantification of synaptic strength shows that two main classes of inhibitory cells (PV+ and SOM+ interneurons) both receive substantial cortical and thalamic input, in contrast to interneurons in sensory areas (where thalamic input strongly prefers PV+ interneurons). Further, each input studied targets PV+ and SOM+ interneurons in a different fashion, suggesting that separate, specific circuits exist for recruitment of feedforward inhibition.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Pharmacological Manipulations of Physiological Arousal and Sleep-Like Slow Waves Modulate Sustained Attention</a></h4>

              
                <p>Sustained attention describes our ability to keep a constant focus on a given task. This ability is modulated by our physiological state of arousal. Although lapses of sustained attention have been linked with dysregulations of arousal, the underlying physiological mechanisms remain unclear. An emerging body of work proposes that the intrusion during wakefulness of sleep-like slow waves, a marker of the transition toward sleep, could mechanistically account for attentional lapses. This study aimed to expose, via pharmacological manipulations of the monoamine system, the relationship between the occurrence of sleep-like slow waves and the behavioral consequences of sustained attention failures. In a double-blind, randomized-control trial, 32 healthy human male participants received methylphenidate, atomoxetine, citalopram or placebo during four separate experimental sessions. During each session, electroencephalography (EEG) was used to measure neural activity while participants completed a visual task requiring sustained attention. Methylphenidate, which increases wake-promoting dopamine and noradrenaline across cortical and subcortical areas, improved behavioral performance whereas atomoxetine, which increases dopamine and noradrenaline predominantly over frontal cortices, led to more impulsive responses. Additionally, citalopram, which increases sleep-promoting serotonin, led to more missed trials. Based on EEG recording, citalopram was also associated with an increase in sleep-like slow waves. Importantly, compared with a classical marker of arousal such as &alpha; power, only slow waves differentially predicted both misses and faster responses in a region-specific fashion. These results suggest that a decrease in arousal can lead to local sleep intrusions during wakefulness which could be mechanistically linked to impulsivity and sluggishness.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> We investigated whether the modulation of attention and arousal could not only share the same neuromodulatory pathways but also rely on similar neuronal mechanisms; for example, the intrusion of sleep-like activity within wakefulness. To do so, we pharmacologically manipulated noradrenaline, dopamine, and serotonin in a four-arm, randomized, placebo-controlled trial and examined the consequences on behavioral and electroencephalography (EEG) indices of attention and arousal. We showed that sleep-like slow waves can predict opposite behavioral signatures: impulsivity and sluggishness. Slow waves may be a candidate mechanism for the occurrence of attentional lapses since the relationship between slow-wave occurrence and performance is region-specific and the consequences of these local sleep intrusions are in line with the cognitive functions carried by the underlying brain regions.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Dissociation between Attention-Dependent and Spatially Specific Illusory Shape Responses within the Topographic Areas of the Posterior Parietal Cortex</a></h4>

              
                <p>The human visual system consists of multiple topographic maps that extend from the early visual cortex (EVC) along the dorsal and ventral processing streams. Responses to illusory shapes within these maps have been demonstrated in the ventral stream areas, in particular the lateral occipital complex (LOC). Recently, the intraparietal sulcus (IPS) of the dorsal stream has been linked to the processing of illusory shapes defined by motion. It remains unclear whether the topographically organized parietal areas also respond to stationary illusory shapes, which would suggest their generic role in representing illusory content. In the current study we measured brain responses using fMRI while 30 human participants (12 male) observed flickering inducers around the fixation task. The inducers either formed an illusory diamond in the center, a triangle in the left or right hemifield, or were inverted such that no illusory figure was formed. We compared responses of parietal regions IPS0-IPS5 and SPL1 to each illusory figure with the nonillusory condition. To determine the role of attentional modulation on illusory shape responses we manipulated the difficulty of the fixation task. Our results show that all IPS areas responded to illusory shapes. The more posterior areas IPS0&ndash;IPS3 additionally displayed a preference toward contralateral shapes, while the more anterior areas IPS4 and IPS5 showed response attenuation with increased task difficulty. We suggest that the IPS can represent illusory content generated not only by moving, but also by stationary stimuli, and that there is a functional dissociation between attention-dependent anterior and spatially specific posterior topographic maps.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The traditional view of the ventral visual pathway being solely responsible for representation of objects has recently been challenged by demonstrating illusory shape representation within the dorsal visual pathway with moving bistable stimuli. Our results provide evidence for the dorsal stream contribution to representing not only moving, but also stationary illusory shapes. Our results also show a functional subdivision along the topographic maps, with spatially specific shape responses in the more posterior, and attention-dependent responses in the more anterior areas. These findings have implications for our understanding of the relationship between attention and grouping in healthy individuals and neuropsychological patients. Furthermore, IPS areas should be considered in theoretical accounts and models of how subjective content is generated in the brain.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Neural Representation of Intraoral Olfactory and Gustatory Signals by the Mediodorsal Thalamus in Alert Rats</a></h4>

              
                <p>The mediodorsal thalamus is a multimodal region involved in a variety of cognitive behaviors, including olfactory attention, odor discrimination, and the hedonic perception of flavors. Although the mediodorsal thalamus forms connections with principal regions of the olfactory and gustatory networks, its role in processing olfactory and gustatory signals originating from the mouth remains unclear. Here, we recorded single-unit activity in the mediodorsal thalamus of behaving female rats during the intraoral delivery of individual odors, individual tastes, and odor-taste mixtures. Our results are the first to demonstrate that neurons in the mediodorsal thalamus dynamically encode chemosensory signals originating from the mouth. This chemoselective population is broadly tuned, exhibits excited and suppressed responses, and responds to odor-taste mixtures differently than an odor or taste alone. Furthermore, a subset of chemoselective neurons encodes the palatability-related features of tastes and may represent associations between previously experienced odor-taste pairs. Our results further demonstrate the multidimensionality of the mediodorsal thalamus and provide additional evidence of its involvement in processing chemosensory information important for ingestive behaviors.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The perception of food relies on the concurrent processing of olfactory and gustatory signals originating from the mouth. The mediodorsal thalamus is a higher-order thalamic nucleus involved in a variety of chemosensory-dependent behaviors and connects the olfactory and gustatory cortices with the prefrontal cortex. However, it is unknown how neurons in the mediodorsal thalamus process intraoral chemosensory signals. Using tetrode recordings in alert rats, our results are the first to show that neurons in the mediodorsal thalamus dynamically represent olfactory and gustatory signals from the mouth. Our findings are consistent with the mediodorsal thalamus being a key node between sensory and prefrontal cortical areas for processing chemosensory information underlying ingestive behavior.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Identification of a Glutamatergic Claustrum-Anterior Cingulate Cortex Circuit for Visceral Pain Processing</a></h4>

              
                <p>Chronic visceral pain is a major challenge for both patients and health providers. Although the central sensitization of the brain is thought to play an important role in the development of visceral pain, the detailed neural circuits remain largely unknown. Using a well-established chronic visceral hypersensitivity model induced by neonatal maternal deprivation (NMD) in male mice, we identified a distinct pathway whereby the claustrum (CL) glutamatergic neuron projecting to the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is critical for visceral pain but not for CFA-evoked inflammatory pain. By a combination of <I>in vivo</I> circuit-dissecting extracellular electrophysiological approaches and visceral pain related electromyographic (EMG) recordings, we demonstrated that optogenetic inhibition of CL glutamatergic activity suppressed the ACC neural activity and visceral hypersensitivity of NMD mice whereas selective activation of CL glutamatergic activity enhanced the ACC neural activity and evoked visceral pain of control mice. Further, optogenetic studies demonstrate a causal link between such neuronal activity and visceral pain behaviors. Chemogenetic activation or inhibition of ACC neural activities reversed the effects of optogenetic manipulation of CL neural activities on visceral pain responses. Importantly, molecular detection showed that NMD significantly enhances the expression of NMDA receptors and activated CaMKII&alpha; in the ACC postsynaptic density (PSD) region. Together, our data establish a functional role for CL-&gt;ACC glutamatergic neurons in gating visceral pain, thus providing a potential treatment strategy for visceral pain.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Studies have shown that sensitization of anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) plays an important role in chronic pain. However, it is as yet unknown whether there is a specific brain region and a distinct neural circuit that helps the ACC to distinguish visceral and somatic pain. The present study demonstrates that claustrum (CL) glutamatergic neurons maybe responding to colorectal distention (CRD) rather than somatic stimulation and that a CL glutamatergic projection to ACC glutamatergic neuron regulates visceral pain in mice. Furthermore, excessive NMDA receptors and overactive CaMKII&alpha; in the ACC postsynaptic density (PSD) region were observed in mice with chronic visceral pain. Together, these findings reveal a novel neural circuity underlying the central sensitization of chronic visceral pain.</p>

                <p>Aquaporin-4 (AQP4) is characterized by the formation of orthogonal arrays of particles (OAPs) comprising its M1 and M23 isoforms in the plasma membrane. However, the biological importance of OAP formation is obscure. Here, we developed an OAP depolymerization male mouse model by transgenic knock-in of an AQP4-A25Q mutation. Analyses of the mutant brain tissue using blue native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, super-resolution imaging, and immunogold electron microscopy revealed remarkably reduced OAP structures and glial endfeet localization of the AQP4-A25Q mutant protein without effects on its overall mRNA and protein expression. <I>AQP4<sup>A25Q/A25Q</sup></I> mice showed better survival and neurologic deficit scores when cerebral edema was induced by water intoxication or middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion. The brain water content and swelling of pericapillary astrocytic endfeet processes in <I>AQP4<sup>A25Q/A25Q</sup></I> mice were significantly reduced, functionally supporting decreased AQP4 protein expression at the blood&ndash;brain barrier. The infarct volume and neuronal damage were also reduced in <I>AQP4<sup>A25Q/A25Q</sup></I> mice in the middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion model. Astrocyte activation in the brain was alleviated in <I>AQP4<sup>A25Q/A25Q</sup></I> mice, which may be associated with decreased cell swelling. We conclude that the OAP structure of AQP4 plays a key role in its polarized expression in astrocytic endfeet processes at the blood&ndash;brain barrier. Therefore, our study provided new insights into intervention of cerebral cellular edema caused by stroke and traumatic brain injury through regulating AQP4 OAP formation.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Aquaporin-4 (AQP4) is characterized by orthogonal arrays of particles (OAPs) comprising the M1 and M23 isoforms in the membrane. Here, an OAP depolymerization male mouse model induced by AQP4-A25Q mutation was first established, and the functions of OAP depolymerization in cerebral edema have been studied. The results revealed that AQP4 lost its OAP structure without affecting AQP4 mRNA and protein levels in AQP4-A25Q mice. AQP4-A25Q mutation mice has neuroprotective effects on cerebral edema induced by water intoxication and middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion through relieving the activation of astrocytes and suppressed microglia-mediated neuroinflammation. We concluded that the OAP structure of AQP4 plays a key role in its polarized expression in astrocytic endfeet processes at the blood&ndash;brain barrier.

                <p>Diabetic neuropathic pain (DNP) is a diabetes complication experienced by many patients. Ventrolateral periaqueductal gray (vlPAG) neurons are essential mediators of the descending pain modulation system, yet the role of vlPAG astrocytes in DNP remains unclear. The present study applied a multidimensional approach to elucidate the role of these astrocytes in DNP. We verified the activation of astrocytes in different regions of the PAG in male DNP-model rats. We found that only astrocytes in the vlPAG exhibited increased growth. Furthermore, we described differences in vlPAG astrocyte activity at different time points during DNP progression. After the 14th day of modeling, vlPAG astrocytes exhibited obvious activation and morphologic changes. Furthermore, activation of Gq-designer receptors exclusively activated by a designer drug (Gq-DREADDs) in vlPAG astrocytes in naive male rats induced neuropathic pain-like symptoms and pain-related aversion, whereas activation of Gi-DREADDs in vlPAG astrocytes in male DNP-model rats alleviated sensations of pain and promoted pain-related preference behavior. Thus, bidirectional manipulation of vlPAG astrocytes revealed their potential to regulate pain. Surprisingly, activation of Gi-DREADDs in vlPAG astrocytes also mitigated anxiety-like behavior induced by DNP. Thus, our results provide direct support for the hypothesis that vlPAG astrocytes regulate diabetes-associated neuropathic pain and concomitant anxiety-like behavior.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Many studies examined the association between the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray (vlPAG) and neuropathic pain. However, few studies have focused on the role of vlPAG astrocytes in diabetic neuropathic pain (DNP) and DNP-related emotional changes. This work confirmed the role of vlPAG astrocytes in DNP by applying a more direct and robust approach. We used chemogenetics to bidirectionally manipulate the activity of vlPAG astrocytes and revealed that vlPAG astrocytes regulate DNP and pain-related behavior. In addition, we discovered that activation of Gi-designer receptors exclusively activated by a designer drug in vlPAG astrocytes alleviated anxiety-like behavior induced by DNP. Together, these findings provide new insights into DNP and concomitant anxiety-like behavior and supply new therapeutic targets for treating DNP.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Progressively Decreased HCN1 Channels Results in Cone Morphological Defects in Diabetic Retinopathy</a></h4>

              
                <p>Historically, diabetic retinopathy has been recognized as a vascular disease. Recent clinical evidence suggests the initiation of diabetic retinopathy with neuropathy rather than microangiopathy. However, the molecular mechanism that drives diabetic retinopathy-associated neuropathy remains mostly unexplored. Here, we reported progressive diabetic retinopathy defects in blood glucose levels, shortening of cone segments and uncoupled appearance of retinal vascular abnormalities from <I>pdx1</I><sup>+/&ndash;</sup> <I>mutants</I> zebrafish to glucose-treated <I>pdx1</I><sup>+/&ndash;</sup> <I>mutants</I> zebrafish of both sexes. Further single-cell transcriptomic analysis revealed cones as the most vulnerable retinal neuron type that underwent three developmentally progressive cell states (States 1-3), predominantly present in WT animals, <I>pdx1</I><sup>+/&ndash;</sup> <I>mutants</I>, and glucose-treated <I>pdx1</I><sup>+/&ndash;</sup> <I>mutants</I>, respectively. Mechanistically, the expression of <I>hcn1</I> was progressively decreased in cones during its transition from State 1 to State 3. Furthermore, genetic <I>hcn1</I> disruption resulted in similar cone segment defects found in the diabetic retinopathy model, suggesting the involvement of progressive <I>hcn1</I> reduction in diabetic retinopathy-associated cone defects. Thus, our study provided a vertebrate retina model representing progressive diabetic retinopathy defects and further gained new mechanistic insights into the cone morphologic defects as an early neuropathy in diabetic retinopathy.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> We create a vertebrate retina model representing the progressive diabetic retinopathy-associated defects using zebrafish. Further systematic single-cell transcriptome analysis reveals two novel cell states of cones in response to different levels of higher glucose and the progressive decrease of HCN1 channels as a mechanism underlying cone defects in diabetic retinopathy.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Enhanced mosquito vectorial capacity underlies the Cape Verde Zika epidemic</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Noah H. Rose, Stéphanie Dabo, Silvânia da Veiga Leal, Massamba Sylla, Cheikh T. Diagne, Oumar Faye, Ousmane Faye, Amadou A. Sall, Carolyn S. McBride, Louis Lambrechts</p>

The explosive emergence of Zika virus (ZIKV) across the Pacific and Americas since 2007 was associated with hundreds of thousands of human cases and severe outcomes, including congenital microcephaly caused by ZIKV infection during pregnancy. Although ZIKV was first isolated in Uganda, Africa has so far been exempt from large-scale ZIKV epidemics, despite widespread susceptibility among African human populations. A possible explanation for this pattern is natural variation among populations of the primary vector of ZIKV, the mosquito <i>Aedes aegypti</i>. Globally invasive populations of <i>Ae</i>. <i>aegypti</i> outside of Africa are considered effective ZIKV vectors because they are human specialists with high intrinsic ZIKV susceptibility, whereas African populations of <i>Ae</i>. <i>aegypti</i> across the species’ native range are predominantly generalists with low intrinsic ZIKV susceptibility, making them less likely to spread viruses in the human population. We test this idea by studying a notable exception to the patterns observed across most of Africa: Cape Verde experienced a large ZIKV outbreak in 2015 to 2016. We find that local <i>Ae</i>. <i>aegypti</i> in Cape Verde have substantial human-specialist ancestry, show a robust behavioral preference for human hosts, and exhibit increased susceptibility to ZIKV infection, consistent with a key role for variation among mosquito populations in ZIKV epidemiology. These findings suggest that similar human-specialist populations of <i>Ae</i>. <i>aegypti</i> in the nearby Sahel region of West Africa, which may be expanding in response to rapid urbanization, could serve as effective vectors for ZIKV in the future.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Global genome decompaction leads to stochastic activation of gene expression as a first step toward fate commitment in human hematopoietic cells</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Romuald Parmentier, Laëtitia Racine, Alice Moussy, Sophie Chantalat, Ravi Sudharshan, Nan Papili Gao, Daniel Stockholm, Guillaume Corre, Geneviève Fourel, Jean-François Deleuze, Rudiyanto Gunawan, Andras Paldi</p>

When human cord blood–derived CD34+ cells are induced to differentiate, they undergo rapid and dynamic morphological and molecular transformations that are critical for fate commitment. In particular, the cells pass through a transitory phase known as “multilineage-primed” state. These cells are characterized by a mixed gene expression profile, different in each cell, with the coexpression of many genes characteristic for concurrent cell lineages. The aim of our study is to understand the mechanisms of the establishment and the exit from this transitory state. We investigated this issue using single-cell RNA sequencing and ATAC-seq. Two phases were detected. The first phase is a rapid and global chromatin decompaction that makes most of the gene promoters in the genome accessible for transcription. It results 24 h later in enhanced and pervasive transcription of the genome leading to the concomitant increase in the cell-to-cell variability of transcriptional profiles. The second phase is the exit from the multilineage-primed phase marked by a slow chromatin closure and a subsequent overall down-regulation of gene transcription. This process is selective and results in the emergence of coherent expression profiles corresponding to distinct cell subpopulations. The typical time scale of these events spans 48 to 72 h. These observations suggest that the nonspecificity of genome decompaction is the condition for the generation of a highly variable multilineage expression profile. The nonspecific phase is followed by specific regulatory actions that stabilize and maintain the activity of key genes, while the rest of the genome becomes repressed again by the chromatin recompaction. Thus, the initiation of differentiation is reminiscent of a constrained optimization process that associates the spontaneous generation of gene expression diversity to subsequent regulatory actions that maintain the activity of some genes, while the rest of the genome sinks back to the repressive closed chromatin state.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Shared biophysical mechanisms determine early biofilm architecture development across different bacterial species</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Hannah Jeckel, Francisco Díaz-Pascual, Dominic J. Skinner, Boya Song, Eva Jiménez-Siebert, Kerstin Strenger, Eric Jelli, Sanika Vaidya, Jörn Dunkel, Knut Drescher</p>

Bacterial biofilms are among the most abundant multicellular structures on Earth and play essential roles in a wide range of ecological, medical, and industrial processes. However, general principles that govern the emergence of biofilm architecture across different species remain unknown. Here, we combine experiments, simulations, and statistical analysis to identify shared biophysical mechanisms that determine early biofilm architecture development at the single-cell level, for the species <i>Vibrio cholerae</i>, <i>Escherichia coli</i>, <i>Salmonella enterica</i>, and <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> grown as microcolonies in flow chambers. Our data-driven analysis reveals that despite the many molecular differences between these species, the biofilm architecture differences can be described by only 2 control parameters: cellular aspect ratio and cell density. Further experiments using single-species mutants for which the cell aspect ratio and the cell density are systematically varied, and mechanistic simulations show that tuning these 2 control parameters reproduces biofilm architectures of different species. Altogether, our results show that biofilm microcolony architecture is determined by mechanical cell–cell interactions, which are conserved across different species.

                Background: Diabetic polyneuropathy (DPN) is the most prevalent consequence of diabetes mellitus, and it has a significant impact on the patient's health. This study aims to evaluate effects of antigravity treadmill training on gait and balance in patients with DPN. Methods: The study included 45 males with type 2 diabetes who were randomly assigned to one of two groups: the experimental group (n=23) or the control group (n=22). For a period of 12 weeks, the experimental group received antigravity treadmill training (75% weight bearing, 30 min per session, three times per week) combined with traditional physical therapy. During the same time period, the control group received only traditional physical therapy. The Biodex Balance System was used to assess postural stability indices, while the GAITRite Walkway System was used to assess spatiotemporal gait parameters. All measurements were obtained before and at the end of the study after 12 weeks of treatment. Results: The mean values of all measured variables improved significantly in both groups (P<0.05), with the experimental group showing significantly greater improvements than the control group. The post-treatment gait parameters (i.e., step length, step time, double support time, velocity, and cadence) were 61.3 cm, 0.49 sec, 0.25 sec, 83.09 cm/sec, and 99.78 steps/min as well as 56.14 cm, 0.55 sec, 0.29 sec, 75.73 cm/sec, and 88.14 steps/min for the experimental and control group, respectively. The post-treatment overall stability index was 0.32 and 0.70 for the experimental and control group, respectively. Conclusions: Antigravity treadmill training in combination with traditional physical therapy appears to be superior to traditional physical therapy alone in terms of gait and balance training. As a result, the antigravity treadmill has been found to be an effective device for the rehabilitation of DPN patients.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Factors associated with scientific production of professors working at a private university in Peru: An analytical cross-sectional study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Objective: To estimate the association between the academic, personal, and work characteristics and scientific production of professors at a private university of Lima, Peru, in 2021. Methods: We undertook an observational, analytical, and cross-sectional study. The sample included 322 professors through simple random sampling. Two questionnaires were administered. The first gathered personal, academic, and work characteristics; while the second evaluated scientific production. The chi-squared test was used, with a significance level of p<0,05, to evaluate the association between the different characteristics and scientific production. A multiple logistic regression was analyzed through the Stepwise method to evaluate the relationship between the variables of exposure and scientific production. We calculated prevalence ratios (PRs) with their respective 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). Results: We analyzed 322 professors, 59,6% were male. Scientific production was associated with being registered in Renacyt (PR = 5,52; 95% CI: 2,14 to 4,23; p = <0.001), having a doctoral degree (PR = 2,45; 95% CI: 1,60 to 3,85; p = <0.001), having been a thesis advisor (PR = 3,83; 95% CI: 1,45 to 5,66; p = <0.001), having facilities to conduct research at the workplace (PR = 1,58; 95% CI: 1,12 to 2,47; p = 0.006), and having received training by the university (PR = 1,99; 95% CI: 1,55 to 2,56; p = 0,001). Conclusions: Scientific production was associated with being registered in Renacyt, having a doctoral degree, having been a thesis advisor, having facilities to conduct research at the workplace, and having being trained in research by the university. Hence, evaluation systems and the monitoring of university quality standards should be strengthened. In addition, it is necessary to undertake wider scope studies in order to enhance the strategies that promote professors’ research.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Community social responsibility of continued and appropriate use of silver amalgam as dental restorative material in southern India: A cross-sectional study [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: For more than 150 years, dental amalgam (DA) has been popular as a dental restorative material. Yet, many organisations oppose its use due to perceived toxicity and environmental concerns. Hence, this study aimed to explore the continued use of DA from a South Indian dental practitioners’ perspective. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted among fifty-two private and public dental practitioners of Udupi district in Southern India. A self‑administered questionnaire was distributed, that involved assessment of their preferences, continuation of use and concerns of using DA as a restorative material. Percentage contribution of each variable was calculated. Preferences for continuation of use of silver amalgam based upon the age, experience and mercury toxicity as a risk factor were analysed using Students-t test and Chi-square test.  Results: The majority of dentists were satisfied (87%) with the results of the DA, found minimal failures (96%) and found DA more economical (89%). More than half (54%) of the participants reported that they would not continue the use of DA owing to mercury toxicity and environmental concerns. Dentists with higher age and longer clinical experience preferred continuation of DA. Conclusions: In spite of satisfaction with DA for its minimal failure, longevity and affordability, the authors found that a majority of practitioners did not prefer its continued usage. This highlights their concerns over mercury toxicity and soft tissue lesions and accentuates their community social responsibility. There is also an urgent need to educate dentists on mercury hygiene, mercury waste management and disposal.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Gender, digital financial services and vulnerability in the era of pandemics: A cross-sectional analysis [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has rapidly spread across the world, infecting millions and causing economic disruption on an unprecedented scale. While everyone is affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, vulnerable communities are at the greatest risk. The objective of this study is to examine the relationship between digital financial services (DFS), gender, and the vulnerability of informal settlement dwellers to COVID-19. Methods: We sampled a total of 2,697 households from 101 informal settlements across eleven out of sixteen administrative regions of Ghana. The regions were selected based on the relative severity of the pandemic, and the associated national lockdown regulations. Results: Adopting the multiple regression analytical technique, the results reveal three main findings: First, we observe that males in informal settlements are more likely to be exposed to infected people or a person who died from COVID-19 than females. However, women are more likely to be vulnerable to the pandemic than men as vulnerable populations have a higher susceptibility to pandemics due to less capacity to implement preparedness and response strategies due to disparities in their societal status. Finally, we find that the vulnerability of informal dwellers is moderated by the use of digital financial services. Conclusions: Our results provide policy implications for authorities designing policies to address vulnerability to pandemics in poor informal settlements in Africa.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The objective of this study was to outline the dynamics of prokineticin-2 pathway in relation to clinical-pathological features of Parkinson's disease by examining olfactory neurons of patients.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Thirty-eight patients (26 de novo, newly diagnosed) and 31 sex/age-matched healthy controls underwent noninvasive mucosa brushing for olfactory neurons collection, and standard clinical assessment. Gene expression levels of prokineticin-2, prokineticin-2 receptors type 1 and 2, and prokineticin-2-long peptide were measured in olfactory neurons by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR); moreover, the prokineticin-2 protein and α-synuclein species (total and oligomeric) were quantified by immunofluorescence staining.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Prokineticin-2 expression was significantly increased in Parkinson's disease. De novo patients had higher prokineticin-2 levels, directly correlated with Movement Disorder Society-Sponsored Revision of the Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) part III motor score. In addition, oligomeric α-synuclein was higher in Parkinson's disease and directly correlated with prokineticin-2 protein levels. Total α-synuclein did not differ between patients and controls.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Prokineticin-2 is a chemokine showing neuroprotective effects in experimental models of Parkinson's disease, but translational proof of its role in patients is still lacking. Here, we used olfactory neurons as the ideal tissue to analyze molecular stages of neurodegeneration in vivo, providing unprecedented evidence that the prokineticin-2 pathway is activated in patients with Parkinson's disease. Specifically, prokineticin-2 expression in olfactory neurons was higher at early disease stages, proportional to motor severity, and associated with oligomeric α-synuclein accumulation. These data, consistently with preclinical findings, support prokineticin-2 as a candidate target in Parkinson's disease, and validate reliability of olfactory neurons to reflect pathological changes of the disease.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The glymphatic system cleans amyloid and tau proteins from the brain in animal studies of Alzheimer disease (AD). However, there is no direct evidence showing this in humans.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Participants (n = 50, 62.6 ± 5.4 years old, 36 women) with AD and normal controls underwent amyloid positron emission tomography (PET), tau PET, structural T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging, and neuropsychological evaluation. Whole-brain glymphatic activity was measured by diffusion tensor image analysis along the perivascular space (DTI-ALPS).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>ALPS-indexes showed negative correlations with deposition of amyloid and tau on PET images and positive correlations with cognitive scores even after adjusting for age, sex, years of education, and <i>APOE4</i> genotype covariates in multiple AD-related brain regions (all <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). Mediation analysis showed that ALPS-index acted as a significant mediator between regional standardized uptake value ratios of amyloid and tau images and cognitive dysfunction even after correcting for multiple covariates in AD-related brain regions. These regions are responsible for attention, memory, and executive function, which are vulnerable to sleep deprivation.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>

                <p>Here, we report the generation and comprehensive characterization of a knockin mouse model for the hotspot p.Arg87Cys variant of the cytoplasmic FMR1-interacting protein 2 (<i>CYFIP2</i>) gene, which was recently identified in individuals diagnosed with West syndrome, a developmental and epileptic encephalopathy. The <i>Cyfip2</i>
<sup>
   <i>+/R87C</i>
</sup> mice recapitulated many neurological and neurobehavioral phenotypes of the patients, including spasmlike movements, microcephaly, and impaired social communication. Age-progressive cytoarchitectural disorganization and gliosis were also identified in the hippocampus of <i>Cyfip2</i>
<sup>
   <i>+/R87C</i>
</sup> mice. Beyond identifying a decrease in CYFIP2 protein levels in the <i>Cyfip2</i>
<sup>
   <i>+/R87C</i>
</sup> brains, we demonstrated that the p.Arg87Cys variant enhances ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of CYFIP2. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

                fMRI has been increasingly used to study brain function in domestic dogs trained to lie still in MRI scanners. These studies highlight both similarities and differences between dogs and humans when presented with the same stimuli, raising intriguing questions about the concept of functional homologies in a coevolved species that shares the human environment.

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/inpress.rss">Large-scale, closed-loop interrogation of neural circuits underlying cognition</a></h4>

              
                Cognitive functions are increasingly understood to involve coordinated activity patterns between multiple brain regions, and their disruption by neuropsychiatric disorders is similarly complex. Closed-loop neurostimulation can directly modulate neural signals with temporal and spatial precision. How to leverage such an approach to effectively identify and target distributed neural networks implicated in mediating cognition remains unclear. We review current conceptual and technical advances in this area, proposing that devices that enable large-scale acquisition, integrated processing, and multiregion, arbitrary waveform stimulation will be critical for mechanistically driven manipulation of cognitive processes in physiological and pathological brain networks.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Descending neuron population dynamics during odor-evoked and spontaneous limb-dependent behaviors</a></h4>

              
                Deciphering how the brain regulates motor circuits to control complex behaviors is an important, long-standing challenge in neuroscience. In the fly, <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>, this is coordinated by a population of ~ 1100 descending neurons (DNs). Activating only a few DNs is known to be sufficient to drive complex behaviors like walking and grooming. However, what additional role the larger population of DNs plays during natural behaviors remains largely unknown. For example, they may modulate core behavioral commands or comprise parallel pathways that are engaged depending on sensory context. We evaluated these possibilities by recording populations of nearly 100 DNs in individual tethered flies while they generated limb-dependent behaviors, including walking and grooming. We found that the largest fraction of recorded DNs encode walking while fewer are active during head grooming and resting. A large fraction of walk-encoding DNs encode turning and far fewer weakly encode speed. Although odor context does not determine which behavior-encoding DNs are recruited, a few DNs encode odors rather than behaviors. Lastly, we illustrate how one can identify individual neurons from DN population recordings by using their spatial, functional, and morphological properties. These results set the stage for a comprehensive, population-level understanding of how the brain’s descending signals regulate complex motor actions.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Evolutionary shaping of human brain dynamics</a></h4>

              
                The human brain is distinct from those of other species in terms of size, organization, and connectivity. How do structural evolutionary differences drive patterns of neural activity enabling brain function? Here, we combine brain imaging and biophysical modeling to show that the anatomical wiring of the human brain distinctly shapes neural dynamics. This shaping is characterized by a narrower distribution of dynamic ranges across brain regions compared with that of chimpanzees, our closest living primate relatives. We find that such a narrow dynamic range distribution supports faster integration between regions, particularly in transmodal systems. Conversely, a broad dynamic range distribution as seen in chimpanzees facilitates brain processes relying more on neural interactions within specialized local brain systems. These findings suggest that human brain dynamics have evolved to foster rapid associative processes in service of complex cognitive functions and behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Rapid reconstruction of neural circuits using tissue expansion and light sheet microscopy</a></h4>

              
                Brain function is mediated by the physiological coordination of a vast, intricately connected network of molecular and cellular components. The physiological properties of neural network components can be quantified with high throughput. The ability to assess many animals per study has been critical in relating physiological properties to behavior. By contrast, the synaptic structure of neural circuits is presently quantifiable only with low throughput. This low throughput hampers efforts to understand how variations in network structure relate to variations in behavior. For neuroanatomical reconstruction there is a methodological gulf between electron-microscopic (EM) methods, which yield dense connectomes at considerable expense and low throughput, and light-microscopic (LM) methods, which provide molecular and cell-type specificity at high throughput but without synaptic resolution. To bridge this gulf, we developed a high-throughput analysis pipeline and imaging protocol using tissue expansion and light sheet microscopy (ExLLSM) to rapidly reconstruct selected circuits across many animals with single-synapse resolution and molecular contrast. Using <i>Drosophila</i> to validate this approach, we demonstrate that it yields synaptic counts similar to those obtained by EM, enables synaptic connectivity to be compared across sex and experience, and can be used to correlate structural connectivity, functional connectivity, and behavior. This approach fills a critical methodological gap in studying variability in the structure and function of neural circuits across individuals within and between species.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Little skate genome provides insights into genetic programs essential for limb-based locomotion</a></h4>

              
                The little skate <i>Leucoraja erinacea</i>, a cartilaginous fish, displays pelvic fin driven walking-like behavior using genetic programs and neuronal subtypes similar to those of land vertebrates. However, mechanistic studies on little skate motor circuit development have been limited, due to a lack of high-quality reference genome. Here, we generated an assembly of the little skate genome, with precise gene annotation and structures, which allowed post-genome analysis of spinal motor neurons (MNs) essential for locomotion. Through interspecies comparison of mouse, skate and chicken MN transcriptomes, shared and divergent gene expression profiles were identified. Comparison of accessible chromatin regions between mouse and skate MNs predicted shared transcription factor (TF) motifs with divergent ones, which could be used for achieving differential regulation of MN-expressed genes. A greater number of TF motif predictions were observed in MN-expressed genes in mouse than in little skate. These findings suggest conserved and divergent molecular mechanisms controlling MN development of vertebrates during evolution, which might contribute to intricate gene regulatory networks in the emergence of a more sophisticated motor system in tetrapods.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Consistent Under-reporting of Task Details in Motor Imagery Research</a></h4>

              
                Motor Imagery is a subject of longstanding scientific interest. However, critical details of motor imagery protocols are not always reported in full, hampering direct replication and translation of this work. The present review provides a quantitative assessment of the prevalence of under reporting in the recent motor imagery literature. Publications from the years 2018-2020 were examined, with 695 meeting the inclusion criteria for further examination. Of these studies, 64% (445/695) did not provide information about the modality of motor imagery (i.e.,kinesthetic, visual, or a mixture of both) used in the study. When visual or mixed imagery was specified, the details of the visual perspective to be used (i.e., first person, third person, or combinations of both) were not reported in 24% (25/103) of studies. Further analysis indicated that studies using questionnaires to assess motor imagery reported more information than those that did not. We conclude that studies using motor imagery consistently under-report key details of their protocols, which poses a significant problem for understanding, replicating, and translating motor imagery effects.

                Although seizure detection algorithms are widely used to localize seizure onset on intracranial EEG in epilepsy patients, relatively few studies focus on seizure activity beyond the seizure onset zone to direct treatment of surgical patients with epilepsy. To address this gap, we develop and compare fully automated deep learning algorithms to detect seizure activity on single channels, effectively quantifying spread when deployed across multiple channels. Across 275 seizures in 71 patients, we discover that the extent of seizure spread across the brain and the timing of seizure spread between temporal lobe regions is associated with both surgical outcomes and the brain's structural connectivity between temporal lobes. Finally, we uncover a hierarchical structure of seizure spread patterns highlighting the relationship between clusters of seizures. Collectively, these findings underscore the broad utility in quantifying seizure activity past seizure onset to identify novel mechanisms of seizure evolution and its relationship to potential seizure freedom.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A computational account of need states, reward and wanting</a></h4>

              
                Needing is related to deprivation of something biologically significant, and wanting is linked to reward prediction and dopamine and usually has more power on behavioral activation than need states alone. The interaction and independence between needing and wanting in terms of brain functioning is not so defined, and it is unclear why sometimes there is association and sometimes dissociation between them. To investigate this question, we used a computational approach. In this approach needing is related to a deviation from preferred states that living things tend to occupy in order to reduce entropy, while wanting is related to precision over policy leading to rewards. We found that: (1) when need states increase, the tendency to occupy preferred states is enhanced independently of wanting (reward prediction), showing a dissociation between needing and wanting. We also found that (2) when need states increase, precision (i.e. saliency) of the reward leading to the preferred state is also increased, suggesting that need can amplify the value of a reward and its wanting. This led to the development of a model showing how needing is dissociated from wanting in that the tendency to be in a preferred state is independent of prediction of reward; and how needing can amplify wanting, by attributing saliency to relevant reward prediction.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Temporal integration is a robust feature of perceptual decisions</a></h4>

              
                Making informed decisions in noisy environments requires integrating sensory information over time. However, recent work has suggested that it may be difficult to determine whether an animal's decision-making strategy relies on evidence integration or not. In particular, strategies based on extrema-detection or random snapshots of the evidence stream may be difficult or even impossible to distinguish from classic evidence integration. Moreover, such non-integration strategies might be surprisingly common in experiments that aimed to study decisions based on integration. To determine whether temporal integration is central to perceptual decision making, we developed a new model-based approach for comparing temporal integration against alternative "non-integration" strategies for tasks in which the sensory signal is composed of discrete stimulus samples. We applied these methods to behavioral data from monkeys, rats, and humans performing a variety of sensory decision making tasks. In all species and tasks, we found converging evidence in favor of temporal integration. First, in all observers across studies, the integration model better accounted for standard behavioral statistics such as psychometric curves and psychophysical kernels. Second, we found that sensory samples with large evidence do not contribute disproportionately to subject choices, as predicted by an extrema-detection strategy. Finally, we provide a direct confirmation of temporal integration by showing that the sum of both early and late evidence contributed to observer decisions. Overall, our results provide experimental evidence suggesting that temporal integration is an ubiquitous feature in mammalian perceptual decision-making. Our study also highlights the benefits of using experimental paradigms where the temporal stream of sensory evidence is controlled explicitly by the experimenter, and known precisely by the analyst, to characterize the temporal properties of the decision process.

	<p>Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) as well as noradrenaline (NA) are key modulators of various fundamental brain functions including the control of appetite. While manipulations that alter brain serotoninergic signaling clearly affect body weight, studies implicating 5-HT transporters and NA transporters (5-HTT and NAT, respectively) as a main drug treatment target for human obesity have not been conclusive. The aim of this positron emission tomography (PET) study was to investigate how these central transporters are associated with changes of body weight after 6 months of dietary intervention or Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery in order to assess whether 5-HTT as well as NAT availability can predict weight loss and consequently treatment success. The study population consisted of two study cohorts using either the 5-HTT-selective radiotracer [11C]DASB to measure 5-HTT availability or the NAT-selective radiotracer [11C]MRB to assess NAT availability. Each group included non-obesity healthy participants, patients with severe obesity (body mass index, BMI, &amp;amp;gt;35 kg/m2) following a conservative dietary program (diet) and patients undergoing RYGB surgery within a 6-month follow-up. Overall, changes in BMI were not associated with changes of both 5-HTT and NAT availability, while 5-HTT availability in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) prior to intervention was associated with substantial BMI reduction after RYGB surgery and inversely related with modest BMI reduction after diet. Taken together, the data of our study indicate that 5-HTT and NAT are involved in the pathomechanism of obesity and have the potential to serve as predictors of treatment outcomes.</p>

	<p>(1) Background: Functional Hypothalamic Amenorrhea (FHA) can be caused by the hyper activation of neuro-endocrine responses to stress. Among other endocrine factors and hypothalamic dysfunctions, the psychophysiological stress response can very frequently lead to an inhibition of the gonadal&amp;amp;ndash;pituitary axis. The aim of this study was to investigate the level of neurovegetative activation in a group of young women affected by this condition. (2) Methods: Twenty-five women (mean age = 21.1 &amp;amp;plusmn; 4.34) with FHA were consecutively recruited. Information on psycho-physiological distress was collected through a Psychopathological assessment (with the administration of three psychometric tests) and the Psychophysiological Stress Profile (PSP). Their data were compared with a control group. (3) Results: In the PSP, the patients displayed significantly higher values compared to controls in terms of the parameters of muscle tension (sEMG), skin conductance (SCL/SCR), heart rate (HR), and peripheral temperature (PT). Furthermore, autonomic hyper-activation at rest, marked reactivity to stress, and reduced recovery were seen. Moreover, a condition characterized by psychological distress (anxiety and somatic complaints, depressed and irritable mood, obsessive-compulsive traits) emerged. (4) Conclusions: The results highlight autonomic hyper-activation in FHA, which is also associated with psychological distress. Considering that FHA is a condition that affects multiple systems between mind and body, a multimodal, multidimensional, and multidisciplinary assessment of stress is becoming an emerging need.</p>

	<p>Background: After deep brain stimulation (DBS), hiccups as a complication may lead to extreme fatigue, sleep deprivation, or affected prognosis. Currently, the causes and risk factors of postoperative hiccups are unclear. In this study, we investigated the risk factors for hiccups after DBS of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) for Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD) under general anesthesia. Methods: We retrospectively included patients who underwent STN DBS in the study, and collected data of demographic characteristics, clinical evaluations, and medications. According to the occurrence of hiccups within seven days after operation, the patients were divided into a hiccups group and non-hiccups group. The potentially involved risk factors for postoperative hiccups were statistically analyzed by logistic regression analysis. Results: A total of 191 patients were included in the study, of which 34 (17.80%) had postoperative transient persistent hiccups. Binary univariate logistic regression analysis showed that male, higher body mass index (BMI), smoker, Hoehn and Yahr stage (off), preoperative use of amantadine, hypnotic, Hamilton anxiety scale and Hamilton depression scale scores, and postoperative limited noninfectious peri-electrode edema in deep white matter were suspected risk factors for postoperative hiccups (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.1). In binary multivariate logistic regression analysis, male (compared to female, OR 14.00; 95% CI, 1.74&amp;amp;ndash;112.43), postoperative limited noninfectious peri-electrode edema in deep white matter (OR, 7.63; 95% CI, 1.37&amp;amp;ndash;42.37), preoperative use of amantadine (OR, 3.64; 95% CI, 1.08&amp;amp;ndash;12.28), and higher BMI (OR, 3.50; 95% CI, 1.46&amp;amp;ndash;8.36) were independent risk factors for postoperative hiccups. Conclusions: This study is the first report about the risk factors of hiccups after STN DBS under general anesthesia for PD patients. The study suggests that male, higher BMI, preoperative use of amantadine, and postoperative limited noninfectious peri-electrode edema in deep white matter are independent risk factors for postoperative hiccups of STN-DBS for PD patients. Most hiccups after STN-DBS for PD patients were transient and self-limiting.</p>

	<p>Nasal obstruction is believed to play a significant role in the pathophysiology and management of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). However, controversy remains about the ability of isolated nasal surgery to improve OSA. The objective of this systematic review is to give an updated overview of the literature on whether isolated nasal surgery can improve OSA subjectively (Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS)) and/or objectively (polysomnography (PSG)). Methods: A systematic review was performed searching the electronic databases PubMed, Embase.com (accessed on 20 June 2022&amp;amp;#65289;Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) up to 20 June 2022. Eligible studies were reviewed for methodological quality using the NIH Quality Assessment Tool for Observational Cohort and Cross-Sectional Studies. Results: Twenty-one studies met the inclusion criteria. The majority of the included studies reported no significant reduction in the apnea&amp;amp;ndash;hypopnea index (AHI) after isolated nasal surgery in patients with OSA. The meta-analysis suggests that the AHI slightly decreases after nasal surgery. The ESS was significantly lower after nasal surgery in eighteen studies. Conclusion: Based on the present analysis of objective outcomes, isolated nasal surgery did not improve the AHI significantly in the majority of the studies. The meta-analysis suggests a slight decrease in AHI after nasal surgery, but this reduction is not clinically relevant in terms of treatment success. Isolated nasal surgery should therefore not be recommended as a first-line treatment for OSA. Because of high study heterogeneity, these results should be interpreted with caution. Isolated nasal surgery can possibly improve OSA subjectively. Perhaps only OSA patients with complaints of nasal obstruction or OSA patients experiencing difficulty with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) compliance would benefit from isolated nasal surgery.</p>

	<p>(1) Background: Cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) are attracting increasing attention. Nevertheless, the risk factors for CMBs remain poorly identified, and the relationship between CMBs and cognitive impairment is still up for debate; (2) Objective: The present study analyzed the risk factors for CMBs and probed into the potential correlations between the presence, number, and location of CMBs and cognition; (3) Methods: This study enrolled 406 subjects who underwent both brain 3.0-T magnetic resonance imaging scans and cognitive testing. Spearman correlation was used to assess the relationship between the number of CMBs and cognition. Multiple linear regression was utilized to analyze the relationship between the regions of CMBs and each cognitive domain; (4) Results: Multivariate logistic regression analysis results showed that age (odds ratio (OR) = 1.045, 95% confidence interval (95%CI; 1.009, 1.082)), smoking (OR = 3.604, 95%CI (1.995, 6.509)), hypertension (OR = 3.607, 95%CI (2.204, 5.901)), total cholesterol (OR = 0.611, 95%CI (0.467, 0.799)), and Amyloid-&amp;amp;beta;1-42 (A&amp;amp;beta;1-42) (OR = 1.028, 95%CI (1.018, 1.037)) were the influencing factors of CMBs. Education years (OR = 0.959, 95%CI (0.930, 0.988)), white matter lesions (OR = 2.687, 95%CI (1.782, 4.051)), and CMBs (OR = 21.246, 95%CI (5.728, 21.576)) were the risk factors for cognitive impairment. Hypertension increased the probability of deep CMBs (OR = 12.54, 95%CI (2.21, 71.28)), while A&amp;amp;beta;1-42 elevated the probability of lobar CMBs (OR = 1.02, 95%CI (1.00, 1.03)). There was a linear correlation between the number of CMBs and Montreal Cognitive Assessment scores (r = &amp;amp;minus;0.756, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). However, CMBs in each region were not related to specific cognitive domains (p &amp;amp;gt; 0.05), except CMBs in the mixed group that were negatively correlated with attention (OR = &amp;amp;minus;0.669, 95%CI (&amp;amp;minus;0.034, &amp;amp;minus;5.270)); (5) Conclusions: Taken together, serum A&amp;amp;beta;1-42 levels are related to the presence of CMBs. Cognitive impairment is correlated with the number of CMBs rather than their region. These findings suggest that CMBs play a role in cognitive impairment and that CMBs mark the presence of diffuse vascular injury and neurodegenerative brain damage.</p>

	<p>With aging comes degradation of bimanual movement performance. A hallmark feature of bimanual movements is movement-related beta desynchronization (MRBD), an attenuation in the amplitude of beta oscillations associated with sensorimotor activation. Here, we investigated MRBD in 39 healthy adults (20 younger and 19 older adults) in frontal, central, and parietal regions across both hemispheres, during the planning and execution of a bimanual tracking task. Task accuracy decreased with age and during more difficult conditions when both hands had to move at different relative speeds. MRBD was mostly situated in the central region, and increased in older versus younger adults during movement execution but not planning. Irrespective of age, motor planning and execution were associated with increased MRBD in the left and right hemispheres, respectively. Notably, right central MRBD during motor planning was associated with bimanual task performance, particularly in older adults. Specifically, persons who demonstrated high MRBD during motor planning performed better on the bimanual tracking task. Our results highlight the importance of lateralized MRBD during motor planning, thereby shining new light on previous research and providing a promising avenue for future interventions.</p>

	<p>(1) Background: Cerebral autoregulation is altered during acute mild traumatic brain injury, or concussion. However, it is unknown how a history of concussion can impact cerebral haemodynamic activity during a task that elicits an autoregulatory response. (2) Methods: We assessed cerebral haemodynamic activity in those with a history of three or more concussions. The study included 44 retired athletes with concussion history and 25 control participants. We recorded participants&amp;amp;rsquo; relative changes in right and left pre-frontal cortex oxygenation collected by near-infrared spectroscopy and continuous beat-to-beat blood pressure measured by finger photoplethysmography. Participants completed a 5-min seated rest followed by a 5-min repeated squat (10-s) stand (10-s) maneuver (0.05 Hz) to elicit a cerebral autoregulatory response. Wavelet transformation was applied to the collected signals, allowing separation into cardiac interval I (0.6 to 2 Hz), respiratory interval II (0.145 to 0.6 Hz), and smooth muscle cell interval III (0.052 to 0.145 Hz). (3) Results: Significant increases at cardiac interval I were found for the wavelet amplitude of oxy-haemoglobin and haemoglobin difference at the right pre-frontal cortex. No significant difference was found at the left pre-frontal cortex or the blood pressure wavelet amplitudes. (4) Conclusion: Contributions from cardiac activity to the pre-frontal cortex oxygenation are elevated when eliciting dynamic cerebral autoregulation in those with a history of three or more concussions.</p>

	<p>Background: Traumatic optic neuropathy (TON) is damage to the optic nerve that is caused by external violence to the optic nerve during cranial and facial trauma. This kind of injury may result in impaired vision, has a high risk of blindness, and significantly impairs the neurological function of the patient. The treatment of TON is controversial, and many different approaches have been suggested. No one is considered best because the traumatic mechanism is not clear. Methods: In this retrospective study, the clinical features of 37 patients diagnosed with TON without light perception who were treated at the Ninth People&#039;s Hospital of Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine were investigated. A comparison was made between the patient&#039;s visual results before and after therapy. In addition, using a multifactorial linear regression model, the independent risk variables for the degree of improvement in visual acuity (IDVA) following surgery were determined. Results: After the operation, 17 people&#039;s visual acuity (VA) was lightless, 20 people&#039;s visual acuity was improved, and 13 people&#039;s visual acuity reached the standard of decerebrate. The efficiency of total optic nerve decompression was 54.1%, and the unblinded rate was 35.1%. Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that fractures of the optic canal and orbit were independent predictors of postoperative VA and IDVA. Conclusions: Total optic canal decompression may efficiently and safely enhance the vision of patients who have TON. Patients with TON who do not have fractures of the optic canal and orbit prior to decompression had a more favorable surgical prognosis.</p>

	<p>The regulation of surface tension (ST) by surfactants plays an important role in the human respiratory system but is largely unexplored in brain homeostasis. The aim of this study was to evaluate changes in ST in relation to surfactant proteins (SPs) in children with intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH). CSF samples from 93 patients were analyzed for ST with a force tensiometer and SP-A-D and -G with ELISA assays. Patients belonged to six groups: (i) IVH before primary intervention (PI), (ii) IVH 4&amp;amp;ndash;28 days after PI, (iii) IVH 44&amp;amp;ndash;357 days after PI, (iv) hydrocephalus, (v) sepsis and (vi) controls. We found indirect correlations and significant differences in ST and SPs (all p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001; except for SP-C, p = 0.007). Post hoc analyses showed significantly decreased ST in IVH patients before PI compared with patients with hydrocephalus, sepsis or controls (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), but it increased in IVH patients over time. All SPs were significantly elevated when comparing IVH patients before PI with controls (all p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001; except for SP-C, p = 0.003). Children suffering from IVH displayed an increase in SPs and a decrease in ST as coping mechanisms to preserve CSF flow. The increase in ST over time could serve as prognostic marker for the healing process.</p>

	<p>We evaluated the association between cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) and executive function (EF) in young adults and the mediating effects of GMV on this relationship. This study involved 217 college students. An incremental load exercise program was used to evaluate VO2max. EF was estimated by the Flanker task, the 2-back task, and the more-odd shifting task, while structural magnetic resonance and region-based morphometry (RBM) were used to analyze GMV. The high CRF group had a shorter updating reaction time (RT) (p &amp;amp;le; 0.05). CRF was positively correlated with the right orbital part of the middle frontal gyrus (ORBmid.R) GMV (p &amp;amp;le; 0.05). ORBmid.R GMV was negatively correlated with updating RT (p &amp;amp;le; 0.05). Model 4 in SPSS was used to assess the mediating effects of ORBmid.R GMV between CRF and updating RT. ORBmid.R GMV was established to have a partially mediating role between CRF and updating RT, which accounted for 19.6% of the total effect value. These findings indicate that the negative correlation between CRF and EF was significant, and ORBmid.R GMV played a mediating role in the relationship between CRF and EF, providing new evidence toward comprehensively revealing that CRF promotes EF performance.</p>

	<p>Introduction: Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) have recently been proposed as promising biomarkers in different immune-mediated disorders. We evaluated the plasma levels of MMP-9 and MMP-2 and their tissue inhibitors TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 in a patients&amp;amp;rsquo; cohort with generalized myasthenia gravis (MG). Methods: Plasma concentrations of MMP-9, MMP-2, TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 were evaluated in 14 patients with generalized MG and 13 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. The severity of disease was assessed by the modified Osserman classification. Results: Compared to the healthy subjects, MG patients had increased plasma concentrations of MMP-9, but reduced plasma levels of MMP-2 and TIMP-1. MG patients also showed a positive correlation between MMP-2 concentrations and disease severity. An increase in MMP-9 levels and MMP-9/TIMP-1 ratio and a decrease in MMP-2 levels and MMP-2/TIMP-2 ratio were detected in patients with generalized MG. Higher levels of MMP-2 correlated with greater disease severity. Discussion: Our preliminary findings suggest that MMPs and TIMPs could play a role in the pathogenesis of MG and might be associated with the risk of clinical deterioration.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Microglia are macrophage-like cells exerting determinant roles in neuroinflammatory and oxidative stress processes during brain regeneration. We used zebrafish as a model of brain plasticity and repair. First, by performing L-plastin (Lcp1) immunohistochemistry and using transgenic Tg(<i>mpeg1.1:GFP</i>) or Tg(<i>mpeg1.1:mCherry</i>) fish, we analyzed the distribution of microglia/immune cells in the whole brain. Specific regional differences were evidenced in terms of microglia/immune cell density and morphology (elongated, branched, highly branched, and amoeboid). Taking advantage of Tg(<i>fli:GFP</i>) and Tg(<i>GFAP::GFP)</i> enabling the detection of endothelial cells and neural stem cells (NSCs), we highlighted the association of elongated microglia/immune cells with blood vessels and rounded/amoeboid microglia with NSCs. Second, after telencephalic injury, we showed that L-plastin cells were still abundantly present at 5 days post-lesion (dpl) and were associated with regenerative neurogenesis. Finally, RNA-sequencing analysis from injured telencephalon (5 dpl) confirmed the upregulation of microglia/immune cell markers and highlighted a significant increase of genes involved in oxidative stress <i>(nox2</i>, <i>nrf2a</i>, and <i>gsr)</i>. The analysis of antioxidant activities at 5 dpl also revealed an upregulation of superoxide dismutase and persistent H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> generation in the injured telencephalon. Also, microglia/immune cells were shown to be a source of oxidative stress at 5 dpl. Overall, our data provide a better characterization of microglia/immune cell distribution in the healthy zebrafish brain, highlighting some evolutionarily conserved features with mammals. They also emphasize that 5 days after injury, microglia/immune cells are still activated and are associated to a persistent redox imbalance. Together, these data raise the question of the role of oxidative stress in regenerative neurogenesis in zebrafish.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">In vitro evaluation of ruminal digestibility and fermentation characteristics of local feedstuff-based beef cattle ration [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Consumption of local feedstuff Neptunia plena L. Benth and Leersia hexandra Swartz as a ration by the animal subject is expected to promote cost efficiency and production, as well as provide essential nutrition needs. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate dry matter digestibility (DMD), organic matter digestibility (OMD), ammonia (NH3) production, and volatile fatty acid (VFA) in beef cattle. Methods: Feed and rumen inoculum samples were prepared and analyzed for their proximate contents. There were five treatment groups based on the diet received by beef cattle, namely: T1 (Leersia hexandra Swartz 100 %); T2 (Neptunia plena L. Benth 100%); T3 (Leersia hexandra Swartz 15% + (Neptunia plena L. Benth 15% + 70 % Other Feedstuffs); T4 (Leersia hexandra Swartz 20% + (Neptunia plena L. Benth 20% + 60% Other Feedstuffs); T5 (Leersia hexandra Swartz 25% + (Neptunia plena L. Benth 25% + 50% Other Feedstuffs). In vitro approaches were used to determine the DMD, OMD, NH3 production, and VFA in beef cattle. The data were analyzed using ANOVA at a significance level of 95%, and a Duncan Multiple Range Test. Results: The results showed that the highest DMD (P<0.05) was derived from T 5 (56.47%), followed by T 4 (56.45%) and T 3 (55.90%). T 5=62.40% significantly (P<0.05) generated the highest OMD followed by T 4=61.95% and T 3=60.82%. This treatment had the highest NH 3 value, namely 5.02 mM, compared with T 3=4.55 mM, T 4=4.50 mM, T 2=4.22 mM, and T 1=3.99 mM. Furthermore, T5 had the highest VFA (P<0.05) compared with T 4, T 3, T 2, and T 1 with the value of 150.5, 133.0, 130.5, 130.0, and 123.5 mM, respectively. Conclusions: The local feedstuff-based ration contributed to beef cattle production.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Indigenous astronomical knowledge based seasonal weather forecast: evidence from Borana Oromo pastoralists of Southern Ethiopia [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Indigenous knowledge is still widely used by communities around the world to overcome social-ecological challenges. Borana Oromo pastoralists of Southern Ethiopia have been searching for future weather phenomena using their indigenous knowledge. This study examines indigenous knowledge-based seasonal weather forecasts through using observable physical and temporal patterns of astronomic objects. Data were generated through using focus group discussion, experimental knowledgeable groups and direct observation in the year 2021. The finding reveals that Borana Oromo pastoralists commonly define physical and temporal outlooks of the Moon that are changed and/ or displayed periodically within a range of varying contexts. The observation of the Moon features have been offering sufficient lapse time in a more than/within ahead of a season/ and is relatively more accurate than the other traditional forecasting objects. The study showed that both temporal and spatial dimensions of the forecasting were actually happened in Ganna (March to May rainfall), Adolessa dry season (June to September) and Hgayya rainfall (October to November) seasons of 2021. This indigenous weather forecasting practices are still regularly used in every livelihood decision making process. However, this indigenous weather knowledge of Borana Oromo pastoralists of Southern Ethiopia is not yet mainstreamed in the formal institutional structures. Curtailments of mobility, severity of drought, weakening of traditional institution, leaving of traditional life style and death of the knowledgeable elders are the major factors that are challenging the potential effects of the indigenous weather forecasting indicators of the features of moon in the study area.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Factors affecting the family development index in Indonesia: a cross-sectional survey in Aceh, a region with a 30 year armed conflict experience [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Family development index needs to be measured to ensure that the government has made optimal efforts to provide happiness to the families and to develop strategies in family development in a region with unique conditions. The objective of this study was to assess the family development index and its associated determinants in Aceh province, a region implementing Syariah Law in Indonesia with 30 years of armed conflict experience. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in all regencies in Aceh. The study was a part of the Indonesian National Population and Family Planning Board project. The survey included one individual from each household that was selected randomly. Family development index was measured using a questionnaire consisting of 15 questions. The plausible determinants were collected and assessed through a face-to-face interview. The family development index was dichotomized using 85% cut-off into good and poor. A two-step logistic regression was used to determine the associated determinants. Results: A total of 10,000 households were included in the final analysis. 86.6% had a good family development index, with the highest in Sabang (97.6%) and the lowest index in Aceh Singkil (76.6%), respectively. A multivariate analysis indicated that the regency, marital status, educational qualification, ownership of health insurance, ownership of childbirth certificate, quality of the house (the type of floor, the source of electricity, the source of drinking water and the type of toilet facility) were associated with the family development index. Conclusion: Despite Aceh being one of the less developed provinces in Indonesia with long armed conflict experience, our data suggest that the family development index is relatively high and the index is influenced both by economic and non-economic determinants. To further improve the family development index, it is critical to develop both economic and non-economic components in the region and in the country.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Correlation of cervical progesterone levels to plasma progesterone levels in normal pregnancy and preterm labor: A cross-sectional study [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The theory of “functional progesterone withdrawal” explains the role of progesterone prior to delivery. Previous studies mentioned the existence of progesterone regulation in the cervix that plays a role in maintaining the integrity of the cervix and cervical ripening. Cervical progesterone levels relate to activities of progesterone at the cervix, compared to its amount in circulation. The objective of this study was to measure cervical mucus progesterone levels and its correlation to plasma progesterone levels in pregnancy. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study conducted in January-September 2010 at Persahabatan Hospital. The subjects were pregnant women in the 28th – 34th weeks of gestational age. In total, 72 subjects who met the criteria were divided into normal pregnancy group and preterm labor group. The cervical and plasma progesterone levels were measured using The Advia Centaur® Progesterone kit, which is a commercial immunoassay with direct chemiluminescence method. Results: There was a positive correlation (r=0.539) between cervical progesterone levels with plasma progesterone levels in the preterm labor group. There was no correlation between cervical progesterone levels with plasma progesterone levels in the normal pregnancy group. Conclusion:  This study showed that cervical progesterone levels could be measured through cervical mucus. A significant positive correlation was found by this study between cervical progesterone levels and plasma progesterone levels in the preterm labor group.  This study is expected to provide new insights for understanding the metabolism and the role of progesterone in maintaining cervical integrity during pregnancy, and its relation to prevention of preterm birth.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Paediatric critical COVID-19: clinical features and outcomes during five waves. [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Data reported from several countries show that both children and adolescents accounted for less than 2% of symptomatic cases of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The study objective was to describe the clinical characteristics of children admitted to Tunisian paediatric intensive care units (PICU). Methods: This was a single centre observational retrospective study conducted in the PICU of the Farhat Hached tertiary teaching hospital in Sousse, Tunisia during the period from the March 1, 2020 to February 28, 2022. We included all children aged from one month to 15 years with recent severe or critical severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Infection was confirmed by the positivity of reverse transcriptase either for SARS-CoV2 or with presence of IgM antibodies. We included severe and critical forms of COVID-19 according to the World Health Organization (WHO) classification. Results: 26 patients were included. 16 (61%) were one year old or younger. 18 patients (69.2%) were male. The median age in our research series was six months [1-156 months]. 17 (65.3%) patients had morbidities including mainly cardiac and neurological diseases. Fever (88.4%) and tachypnea (80.8%) were the most common clinical signs. Leukocytosis, high level of C-reactive protein, D-dimer, troponin, and pro-B type natriuretic peptide levels were found in 17, 8, 10, 6, and 10 cases respectively. Seven patients were initially treated with high-flow nasal cannula and didn't need escalation. Three were intubated. Invasive mechanical ventilation was used in six cases. Antibiotics and corticosteroids were used in 84% and 42.3% of children. The median paediatric intensive care unit length-of-stay was 10.9 days. There were six deaths. Conclusion: Paediatricians should be vigilant to the different clinical manifestations of COVID-19 in children admitted in PICU. Special attention should be allocated to infants under one year of age, of the male gender, and for children with comorbidities.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Laboratory risk factors for mortality in severe and critical COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Several studies have reported clinical characteristics and risk factors for predicting adverse outcomes in COVID-19.4–6 However, data exclusively from the ICU especially in the low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) remain lacking. This study aimed to explore risk factors associated with mortality based on laboratory parameters at hospital admission in severe and critical COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU. Methods: This study is a retrospective cohort study. Data from the electronic medical records were collected retrospectively from all severe and critical COVID-19 patients requiring ICU admission in two designated COVID-19 hospitals in Jakarta, Indonesia. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to identify the predictors associated with ICU mortality. The model performance was evaluated by the area under curve (AUC) from the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Results: There were 334 patients admitted to the ICU with COVID-19 included in the statistical analysis. The ICU mortality rate was 75.1%, with 251 patients died in the hospital. Independent risk factors associated mortality including white blood cell count >13.9 x109/L (OR=2.41; 95% CI, 1.15-5.06, p=0.02), neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio >10.7 (OR=2.20; 95% CI, 1.20 – 4.03, p=0.011), and creatinine >0.8 mg/dL (OR=3.55; 95% CI, 2.05 – 6.17, p<0.001). The model yielded an AUC of 0.72 (95% CI, 0.659-0.780, p<0.0001) for predicting ICU mortality in severe and critical COVID-19 patients. Conclusions: White blood cell, neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio, and serum creatinine on hospital admission are significant predictors of mortality in severe and critical COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU. The ICU mortality rate during the second wave of the pandemic in this study was high.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Effects of evidence-based clinical practice guidelines for breast cancer in health care quality improvements. A second systematic review. [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Traditionally, EB-CPGs have been believed to mainly improve the quality and consistency of health care, but this claim must be conclusively proven. We used the Donabedian three-dimensional model (structure, process, and patient outcomes) to assess improvements in the quality of medical care derived from implementing EB-CPGs. This study corresponds to the second systematic review carried out as a series of studies on different clinical issues that aim to evaluate the effectiveness of the application of the EB-CPG for improving the quality of care. Methods: We followed the methods described by the Cochrane Handbook and presented a descriptive analysis because of the high heterogeneity found across the included studies. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PubMed, and EBSCO Host databases, as well as the grey literature, between 1990 and April 2021. No language restrictions were applied. Only randomised clinical trials (RCTs) were selected. Results: Of the total of 364 interventions included in the eleven RCTs evaluated, 11 (3%) were related to healthcare structure, 51 (14%) to the healthcare delivery process and 302 (83%) to patient outcomes. Regarding the impact of using the EB-CPGs, in 303 interventions (83%), there were no significant differences between the control and experimental groups. In 4 interventions (1%), the result favoured the control and intervention groups in 57 of the interventions (16%). Conclusions: Our study showed that EB-CPGs slightly enhanced the quality of health care in the three dimensions described by Donabedian. Future RCTs should improve their design and methodological rigour by considering the certainty of the evidence supporting the EB-CPGs recommendations. In that context, broader analyses could be performed, having more concise hypotheses for further research. Registration: PROSPERO CRD42020205594

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Survival rate of patients with combined hepatocellular cholangiocarcinoma receiving medical cannabis treatment: A retrospective, cohort comparative study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) incidence in Northeastern Thailand is very high and a major cause of mortality. CCA patients typically have a poor prognosis and short-term survival rate due to late-stage diagnosis. Thailand is the first Southeast Asian country to approve medicinal cannabis treatment, especially for palliative care with advanced cancer patients. Methods: A retrospective cohort comparative study of survival rates among 491 newly diagnosed advanced CCA patients was carried out between September 1, 2019, and June 30, 2021. A total of 404 patients were in the standard palliative care pain management treatment group (ST), and 87 were in the medicinal cannabis treatment group (CT). Patients with CCA were recruited from four tertiary hospitals and two secondary hospitals in five provinces of Northeast Thailand. The cumulative survival rates were calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method, and independent prognostic factors were investigated using Cox regression. Results: For ST patients, there was a total follow-up time of 790 person-months, with a mortality rate of 48.35/100 person-months. For CT patients the total follow-up time was 476 person-months, with mortality rate of 10.9/ 100 person-months. The median survival time after registration at a palliative clinic was 0.83 months (95% CI: 0.71–0.95) for ST and 5.66 months (95% CI: 1.94–9.38) for CT. Multivariate analysis showed that CT treatment protocol was associated with a significantly better survival (P value <0.001; median time of CT, 5.66 months (95% CI: 1.94–9.38); median time of ST, 0.83 months (95% CI: 0.71–0.95). Therefore, CT had a reduced probability of dying from the disease (HRadj., 0.28 (95% CI: 0.20–0.37) Conclusions: The medical cannabis increased overall survival rates among CCA patients.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Melan-A expression related to apoptosis of melanocytes in segmental and non-segmental vitiligo [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Vitiligo is a progressive depigmentation of the skin with unclear etiology. Cell-mediated immunity has been suggested to play an important role in the pathogenesis of vitiligo’s progression. Melan-A has a high affinity for specific CD8+ T cells and is one of the critical markers for detecting damage to melanocytes. Our study aims to demonstrate the differences in Melan-A expression associated with apoptosis of melanocytes in patients with segmental vitiligo (SV) and those with non-segmental vitiligo (NSV). Methods A cross-sectional study with 64 patients diagnosed with vitiligo, of whom 33 had NSV and 31 had SV. Skin biopsy and direct immunofluorescence were used to examine Melan-A, and the TUNEL staining method was performed to examine melanocyte apoptosis in both groups. Group comparisons were conducted using appropriate statistical methods. Results Melan-A expression was significantly higher in the NSV group than in the SV group, and there was a significant difference between the two groups (p=0.001). The median of melanocyte apoptosis in the NSV group was relatively higher than in the SV group, and a significant difference was found between the two groups (p=0.001). The Spearman’s rank correlation test between Melan-A expression and melanocyte apoptosis in the NSV group was 0.767 (76.7%) and showed a significant relationship (p<0.05). The same test in the SV group was 0.583 (58.3%) and showed a significant relationship (p<0.05). In both groups, the higher the Melan-A expression, the higher the melanocyte apoptosis. Conclusion Melan-A expression and melanocyte apoptosis are positively correlated. Higher Melan-A expression and melanocyte apoptosis in NSV indicates more severe vitiligo disease compared to SV.

                Background: Several studies have shown that active compounds of Asclepias subulata (cardenolides) have antiproliferative effect on human cancer cells. Cardenolides isolated from A. subulata can be used as active chemical markers to elaborate phytopharmaceutical preparations. The aim of this work was to evaluate the antiproliferative effect of a standardized extract of the aerial parts, based on Asclepias subulata cardenolides. Methods: Four standardized extracts were prepared by HPLC-DAD depending on the concentration of calotropin and the antiproliferative activity was measured for the MTT assay, on the A549, MCF-7, HeLa, PC3 and ARPE cell lines. The concentrations of calotropin used for the standardization of the extracts were 10, 7.6, 5 and 1 mg/dL. Results: Standardization of the A. subulata extract based on calotropin at 7.6 mg/g dry weight was achieved and the antiproliferative activity was evaluated over A549, HeLa and MCF-7 cell lines, obtaining proliferation percentages of 3.8 to 13.4%. Conclusions: The standardized extracts of A. subulata at different concentrations of calotropin showed antiproliferative activity against all the cell lines evaluated. The greatest effect was observed against the HeLa cell line.

                Japan is known for its exclusionary tendencies and clearly delineated Japanese way of doing things. Seeing as its immigration law was amended in April 2019 to allow more migrant workers into the country, there is some urgency in studying these ethnocentric practices, which often lead to inequalities between Japanese and foreign employees at the workplace. The objective of this opinion piece is to help the reader understand the sociocultural context and rationale behind Japanese norms in blue- and white-collar workplaces, as well as foreign employees’ reactions and points of view. Such understanding will hopefully increase both Japanese and foreign employees’ willingness to accommodate each other, and reduce friction and conflict at the workplace.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Emergent multilevel selection in a simple spatial model of the evolution of altruism</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Rutger Hermsen</p>

Theories on the evolutionary origins of altruistic behavior have a long history and have become a canonical part of the theory of evolution. Nevertheless, the mechanisms that allow altruism to appear and persist are still incompletely understood. It is well known, however, that the spatial structure of populations is an important determinant. In both theoretical and experimental studies, much attention has been devoted to populations that are subdivided into discrete groups. Such studies typically imposed the structure and dynamics of the groups by hand. Here, we instead present a simple individual-based model in which altruistic organisms spontaneously self-organize into spatially separated colonies that themselves reproduce by binary fission and hence behave as Darwinian entities in their own right. Using software to automatically track the rise and fall of colonies, we are able to apply formal theory on multilevel selection and thus quantify the within- and among-group dynamics. This reveals that individual colonies inevitably succumb to defectors in a within-colony “tragedy of the commons”. Even so, altruism persists in the population because more altruistic colonies reproduce more frequently and drive less altruistic ones to extinction. Evidently, the colonies promote the selection of altruism but in turn depend on altruism for their existence; the selection of altruism hence involves a kind of evolutionary bootstrapping. The emergence of the colonies also depends crucially on the length scales of motility, altruism, and competition. This reconfirms the general relevance of these scales for social evolution, but also stresses that their impact can only be understood fully in the light of the emergent eco-evolutionary spatial patterns. The results also suggest that emergent spatial population patterns can function as a starting point for transitions of individuality.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">cNap1 bridges centriole contact sites to maintain centrosome cohesion</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Robert Mahen</p>

Centrioles are non-membrane-bound organelles that participate in fundamental cellular processes through their ability to form physical contacts with other structures. During interphase, two mature centrioles can associate to form a single centrosome—a phenomenon known as centrosome cohesion. Centrosome cohesion is important for processes such as cell migration, and yet how it is maintained is unclear. Current models indicate that pericentriolar fibres termed rootlets, also known as the centrosome linker, entangle to maintain centriole proximity. Here, I uncover a centriole–centriole contact site and mechanism of centrosome cohesion based on coalescence of the proximal centriole component cNap1. Using live-cell imaging of endogenously tagged cNap1, I show that proximal centrioles form dynamic contacts in response to physical force from the cytoskeleton. Expansion microscopy reveals that cNap1 bridges between these contact sites, physically linking proximal centrioles on the nanoscale. Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS)-calibrated imaging shows that cNap1 accumulates at nearly micromolar concentrations on proximal centrioles, corresponding to a few hundred protein copy numbers. When ectopically tethered to organelles such as lysosomes, cNap1 forms viscous and cohesive assemblies that promote organelle spatial proximity. These results suggest a mechanism of centrosome cohesion by cNap1 at the proximal centriole and illustrate how a non-membrane-bound organelle forms organelle contact sites.

                Background: In Japan, the effect of education using the leaflet ‘Discipline Without Tough Love’ on mothers during caring for their infants have been reported. We examined the effect of this education on pregnant Japanese women. Methods: The present study was a prospective investigation of all Japanese women with singleton pregnancies who visited our hospital for a perinatal visit at 20-23 weeks’ gestation between November 2017 and March 2018 and gave birth at ≥ 37 weeks’ gestation at our hospital. We examined the maternal feelings (bonding situation) to babies of women who received the leaflet in comparison with that in women who did not receive it during the health check-up performed routinely at one month after delivery using the Japanese version of the Mother-to-Infant Bonding Scale. Results: There were no significant differences in maternal feelings for their babies between the two groups of women. Conclusions: We did not identify any effect of health consultations cased on ‘Discipline Without Tough Love’ during pregnancy on maternal feelings toward babies at one month after delivery. A further study to enlighten pregnant women about parenting without corporal punishment will be needed in Japan.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Responses of Chemosensory Perception to Stimulation of the Human Brain</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Significant advances have been made in our understanding of the neural substrates of human chemosensory processing, involving the piriform cortex, insula, and orbitofrontal cortex. However, the important and challenging issues are to localize the brain regions with high anatomic precision that can causally produce chemosensory perception and further delineate the topography of different classifications of chemosensory perception.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We quantitatively measured subjective responses of chemosensory perception to intracranial electrical stimulation over the brain in neurosurgical patients (n = 302) with medically refractory epilepsy.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The chemosensory perceptions including olfaction, gustation, and chemesthesis were elicited in 21 of 302 patients (7%). Chemosensory responses were evoked in 53 (0.2%) of 21,661 stimulated sites. The highest response rate (1.8%) was in the insula (37/2,051 stimulated sites from 15/163 patients). The chemosensory perception emerged predominantly during stimulation of the insula along the central sulcus axis. Notably, there existed a distinct pattern that the anteroventral insula predominately represented orthonasal olfaction, whereas different chemosensory modalities converged in the mid-dorsal insula.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This study provided a detailed characterization of chemosensory perception across the brain, especially in the insula. These results suggest that the cortex along the banks of the central sulcus of the insula may play a role in producing the supramodal sensation of flavor. It also indicates that dysfunction of the central insula should be considered during the evaluation of chemosensory-related epileptic seizures. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

                Using in vivo neural activity recording, optogenetics, and viral-mediated transneuronal anterograde tracing, Hashimoto et al. find that, rather than simply gating behavior, the lateral septum modulates cortical state and responsivity to sensory stimuli to promote preparatory defensive behavioral states associated with heightened reactivity to threat-related cues.

                Zhang et al. show that SHH-MB exhibits RNA m6A hypermethylation compared with normal cerebella. Overexpression of m6A methyltransferase METTL3 causes hypermethylation of PTCH1 and GLI2, as well as sustained hedgehog signaling, which further promotes tumor progression of SHH-MB. Targeting METTL3 could inhibit tumor growth, suggesting a potential therapeutic strategy of SHH-MB.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">A critical developmental window for ELAV/Hu-dependent mRNA signatures at the onset of neuronal differentiation</a></h4>

              
                Carrasco et al. show that neuronal differentiation depends on the establishment of a subset of alternative mRNA isoforms by one single effector, ELAV, as soon as the first post-mitotic neurons are born. Outside of this developmental window, nuclear activation of the paralog FNE fully rescues neuronal RNA signatures and neurogenesis.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Neural defensive circuits underlie helping under threat in humans</a></h4>

              
                Empathy for others’ distress has long been considered the driving force of helping. However, when deciding to help others in danger, one must consider not only their distress, but also the risk to oneself. Whereas the role of self-defense in helping has been overlooked in human research, studies in other animals indicate defensive responses are necessary for the protection of conspecifics. In this pre-registered study (N=49), we demonstrate that human defensive neural circuits are implicated in helping others under threat. Participants underwent fMRI scanning while deciding whether to help another participant avoid aversive electrical shocks, at the risk of also being shocked. We found that higher engagement of neural circuits that coordinate fast escape from self-directed danger (including the insula, PAG, and ACC) facilitated decisions to help others. Importantly, using representational similarity analysis, we found that the strength with which the amygdala and insula uniquely represented the threat to oneself (and not the other’s distress) predicted helping. Our findings indicate that in humans, as other mammals, defensive mechanisms play a greater role in helping behavior than previously understood.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Oxytocin signaling in the posterior hypothalamus prevents hyperphagic obesity in mice</a></h4>

              
                Decades of studies have revealed molecular and neural circuit bases for body weight homeostasis. Neural hormone oxytocin (Oxt) has received attention in this context because it is produced by neurons in the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus (PVH), a known output center of hypothalamic regulation of appetite. Oxt has an anorexigenic effect, as shown in human studies, and can mediate satiety signals in rodents. However, the function of Oxt signaling in the physiological regulation of appetite has remained in question, because whole-body knockout (KO) of <i>Oxt</i> or <i>Oxt receptor</i> (<i>Oxtr</i>) has little effect on food intake. We herein show that acute conditional KO (cKO) of <i>Oxt</i> selectively in the adult PVH, but not in the supraoptic nucleus, markedly increases body weight and food intake, with an elevated level of plasma triglyceride and leptin. Intraperitoneal administration of Oxt rescues the hyperphagic phenotype of the PVH <i>Oxt</i> cKO model. Furthermore, we show that cKO of <i>Oxtr</i> selectively in the posterior hypothalamic regions, especially the arcuate hypothalamic nucleus, a primary center for appetite regulations, phenocopies hyperphagic obesity. Collectively, these data reveal that Oxt signaling in the arcuate nucleus suppresses excessive food intake.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Continuous sensing of IFNα by hepatic endothelial cells shapes a vascular antimetastatic barrier</a></h4>

              
                Hepatic metastases are a poor prognostic factor of colorectal carcinoma (CRC) and new strategies to reduce the risk of liver CRC colonization are highly needed. Herein, we used mouse models of hepatic metastatization to demonstrate that the continuous infusion of therapeutic doses of interferon-alpha (IFNα) controls CRC invasion by acting on hepatic endothelial cells (HECs). Mechanistically, IFNα promoted the development of a vascular antimetastatic niche characterized by liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) defenestration extracellular matrix and glycocalyx deposition, thus strengthening the liver vascular barrier impairing CRC trans-sinusoidal migration, without requiring a direct action on tumor cells, hepatic stellate cells, hepatocytes, or liver dendritic cells (DCs), Kupffer cells (KCs) and liver capsular macrophages (LCMs). Moreover, IFNα endowed LSECs with efficient cross-priming potential that, along with the early intravascular tumor burden reduction, supported the generation of antitumor CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and ultimately led to the establishment of a protective long-term memory T cell response. These findings provide a rationale for the use of continuous IFNα therapy in perioperative settings to reduce CRC metastatic spreading to the liver.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Combining transgenesis with paratransgenesis to fight malaria</a></h4>

              
                Malaria is among the deadliest infectious diseases, and <i>Plasmodium</i>, the causative agent, needs to complete a complex development cycle in its vector mosquito for transmission to occur. Two promising strategies to curb transmission are transgenesis, consisting of genetically engineering mosquitoes to express antimalarial effector molecules, and paratransgenesis, consisting of introducing into the mosquito commensal bacteria engineered to express antimalarial effector molecules. Although both approaches restrict parasite development in the mosquito, it is not known how their effectiveness compares. Here we provide an in-depth assessment of transgenesis and paratransgenesis and evaluate the combination of the two approaches. Using the Q-system to drive gene expression, we engineered mosquitoes to produce and secrete two effectors – scorpine and the MP2 peptide – into the mosquito gut and salivary glands. We also engineered <i>Serratia</i>, a commensal bacterium capable of spreading through mosquito populations to secrete effectors into the mosquito gut. Whereas both mosquito-based and bacteria-based approaches strongly reduced the oocyst and sporozoite intensity, a substantially stronger reduction of <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> development was achieved when transgenesis and paratransgenesis were combined. Most importantly, transmission of <i>Plasmodium berghei</i> from infected to naïve mice was maximally inhibited by the combination of the two approaches. Combining these two strategies promises to become a powerful approach to combat malaria.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Normative decision rules in changing environments</a></h4>

              
                Models based on normative principles have played a major role in our understanding of how the brain forms decisions. However, these models have typically been derived for simple, stable conditions, and their relevance to decisions formed under more naturalistic, dynamic conditions is unclear. We previously derived a normative decision model in which evidence accumulation is adapted to fluctuations in the evidence-generating process that occur during a single decision (Glaze et al., 2015), but the evolution of commitment rules (e.g., thresholds on the accumulated evidence) under dynamic conditions is not fully understood. Here we derive a normative model for decisions based on changing contexts, which we define as changes in evidence quality or reward, over the course of a single decision. In these cases, performance (reward rate) is maximized using decision thresholds that respond to and even anticipate these changes, in contrast to the static thresholds used in many decision models. We show that these adaptive thresholds exhibit several distinct temporal motifs that depend on the specific predicted and experienced context changes and that adaptive models perform robustly even when implemented imperfectly (noisily). We further show that decision models with adaptive thresholds outperform those with constant or urgency-gated thresholds in accounting for human response times on a task with time-varying evidence quality and average reward. These results further link normative and neural decision-making while expanding our view of both as dynamic, adaptive processes that update and use expectations to govern both deliberation and commitment.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Histone H3 clipping is a novel signature of human neutrophil extracellular traps</a></h4>

              
                Neutrophils are critical to host defence, executing diverse strategies to perform their antimicrobial and regulatory functions. One tactic is the production of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). In response to certain stimuli neutrophils decondense their lobulated nucleus and release chromatin into the extracellular space through a process called NETosis. However, NETosis, and the subsequent degradation of NETs, can become dysregulated. NETs are proposed to play a role in infectious as well as many non-infection related diseases including cancer, thrombosis, autoimmunity and neurological disease. Consequently, there is a need to develop specific tools for the study of these structures in disease contexts. In this study, we identified a NET-specific histone H3 cleavage event and harnessed this to develop a cleavage site-specific antibody for the detection of human NETs. By microscopy, this antibody distinguishes NETs from chromatin in purified and mixed cell samples. It also detects NETs in tissue sections. We propose this antibody as a new tool to detect and quantify NETs.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Comprehensive machine-learning survival framework develops a consensus model in large-scale multicenter cohorts for pancreatic cancer</a></h4>

              
                As the most aggressive tumor, the outcome of pancreatic cancer (PACA) has not improved observably over the last decade. Anatomy-based TNM staging does not exactly identify treatment-sensitive patients, and an ideal biomarker is urgently needed for precision medicine. Based on expression files of 1280 patients from 10 multicenter cohorts, we screened 32 consensus prognostic genes. Ten machine-learning algorithms were transformed into 76 combinations, of which we selected the optimal algorithm to construct an artificial intelligence-derived prognostic signature (AIDPS) according to the average C-index in the nine testing cohorts. The results of the training cohort, nine testing cohorts, Meta-Cohort, and three external validation cohorts (290 patients) consistently indicated that AIDPS could accurately predict the prognosis of PACA. After incorporating several vital clinicopathological features and 86 published signatures, AIDPS exhibited robust and dramatically superior predictive capability. Moreover, in other prevalent digestive system tumors, the nine-gene AIDPS could still accurately stratify the prognosis. Of note, our AIDPS had important clinical implications for PACA, and patients with low AIDPS owned a dismal prognosis, higher genomic alterations, and denser immune cell infiltrates as well as were more sensitive to immunotherapy. Meanwhile, the high AIDPS group possessed observably prolonged survival, and panobinostat may be a potential agent for patients with high AIDPS. Overall, our study provides an attractive tool to further guide the clinical management and individualized treatment of PACA.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Coding of latent variables in sensory, parietal, and frontal cortices during closed-loop virtual navigation</a></h4>

              
                We do not understand how neural nodes operate and coordinate within the recurrent action-perception loops that characterize naturalistic self-environment interactions. Here, we record single-unit spiking activity and local field potentials (LFPs) simultaneously from the dorsomedial superior temporal area (MSTd), parietal area 7a, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) as monkeys navigate in virtual reality to 'catch fireflies'. This task requires animals to actively sample from a closed-loop virtual environment while concurrently computing continuous latent variables: (i) the distance and angle travelled (i.e., path integration) and (ii) the distance and angle to a memorized firefly location (i.e., a hidden spatial goal). We observed a patterned mixed selectivity, with the prefrontal cortex most prominently coding for latent variables, parietal cortex coding for sensorimotor variables, and MSTd most often coding for eye-movements. However, even the traditionally considered sensory area (i.e., MSTd) tracked latent variables, demonstrating path integration and vector-coding of hidden spatial goals. Further, global encoding profiles and unit-to-unit coupling (i.e., noise correlations) suggested a functional subnetwork composed by MSTd and dlPFC, and not between these and 7a, as anatomy would suggest. We show that the greater the unit-to-unit coupling between MSTd and dlPFC, the more the animals' gaze position was indicative of the ongoing location of the hidden spatial goal. We suggest this MSTd-dlPFC subnetwork reflects the monkeys' natural and adaptive task strategy wherein they continuously gaze toward the location of the (invisible) target. Together, these results highlight the distributed nature of neural coding during closed action-perception loops and suggest that fine-grain functional subnetworks may be dynamically established to subserve (embodied) task strategies.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Functional ultrasound imaging reveals an aberrant developmental trajectory of functional connectivity in a mouse model of the 15q13.3 copy number variant microdeletion</a></h4>

              
                The developmental nature of many neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia necessitates the detection of functional biomarkers during the prodromal phase of disease that can predict symptomatic conversion and outcomes. Structural chromosomal aberrations, such as copy number variants, confer high risk and penetrance of neuropsychiatric disorders. We used functional ultrasound imaging (fUS) to characterize the functional connectivity profile of the 15q13.3+/- copy number variant mouse model during major developmental milestones on post-natal day (p)35, 42, 60, and 90 in comparison to wild type littermates. We identified divergent trajectories for 15q13.3+/- mice and WT littermate controls where functional connectivity was reduced for both genotypes with age, but to a lesser extent for 15q13.3+/- mice. We were then able to isolate the distinct differences between genotypes to identify a large-scale network where 15q13.3+/- mice displayed global cortical hyperconnectivity and elevated intra-connectivity within the hippocampus and amygdala, in particular. In order to determine the stage of development where the connectivity trajectories bifurcated, we used machine learning to predict genotype. We found that the connectivity profile from p42, but not p35, predicted the genotype of individual mice at p90 with 82% accuracy. All together, these results suggest a crucial period of network maturation from early to late pubescence that is pivotal in the transition of healthy network connectivity into adulthood. This novel application of fUS longitudinally through development shows promise in improving the understanding of the disease biology of mouse models of psychiatric diseases.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Spatiotemporal tissue maturation of thalamocortical pathways in the human fetal brain</a></h4>

              
                The development of connectivity between the thalamus and maturing cortex is a fundamental process in the second half of human gestation, establishing the neural circuits that are the basis for several important brain functions. In this study, we acquired high-resolution in utero diffusion MRI from 140 fetuses as part of the Developing Human Connectome Project, to examine the emergence of thalamocortical white matter over the second to third trimester. We delineate developing thalamocortical pathways and parcellate the fetal thalamus according to its cortical connectivity using diffusion tractography. We then quantify microstructural tissue components along the tracts in the fetal compartments that are critical substrates for white matter maturation, such as the subplate and intermediate zone. We identify patterns of change in the diffusion metrics that reflect critical neurobiological transitions occurring in the second to third trimester, such as the disassembly of radial glial scaffolding and the lamination of the cortical plate. These maturational trajectories of MR signal in transient fetal compartments provide a normative reference to complement histological knowledge, facilitating future studies to establish how developmental disruptions in these regions contribute to pathophysiology.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Single-cell analysis of prenatal and postnatal human cortical development</a></h4>

              
                Human cortical development involves birth, differentiation and maturation of a multitude of cellular lineages over the course of prenatal and postnatal life. Single-cell genomics provided insight into the molecular changes that underlie the development of early cortical lineages but has mostly been applied to the second trimester of prenatal human cortical development. Here, we utilize single-nucleus RNA sequencing to capture the development of the main human cortical lineages across prenatal and postnatal stages until adulthood and generate a comprehensive single-cell transcriptomic atlas of human cortical development. We collected more than 350,000 single-nucleus RNA-seq profiles from 108 tissue samples from 60 donors representing the second and third trimester of gestation, as well as neonatal, early and late postnatal stages of development. We identify lineage-specific developmental programs that underlie the development of specific subtypes of excitatory cortical neurons, interneurons, glial cell types and brain vasculature. Moreover, we discover sex- and region-specific developmental changes in each of these lineages. By intersecting our results with genetic risk factors for autism, we identify the cortical cell types and lineages most vulnerable to genetic insults that cause autism. We show that lineage-specific gene expression programs upregulated in female cells are especially enriched for the genetic risk factors of autism. Since these genes are expressed at lower levels in males during development, they may be more susceptible to heterozygous loss of function in ASD, providing a basis for the increased male to female ratio of autism incidence.

                The molecular mechanisms and evolutionary changes accompanying synapse development are still poorly understood. Here, we generated a cross-species proteomic map of synapse development in the human, macaque, and mouse neocortex. By tracking the changes of >1,000 postsynaptic density (PSD) proteins from midgestation to adolescence, we found that PSD maturation in humans separates into three major phases that are dominated by distinct pathways. Cross-species comparisons reveal that the human PSD matures about three times slower than other species and contains higher levels of Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factors (RhoGEFs) in the perinatal period. Enhancement of the RhoGEF signaling in human neurons delays the morphological maturation of dendritic spines and functional maturation of synapses, potentially contributing to the neotenic traits of human brain development. In addition, PSD proteins can be divided into four modules that exert stage- and cell type-specific functions, possibly explaining their differential associations with cognitive functions and diseases. Together, our proteomic map of synapse development provides a blueprint for studying the molecular basis and evolutionary changes of synapse maturation.

                The orientation of sketch maps of remote but familiar city squares produced from memory has been shown to depend on the distance and airline direction from the production site to the remembered square (position dependent recall, Rohrich et al. 2014). Here, we present a virtual reality version of the original experiment and additionaly study the role of body orientation. Three main points can be made: First, "immersive sketching" is a novel and useful paradigm in which subjects sketch maps live on paper while being immersed in virtual reality. Second, the original effect of position dependent recall was confirmed, indicating that the sense of presence generated in a virtual environment suffices to bias the imagery of distant places. Finally, the orientation of the produced sketch maps depended also on the body orientation of the subjects. At each production site, body orientation was controlled by varying the position of the life feed in the virtual environment such that subjects had to turn towards the prescribed direction. Position dependent recall is strongest if subjects are aligned with the airline direction to the target and virtually goes away if they turn in the opposite direction.

                Human listeners estimate the spatial direction of a sound source from multiple auditory features and prior information on the sound direction. In this work, we describe a model of directional localization of a broadband and stationary sound source presented in an anechoic environment to a static listener. The model is based on Bayesian inference and it infers the sound direction from the spatial percept built by weighting the sensory evidence with prior beliefs. With the imposed restrictions, the sensory evidence is composed by a simplistic extraction mechanisms for two binaural features evaluating interaural disparities in time and intensity with a more detailed extraction mechanisms of monaural spectral-shape features. Our analysis considered two model variants for monaural features: amplitude spectra and their spectral gradient profiles. In addition, the model accounts for two types of uncertainties: the sensory noise in spatial cues and the response noise of pointing towards the direction. The proposed model variants were fitted to individual performance of human listeners localizing noise bursts. We then tested the predictive power of those models on the effects of localizing with other ears and sounds with rippled spectrum. This evaluation, especially with the deviation from a flat source spectrum, showed a clear preference for the model variant with spectral gradient cues, also in comparison to previously proposed localization models. Hence, the proposed model provides a tool for the evaluation of head-related transfer functions and a solid basis for future extensions towards modeling dynamic listening conditions.

                Previously we demonstrated that intra-hippocampal infusion of purified, Semaphorin 4D (Sema4D) extracellular domain into the mouse hippocampus rapidly promotes formation of GABAergic synapses and decreases seizure susceptibility in mice. Given the relatively fast action of Sema4D treatment revealed by these studies, we sought to determine the time course of Sema4D treatment on hippocampal network activity using an acute hippocampal slice preparation. We performed long-term extracellular recordings from area CA1 encompassing a 2 hour application of Sema4D and found that hippocampal excitation is suppressed hours following treatment. We also asked if Sema4D treatment could ameliorate seizures in an acute seizure model: the kainic acid (KA) mouse model of Status Epilepticus (SE). We demonstrate that Sema4D treatment suppresses seizures and lessens benzodiazepine (BZD) insensitivity which is a hallmark of refractory SE. Lastly, we sought to explore alternative methods of Sema4D delivery to hippocampus and thus created an Adeno Associated Virus expressing the extracellular domain of Sema4D. Our data reveal that virally delivered, chronically overexpressed Sema4D extracellular domain promotes GABAergic synapse formation and suppresses seizure activity similar to the actions of purified Sema4D protein. These results provide proof of concept that Sema4D-mediated GABAergic synapse development could combat BZD insensitivity in intractable forms of epilepsy, and that viral delivery of Sema4D is an efficacious and promising delivery method.

                Background: Social memory is essential to the functioning of a social animal within a group. Estrogens can affect social memory too quickly for classical genomic mechanisms. Previously, 17{beta}-estradiol (E2) rapidly facilitated short-term social memory and increased nascent synapse formation, these synapses being potentiated following neuronal activity. However, what mechanisms underlie and co-ordinate the rapid facilitation of social memory and synaptogenesis are unclear. Here, the necessity of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling for rapid facilitation of short-term social memory and synaptogenesis was tested. Methods: Mice performed a short-term social memory task or were used as task-naive controls. ERK and PI3K pathway inhibitors were infused intra-dorsal hippocampally 5 minutes before E2 infusion. Forty minutes following intrahippocampal E2 or vehicle administration, tissues were collected for quantification of glutamatergic synapse number in the CA1. Results: Dorsal hippocampal E2 rapid facilitation of short-term social memory depended upon ERK and PI3K pathways. E2 increased glutamatergic synapse number (GluA1/bassoon colocalization) in task-performing mice but decreased synapse number in task-naive mice. Critically, ERK signaling was required for synapse formation/elimination in task-performing and task-naive mice, whereas PI3K inhibition blocked synapse formation only in task-performing mice. Conclusions: Whilst ERK and PI3K are both required for E2 facilitation of short-term social memory and synapse formation, only ERK is required for synapse elimination. This demonstrates previously unknown, bidirectional, rapid actions of E2 on brain and behaviour and underscores the importance of estrogen signaling in the brain to social behaviour.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Representations of fricatives in sub-cortical model responses: comparisons with human perception</a></h4>

              
                Fricatives are obstruent phonemes made by constricting airflow in the vocal tract, producing turbulence across the constriction site or downstream from the constriction. Fricatives exhibit significant intra/inter-subject and contextual variability. Yet fricatives are perceived with high accuracy. The current study investigated modeled neural responses to fricatives in the auditory nerve (AN) and inferior colliculus (IC), with the hypothesis that response profiles across populations of neurons provide robust correlates to perception. Stimuli were 270 intervocalic fricatives (10 speakers x 9 fricatives x 3 utterances). Computational model response profiles had 50 characteristic frequencies, log-spaced from 125 to 8 or 20 kHz. Confusion matrices generated by KNN subspace classifiers used the average rates for the 50 characteristic frequencies as the features and compared them with published behavioral data. The modeled AN and IC neural responses provided better predictions of perceptual accuracy than the stimulus spectra, with IC showing better accuracy than AN. Perceptual fricative accuracy was explained by modeled neural response profiles, whereas confusions were only partially explained. Extended frequencies improved accuracy based on the model IC, corroborating the importance of extended high frequencies in speech perception. Future electrophysiological studies from IC cells and neural response simulations of hearing-impaired ears could guide the development of processing strategies.

                The amygdala is one of the most widely studied regions in behavioral neuroscience. A plethora of classical, and new paradigms have dissected its precise involvement in emotional and social sensing, learning, and memory. Several important insights resulted from the use of genetic markers - yet, in the age of single cell transcriptomics, the amygdala remains molecularly underdescribed. Here, we present a molecular cell type taxonomy of the full mouse amygdala in fear learning and consolidation. We performed single-cell RNA-seq on naive and fear conditioned mice, inferred the 130 neuronal cell types distributions in silico using orthogonal spatial transcriptomic datasets, and describe the cell types' transcriptional responses to learning and memory consolidation. Only a fraction of cells, within a subset of all neuronal types, were transcriptionally responsive to fear learning, memory and retrieval. These activated engram cells upregulated activity-response genes, and processes of synaptic signaling, plasticity, development and neurite outgrowth. Our transcriptome-wide data confirm known actors, and describe several new candidate genes. The atlas may help pinpoint the amygdala's circuits in performing emotional sensing and integration, and provide new insights to the global cellular processes involved.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Tackling the challenges of group network inference from intracranial EEG data</a></h4>

              
                Intracranial EEG (iEEG) data is a powerful way to map brain function, characterized by high temporal and spatial resolution, allowing the study of interactions among neuronal populations that orchestrate cognitive processing. However, the statistical inference and analysis of brain networks using iEEG data faces many challenges related to its sparse brain coverage, and its inhomogeneity across patients. We review these challenges and develop a methodological pipeline for estimation of network structure not obtainable from any single patient, illustrated on the inference of the interaction among visual streams using a dataset of 27 human iEEG recordings from a visual experiment employing visual scene stimuli. 100 ms sliding window and multiple band-pass filtered signals are used to provide temporal and spectral resolution. For the connectivity analysis we showcase two connectivity measures reflecting different types of interaction between regions of interest (ROI): Phase Locking Value as a symmetric measure of synchrony, and Directed Transfer Function - asymmetric measure describing causal interaction. For each two channels, initial uncorrected significance testing at p<0.05 for every time-frequency point is carried out by comparison of the data-derived connectivity to a baseline surrogate-based null distribution, providing a binary time-frequency connectivity map. For each ROI pair, a connectivity density map is obtained by averaging across all pairs of channels spanning them, effectively agglomerating data across relevant channels and subjects. Finally, the difference of the mean map value after and before the stimulation is compared to the same statistic in surrogate data to assess link significance. The analysis confirmed the function of the parieto-medial temporal pathway, mediating visuospatial information between dorsal and ventral visual streams during visual scene analysis. Moreover, we observed the anterior hippocampal connectivity with more posterior areas in the medial temporal lobe, and found the reciprocal information flow between early processing areas and medial place area. To summarize, we developed an approach for estimating network connectivity, dealing with the challenge of sparse individual coverage of intracranial EEG electrodes. Its application provided new insights into the interaction between the dorsal and ventral visual streams, one of the iconic dualities in human cognition.

                Motor neuron degeneration, the defining feature of ALS, is a primary example of cell-type specificity in neurodegenerative diseases. Using isogenic pairs of iPSCs harboring different familial ALS mutations, we assess the capacity of iPSC-derived spinal motor neurons, sensory neurons, astrocytes, and superficial cortical neurons to capture disease features including transcriptional and splicing dysregulation observed in human post-mortem neurons. At surprisingly early time points, differentially regulated genes in iPSC-derived spinal motor neurons, but not other cell types, overlap with one-third of the differentially regulated genes in laser-dissected motor neurons from postmortem spinal cords. The extent of dysregulation correlates well between iPSC-derived and bona fide spinal motor neurons. In iPSC-derived spinal motor neurons, but not other derived cell types, we detect downregulation of genes affected by TDP-43-dependent aberrant splicing. This reduction takes place exclusively within genotypes known to involve TDP-43 pathology and occurs without evidence of TDP-43 mislocalization or protein level alteration.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Reading negative action verbs: one or two-step processing within the primary motor cortex?</a></h4>

              
                Controversy persists regarding the representation of negated actions, specifically concerning activation and inhibitory mechanisms in the motor system, and whether this occurs in one or two steps. We conducted two experiments probing corticospinal excitability (CSE) and short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) in the primary motor cortex at different latencies while reading affirmative and negative action sentences. Twenty-six participants read action and non-action sentences in affirmative or negative forms. Using transcranial magnetic stimulation, we probed CSE in hand muscles at rest and at several latencies after verb presentation. We observed a greater CSE for action sentences compared to non-action sentences, regardless of verb form. In experiment two, nineteen participants read affirmative and negative action sentences. We measured CSE and SICI at short and long latencies after verb presentation. CSE was greater for affirmative and negative action sentences at both latencies compared to rest. SICI did not change at the short latency but increased at longer latencies, regardless of verb form. Our results lend partial support for a two-step model, as negated actions showed the same motor excitability as affirmed actions with no additional inhibition at early latencies. Later neural differences between affirmative and negative actions may occur outside the primary motor cortex.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Bayesian Accounts of Perceptual Decisions in the Nonclinical Continuum of Psychosis: Greater Imprecision in Both Top-down and Bottom-up Processes</a></h4>

              
                Neurocomputational accounts of psychosis propose mechanisms for how information is integrated into a predictive model of the world, in attempts to understand the occurrence of altered perceptual experiences. Conflicting Bayesian theories postulate aberrations in either top-down or bottom-up processing. The top-down theory predicts an overreliance on prior beliefs or expectations resulting in aberrant perceptual experiences, whereas the bottom-up theory predicts an overreliance on current sensory information, as aberrant salience is directed towards objectively uninformative stimuli. This study empirically adjudicates between these models. We use a perceptual decision-making task in a neurotypical population with varying degrees of psychotic-like experiences. Bayesian modelling was used to compute individuals' reliance on prior relative to sensory information. Across two datasets (discovery dataset n=363; independent replication in validation dataset n=782) we showed that psychotic-like experiences were associated with an overweighting of sensory information relative to prior expectations, which seem to be driven by decreased precision afforded to prior information. However, when prior information was more uncertain, participants with greater psychotic-like experiences encoded sensory information with greater noise. Greater psychotic-like experiences were also associated with generally heightened perceptions of task instability, which we suggest may be the cause for the observed aberrant precision in the encoding both prior and likelihood information. Our study lends empirical support to notions of both weaker bottom-up and weaker (rather than stronger) top-down perceptual processes, as well as aberrancies in belief updating that extend into the non-clinical continuum of psychosis.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The role of consciously timed movements in shaping and improving auditory timing</a></h4>

              
                Our subjective sense of time is intertwined with a plethora of perceptual, cognitive, and motor functions, and likewise, the brain is equipped to expertly filter, weight, and combine these signals for seamless interactions with a dynamic world. Until relatively recently, the literature on time perception has excluded the influence of motor activity, yet, it has been found that motor circuits in the brain are at the core of most timing functions. Several studies have now identified that concurrent movements exert robust effects on perceptual timing estimates, but critically, have not assessed how humans consciously judge the duration of their own movements. This creates a gap in our understanding of the mechanisms driving movement-related effects on sensory timing. We sought to address this gap by administering a sensorimotor timing task in which we explicitly compared the timing of isolated auditory tones and arm movements, or both simultaneously. We contextualized our findings within a Bayesian cue combination framework, in which separate sources of temporal information are weighted by their reliability and integrated into a unitary time estimate that is more precise than either unisensory estimate. Our results revealed differences in accuracy between auditory, movement, and combined trials, and crucially, that combined trials were the most accurately timed. Under the Bayesian framework, we found that participants' combined estimates were more precise than isolated estimates in a way that trended towards optimality, while being overall less optimal than the model's prediction. These findings elucidate previously unknown qualities of conscious motor timing, and proposes computational mechanisms that can describe how movements combine with perceptual signals to create unified, multimodal experiences of time.

                Bees rely heavily on vision during most of their interaction with the environment, but so far, visual abilities have not been included into functional investigations of these crucial pollinators. This is probably due to the lack of comprehensive and phylogenetically-controlled quantification of visual traits across species. In the present study, we used high-throughput micro-CT tools to quantify, compare and understand the diversity of visual traits of compound eyes in bumblebees. Visual systems of bumblebees were far from identical, with variations across sizes, castes and species. While phylogenetic proximity poorly supported interspecific variations, these were better explained by two ecological factors: social parasitism and habitat. The eye parameter, a metric that measures the relative investment of a compound eye into resolution or sensitivity, was lower in queens of social parasitic species than of non-parasitic species. Workers of species associated with forested habitat had distinct visual traits, including a higher eye parameter, than those of species living in open landscapes. These diverse visual traits are likely to provide selective advantages to bumblebees given their specific ecological requirements. We thus propose that social parasitism and forest habitat are drivers of the diversification of compound eyes in bumblebees. Finally, we discuss how the present study can inspire trait-based approaches in ecology and conservation biology.

                Development of the nervous system depends on signaling centers, specialized cellular populations that produce secreted molecules to regulate neurogenesis in the neighboring neuroepithelium. Some signaling centers also generate key types of neurons. The formation of a signaling center involves its induction, the maintenance of expression of its secreted molecules, and cell differentiation and migration events. How these distinct processes are coordinated during signaling center development remains unknown. Here we show that Lmx1a acts as a master regulator to orchestrate the formation and function of the cortical hem (CH), a critical signaling center that controls hippocampus development. Lmx1a co-regulates CH induction, its Wnt signaling, and the differentiation and migration of CH-derived Cajal-Retzius neurons. Combining RNAseq, genetic, and rescue experiments, we identified major downstream genes that mediate distinct Lmx1a-dependent processes. Our work revealed that signaling centers in the mammalian brain employ master regulatory genes and established a framework for analyzing signaling center development.

                Mechanisms of specific memory deficits associated with Rett syndrome are poorly understood, at least in part because mutations of MECP2 have confounding effects on nervous system development and basal synaptic transmission. To mitigate such empirical uncertainties, this study exploited technical advantages of the Aplysia sensorimotor synapse to examine the potential role of MeCP2 in long-term synaptic plasticity. The results indicate MeCP2 may act as an inhibitory constraint on gene expression required for formation as well as maintenance of plasticity.

                Synucleinopathies including Parkinson's disease etc. are characteristic for -synuclein aggregates in neurons or glia, and are always manifested olfaction deficits at their primary onsets. It remains elusive why aggregated -synuclein predominantly affects olfactory system. Employing the knockout mice, we investigated the physiological function of -synuclein in olfactory system and found that SNCA/-synuclein deletion primarily interfered the projection of olfactory neurons. iTRAQ-based LC-MS identified 188 differentially expressed proteins, including 9 that were associated with axon guidance. Among them, NCK2 was most significantly down-regulated, which was indicated to be involved a PPI network of 21 proteins, including 11 players of the Ephrin receptor signaling pathway. Either SNCA/-synuclein deletion or NCK2 deficiency inactivated EphA4 receptor. Re-expressing -synuclein in the knockout neurons reverse the NCK2, as well as the phosphorylated EphA4. Thus, -synuclein regulated axon guidance through NCK2-EphA4 signaling pathway. Malfunction of -synuclein, whether because of deletion or aggregation, may cause aberrant olfactory neurons projection and subsequent olfaction deficits. This extended our knowledge of -synuclein in olfactory system, which may explain why olfaction is usually impaired in some synucleinopathies.

                Many neurodevelopmental conditions, including autism, affect males more than females. Genomic mechanisms enhancing risk in males may contribute to this sex-bias. The ubiquitin protein ligase E3A gene (Ube3a) exerts pleiotropic effects on cellular homeostasis via control of protein turnover and by acting as transcriptional coactivator with steroid hormone receptors. Overdosage of Ube3a via duplication or triplication of chromosomal region 15q11-13 causes 1-2% of autistic cases. Here, we test the hypothesis that increased dosage of Ube3a may influence autism-relevant phenotypes in a sex-biased manner. We report robust sex-biasing effects on brain connectomics and repetitive behaviors in mice with extra copies of Ube3a. These effects were associated with a profound transcriptional dysregulation of several known autism-associated genes (e.g., FMR1, SCN2A, PTEN, MEF2C, SHANK3, TSC2) as well as differentially-expressed genes identified in human 15q duplication and in autistic patients. Notably, increased Ube3a dosage also affects multiple sex-relevant mechanisms, including genes on the X chromosome, genes influenced by sex steroid hormones, downstream targets of the androgen and estrogen receptors, or genes that are sex-differentially regulated by transcription factors. These results suggest that Ube3a overdosage can critically contribute to sex-bias in neurodevelopmental conditions via influence on sex-differential mechanisms.

                Early-life experiences may promote stereotyped behavioral alterations that are dynamic across development time, but also behavioral responses that are variable among individuals, even when initially exposed to the same stimulus. Here, by utilizing longitudinal monitoring of C. elegans individuals throughout development we show that behavioral effects of early-life starvation are exposed during early and late developmental stages and buffered during intermediate stages of development. We further found that both dopamine and serotonin shape the discontinuous behavioral responses by opposite and temporally segregated functions across development time. While dopamine buffers behavioral responses during intermediate developmental stages, serotonin promotes behavioral sensitivity to stress during early and late stages. Interestingly, unsupervised analysis of individual biases across development uncovered multiple individuality types that coexist within stressed and unstressed populations and further identified experience-dependent effects on their composition. These results provide insight into the complex temporal regulation of behavioral plasticity across developmental timescales, structuring shared and unique individual responses to early-life experiences.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Removal of reinforcement improves instrumental performance in humans by decreasing a general action bias rather than unmasking learnt associations</a></h4>

              
                Performance during instrumental learning is commonly believed to reflect the knowledge that has been acquired up to that point. However, recent work in rodents found that instrumental performance was enhanced during periods when reinforcement was withheld, relative to periods when reinforcement was provided. This suggests that reinforcement may mask acquired knowledge and lead to impaired performance. In the present study, we investigated whether such a beneficial effect of removing reinforcement translates to humans. Specifically, we tested whether performance during learning was improved during non-reinforced relative to reinforced task periods using signal detection theory and a computational modelling approach. To this end, 60 healthy volunteers performed a novel visual go/no-go learning task with deterministic reinforcement. To probe acquired knowledge in the absence of reinforcement, we interspersed blocks without feedback. In these non-reinforced task blocks, we found an increased d', indicative of enhanced instrumental performance. However, computational modelling showed that this improvement in performance was not due to an increased sensitivity of decision making to learnt values, but to a more cautious mode of responding, as evidenced by a reduction of a general response bias. Together with an initial tendency to act, this is sufficient to drive differential changes in hit and false alarm rates that jointly lead to an increased d'. To conclude, the improved instrumental performance in the absence of reinforcement observed in studies using asymmetrically reinforced go/no-go tasks may reflect a change in response bias rather than unmasking latent knowledge.

                Loss of function (LoF) of Tar-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) and mislocalization, together with TDP-43-positive and hyperphosphorylated inclusions, are found in postmortem tissue of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) patients, including those carrying LoF variants in the progranulin gene (GRN). Modeling TDP-43 pathology has been challenging in vivo and in vitro. We present a 3D-induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived paradigm - mature brain organoids (mbOrg) - composed of cortical-like-astrocytes (iA) and neurons (iN). When devoid of GRN, mbOrgs spontaneously recapitulate TDP-43 mislocalization, hyperphosphorylation and LoF phenotypes. Mixing-and-matching genotypes in mbOrgs showed that GRN-/- iA are drivers for TDP-43 pathology. Finally, we rescued TDP-43 LoF by adding exogenous progranulin, demonstrating a link between TDP-43 LoF and progranulin expression. In conclusion, we present an iPSC-derived platform that shows striking features of human TDP-43 proteinopathy and provides a tool for mechanistic modeling of TDP-43 pathology and patient-tailored therapeutic screening for FTD and ALS.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A common neural code for representing imagined and inferred tastes</a></h4>

              
                Inferences about the taste of foods are a key aspect of our everyday experience of food choice. Despite this, gustatory mental imagery is a relatively under-studied aspect of our mental lives. In the present study, we examined subjects during high-field fMRI as they actively imagined basic tastes and subsequently viewed pictures of foods dominant in those specific taste qualities. Imagined tastes elicited activity in the bilateral dorsal mid-insula, one of the primary cortical regions responsive to the experience of taste. In addition, within this region we reliably decoded imagined tastes according to their dominant quality (sweet, sour, or salty) thus indicating that, like actual taste, imagined taste activates distinct quality-specific neural patterns. Using a cross-task decoding analysis, we found that the neural patterns for imagined tastes and food pictures in the mid-insula were reliably similar and quality-specific, suggesting a common code for representing taste quality regardless of whether explicitly imagined or automatically inferred when viewing food. These findings have important implications for our understanding of the mechanisms of mental imagery and the multimodal nature of presumably primary sensory brain regions like the dorsal mid-insula.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Localized APP pathology in the hippocampus is sufficient to result in progressive disorganization of the timing of neuronal firing patterns</a></h4>

              
                Deficits in spatial navigation are among the early symptoms in Alzheimer's disease patients, consistent with the hippocampal formation as the site for spatial computations and disease onset. Although the correspondence between the early symptoms and brain regions that are affected early in the disease has been recognized, it is not clear whether progressive cognitive decline is solely caused by a spreading pathology or whether a focal pathology can by itself cause aberrant neuronal activity in a larger network. These possibilities cannot be distinguished in standard disease models which broadly express APP across brain regions. We therefore generated a mouse model in which the expression of mutant human APP was limited to hippocampal CA3 cells (CA3-APP mice). We first asked whether the limited pathology in CA3 can result in memory deficits and found impaired performance of CA3-APP mice in a hippocampus-dependent memory task. By then recording in the CA1 region, we asked to what extent neuronal activity patterns emerged in a brain region which received projections from APP-expressing CA3 cells, but did itself not show any primary pathology. While the spatial firing patterns of CA1 cells were preserved, we observed a reduced theta oscillation frequency in the local field potential and in a subpopulation of principal cells in CA1. Furthermore, CA1 interneurons showed decreased theta oscillation frequencies, and this effect was even more pronounced in CA3 interneurons, which also do not directly express APP. Pathology that is highly localized and limited to presynaptic cells is thus sufficient to cause aberrant firing patterns in postsynaptic neuronal networks, which indicates that disease progression is not only from a spreading molecular pathology but also mediated by progressive physiological dysfunction.

                Physical exercise has been positioned as a promising strategy to prevent and/or alleviate anxiety and depression, but the mechanisms underlying its effects on mental health have yet to be entirely determined. Although the prevalence of depression and anxiety in women is about twice that of men, very few studies have examined whether physical exercise could affect mental health differently according to sex. This study examined, in mice, the sex-specific effects of voluntary exercise on body weight, depressive- and anxiety-like behaviors, as well as different markers along the gut microbiota-immune-brain axis. Male and female C57BL/6N mice had voluntary access to running wheels in their home-cages for 24 days or were left undisturbed in identical home-cages without running wheels. Behaviors were then examined in the open field, Splash, elevated plus maze, and tail suspension tests. Gene expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, microglia activation-related genes, and tight junction proteins was determined in the jejunum and the hippocampus, while microbiota composition and predicted function were verified in cecum contents. Voluntary exercise limited weight gains, reduced anxiety-like behaviors, and altered grooming patterns in males exclusively. Although the exercise intervention resulted in changes to brain inflammatory activity and to cecal microbiota composition and inferred function in both sexes, reductions in the jejunal expression of pro-inflammatory markers were observed in females only. These findings support the view that voluntary exercise, even when performed during a short period, is beneficial for mental and intestinal health and that its sex-specific effects on behavior could be, at least in part, mediated by the gut microbiota-immune-brain axis.

                Neocortical layer 1 (L1) is a site of convergence between pyramidal neuron dendrites and feedback axons where local inhibitory signaling can profoundly shape cortical processing. Evolutionary expansion of human neocortex is marked by distinctive pyramidal neuron types with extensive branching in L1, but whether L1 interneurons are similarly diverse is underexplored. Using patch-seq recordings from human neurosurgically resected tissues, we identified four transcriptomically defined subclasses, unique subtypes within those subclasses and additional types with no mouse L1 homologue. Compared with mouse, human subclasses were more strongly distinct from each other across all modalities. Accompanied by higher neuron density and more variable cell sizes compared with mouse, these findings suggest L1 is an evolutionary hotspot, reflecting the increasing demands of regulating the expanding human neocortical circuit.

                Artificial perturbation of local neural activity in the high-level visual cortex alters visual perception. Quantitative characterization of these perceptual alterations holds the key to the development of a mechanistic theory of visual perception. Historically, though, the complexity of these perceptual alterations, as well as their subjective nature, has rendered them difficult to quantify. Here, we trained macaque monkeys to detect and report brief optogenetic impulses delivered to their inferior temporal cortex, the high-level visual area associated with object recognition, via an implanted LED array. We assumed that the animals perform this task by detecting the stimulation-induced alterations of the contents of their vision. We required the animals to fixate on a set of images during the task and utilized a machine-learning structure aiming at physically perturbing the viewed images in order to trick the animals into thinking they were being stimulated. In a high-throughput iterative process of behavioral data collection, we developed highly specific perturbed images, perceptograms, looking at which would trick the animals into feeling cortically stimulated. Perceptograms provide parametric and pictorial evidence of the visual hallucinations induced by cortical stimulation. Objective characterization of stimulation-induced perceptual events, besides its theoretical value, opens the door to making better visual prosthetic devices as well as a deeper understanding of visual hallucinations in mental disorders.

                Cortical circuits encoding sensory information consist of populations of neurons, yet how information aggregates via pooling individual cells remains poorly understood. Such pooling may be particularly important in noisy settings where single neuron encoding is degraded. One example is the cocktail party problem, with competing sounds from multiple spatial locations. How populations of neurons in auditory cortex (ACx) code competing sounds have not been previously investigated. Here, we apply a novel information theoretic approach to estimate information in populations of neurons in ACx about competing sounds from multiple spatial locations, including both summed population (SP) and labeled line (LL) codes. We find that a small subset of neurons is sufficient to nearly maximize mutual information over different spatial configurations, with the LL code outperforming the SP code, and approaching information levels attained without noise. Moreover, with a LL code, units with diverse spatial responses, including both regular and narrow-spiking units, constitute the best pool. Finally, information in the population increases with spatial separation between target and masker, in correspondence with behavioral results on spatial release from masking in human and animals. Taken together, our results reveal that a compact and diverse population of neurons in ACx provide a robust code for competing sounds from different spatial locations.

Deficits in social interactions in ASD animal models are generally analysed using the three chambers test paradigm that is simple to implement and use but fails to detect subtle social deficits or complex social behavior on an extended period of time within a group of mice. Here, we set up a novel procedure entitled the Live Mouse Tracker (LMT) that detects a great number of complex social behaviours that we recorded continuously for up to three days in groups of 4 mice. This was performed in the valproic acid (VPA) mouse model where VPA (450 mg/kg) was injected to pregnant females at E12.5. Studies were performed with a special focus on females given that ASD is 3-4 times more diagnosed in males than in females and that several ASD models failed to detect major social deficits in females, contrary to males. Comparisons were made within groups of 4 female animals with same treatment or within groups of different treatments (saline versus VPA). We report that VPA females show several types of social deficits and that are different in nature and magnitude in relation with time (from 1 hour to 3 days). These deficits were also different when VPA mice were tested together compared to when they were mixed with saline treated mice. Indeed, while social behavior was improved in VPA mice with the presence of saline mice while that of saline mice was negatively affected by the presence of VPA mice. This study indicates that female VPA mice show several social deficits, contrary to the common knowledge. It further implies that ASD related behavior alters normal behavior in a mixed group of mice.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Reward modulates visual responses in the superficial superior colliculus of mice</a></h4>

              
                The superficial layers of the superior colliculus (SC) are highly visual and receive direct input from the retina. Nonetheless, neural activity in the superficial SC (sSC) is modulated by locomotion and pupil-linked arousal. Here we show that visual responses of neurons in the sSC are additionally modulated by reward delivered prior to the visual stimulus. We trained mice to perform a visual detection task and recorded the activity of neurons in the SC using two-photon calcium imaging and electrophysiological recordings using high-density silicone probes (Neuropixels). Neurons across all layers of the SC responded to various task events, including reward delivery. However, responses to events like licking or movements did not explain the visual response modulation by reward. Electrophysiological recordings showed that most of the reward modulation occurred in the superficial rather than the deeper layers of the SC. Neurons also exhibited modulation by pupil-linked arousal, which was independent of the reward modulation. Performance of a population decoder to detect visual stimuli improved significantly by reward modulation but not by pupil-linked arousal modulation. Our results indicate that behavioural factors other than locomotion and arousal modulate visual activity in the SC.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Episodic long-term memory formation during slow-wave sleep</a></h4>

              
                We are unresponsive during slow-wave sleep but continue monitoring external events for survival. Our brain wakens us when danger is imminent. If events are non-threatening, our brain might store them for later consideration to improve decision-making. To test this hypothesis, we examined whether simultaneously sleep-played foreign words and translation words are encoded/stored and which neural-electrical events facilitate encoding/storage. A closed-loop algorithm targeted word pairs to slow-wave peaks or troughs. Retrieval tests were given 12 and 36 hours later. These tests required decisions regarding the semantic category of previously sleep-played foreign words. The sleep-played vocabulary influenced awake decision-making 36 hours later, if targeted to troughs. The words' linguistic processing raised neural complexity. The words' semantic-associative encoding was supported by increased theta power during the ensuing peak. Fast-spindle power ramped up during a second peak likely aiding consolidation. Hence, new vocabulary played during slow-wave sleep was stored and influenced decision-making days later.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A Process Model Account of the Role of Dopamine in Intertemporal Choice</a></h4>

              
                Theoretical accounts disagree on the role of dopamine in intertemporal choice and assume that dopamine either promotes delay of gratification by increasing the preference for larger rewards or that dopamine reduces patience by enhancing the sensitivity to waiting costs. Here, we reconcile these conflicting accounts by providing empirical support for a novel process model according to which dopamine contributes to two dissociable components of the decision process, evidence accumulation and starting bias. We re-analyzed a previously published data set where intertemporal decisions were made either under the D2 antagonist amisulpride or under placebo by fitting a hierarchical drift diffusion model that distinguishes between dopaminergic effects on the speed of evidence accumulation and the starting point of the accumulation process. Blocking dopaminergic neurotransmission not only strengthened the sensitivity to whether a reward is perceived as worth the delay costs during evidence accumulation (drift rate) but also attenuated the impact of waiting costs on the starting point of the evidence accumulation process (bias). Taken together, our findings support a novel, process-based account of the role of dopamine for cost-benefit decision making, highlight the potential benefits of process-informed analyses and advance our understanding of dopaminergic contributions to decision making.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cholinergic Modulation Shifts the Response of CA1 Pyramidal Cells to Depolarizing Ramps via TRPM4 Channels with Implications for Place Field Firing</a></h4>

              
                A synergistic combination of in vitro electrophysiology and multicompartmental modeling of rat CA1 pyramidal neurons identified TRPM4 channels as major drivers of cholinergic modulation of the firing rate during a triangular current ramp, which emulates the elevation in synaptic input received while traversing the place field. In control, fewer spikes at lower frequencies are elicited on the down-ramp compared to the up-ramp. The cholinergic agonist carbachol (CCh) reverses this spike rate adaptation, causing more spikes to be elicited on the down-ramp than the up-ramp. The non-specific TRP antagonist flufenamic acid and the TRPM4-specific blockers CBA and 9-phenanthrol, but not the TRPC-specific antagonist SKF96365, reverse the effect of CCh; this implicates the Ca2+-activated nonspecific cation current, ICAN, carried by TRPM4 channels. Modeling suggests that the IP3 receptor is the locus that requires both CCh and sustained depolarization to produce the rightward shift in firing rate along the ramp. In the model, a step change in IP3, representing the activation of muscarinic receptors by CCh, coupled with an increase in bulk [Ca2+] due to voltage-gated Ca2+ influx during the ramp, activates Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release (CICR). CICR in turn activates TRPM4, via a nanodomain required by the presumed micromolar half-activation for TRPM4.

	<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has become increasingly worse worldwide since it was discovered in China in late December 2019. Easy contact transmission between people and a low to moderate mortality rate may cause failure in medical health services if there is no proper personal protective equipment for personnel. During the pandemic, patients with acute ischemic stroke with large-vessel occlusion who required immediate treatment through mechanical thrombectomy (MT) were still being sent to the emergency room. Knowing how to maintain effective treatment standards has become our concern. We used a retrospective, single-center study to select COVID-19 (-) patients with acute ischemic stroke undergoing mechanical thrombectomy during the years 2020&amp;amp;ndash;2021. Patients with acute ischemic stroke with large-vessel occlusion received mechanical thrombectomy were compared with patients admitted from December 2020 to May 2021 (the pre- COVID-19 group) and those from June 2021 to November 2021 (the during COVID-19 group). Furthermore, the time disparity of mechanical thrombectomy was compared between these two groups. Of patients confirmed with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) with large-vessel occlusion (LVO) during the study period, 62 were included. Compared with the pre-COVID-19 group (34 patients; median age, 70.5 years), the during COVID-19 group (28 patients; median age, 71.5 years) showed no major median time difference in door-to-computed-tomography-angiography (CTA) time (19.0 min vs. 20.0 min, p = 0.398) and no major median time difference in door-to-groin-puncture time (118.0 min vs. 109.0 min, p = 0.281). In our study, with a prepared protocol for the pandemic having been established in the healthcare system, we could see no difference between the pre-pandemic and during-pandemic time periods when using mechanical thrombectomy to treat COVID-19 (-) patients of AIS with LVO. By means of a quick-PCR test during triage, there was no time delay to perform MT or any lowering of safety protocol for workers in the healthcare system.</p>

	<p>Epilepsy and migraine are among the most prevalent neurological disorders. By being comorbid, the presence of one disorder increases the likelihood of the other. Although several similar clinical features of epilepsy and migraine have been observed as early as the 19th century, only in recent years have researchers engaged in finding a common pathogenic mechanism between them. In this study, the epilepsy&amp;amp;ndash;migraine comorbidity rat model was generated, and the pathophysiological basis of epilepsy&amp;amp;ndash;migraine comorbidity was examined. Male rats were divided into four groups: control, migraine, epilepsy, epilepsy&amp;amp;ndash;migraine comorbidity. After establishing the models, the amount of scratching and the pain threshold of the rats were observed. Western blot and immunofluorescence staining were used to detect the protein expression levels of TLR4 and GABAAR&amp;amp;alpha;1 in the temporal cortex, hippocampus, trigeminal ganglion, and medullary dorsal horn. Subsequently, co-immunoprecipitation of GABAAR&amp;amp;alpha;1 and TLR4 was performed. Then, the rats were divided into three groups: comorbidity, comorbidity + TAK-242, and comorbidity + muscimol. After drug intervention, the seizure latency, seizure level, amount of scratching, and pain threshold were observed. Western blot was used to detect the protein expression levels of TLR4 and GABAAR&amp;amp;alpha;1 in the temporal cortex, hippocampus, trigeminal ganglion, and medullary dorsal horn. Our results demonstrate that the seizure attacks in comorbidity and epilepsy groups performed severely, and the comorbidity and migraine groups displayed a remarkable increase in the amount of head-scratching and a noticeable decrease in the facial mechanical withdrawal threshold. Further analysis revealed considerably increased Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), associated with reduced &amp;amp;gamma;-aminobutyric acid type A receptor &amp;amp;alpha;1 (GABAAR&amp;amp;alpha;1) and microglia enhanced in the epilepsy&amp;amp;ndash;migraine comorbidity rat. Additionally, co-immunoprecipitation proved GABAAR&amp;amp;alpha;1 binding TLR4. Following muscimol to activate GABAAR&amp;amp;alpha;1, seizure attacks and migraine-like behavior were rescued. GABAAR&amp;amp;alpha;1 level increment was accompanied by the decline of TLR4, while TAK-242, the inhibitor of TLR4, only decreased TLR4 without affecting GABAAR&amp;amp;alpha;1 expression. It also ameliorated the migraine-like behavior with no impact on seizure activity. We propose that GABAAR&amp;amp;alpha;1 binding and negatively regulating TLR4 contribute to epilepsy&amp;amp;ndash;migraine comorbidity; TLR4 is a critical intermediate link in epilepsy&amp;amp;ndash;migraine comorbidity; immune-induced neuroinflammation in microglia may be involved in migraine and epilepsy&amp;amp;ndash;migraine comorbidity.</p>

	<p>Recently, astrocytes are fast climbing the ladder of importance in cognitive-related diseases. Perioperative neurocognitive disorder (PND) is a common consequence of anesthesia and surgery, which is widely investigated in elderly and susceptible individuals. There is no doubt that astrocytes also play an irreplaceable role in the pathogenesis of PND. Reactive astrocytes can be found in the PND model, with an altered phenotype and morphology, suggesting a role in the development of the diseases. As a prominent participant cell in the central inflammatory response, the inflammatory response is unavoidably a crucial pathway in the development of the disease. Astrocytes also play a significant role in the homeostasis of the internal environment, neuronal metabolism, and synaptic homeostasis, all of which have an impact on cognitive function. In this article, we discuss the function of astrocytes in PND in order to establish a framework for investigating treatments for PND that target astrocytes.</p>

	<p>Background: Aggressive resection without compromising the patient&amp;amp;rsquo;s neurological status remains a significant challenge in treating intracranial gliomas. Our current study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of extra-operative stimulation and mapping via implanted subdural electrodes with or without depth (EOCSM), offering an alternative approach when awake mapping is contraindicated. Methods: Fifty-one patients undergoing EOCSM for glioma resection in our institution formed the sample study of our current retrospective study. We assessed the effectiveness and safety of our approach by measuring the extent of resection and recording the periprocedural complications, respectively. Results: The mean age of our participants was 58 years (&amp;amp;plusmn;9.4 years). The lesion was usually located on the left side (80.4%) and affected the frontal lobe (51.0%). EOCSM was successful in 94.1% of patients. The stimulation and electrode implantation procedures lasted for a median of 2.0 h and 75 h, respectively. Stimulation-induced seizures and CSF leakage occurred in 13.7% and 5.9% of our cases. The mean extent of resection was 91.6%, whereas transient dysphasia occurred in 21.6% and transient hemiparesis in 5.9% of our patients, respectively. Conclusions: Extraoperative stimulation and mapping constitute a valid alternative mapping option in glioma patients who cannot undergo an awake craniotomy.</p>

	<p>The present report from the field tries to present challenges associated with establishing healthcare services for individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) in a low- and middle-income area. The given case that has been highlighted is establishing daycare services focusing on rehabilitation and training services for individuals with ASD, and their caregivers and family members, in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq (KRI). Based on my experience, the associated challenges are divided into three primary levels: personal, professional, and organizational. The report highlights the importance of understanding the challenges associated with establishing healthcare services with the desire to put them under control. Plus, understanding the cultural aspects of the healthcare services for individuals with ASD experiences to address the issues at each level shared. It is concluded in the final part of the report that the key to establishing healthcare quality is to understand attitudes toward healthcare at the personal, professional, and organizational levels. This attitude determines the expectation from the services and defines assistance-seeking behaviors. Results offer insight for stakeholders in the healthcare field, allowing for a better understanding and improvement of availability and access to quality-driven healthcare services. A pre- and in-service training approach is practiced to address the associated challenges of establishing healthcare services at the personal level in KRI. A similar policy might be applicable in other LMICs, where there is a lack of professional and skillful healthcare service providers.</p>

	<p>(1) Background: Vestibular migraine (VM) and Meni&amp;amp;egrave;re&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (MD) share multiple features in terms of clinical presentations and auditory-vestibular functions, and, therefore, more accurate diagnostic tools to distinguish between the two disorders are needed. (2) Methods: The study was of retrospective design and examined the data of 69 MD patients, 79 VM patients and 72 MD with migraine patients. Five vestibular autorotation test (VAT) parameters, i.e., horizontal gain/phase, vertical gain/phase and asymmetry were subjected to logistic regression. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated to determine the accuracy of the different parameters in the differential diagnosis of MD and VM. (3) Results: Our results showed that the horizontal gain of VAT significantly outperformed other parameters in distinguishing MD and VM. In addition, the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of the horizontal gain were 95.7%, 50.6% and 71.6%, respectively, for the differentiation between VM and MD. In most MD patients, the horizontal gain decreased in the range of 3&amp;amp;ndash;4 Hz, while in most VM patients, horizontal gain increased in the range between 2&amp;amp;ndash;3 Hz. More MD with migraine patients had an increased horizontal gain when the frequency was less than 5.0 Hz and had a decreased horizontal gain when the frequency was greater than 5.0 Hz. (4) Conclusion: Our study suggested the VAT, especially the horizontal gain, as an indicator, may serve as a sensitive and objective indicator that helps distinguish between MD and VM. Moreover, VAT, due to its non-invasive and all-frequency nature, might be an important part of a test battery.</p>

	<p>Background: Alterations of hypothalamic&amp;amp;ndash;pituitary&amp;amp;ndash;adrenal (HPA) axis activity and serotonergic signaling are implicated in the pathogenesis of human obesity and may contribute to its metabolic and mental complications. The association of these systems has not been investigated in human obesity. Objective: To investigate the relation of HPA responsiveness and serotonin transporter (5-HTT) availability in otherwise healthy individuals with obesity class II or III (OB) compared to non-obesity controls (NO). Study participants: Twenty-eight OB (21 females; age 36.6 &amp;amp;plusmn; 10.6 years; body mass index (BMI) 41.2 &amp;amp;plusmn; 5.1 kg/m2) were compared to 12 healthy NO (8 females; age 35.8 &amp;amp;plusmn; 7.4 years; BMI 22.4 &amp;amp;plusmn; 2.3 kg/m2), matched for age and sex. Methods: HPA axis responsiveness was investigated using the combined dexamethasone/corticotropin-releasing hormone (dex/CRH) test, and curve indicators were derived for cortisol and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). The 5-HTT selective tracer [11C]DASB was applied, and parametric images of the binding potentials (BPND) were calculated using the multilinear reference tissue model and evaluated by atlas-based volume of interest (VOI) analysis. The self-questionnaires of behavioral inhibition system/behavioral activation system (BIS/BAS) with subscales drive, fun-seeking and reward were assessed. Results: OB showed significant positive correlations of ACTH curve parameters with overall 5-HTT BPND (ACTHAUC: r = 0.39, p = 0.04) and 5-HTT BPND of the caudate nucleus (ACTHAUC: r = 0.54, p = 0.003). In NO, cortisol indicators correlated significantly with BPND in the hippocampus (cortisolAUC: r = 0.59, p = 0.04). In OB, BAS reward was inversely associated with the ACTHAUC (r = &amp;amp;minus;0.49, p = 0.009). Conclusion: The present study supports a serotonergic-neuroendocrine association, which regionally differs between OB and NO. In OB, areas processing emotion and reward seem to be in-volved. The finding of a serotonergic HPA correlation may have implications for other diseases with dysregulated stress axis responsiveness, and for potential pharmacologic interven-tions.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Dignity in the care of older adults living in nursing homes and long-term care facilities [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Depending on the fields and actors involved, dignity may involve, signify, and encompass different meanings. This fundamental right can be subjectively experienced and rooted in a person's perception of being treated and cared for. Care refers to a set of specific activities combined in a complex life-sustaining network, including long-term Care, which involves various services designed to meet a person's health or personal care needs. However, older residents' human rights have been disrespected and widened the gaps between theory and practice regarding the precarious protection of their rights and dignity inside long-term facilities and nursing homes. This paper aims to discuss threats to dignity and elucidate some strategies to promote and conserve dignity in care, including the person-centered practice in long-term care. Some barriers to the dignity of older residents involve the organizational culture, restraints of time, heavy workload, burnout, and lack of partnership between the residents, their families, and the long-term care homes' staff. Person-centered integrated care quality frameworks are core components of a good quality of care in these spaces in high-income countries. Unfortunately, the COVID-19 pandemic highlighted how weak long-term care policies were and demonstrated that much progress in the dignity of care in long-term care facilities and nursing homes is needed. In low- and middle-income countries, long-term care policies do not accompany the accelerated and intense aging process, and there are other threats, like their invisibility to the public sector and the prejudices about this service model. It's urgent to create strategies for designing and implementing sustainable and equitable long- term care systems based on a person-centered service with dignity to everyone who needs it.

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Axonal Domain Structure as a Putative Identifier of Neuron-Specific Vulnerability to Oxidative Stress in Cultured Neurons</a></h4>

              
                <p>Several populations of neurons are purported to degenerate in Parkinson&rsquo;s disease (PD). One current hypothesis suggests that vulnerable neurons in PD share common characteristics including projecting to voluminous territories and having extremely long and branched axonal domains with large numbers of neurotransmitter release sites. In this study, we used a mouse <I>in vitro</I> culture system to compare the axonal domain of neuronal populations suspected to be vulnerable in PD to that of neuronal populations considered at a lesser risk. In the first category, we included dopamine (DA) neurons of the substantia nigra, noradrenergic neurons of the locus coeruleus (LC), serotonin neurons of the raphe nuclei (R), and cholinergic neurons of the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus (DMV). In the second category, we included DA neurons of the ventral tegmental area, cholinergic neurons of the hypoglossal nucleus, and cholinergic interneurons of the dorsal striatum. Validating their differential vulnerability, we find that, when compared with neurons presumed to be resilient in PD, a larger proportion of neurons presumed to be vulnerable in PD degenerate in response to cell stress induced by hydrogen peroxide. We also find that they are endowed with larger axonal domains, that are more complex, have more axonal varicosities with a higher proportion of varicosities that are positive for synaptotagmin 1 (Syt-1). Notwithstanding the obvious limitations related to the dissection of small brain nuclei and to the growth of these neurons <I>in vitro</I>, these findings support the hypothesis that axonal domain structure is a key characteristic of neuronal vulnerability to oxidative stress.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Blood-Brain Barrier Disruption in Preclinical Mouse Models of Stroke Can Be an Experimental Artifact Caused by Craniectomy</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>The pathophysiological features of ischemia-related blood&ndash;brain barrier (BBB) disruption are widely studied using preclinical stroke models. However, in many of these models, craniectomy is required to confirm arterial occlusion via laser Doppler flowmetry or to enable direct ligation of the cerebral artery. In the present study, mice were used to construct a distal middle cerebral artery occlusion (dMCAO) model, a preclinical stroke model that requires craniectomy to enable direct ligation of the cerebral artery, or were subjected to craniectomy alone. dMCAO but not craniectomy caused neurodegeneration and cerebral infarction, but both procedures induced an appreciable increase in BBB permeability to Evans blue dye, fluorescein, and endogenous albumin but not to 10 kDa dextran-FITC, leading to cerebral edema. Using rats, we further showed that BBB disruption induced by craniectomy with no evidence of dural tearing was comparable to that induced by craniectomy involving tearing of the dura. In conclusion, our data demonstrated that craniectomy can be a major contributor to BBB disruption and cerebral edema in preclinical stroke models. The implications of this experimental artifact for translational stroke research and preclinical data interpretation are discussed.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Mutation patterns of resistance genes for macrolides, aminoglycosides, and rifampicin in nontuberculous mycobacteria isolates from Kenya [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) treatment constitutes a macrolide-based antibiotic regimen in combination with aminoglycosides for Rapid-Growing mycobacteria (RGM), and rifampicin for Slow-Growing mycobacteria (SGM). Mutations in the anti-NTM drug target regions promote NTM evolution to mutant strains that are insusceptible to NTM drugs leading to treatment failure. We, therefore, described the mutation patterns of anti-NTM drug target genes including rrl, rrs, and rpoB in NTM isolates from Kenya.  Methods: We carried out a cross-sectional study that included 122 NTM obtained from the sputum of symptomatic tuberculosis-negative patients in Kenya. All the 122 NTM underwent targeted sequencing of the rrl gene. The 54 RGM were also sequenced for rrs, and the 68 SGM were sequenced for rpoB genes using ABI 3730XL analyzer. The obtained sequences were aligned to their wild-type reference sequences for each gene using Geneious then mutations were identified. Pearson chi-square at 95% confidence interval tested the association of NTM to mutation patterns for each gene. Results: Twenty-eight (23%) of the NTM were resistant to at least one of the antibiotics used in the macrolide-based treatment. Twelve (10.4%) of NTM were macrolide resistant, with 7(58.3%) of RGM and 5(41.7%) of SGM having mutations in the rrl gene. For ten (83.3%) NTM, mutations were found at position 2058, while for two (16.6%) NTM, mutations were found at position 2059. Six (11.1%) of the 54 RGM exhibited mutations in the aminoglycoside target gene rrs at location 1408. Ten (14.7%) of the 68 SGM were resistant to rifampicin, with 40 percent having mutations at codon 531 in the rpoB gene.   Conclusion: We demonstrated a significant level of drug resistance for macrolides, aminoglycosides and rifampicin in NTM isolated from symptomatic TB negative patients in Kenya.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Automated segmentation of endometriosis using transfer learning technique [version 2; peer review: 1 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: This paper focuses on segmenting the exact location of endometriosis using the state-of-art technique known as U-Net. Endometriosis is a progressive disorder that has a significant impact on women. The lesion-like appearance that grows inside the uterus and sheds for every periodical cycle is known as endometriosis. If the lesion exists and is transferred to other locations in the women’s reproductive system, it may lead to a serious problem. Besides radiologists deep learning techniques exist for recognizing the presence and aggravation of endometriosis. Methods: The proposed method known as structural similarity analysis of endometriosis (SSAE) identifies the similarity between pathologically identified and annotated images obtained from standardized dataset known as GLENDA v1.5 by implementing two systematic approaches. The first approach is based on semantic segmentation and the second approach uses statistical analysis. Semantic segmentation is a cutting-edge technology for identifying exact locations by performing pixel-level classification. In semantic segmentation, U-Net is a transfer-learning architecture that works effectively for biomedical image classification. The SSAE implements the U-Net architecture for segmenting endometriosis based on the region of occurrence. The second approach proves the similarity between pathologically identified images and the corresponding annotated images using a statistical evaluation. Statistical analysis was performed using calculation of both the mean and standard deviation of all four regions by implementing systematic sampling procedure. Results: The SSAE obtains the intersection over union value of 0.72 and the F1 score of 0.74 for the trained dataset. The means of both the laparoscopic and annotated images for all regions were similar. Consequently, the SSAE facilitated the presence of abnormalities in a specific region. Conclusions: The proposed SSAE approach identifies the affected region using U-Net architecture and systematic sampling procedure.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Online academic satisfaction during the COVID-19 pandemic in medical students: role of sleep, psychological issues, college adjustment, and digital skills [version 3; peer review: 1 approved, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The measures taken to contain the COVID-19 pandemic, led to significant changes in university education, resulting in the new normal standard of virtual teaching in many undergraduate medical schools worldwide. Therefore, the aim of this paper was to determine the factors related to academic satisfaction with virtual teaching in medical students during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A cross-sectional-analytical study was conducted on medical students at a private university in Peru, through self-reported questionnaires divided into sociodemographic data and variables of interest that could influence academic satisfaction during the pandemic. To evaluate possible factors related to academic satisfaction, stepwise regression models were performed for both sexes. Results: In total, data from 310 medical students, 117 males and 193 females, were analyzed. Academic satisfaction reached a score of 11.2 ± 2.9, which was similar in both sexes. The best regression model for males (AIC: 544.32; RMSE: 2.42; R2: 0.30) showed that adaptation to university life (favorable change) and depression (unfavorable change) explained 30% of changes in students' academic satisfaction. While in females (AIC: 907.59; RMSE: 2.49; R 2: 0.22) the model integrated favorable factors such as adjustment to college life and anxiety; while depression and poor sleep quality were unfavorable factors. Conclusion: Factors that contributed to academic satisfaction in medical students were determined in this study, which differed by gender. Thus, it is important to take into account the particularities of male and female medical students in order to improve their academic satisfaction during their university careers.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Genetics and functional significance of the understudied methamphetamine sensitive circadian oscillator (MASCO) [version 2; peer review: 2 approved]</a></h4>

              
                The last 50 years have witnessed extraordinary discoveries in the field of circadian rhythms. However, there are still several mysteries that remain. One of these chronobiological mysteries is the circadian rhythm that is revealed by administration of stimulant drugs to rodents. Herein we describe the discovery of this circadian rhythm and its underlying oscillator, which is frequently called the methamphetamine-sensitive circadian oscillator, or MASCO. This oscillator is distinct from canonical circadian oscillators because it controls robust activity rhythms independently of the suprachiasmatic nucleus and circadian genes are not essential for its timekeeping. We discuss these fundamental properties of MASCO and integrate studies of strain, sex, and circadian gene mutations on MASCO. The anatomical loci of MASCO are not known, so it has not been possible thus far to discover its novel molecular timekeeping mechanism or its functional significance. However, studies in mutant mice suggest that genetic approaches can be used to identify the neural network involved in the rhythm generation of MASCO. We also discuss parallels between human and rodent studies that support our working hypothesis that a function of MASCO may be to regulate sleep-wake cycles.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Engineering indel and substitution variants of diverse and ancient enzymes using Graphical Representation of Ancestral Sequence Predictions (GRASP)</a></h4>

Ancestral sequence reconstruction is a technique that is gaining widespread use in molecular evolution studies and protein engineering. Accurate reconstruction requires the ability to handle appropriately large numbers of sequences, as well as insertion and deletion (indel) events, but available approaches exhibit limitations. To address these limitations, we developed Graphical Representation of Ancestral Sequence Predictions (GRASP), which efficiently implements maximum likelihood methods to enable the inference of ancestors of families with more than 10,000 members. GRASP implements partial order graphs (POGs) to represent and infer insertion and deletion events across ancestors, enabling the identification of building blocks for protein engineering.
To validate the capacity to engineer novel proteins from realistic data, we predicted ancestor sequences across three distinct enzyme families: glucose-methanol-choline (GMC) oxidoreductases, cytochromes P450, and dihydroxy/sugar acid dehydratases (DHAD). All tested ancestors demonstrated enzymatic activity. Our study demonstrates the ability of GRASP (1) to support large data sets over 10,000 sequences and (2) to employ insertions and deletions to identify building blocks for engineering biologically active ancestors, by exploring variation over evolutionary time.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Modelling the first wave of COVID-19 in India</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Dhiraj Kumar Hazra, Bhalchandra S. Pujari, Snehal M. Shekatkar, Farhina Mozaffer, Sitabhra Sinha, Vishwesha Guttal, Pinaki Chaudhuri, Gautam I. Menon</p>

Estimating the burden of COVID-19 in India is difficult because the extent to which cases and deaths have been undercounted is hard to assess. Here, we use a 9-component, age-stratified, contact-structured epidemiological compartmental model, which we call the INDSCI-SIM model, to analyse the first wave of COVID-19 spread in India. We use INDSCI-SIM, together with Bayesian methods, to obtain optimal fits to daily reported cases and deaths across the span of the first wave of the Indian pandemic, over the period Jan 30, 2020 to Feb 15, 2021. We account for lock-downs and other non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), an overall increase in testing as a function of time, the under-counting of cases and deaths, and a range of age-specific infection-fatality ratios. We first use our model to describe data from all individual districts of the state of Karnataka, benchmarking our calculations using data from serological surveys. We then extend this approach to aggregated data for Karnataka state. We model the progress of the pandemic across the cities of Delhi, Mumbai, Pune, Bengaluru and Chennai, and then for India as a whole. We estimate that deaths were undercounted by a factor between 2 and 5 across the span of the first wave, converging on 2.2 as a representative multiplier that accounts for the urban-rural gradient. We also estimate an overall under-counting of cases by a factor of between 20 and 25 towards the end of the first wave. Our estimates of the infection fatality ratio (IFR) are in the range 0.05—0.15, broadly consistent with previous estimates but substantially lower than values that have been estimated for other LMIC countries. We find that approximately 35% of India had been infected overall by the end of the first wave, results broadly consistent with those from serosurveys. These results contribute to the understanding of the long-term trajectory of COVID-19 in India.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Understanding the impact of third-party species on pairwise coexistence</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jie Deng, Washington Taylor, Serguei Saavedra</p>

The persistence of virtually every single species depends on both the presence of other species and the specific environmental conditions in a given location. Because in natural settings many of these conditions are unknown, research has been centered on finding the fraction of possible conditions (probability) leading to species coexistence. The focus has been on the persistence probability of an entire multispecies community (formed of either two or more species). However, the methodological and philosophical question has always been whether we can observe the entire community and, if not, what the conditions are under which an observed subset of the community can persist as part of a larger multispecies system. Here, we derive long-term (using analytical calculations) and short-term (using simulations and experimental data) system-level indicators of the effect of third-party species on the coexistence probability of a pair (or subset) of species under unknown environmental conditions. We demonstrate that the fraction of conditions incompatible with the possible coexistence of a pair of species tends to become vanishingly small within systems of increasing numbers of species. Yet, the probability of pairwise coexistence in isolation remains approximately the expected probability of pairwise coexistence in more diverse assemblages. In addition, we found that when third-party species tend to reduce (resp. increase) the coexistence probability of a pair, they tend to exhibit slower (resp. faster) rates of competitive exclusion. Long-term and short-term effects of the remaining third-party species on all possible specific pairs in a system are not equally distributed, but these differences can be mapped and anticipated under environmental uncertainty.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Use of compressed sensing to expedite high-throughput diagnostic testing for COVID-19 and beyond</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Kody A. Waldstein, Jirong Yi, Myung Cho, Raghu Mudumbai, Xiaodong Wu, Steven M. Varga, Weiyu Xu</p>

The rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 has placed a significant burden on public health systems to provide swift and accurate diagnostic testing highlighting the critical need for innovative testing approaches for future pandemics. In this study, we present a novel sample pooling procedure based on compressed sensing theory to accurately identify virally infected patients at high prevalence rates utilizing an innovative viral RNA extraction process to minimize sample dilution. At prevalence rates ranging from 0–14.3%, the number of tests required to identify the infection status of all patients was reduced by 69.26% as compared to conventional testing in primary human SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal swabs and a coronavirus model system. Our method provided quantification of individual sample viral load within a pool as well as a binary positive-negative result. Additionally, our modified pooling and RNA extraction process minimized sample dilution which remained constant as pool sizes increased. Compressed sensing can be adapted to a wide variety of diagnostic testing applications to increase throughput for routine laboratory testing as well as a means to increase testing capacity to combat future pandemics.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Novel methods for estimating the instantaneous and overall COVID-19 case fatality risk among care home residents in England</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Christoper E. Overton, Luke Webb, Uma Datta, Mike Fursman, Jo Hardstaff, Iina Hiironen, Karthik Paranthaman, Heather Riley, James Sedgwick, Julia Verne, Steve Wilner, Lorenzo Pellis, Ian Hall</p>

The COVID-19 pandemic has had high mortality rates in the elderly and frail worldwide, particularly in care homes. This is driven by the difficulty of isolating care homes from the wider community, the large population sizes within care facilities (relative to typical households), and the age/frailty of the residents. To quantify the mortality risk posed by disease, the case fatality risk (CFR) is an important tool. This quantifies the proportion of cases that result in death. Throughout the pandemic, CFR amongst care home residents in England has been monitored closely. To estimate CFR, we apply both novel and existing methods to data on deaths in care homes, collected by Public Health England and the Care Quality Commission. We compare these different methods, evaluating their relative strengths and weaknesses. Using these methods, we estimate temporal trends in the instantaneous CFR (at both daily and weekly resolutions) and the overall CFR across the whole of England, and dis-aggregated at regional level. We also investigate how the CFR varies based on age and on the type of care required, dis-aggregating by whether care homes include nursing staff and by age of residents. This work has contributed to the summary of measures used for monitoring the UK epidemic.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Structural spine plasticity: Learning and forgetting of odor-specific subnetworks in the olfactory bulb</a></h4>

              
                <p>by John Hongyu Meng, Hermann Riecke</p>

Learning to discriminate between different sensory stimuli is essential for survival. In rodents, the olfactory bulb, which contributes to odor discrimination via pattern separation, exhibits extensive structural synaptic plasticity involving the formation and removal of synaptic spines, even in adult animals. The network connectivity resulting from this plasticity is still poorly understood. To gain insight into this connectivity we present here a computational model for the structural plasticity of the reciprocal synapses between the dominant population of excitatory principal neurons and inhibitory interneurons. It incorporates the observed modulation of spine stability by odor exposure. The model captures the striking experimental observation that the exposure to odors does not always enhance their discriminability: while training with similar odors enhanced their discriminability, training with dissimilar odors actually <i>reduced</i> the discriminability of the training stimuli. Strikingly, this differential learning does not require the activity-dependence of the spine stability and occurs also in a model with purely random spine dynamics in which the spine density is changed homogeneously, e.g., due to a global signal. However, the experimentally observed odor-specific reduction in the response of principal cells as a result of extended odor exposure and the concurrent disinhibition of a subset of principal cells arise only in the activity-dependent model. Moreover, this model predicts the experimentally testable recovery of odor response through weak but not through strong odor re-exposure and the forgetting of odors via exposure to interfering odors. Combined with the experimental observations, the computational model provides strong support for the prediction that odor exposure leads to the formation of odor-specific subnetworks in the olfactory bulb.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Mechanics of lung cancer: A finite element model shows strain amplification during early tumorigenesis</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Rebecca G. Zitnay, Michael R. Herron, Keith R. Carney, Scott Potter, Lyska L. Emerson, Jeffrey A. Weiss, Michelle C. Mendoza</p>

Early lung cancer lesions develop within a unique microenvironment that undergoes constant cyclic stretch from respiration. While tumor stiffening is an established driver of tumor progression, the contribution of stress and strain to lung cancer is unknown. We developed tissue scale finite element models of lung tissue to test how early lesions alter respiration-induced strain. We found that an early tumor, represented as alveolar filling, amplified the strain experienced in the adjacent alveolar walls. Tumor stiffening further increased the amplitude of the strain in the adjacent alveolar walls and extended the strain amplification deeper into the normal lung. In contrast, the strain experienced in the tumor proper was less than the applied strain, although regions of amplification appeared at the tumor edge. Measurements of the alveolar wall thickness in clinical and mouse model samples of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) showed wall thickening adjacent to the tumors, consistent with cellular response to strain. Modeling alveolar wall thickening by encircling the tumor with thickened walls moved the strain amplification radially outward, to the next adjacent alveolus. Simulating iterative thickening in response to amplified strain produced tracks of thickened walls. We observed such tracks in early-stage clinical samples. The tracks were populated with invading tumor cells, suggesting that strain amplification in very early lung lesions could guide pro-invasive remodeling of the tumor microenvironment. The simulation results and tumor measurements suggest that cells at the edge of a lung tumor and in surrounding alveolar walls experience increased strain during respiration that could promote tumor progression.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Phosphoinositide species and filamentous actin formation mediate engulfment by senescent tumor cells</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Wesley D. Frey, Ashlyn Y. Anderson, Hyemin Lee, Julie B. Nguyen, Emma L. Cowles, Hua Lu, James G. Jackson</p>

Cancer cells survive chemotherapy and cause lethal relapse by entering a senescent state that facilitates expression of many phagocytosis/macrophage-related genes that engender a novel cannibalism phenotype. We used biosensors and live-cell imaging to reveal the basic steps and mechanisms of engulfment by senescent human and mouse tumor cells. We show filamentous actin in predator cells was localized to the prey cell throughout the process of engulfment. Biosensors to various phosphoinositide (PI) species revealed increased concentration and distinct localization of predator PI(4) P and PI(4,5)P2 at the prey cell during early stages of engulfment, followed by a transient burst of PI(3) P before and following internalization. PIK3C2B, the kinase responsible for generating PI(3)P, was required for complete engulfment. Inhibition or knockdown of Clathrin, known to associate with PIK3C2B and PI(4,5)P2, severely impaired engulfment. In sum, our data reveal the most fundamental cellular processes of senescent cell engulfment, including the precise localizations and dynamics of actin and PI species throughout the entire process.

                Background: Cardiovascular involvement is not well studied in children with sickle cell disease. The aim of this study was to evaluate the echocardiographic parameters and to investigate speckle tracking echocardiography (STE) interest in detecting subclinical myocardial impairment of children with sickle cell disease. Methods: The study was directed in the echocardiographic laboratory in the military hospital of Tunis between July 2018 and December 2018. 30 patients with sickle cell anemia (SCA) and 30 controls were compared. The echocardiographic measurements were indexed according to body surface. Cardiac output, left ventricular ejection fraction, wall thickness, as well as LV 2-D longitudinal systolic strain were assessed. Results: The SCA Group included 30 patients (11.8 ± 2yrs, sex ratio: 1.31) with homozygous SCA and the C Group included 30 healthy controls (12.7 ± 1,2yrs, sex ratio: 1.27). According to the findings, SCA Group showed significantly larger LV diameter (36.2±2.5mm/m2 vs 29.3±1.3mm/m2, p=0.005). SCA Group also showed lower LV ejection fraction (62%±0.5 vs 65%±5, p=0.001). No significant difference was observed for cardiac output (p=0.4). Otherwise, two-dimensional longitudinal strain of LV was higher in SCA group (-21%±3.07 vs -25%±2.98; p<0.01). Conclusions: Our study highlights several cardiac abnormalities in children with SCA, which could represent a marker of disease severity and point out the importance of the cardiologic screening of these patients.

                Tropical sprue (TS) is a post-infective disease of the small bowel characterized by a malabsorption syndrome affecting tropics inhabitants and visitors. Diagnosis of TS remain challenging since it can be confused with common diarrheal diseases, especially in non-endemic areas. We report a Tunisian case of latent TS. A 58-year-old male with a history of chronic watery diarrhea, was admitted to the intensive care unit for confusion which was related to severe metabolic acidosis. Despite the neurological improvement after hydro-electrolytic resuscitation and acid-base disorders correction, the patient continued to have three to five loose stools daily. A nutritional assessment showed a malabsorption syndrome: iron, Vitamin B12 and folate deficiencies; normochromic normocytic anemia and hypoalbuminemia. Gastrointestinal endoscopy showed duodenal villous atrophy and biopsy confirmed subtotal villous atrophy with increased intraepithelial lymphocytosis and a thickened hyalonalized sub-epithelial basal lamina. Celiac disease was evoked, however the patient did not improve on a gluten-free diet and the celiac serology was negative. On re-interviewing, we discovered that the patient had spent two months in India three years prior. Given the travel history, clinico-biological and histological data TS was highly considered and a good response to a five-month antibiotic course combined to nutritional supplementation supported this diagnosis. Clinico-biological, endoscopic and histological findings were overlapping between TS and other malabsorption diseases, explaining diagnosis difficulties. TS should be systematically discussed in tropics visitors presenting with chronic diarrhea. Improvement after micronutrient and vitamin deficiencies replacement combined to a prolonged antibiotic course supports the diagnosis of TS.
