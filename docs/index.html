              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06592">The Neuroscientific Basis of Flow: Learning Progress Guides Task Engagement and Cognitive Control</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2409.06592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: People often strive for deep engagement in activities which is usually associated with feelings of flow: a state of full task absorption accompanied by a sense of control and fulfillment. The intrinsic factors driving such engagement and facilitating subjective feelings of flow remain unclear. Building on computational theories of intrinsic motivation, this study examines how learning progress predicts engagement and directs cognitive control. Results showed that task engagement, indicated by feelings of flow and distractibility, is a function of learning progress. Electroencephalography data further revealed that learning progress is associated with enhanced proactive preparation (e.g., reduced pre-stimulus contingent negativity variance and parietal alpha desynchronization) and improved feedback processing (e.g., increased P3b amplitude and parietal alpha desynchronization). The impact of learning progress on cognitive control is observed at the task-block and goal-episode levels, but not at the trial level. This suggests that learning progress shapes cognitive control over extended periods as progress accumulates. These findings highlight the critical role of learning progress in sustaining engagement and cognitive control in goal-directed behavior.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06325">Non-exchangeable networks of integrate-and-fire neurons: spatially-extended mean-field limit of the empirical measure</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2409.06325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of exchangeable or spatially-structured networks of $N$ interacting stochastic neurons can be described by deterministic population equations in the mean-field limit $N\to\infty$, when synaptic weights scale as $O(1/N)$. This asymptotic behavior has been proven in several works but a general question has remained unanswered: does the $O(1/N)$ scaling of synaptic weights, by itself, suffice to guarantee the convergence of network dynamics to a deterministic population equation, even when networks are not assumed to be exchangeable or spatially structured? In this work, we consider networks of stochastic integrate-and-fire neurons with arbitrary synaptic weights satisfying only a $O(1/N)$ scaling condition. Borrowing results from the theory of dense graph limits (graphons), we prove that, as $N\to\infty$, and up to the extraction of a subsequence, the empirical measure of the neurons' membrane potentials converges to the solution of a spatially-extended mean-field partial differential equation (PDE). Our proof requires analytical techniques that go beyond standard propagation of chaos methods. In particular, we introduce a weak metric that depends on the dense graph limit kernel and we show how the weak convergence of the initial data can be obtained by propagating the regularity of the limit kernel along the dual-backward equation associated with the spatially-extended mean-field PDE. Overall, this result invites us to re-interpret spatially-extended population equations as universal mean-field limits of networks of neurons with $O(1/N)$ synaptic weight scaling.

                arXiv:2308.06578v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Just like electrical engineers understand how microprocessors execute programs in terms of how transistor currents are affected by their inputs, neuroscientists want to understand behavior production in terms of how neuronal outputs are affected by their inputs and internal states. This dependency of neuronal outputs on inputs can be described by a state-dependent input-output (IO)-function. However, to reliably identify these IO-functions, we need to perturb each input and combination of inputs while observing all the outputs. Here, we argue that such completeness is possible in C. elegans; a complete description that goes all the way from the activity of every neuron to predict behavior. The established and growing toolkit of optophysiology can non-invasively capture and control every neuron's activity and scale to countless experiments. The information from many such experiments can be pooled while capturing the inter-individual variability because neuronal identity and function are largely conserved across individuals. Just like electrical engineers use transistor IO-functions to simulate program execution, we argue that neuronal IO-functions could be used to simulate the impressive breadth of brain states and behaviors of C. elegans.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13870">Multi-intention Inverse Q-learning for Interpretable Behavior Representation</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2311.13870v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In advancing the understanding of natural decision-making processes, inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) methods have proven instrumental in reconstructing animal's intentions underlying complex behaviors. Given the recent development of a continuous-time multi-intention IRL framework, there has been persistent inquiry into inferring discrete time-varying rewards with IRL. To address this challenge, we introduce the class of hierarchical inverse Q-learning (HIQL) algorithms. Through an unsupervised learning process, HIQL divides expert trajectories into multiple intention segments, and solves the IRL problem independently for each. Applying HIQL to simulated experiments and several real animal behavior datasets, our approach outperforms current benchmarks in behavior prediction and produces interpretable reward functions. Our results suggest that the intention transition dynamics underlying complex decision-making behavior is better modeled by a step function instead of a smoothly varying function. This advancement holds promise for neuroscience and cognitive science, contributing to a deeper understanding of decision-making and uncovering underlying brain mechanisms.

                arXiv:2404.00785v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive study focused on disentangling hippocampal shape variations from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) datasets within the context of neurological disorders. Leveraging a Graph Variational Autoencoder (VAE) enhanced with Supervised Contrastive Learning, our approach aims to improve interpretability by disentangling two distinct latent variables corresponding to age and the presence of diseases. In our ablation study, we investigate a range of VAE architectures and contrastive loss functions, showcasing the enhanced disentanglement capabilities of our approach. This evaluation uses synthetic 3D torus mesh data and real 3D hippocampal mesh datasets derived from the DTI hippocampal dataset. Our supervised disentanglement model outperforms several state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods like attribute and guided VAEs in terms of disentanglement scores. Our model distinguishes between age groups and disease status in patients with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) using the hippocampus data. Our Graph VAE with Supervised Contrastive Learning shows the volume changes of the hippocampus of MS populations at different ages, and the result is consistent with the current neuroimaging literature. This research provides valuable insights into the relationship between neurological disorder and hippocampal shape changes in different age groups of MS populations using a Graph VAE with Supervised Contrastive loss.

                arXiv:2106.03580v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Schemas are knowledge structures that can enable rapid learning. Rodent one-shot learning in a multiple paired association navigation task has been postulated to be schema-dependent. We still only poorly understand how schemas, conceptualized at Marr's computational level, are neurally implemented. Moreover, a biologically plausible computational model of the rodent learning has not been demonstrated. Accordingly, we here compose an agent from schemas with biologically plausible neural implementations. The agent gradually learns a metric representation of its environment using a path integration temporal difference error, allowing it to localize in any environment. Additionally, the agent contains an associative memory that can stably form numerous one-shot associations between sensory cues and goal coordinates, implemented with a feedforward layer or a reservoir of recurrently connected neurons whose plastic output weights are governed by a 4-factor reward-modulated Exploratory Hebbian (EH) rule. A third network performs vector subtraction between the agent's current and goal location to decide the direction of movement. We further show that schemas supplemented by an actor-critic allows the agent to succeed even if an obstacle prevents direct heading, and that temporal-difference learning of a working memory gating mechanism enables one-shot learning despite distractors. Our agent recapitulates learning behavior observed in experiments and provides testable predictions that can be probed in future experiments.

                arXiv:2409.05989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Alzheimer's Disease is an incurable cognitive condition that affects thousands of people globally. While some diagnostic methods exist for Alzheimer's Disease, many of these methods cannot detect Alzheimer's in its earlier stages. Recently, researchers have explored the use of Electroencephalogram (EEG) technology for diagnosing Alzheimer's. EEG is a noninvasive method of recording the brain's electrical signals, and EEG data has shown distinct differences between patients with and without Alzheimer's. In the past, Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) have been used to predict Alzheimer's from EEG data, but these models sometimes produce false positive diagnoses. This study aims to compare losses between ANNs and Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) across multiple types of epochs, learning rates, and nodes. The results show that across these different parameters, ANNs are more accurate in predicting Alzheimer's Disease from EEG signals.

                arXiv:2310.06488v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have emerged as a promising alternative to conventional Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), demonstrating comparable performance in both visual and linguistic tasks while offering the advantage of improved energy efficiency. Despite these advancements, the integration of linguistic and visual features into a unified representation through spike trains poses a significant challenge, and the application of SNNs to multimodal scenarios remains largely unexplored. This paper presents SpikeCLIP, a novel framework designed to bridge the modality gap in spike-based computation. Our approach employs a two-step recipe: an ``alignment pre-training'' to align features across modalities, followed by a ``dual-loss fine-tuning'' to refine the model's performance. Extensive experiments reveal that SNNs achieve results on par with ANNs while substantially reducing energy consumption across various datasets commonly used for multimodal model evaluation. Furthermore, SpikeCLIP maintains robust image classification capabilities, even when dealing with classes that fall outside predefined categories. This study marks a significant advancement in the development of energy-efficient and biologically plausible multimodal learning systems.

                arXiv:2406.02765v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence techniques are increasingly being applied to solve control problems, but often rely on black-box methods without transparent output generation. To improve the interpretability and transparency in control systems, models can be defined as white-box symbolic policies described by mathematical expressions. While current approaches to learn symbolic policies focus on static policies that directly map observations to control signals, these may fail in partially observable and volatile environments. We instead consider dynamic symbolic policies with memory, optimised with genetic programming. The resulting policies are robust, and consist of easy to interpret coupled differential equations. Our results show that dynamic symbolic policies compare with black-box policies on a variety of control tasks. Furthermore, the benefit of the memory in dynamic policies is demonstrated on experiments where static policies fall short. Overall, we present a method for evolving high-performing symbolic policies that offer interpretability and transparency, which lacks in black-box models.

Abstract: As a promising framework for resolving partial differential equations (PDEs), physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have received widespread attention from industrial and scientific fields. However, lack of expressive ability and initialization pathology issues are found to prevent the application of PINNs in complex PDEs. In this work, we propose Deeper Physics-Informed Neural Network (Deeper-PINN) to resolve these issues. The element-wise multiplication operation is adopted to transform features into high-dimensional, non-linear spaces. Benefiting from element-wise multiplication operation, Deeper-PINNs can alleviate the initialization pathologies of PINNs and enhance the expressive capability of PINNs. The proposed structure is verified on various benchmarks. The results show that Deeper-PINNs can effectively resolve the initialization pathology and exhibit strong expressive ability.

                <p>Alteration of synaptic function in the dorsal horn (DH) has been implicated as a cellular substrate for the development of neuropathic pain, but certain details remain unclear. In particular, the lack of information on the types of synapses that undergo functional changes hinders the understanding of disease pathogenesis from a synaptic plasticity perspective. Here, we addressed this issue by using optogenetic and retrograde tracing ex vivo to selectively stimulate first-order nociceptors expressing Nav1.8 (NRs<sup>Nav1.8</sup>) and record the responses of spinothalamic tract neurons in spinal lamina I (L1-STTNs). We found that spared nerve injury (SNI) increased excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) in L1-STTNs evoked by photostimulation of NRs<sup>Nav1.8</sup> (referred to as Nav1.8-STTN EPSCs). This effect was accompanied by a significant change in the failure rate and paired-pulse ratio of synaptic transmission from NRs<sup>Nav1.8</sup> to L1-STTN and in the frequency (not amplitude) of spontaneous EPSCs recorded in L1-STTNs. However, no change was observed in the ratio of AMPA to NMDA receptor&ndash;mediated components of Nav1.8-STTN EPSCs or in the amplitude of unitary EPSCs constituting Nav1.8-STTN EPSCs recorded with extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> replaced by Sr<sup>2+</sup>. In addition, there was a small increase (approximately 10%) in the number of L1-STTNs showing immunoreactivity for phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinases in mice after SNI compared with sham. Similarly, only a small percentage of L1-STTNs showed a lower action potential threshold after SNI. In conclusion, our results show that SNI induces presynaptic modulation at NR<sup>Nav1.8</sup> (consisting of both peptidergic and nonpeptidergic nociceptors) synapses on L1-STTNs forming the lateral spinothalamic tract.</p>

                <p>Ionic current levels of identified neurons vary substantially across individual animals. Yet, under similar conditions, neural circuit output can be remarkably similar, as evidenced in many motor systems. All neural circuits are influenced by multiple neuromodulators, which provide flexibility to their output. These neuromodulators often overlap in their actions by modulating the same channel type or synapse, yet have neuron-specific actions resulting from distinct receptor expression. Because of this different receptor expression pattern, in the presence of multiple convergent neuromodulators, a common downstream target would be activated more uniformly in circuit neurons across individuals. We therefore propose that a baseline tonic (non-saturating) level of comodulation by convergent neuromodulators can reduce interindividual variability of circuit output. We tested this hypothesis in the pyloric circuit of the crab, <I>Cancer borealis</I>. Multiple excitatory neuropeptides converge to activate the same voltage-gated current in this circuit, but different subsets of pyloric neurons have receptors for each peptide. We quantified the interindividual variability of the unmodulated pyloric circuit output by measuring the activity phases, cycle frequency, and intraburst spike number and frequency. We then examined the variability in the presence of different combinations and concentrations of three neuropeptides. We found that at mid-level concentration (30&nbsp;nM) but not at near-threshold (1&nbsp;nM) or saturating (1&nbsp;&micro;M) concentrations, comodulation by multiple neuropeptides reduced the circuit output variability. Notably, the interindividual variability of response properties of an isolated neuron was not reduced by comodulation, suggesting that the reduction of output variability may emerge as a network effect.</p>

                <p>Homeostatic plasticity represents a set of mechanisms thought to stabilize some function of neural activity. Here, we identified the specific features of cellular or network activity that were maintained after the perturbation of GABAergic blockade in two different systems: mouse cortical neuronal cultures where GABA is inhibitory and motoneurons in the isolated embryonic chick spinal cord where GABA is excitatory (males and females combined in both systems). We conducted a comprehensive analysis of various spiking activity characteristics following GABAergic blockade. We observed significant variability in many features after blocking GABA<SUB>A</SUB> receptors (e.g., burst frequency, burst duration, overall spike frequency in culture). These results are consistent with the idea that neuronal networks achieve activity goals using different strategies (degeneracy). On the other hand, some features were consistently altered after receptor blockade in the spinal cord preparation (e.g., overall spike frequency). Regardless, these features did not express strong homeostatic recoveries when tracking individual preparations over time. One feature showed a consistent change and homeostatic recovery following GABA<SUB>A</SUB> receptor block. We found that spike rate within a burst (SRWB) increased after receptor block in both the spinal cord preparation and cortical cultures and then returned to baseline within hours. These changes in SRWB occurred at both single cell and population levels. Our findings indicate that the network prioritizes the burst spike rate, which appears to be a variable under tight homeostatic regulation. The result is consistent with the idea that networks can maintain an appropriate behavioral response in the face of challenges.</p>

                Background Public tenders are vital for a country’s GDP and citizens’ quality of life, enabling public administration to achieve various goals. Developing and developed countries allocate over 10% of their GDP to public procurement. This highlights the significant societal support public tenders can provide, making it important to consider how they can further benefit society. Policy and implications Public procurement can achieve policy objectives and benefit society by selecting tenders based on criteria beyond price, such as economic advantage and social benefits. This approach, endorsed by EU directives since 2014, encourages innovation and socially responsible practices. Contracting authorities in the EU can use social, environmental, and qualitative criteria to determine the most advantageous offers. Poland’s Public Procurement Law (PPL) allows contract award criteria based on quality and price, including social aspects. Contracting authorities can specify criteria like employing marginalized groups, though these criteria often face scrutiny and legal challenges. Non-price criteria aim to enhance competition and achieve social, environmental, and economic goals. Recommendations EU and Polish laws permit and encourage using social aspects as contract award criteria in public procurement. However, contracting authorities must analyze priorities, risk balancing, time constraints, and departmental coordination to effectively implement these criteria. This approach can improve the social situation and support specific groups. Conclusions Public procurement significantly influences a country’s economy and quality of life, with EU and Polish laws allowing social criteria in contract awards. Directive 2014/24/EU supports tenders based on economic and social benefits. Poland’s PPL aligns with this, emphasizing marginalized group employment. Effective implementation fosters job creation, social integration, and improved living standards.

                Background: Breast and esophageal cancer are the most aggressive and prominent causes of death worldwide. In addition, these cancers showed resistance to current chemotherapy regimens with limited success rates and fatal outcomes. Recently many studies reported the significant cytotoxic effects of phenolic and terpene fractions extracted from various Prunus species against different cancer cell lines. As a result, it has a good chance to be tested as a complement or replacement for standard chemotherapies. Methods: The study aimed to evaluate the cytotoxicity of phenolic and terpene fractions extracted from Iraqi Prunus arabica on breast (AMJ13) and esophageal (SK-GT-4) cancer cell lines by using the MTT assay (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide). Analysis using the Chou-Talalay method was performed to assess the synergistic effect between the extracted fractions and chemotherapeutic agent (docetaxel). Moreover, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis was conducted for the quantitative determination of different bioactive molecules of both phenolic and terpene fractions in the extract. Results: According to the findings, the treatment modalities significantly decreased cancer cell viability of AMJ13 and SK-GT-4 and had insignificant cytotoxicity on the normal cells (normal human fibroblast cell line) (all less than 50% cytotoxicity). Analysis with Chou-Talalay showed a strong synergism with docetaxel on both cancer cell lines (higher cytotoxicity even in low concentrations) and failed to induce cytotoxicity on the normal cells. Important flavonoid glycosides and terpenoids were detected by HPLC, in particularly, ferulic acid, catechin, chlorogenic acid, β-sitosterol, and campesterol. Conclusions: In conclusion, the extracted fractions selectively inhibited the proliferation of both cancer cell lines and showed minimal cytotoxicity on normal cells. These fractions could be naturally derived drugs for treating breast and esophageal cancers.

                Abstract Background The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has had significant impacts worldwide, especially among older adults. Frailty is a determinant of susceptibility to morbidity and mortality due to COVID-19 in the elderly. This study aimed to determine frailty status and identify factors associated with the suburban elderly population in Cirebon Regency, Indonesia, after the one-year COVID-19 pandemic. Methods A cross-sectional study of community-dwelling individuals aged ≥ 60 years was conducted in Klangenan, Cirebon Regency, Indonesia, from March to June 2021. A questionnaire was used to determine the baseline characteristics of participants, healthcare access, comorbidity, and frailty status. The Ina-FRAIL scale was used to determine the frailty status (frail/non-frail). The chi-square test and logistic regression analysis were used to determine the association between independent variables and frailty. Results A total of 383 participants were recruited, with a median age of 67 (IQR 64-73) years. The prevalence of frailty in the present study was 10.2%. Multivariate analysis showed that age (OR 2.73; 95%CI 1.21-6.12), multimorbidity (OR 7.86; 95% CI 3.01-20.57) and financial dependence (OR 13.40, 95% CI 5.66-31.73) were significantly associated with frailty. Conclusion One-year COVID-19 pandemic has had a considerable burden on frailty among the suburban elderly population in Indonesia. The factors associated with frailty were age, multimorbidity, and financial dependence.

                Background Currently, there is no objective and quantified measurement for detecting blood clots during extraction socket hemostasis. It has relied solely on clinical observation, even when conducting clinical research by using extraction sockets as samples. This study aimed to assess the in vitro reliability and clinical-relevant validity of a new objective measurement providing quantified data called blood clot detection (BCD) using a standard capillary tube. Methods The in vitro part of the study was conducted using surplus blood samples from ten healthy participants. Two identical sets of blood samples in simulation reservoirs mimicking bleeding sockets were prepared for reliability tests. Then, the capillary tubes were concurrently placed in the reservoirs. The blood-filled distances were measured. The part of clinical-relevant validity study was conducted in sixteen extraction sockets from each healthy participant. Clinical observation and BCD measurement were evaluated by two calibrated assessors. The total duration of the assessment was a 30-minute. Results The distances of the blood-filled capillary tube were decreased by time. Test and retest reliability analysis of the BCD measurement showed an excellent intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.980 (0.968 to 0.988). The medians of blood-filled distance categorized by clinical observation into active bleeding, sluggish oozing, and clot formation were 13.0 mm (Q1 = 11.7, Q3 = 13.8), 5.6 mm (Q1 = 4.3, Q3 = 7.0), and 0.9 mm (Q1 = 0.5, Q3 = 1.3), respectively. The blood-filled distance of the clot formation group was significantly less than the active bleeding and sluggish oozing (p<0.001). Therefore, the BCD measurement also significantly indicated the completion of extraction socket hemostasis Conclusions A distance of blood-filled in capillary tube of 0.9 mm from the BCD measurement significantly ensured complete clot formation. The BCD measurement proved to be a quantified tool for objectively measuring hemostasis of bleeding socket.

                Background Ficus pertusa is a native species from intertropical America used for medicinal purpouses. However, despite its importance as ethnobotanical resource, there is poor chemical information about its extracts. Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate the phytochemical profile of the hydroalcoholic extract of F. pertusa barks through UPLC-MS/MS, as well as its phenolic and flavonoid content. Methodology The chemical identification was performed by Ultra-High Liquid Chromatography coupled to Mass Spectrometry, whereas the Total Phenolic content and Total Flavonoid quantification were measured through UV spectrometry. Results As a result, 19 substances were identified, which are mostly included within the group of condensed tannins, phenolic acids and flavonoids, such as procyanidins, chlorogenic acid and luteolin. Conclusion The identification of the main substances of F. pertusa’s bark and the measurement of its polyphenols content can guide the understanding of the pharmacological mechanisms involved in its ethnomedicinal uses.

                Background Reverse Transcriptase (RT) enzymes have been extensively utilized, especially in Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). Many viruses that cause infections worldwide contain ribonucleic acid (RNA), and for their molecular detection, it is essential to convert RNA to DNA using RT. This study aimed to create and characterize a thermostable Moloney Murine Reverse Transcriptase (MMLV-RT) enzyme by using consensus sequences from the latest MMLV-RT sequence database. Methodology The six latest sequences encoding MMLV-RT were retrieved from the NCBI website, and the consensus sequence was determined and cloned into the pET28a (+) vector. The vector was overexpressed in an E. coli expression system. The enzyme obtained was purified using Talon accept resin. The purified enzyme was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western Blotting. The enzyme performance was evaluated by performing PCR on 89 SARS-CoV 2 positive samples and 40 negative samples both in a concentrated state and at a dilution factor of x10−1. The performance was compared with that of the commercial enzyme, a commercial RT enzyme kit, and Superscript (Invitrogen). Results The enzyme was successfully expressed in E. coli. The concentration of MMLV-RT used was 0.313 mg/mL. The concentrated enzyme detected 98.9% of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, whereas the diluted RT enzyme detected 92.1% of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. In contrast, the diagnostic specificity was 98% for concentrated RT and 95% for diluted RT. This showed that the recombinant in-house MMLV-RT enzyme prototype could be used for the PCR amplification of viral RNA. (Figure 3) Conclusion We successfully produced a recombinant MMLV-RT enzyme whose performance was comparable to that of standard commercial reverse transcriptase (P <0.0001).

                The material extrusion process has been widely used to manufacture custom products. However, the surface texture varies due to the additive mechanism of the process, which depends on the layer height and surface orientation, resulting in varying average surface roughness values for inclined, flat and vertical surfaces. Different strand welding conditions result in non-uniform internal stresses, surface distortions, layer traces, weak bonding, non-uniform pores and material overflow. This paper comprehensively examines material extrusion process achievements in surface texture quality and studies and summarises the most influential processing parameters. Parameter effects are critically discussed for each topic; flat, inclined, and vertical surfaces. The results of this research help reduce post-processing.

                Tuberculous mastitis (TM) is a rare form of tuberculosis, occurring as a primary disease when there is no evidence of tuberculosis in other locations. There are no clear clinical features of TM, especially in the absence of a previous tuberculosis infection. Due to its unclear clinical picture, diagnosis is difficult, and it is often confused with breast carcinoma or pyogenic abscesses. The aim of this study was to report our experience and discuss the characteristics and diagnostic modalities in cases of primary TM in a tuberculosis-endemic area. Method A case series study was conducted at the Arifin Achmad Regional Hospital, reporting four cases of primary tuberculous mastitis in January 2024. The patients were women aged 24-41 years. Case presentation All patients presented with complaints of breast pain for the last 2 weeks to 2 months and complained of symptoms in the form of a lump in the breast that was reddish in colour and mastalgia. One patient was diagnosed during pregnancy, and one had a history of prior breastfeeding. One patient presented with FNAB results for breast carcinoma. The other patient complained of an ulcer on her breast. Physical examination revealed axillary lymphadenopathy in all patients. Histopathological examination revealed tuberculous mastitis in all patients and 1 with tuberculous mastitis, fibrocystic changes, and Atypical Ductal Hyperplasia (ADH). Conclusion Patients with tuberculous mastitis who visited our institution had symptoms similar to those of abscesses and breast cancer. The FNAC test is the most reliable, but false-negative results can occur. Diagnosis requires teamwork between the patient’s doctor, anatomical pathologist, and radiologist. This research requires a larger scale to describe actual conditions.

                Background Supply chain risk management is crucial for the consumer products industry due to its vulnerability to uncertainties and risks. This study investigates the relationship between supply chain risks and performance among SMEs in the ASEAN countries. Supply chain performance, defined as meeting end-customer demands, involves ensuring commodity availability, on-time deliveries, and maintaining sufficient inventory and capacity across organizational boundaries from raw materials to the final consumer. Methods The study utilized a sample of 385 entrepreneurs from the consumer products industry in ASEAN countries. The research was analyzed using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) to establish the correlation between supply chain performance and risks. Factors related to the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) for economic integration and regional trade agreements were incorporated to understand the diverse economic development, infrastructure, and regulatory environments across nations. Results The analysis revealed a strong correlation between supply chain risks and performance. Entrepreneurs in the consumer products industry should collaborate closely with governmental organizations to address the unique challenges posed by regulatory landscapes, cross-border logistics, and geopolitical risks within the ASEAN region. Adapting to cultural nuances and market variations, along with optimizing logistics and infrastructure, are crucial for successful supply chain risk management. Conclusions Effective supply chain risk management significantly enhances the performance of the consumer products industry’s supply chain. Entrepreneurs in this sector should align their strategies with regional and national governments to proactively address issues and mitigate risks. Continuous monitoring and adaptive measures are necessary to handle emerging risks in the dynamic market landscape. The study provides valuable insights for policymakers, suggesting that supportive frameworks and policies are necessary to bolster SME capabilities in risk management. By fostering a collaborative environment between the public and private sectors, ASEAN countries can enhance overall supply chain resilience. Future research could explore sector-specific risk management practices and their impact on supply chain robustness, underscoring the imperative for SMEs to adopt proactive and integrated risk management approaches to thrive in a complex and evolving economic environment.

Multiple myeloma (MM) is a hematological disease exhibiting aberrant clonal expansion of cancerous plasma cells in the bone marrow. The effects of treatments for MM vary between patients, highlighting the importance of developing prognostic models for informed therapeutic decision-making. Most previous models were constructed at the gene level, ignoring the fact that the dysfunction of the pathway is closely associated with disease development and progression. The present study considered two strategies that construct predictive models by taking pathway information into consideration: pathway score method and group lasso using pathway information. The former simply converted gene expression to sample-wise pathway scores for model fitting. We considered three methods for pathway score calculation (ssGSEA, GSVA, and z-scores) and 14 data sources providing pathway information. We implemented these methods in microarray data for MM (GSE136324) and obtained a candidate model with the best prediction performance in interval validation. The candidate model is further compared with the gene-based model and previously published models in two external data. We also investigated the effects of missing values on prediction. The results showed that group lasso incorporating Vax pathway information (Vax(grp)) was more competitive in prediction than the gene model in both internal and external validation. Immune information, including VAX pathways, seemed to be more predictive for MM. Vax(grp) also outperformed the previously published models. Moreover, the new model was more resistant to missing values, and the presence of missing values (<5%) would not evidently deteriorate its prediction accuracy using our missing data imputation method. In a nutshell, pathway-based models (using group lasso) were competitive alternatives to gene-based models for MM. These models were documented in an R package (https://github.com/ShuoStat/MMMs), where a missing data imputation method was also integrated to facilitate future validation.

                <p>by Ahmadou Sylla, Christine Chevillon, Ramsès Djidjiou-Demasse, Ousmane Seydi, Carlos A. Vargas Campos, Magdalene Dogbe, Kayla M. Fast, Jennifer L. Pechal, Alex Rakestraw, Matthew E. Scott, Michael W. Sandel, Heather Jordan, Mark Eric Benbow, Jean-François Guégan</p>

Pathogens such as bacteria, fungi and viruses are important components of soil and aquatic communities, where they can benefit from decaying and living organic matter, and may opportunistically infect human and animal hosts. One-third of human infectious diseases is constituted by sapronotic disease agents that are natural inhabitants of soil or aquatic ecosystems. They are capable of existing and reproducing in the environment outside of the host for extended periods of time. However, as ecological research on sapronosis is infrequent and epidemiological models are even rarer, very little information is currently available. Their importance is overlooked in medical and veterinary research, as well as the relationships between free environmental forms and those that are pathogenic. Here, using dynamical models in realistic aquatic metacommunity systems, we analyze sapronosis transmission, using the human pathogen <i>Mycobacterium ulcerans</i> that is responsible for Buruli ulcer. We show that the persistence of bacilli in aquatic ecosystems is driven by a seasonal upstream supply, and that the attachment and development of cells to aquatic living forms is essential for such pathogen persistence and population dynamics. Our work constitutes the first set of metacommunity models of sapronotic disease transmission, and is highly flexible for adaptation to other types of sapronosis. The importance of sapronotic agents on animal and human disease burden needs better understanding and new models of sapronosis disease ecology to guide the management and prevention of this important group of pathogens.

While most individuals suffer progressive disease following HIV infection, a small fraction spontaneously controls the infection. Although CD8 T-cells have been implicated in this natural control, their mechanistic roles are yet to be established. Here, we combined mathematical modeling and analysis of previously published data from 16 SIV-infected macaques, of which 12 were natural controllers, to elucidate the role of CD8 T-cells in natural control. For each macaque, we considered, in addition to the canonical <i>in vivo</i> plasma viral load and SIV DNA data, longitudinal <i>ex vivo</i> measurements of the virus suppressive capacity of CD8 T-cells. Available mathematical models do not allow analysis of such combined <i>in vivo</i>-<i>ex vivo</i> datasets. We explicitly modeled the <i>ex vivo</i> assay, derived analytical approximations that link the <i>ex vivo</i> measurements with the <i>in vivo</i> effector function of CD8-T cells, and integrated them with an <i>in vivo</i> model of virus dynamics, thus developing a new learning framework that enabled the analysis. Our model fit the data well and estimated the recruitment rate and/or maximal killing rate of CD8 T-cells to be up to 2-fold higher in controllers than non-controllers (p = 0.013). Importantly, the cumulative suppressive capacity of CD8 T-cells over the first 4–6 weeks of infection was associated with virus control (Spearman’s ρ = -0.51; p = 0.05). Thus, our analysis identified the early cumulative suppressive capacity of CD8 T-cells as a predictor of natural control. Furthermore, simulating a large virtual population, our model quantified the minimum capacity of this early CD8 T-cell response necessary for long-term control. Our study presents new, quantitative insights into the role of CD8 T-cells in the natural control of HIV infection and has implications for remission strategies.

Zebrafish have become an essential model organism in screening for developmental neurotoxic chemicals and their molecular targets. The success of zebrafish as a screening model is partially due to their physical characteristics including their relatively simple nervous system, rapid development, experimental tractability, and genetic diversity combined with technical advantages that allow for the generation of large amounts of high-dimensional behavioral data. These data are complex and require advanced machine learning and statistical techniques to comprehensively analyze and capture spatiotemporal responses. To accomplish this goal, we have trained semi-supervised deep autoencoders using behavior data from unexposed larval zebrafish to extract quintessential “normal” behavior. Following training, our network was evaluated using data from larvae shown to have significant changes in behavior (using a traditional statistical framework) following exposure to toxicants that include nanomaterials, aromatics, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), and other environmental contaminants. Further, our model identified new chemicals (Perfluoro-n-octadecanoic acid, 8-Chloroperfluorooctylphosphonic acid, and Nonafluoropentanamide) as capable of inducing abnormal behavior at multiple chemical-concentrations pairs not captured using distance moved alone. Leveraging this deep learning model will allow for better characterization of the different exposure-induced behavioral phenotypes, facilitate improved genetic and neurobehavioral analysis in mechanistic determination studies and provide a robust framework for analyzing complex behaviors found in higher-order model systems.

                <p>by Hamza Giaffar, Sergey Shuvaev, Dmitry Rinberg, Alexei A. Koulakov</p>

Understanding sensory processing relies on the establishment of a consistent relationship between the stimulus space, its neural representation, and perceptual quality. In olfaction, the difficulty in establishing these links lies partly in the complexity of the underlying odor input space and perceptual responses. Based on the recently proposed primacy model for concentration invariant odor identity representation and a few assumptions, we have developed a theoretical framework for mapping the odor input space to the response properties of olfactory receptors. We analyze a geometrical structure containing odor representations in a multidimensional space of receptor affinities and describe its low-dimensional implementation, the primacy hull. We propose the implications of the primacy hull for the structure of feedforward connectivity in early olfactory networks. We test the predictions of our theory by comparing the existing receptor-ligand affinity and connectivity data obtained in the fruit fly olfactory system. We find that the Kenyon cells of the insect mushroom body integrate inputs from the high-affinity (primacy) sets of olfactory receptors in agreement with the primacy theory.

                <p>by Richard J. Abdill, Emma Talarico, Laura Grieneisen</p>

In 2024, all biology is computational biology. Computer-aided analysis continues to spread into new fields, becoming more accessible to researchers trained in the wet lab who are eager to take advantage of growing datasets, falling costs, and novel assays that present new opportunities for discovery. It is currently much easier to find guidance for implementing these techniques than for reporting their use, leaving biologists to guess which details and files are relevant. In this essay, we review existing literature on the topic, summarize common tips, and link to additional resources for training. Following this overview, we then provide a set of recommendations for sharing code, with an eye toward guiding those who are comparatively new to applying open science principles to their computational work. Taken together, we provide a guide for biologists who seek to follow code sharing best practices but are unsure where to start.

Mitosis is an important process in the cell cycle required for cells to divide. Never in mitosis (NIMA)-like kinases (NEKs) are regulators of mitotic functions in diverse organisms. <i>Plasmodium</i> spp., the causative agent of malaria is a divergent unicellular haploid eukaryote with some unusual features in terms of its mitotic and nuclear division cycle that presumably facilitate proliferation in varied environments. For example, during the sexual stage of male gametogenesis that occurs within the mosquito host, an atypical rapid closed endomitosis is observed. Three rounds of genome replication from 1N to 8N and successive cycles of multiple spindle formation and chromosome segregation occur within 8 min followed by karyokinesis to generate haploid gametes. Our previous <i>Plasmodium berghei</i> kinome screen identified 4 <i>Nek</i> genes, of which 2, NEK2 and NEK4, are required for meiosis. NEK1 is likely to be essential for mitosis in asexual blood stage schizogony in the vertebrate host, but its function during male gametogenesis is unknown. Here, we study NEK1 location and function, using live cell imaging, ultrastructure expansion microscopy (U-ExM), and electron microscopy, together with conditional gene knockdown and proteomic approaches. We report spatiotemporal NEK1 location in real-time, coordinated with microtubule organising centre (MTOC) dynamics during the unusual mitoses at various stages of the <i>Plasmodium</i> spp. life cycle. Knockdown studies reveal NEK1 to be an essential component of the MTOC in male cell differentiation, associated with rapid mitosis, spindle formation, and kinetochore attachment. These data suggest that <i>P</i>. <i>berghei</i> NEK1 kinase is an important component of MTOC organisation and essential regulator of chromosome segregation during male gamete formation.

Virulence of apicomplexan parasites is based on their ability to divide rapidly to produce significant biomass. The regulation of their cell cycle is therefore key to their pathogenesis. Phosphorylation is a crucial posttranslational modification that regulates many aspects of the eukaryotic cell cycle. The phosphatase PP1 is known to play a major role in the phosphorylation balance in eukaryotes. We explored the role of TgPP1 during the cell cycle of the tachyzoite form of the apicomplexan parasite <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i>. Using a conditional mutant strain, we show that TgPP1 regulates many aspects of the cell cycle including the proper assembly of the daughter cells’ inner membrane complex (IMC), the segregation of organelles, and nuclear division. Unexpectedly, depletion of TgPP1 also results in the accumulation of amylopectin, a storage polysaccharide that is usually found in the latent bradyzoite form of the parasite. Using transcriptomics and phospho-proteomics, we show that TgPP1 mainly acts through posttranslational mechanisms by dephosphorylating target proteins including IMC proteins. TgPP1 also dephosphorylates a protein bearing a starch-binding domain. Mutagenesis analysis reveals that the targeted phospho-sites are linked to the ability of the parasite to regulate amylopectin steady-state levels. Therefore, we show that TgPP1 has pleiotropic roles during the tachyzoite cell cycle regulation, but also regulates amylopectin accumulation.

                <p>by Tim Rohe, Klaus Hesse, Ann-Christine Ehlis, Uta Noppeney</p>

Hallucinations and perceptual abnormalities in psychosis are thought to arise from imbalanced integration of prior information and sensory inputs. We combined psychophysics, Bayesian modeling, and electroencephalography (EEG) to investigate potential changes in perceptual and causal inference in response to audiovisual flash-beep sequences in medicated individuals with schizophrenia who exhibited limited psychotic symptoms. Seventeen participants with schizophrenia and 23 healthy controls reported either the number of flashes or the number of beeps of audiovisual sequences that varied in their audiovisual numeric disparity across trials. Both groups balanced sensory integration and segregation in line with Bayesian causal inference rather than resorting to simpler heuristics. Both also showed comparable weighting of prior information regarding the signals’ causal structure, although the schizophrenia group slightly overweighted prior information about the number of flashes or beeps. At the neural level, both groups computed Bayesian causal inference through dynamic encoding of independent estimates of the flash and beep counts, followed by estimates that flexibly combine audiovisual inputs. Our results demonstrate that the core neurocomputational mechanisms for audiovisual perceptual and causal inference in number estimation tasks are largely preserved in our limited sample of medicated post-acute individuals with schizophrenia. Future research should explore whether these findings generalize to unmedicated patients with acute psychotic symptoms.

Schwefel, Cock van Oosterhout, Hernán E. Morales</p>

The information contained in population genomic data can tell us much about the past ecology and evolution of species. We leveraged detailed phenotypic and genomic data of nearly all living kākāpō to understand the evolution of its feather color polymorphism. The kākāpō is an endangered and culturally significant parrot endemic to Aotearoa New Zealand, and the green and olive feather colorations are present at similar frequencies in the population. The presence of such a neatly balanced color polymorphism is remarkable because the entire population currently numbers less than 250 birds, which means it has been exposed to severe genetic drift. We dissected the color phenotype, demonstrating that the two colors differ in their light reflectance patterns due to differential feather structure. We used quantitative genomics methods to identify two genetic variants whose epistatic interaction can fully explain the species’ color phenotype. Our genomic forward simulations show that balancing selection might have been pivotal to establish the polymorphism in the ancestrally large population, and to maintain it during population declines that involved a severe bottleneck. We hypothesize that an extinct apex predator was the likely agent of balancing selection, making the color polymorphism in the kākāpō a “ghost of selection past.”

                Introduction Eosinophilic gastroenteritis is a rare disease characterized by gastrointestinal symptoms and peripheral eosinophilia. It can affect any layer of the gastrointestinal tract. Mucosal, muscular, and sub-serosal subtypes of eosinophilic infiltration are distinguished based on their infiltration depth. Ascites is a characteristic feature of sub-serosal eosinophilic gastroenteritis. However, isolated ascites is a very rare presentation of the disease, making diagnosis challenging. Case presentation In this case report, we present a 25-year-old female eosinophilic gastroenteritis patient who initially presented with symptoms and signs of ascites. She also reported seasonal rhinitis, which has been associated with eosinophilic gastroenteritis. She responded effectively to treatment with prednisolone. Conclusions This case report highlights the importance of considering rare diseases like eosinophilic gastroenteritis in the differential diagnosis of ascites. Treatment typically involves dietary modifications and corticosteroids. This case also contributes to our understanding of this rare initial presentation of the disease.

                Background Low back pain (LBP), the primary cause of disability, is the most common musculoskeletal disorder globally and the primary cause of disability. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies are inconclusive and less sensitive for identifying and classifying patients with LBP. Hence, this study aimed to investigate the role of artificial intelligence (AI) models in the prediction of LBP using T2 weighted MRI image of the lumbar spine. Methods This was a prospective case-control study. A total of 200 MRI patients (100 cases and controls each) referred for lumbar spine and whole spine screening were included. The scans were performed using 3.0 Tesla MRI (United Imaging Healthcare). T2 weighted images of the lumbar spine were segmented to extract radiomic features. Machine learning (ML) models, such as random forest, decision tree, logistic regression, K-nearest neighbors, adaboost, and deep learning methods (DL), such as ResNet and GoogleNet, were used, and performance measures were calculated. Results Our study showed that Random forest and AdaBoost are the most reliable ML models for predicting LBP. Random forest showed high performance with area under curve (AUC) values from 0.83 to 0.88 across all lumbar vertebrae and L2-L3, L3-L4, and L4-L5 intervertebral discs (IVDs), with AUCs of 0.88 the highest at L5-S1 IVD (0.92). Adaboost demonstrated high performance at the L2-L5 vertebrae with AUC values of 0.82 to 0.90, with the highest AUC (0.97) at the L5-S1 IVD. Among the DL models, GoogleNet outperformed the other models at 30 epochs with an accuracy of 0.85, followed by ResNet 18 (30 epochs) with an accuracy of 0.84. Conclusion The study demonstrated that ML and DL models can effectively predict LBP from MRI T2 weighted image of the lumbar spine. ML and DL models could also enhance the diagnostic accuracy of LBP, potentially leading to better patient management and outcomes.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Neurons establish functional connections responsible for how we perceive and react to the world around us. Communication from a neuron to its target cell occurs through a long projection called an axon. Axon distances can exceed 1 m in length in humans and require a dynamic microtubule cytoskeleton for growth during development and maintenance in adulthood. Stathmins are microtubule-associated proteins that function as relays between kinase signaling and microtubule polymerization. In this review, we describe the prolific role of Stathmins in microtubule homeostasis with an emphasis on emerging roles for Stathmin-2 (Stmn2) in axon integrity and neurodegeneration. Stmn2 levels are altered in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis and loss of Stmn2 provokes motor and sensory neuropathies. There is growing potential for employing Stmn2 as a disease biomarker or even a therapeutic target. Meeting this potential requires a mechanistic understanding of emerging complexity in Stmn2 function. In particular, Stmn2 palmitoylation has a surprising contribution to axon maintenance through undefined mechanisms linking membrane association, tubulin interaction, and axon transport. Exploring these connections will reveal new insight on neuronal cell biology and novel opportunities for disease intervention.</p>

                Stress-related disorders are among the biggest global health challenges. Despite significant progress in understanding their neurocognitive basis, the promise of applying insights from fundamental research to prevention and treatment remains largely unfulfilled. We argue that neurofeedback – a method for training voluntary control over brain activity – has the potential to fill this translational gap. We provide a contemporary perspective on neurofeedback as endogenous neuromodulation that can target complex brain network dynamics, is transferable to real-world scenarios outside a laboratory or treatment facility, can be trained prospectively, and is individually adaptable. This makes neurofeedback a prime candidate for a personalized preventive neuroscience-based intervention strategy that focuses on the ecological momentary neuromodulation of stress-related brain networks in response to actual stressors in real life.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93887">Individuals with anxiety and depression use atypical decision strategies in an uncertain world</a></h4>

              
                Previous studies on reinforcement learning have identified three prominent phenomena: (1) individuals with anxiety or depression exhibit a reduced learning rate compared to healthy subjects; (2) learning rates may increase or decrease in environments with rapidly changing (i.e. volatile) or stable feedback conditions, a phenomenon termed <i>learning rate adaptation</i>; and (3) reduced learning rate adaptation is associated with several psychiatric disorders. In other words, multiple learning rate parameters are needed to account for behavioral differences across participant populations and volatility contexts in this flexible learning rate (FLR) model. Here, we propose an alternative explanation, suggesting that behavioral variation across participant populations and volatile contexts arises from the use of mixed decision strategies. To test this hypothesis, we constructed a mixture-of-strategies (MOS) model and used it to analyze the behaviors of 54 healthy controls and 32 patients with anxiety and depression in volatile reversal learning tasks. Compared to the FLR model, the MOS model can reproduce the three classic phenomena by using a single set of strategy preference parameters without introducing any learning rate differences. In addition, the MOS model can successfully account for several novel behavioral patterns that cannot be explained by the FLR model. Preferences for different strategies also predict individual variations in symptom severity. These findings underscore the importance of considering mixed strategy use in human learning and decision-making and suggest atypical strategy preference as a potential mechanism for learning deficits in psychiatric disorders.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94198">Speech-induced suppression and vocal feedback sensitivity in human cortex</a></h4>

              
                Across the animal kingdom, neural responses in the auditory cortex are suppressed during vocalization, and humans are no exception. A common hypothesis is that suppression increases sensitivity to auditory feedback, enabling the detection of vocalization errors. This hypothesis has been previously confirmed in non-human primates, however a direct link between auditory suppression and sensitivity in human speech monitoring remains elusive. To address this issue, we obtained intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) recordings from 35 neurosurgical participants during speech production. We first characterized the detailed topography of auditory suppression, which varied across superior temporal gyrus (STG). Next, we performed a delayed auditory feedback (DAF) task to determine whether the suppressed sites were also sensitive to auditory feedback alterations. Indeed, overlapping sites showed enhanced responses to feedback, indicating sensitivity. Importantly, there was a strong correlation between the degree of auditory suppression and feedback sensitivity, suggesting suppression might be a key mechanism that underlies speech monitoring. Further, we found that when participants produced speech with simultaneous auditory feedback, posterior STG was selectively activated if participants were engaged in a DAF paradigm, suggesting that increased attentional load can modulate auditory feedback sensitivity.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94144">Distinguishing mutants that resist drugs via different mechanisms by examining fitness tradeoffs</a></h4>

              
                There is growing interest in designing multidrug therapies that leverage tradeoffs to combat resistance. Tradeoffs are common in evolution and occur when, for example, resistance to one drug results in sensitivity to another. Major questions remain about the extent to which tradeoffs are reliable, specifically, whether the mutants that provide resistance to a given drug all suffer similar tradeoffs. This question is difficult because the drug-resistant mutants observed in the clinic, and even those evolved in controlled laboratory settings, are often biased towards those that provide large fitness benefits. Thus, the mutations (and mechanisms) that provide drug resistance may be more diverse than current data suggests. Here, we perform evolution experiments utilizing lineage-tracking to capture a fuller spectrum of mutations that give yeast cells a fitness advantage in fluconazole, a common antifungal drug. We then quantify fitness tradeoffs for each of 774 evolved mutants across 12 environments, finding these mutants group into classes with characteristically different tradeoffs. Their unique tradeoffs may imply that each group of mutants affects fitness through different underlying mechanisms. Some of the groupings we find are surprising. For example, we find some mutants that resist single drugs do not resist their combination, while others do. And some mutants to the same gene have different tradeoffs than others. These findings, on one hand, demonstrate the difficulty in relying on consistent or intuitive tradeoffs when designing multidrug treatments. On the other hand, by demonstrating that hundreds of adaptive mutations can be reduced to a few groups with characteristic tradeoffs, our findings may yet empower multidrug strategies that leverage tradeoffs to combat resistance. More generally speaking, by grouping mutants that likely affect fitness through similar underlying mechanisms, our work guides efforts to map the phenotypic effects of mutation.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91002">DBT is a metabolic switch for maintenance of proteostasis under proteasomal impairment</a></h4>

              
                Proteotoxic stress impairs cellular homeostasis and underlies the pathogenesis of many neurodegenerative diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The proteasomal and autophagic degradation of proteins are two major pathways for protein quality control in the cell. Here, we report a genome-wide CRISPR screen uncovering a major regulator of cytotoxicity resulting from the inhibition of the proteasome. Dihydrolipoamide branched chain transacylase E2 (DBT) was found to be a robust suppressor, the loss of which protects against proteasome inhibition-associated cell death through promoting clearance of ubiquitinated proteins. Loss of DBT altered the metabolic and energetic status of the cell and resulted in activation of autophagy in an AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-dependent mechanism in the presence of proteasomal inhibition. Loss of DBT protected against proteotoxicity induced by ALS-linked mutant TDP-43 in <i>Drosophila</i> and mammalian neurons. DBT is upregulated in the tissues of ALS patients. These results demonstrate that DBT is a master switch in the metabolic control of protein quality control with implications in neurodegenerative diseases.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/88344">A three filament mechanistic model of musculotendon force and impedance</a></h4>

              
                The force developed by actively lengthened muscle depends on different structures across different scales of lengthening. For small perturbations, the active response of muscle is well captured by a linear-time-invariant (LTI) system: a stiff spring in parallel with a light damper. The force response of muscle to longer stretches is better represented by a compliant spring that can fix its end when activated. Experimental work has shown that the stiffness and damping (impedance) of muscle in response to small perturbations is of fundamental importance to motor learning and mechanical stability, while the huge forces developed during long active stretches are critical for simulating and predicting injury. Outside of motor learning and injury, muscle is actively lengthened as a part of nearly all terrestrial locomotion. Despite the functional importance of impedance and active lengthening, no single muscle model has all these mechanical properties. In this work, we present the viscoelastic-crossbridge active-titin (VEXAT) model that can replicate the response of muscle to length changes great and small. To evaluate the VEXAT model, we compare its response to biological muscle by simulating experiments that measure the impedance of muscle, and the forces developed during long active stretches. In addition, we have also compared the responses of the VEXAT model to a popular Hill-type muscle model. The VEXAT model more accurately captures the impedance of biological muscle and its responses to long active stretches than a Hill-type model and can still reproduce the force-velocity and force-length relations of muscle. While the comparison between the VEXAT model and biological muscle is favorable, there are some phenomena that can be improved: the low frequency phase response of the model, and a mechanism to support passive force enhancement.

                In birds and insects, the female uptakes sperm for a specific duration post-copulation known as the ejaculate holding period (EHP) before expelling unused sperm and the mating plug through sperm ejection. In this study, we found that <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> females shortens the EHP when incubated with males or mated females shortly after the first mating. This phenomenon, which we termed <span class="underline">m</span>ale-<span class="underline">i</span>nduced <span class="underline">E</span>HP <span class="underline">s</span>hortening (MIES), requires Or47b+ olfactory and ppk23+ gustatory neurons, activated by 2-methyltetracosane and 7-tricosene, respectively. These odorants raise cAMP levels in pC1 neurons, responsible for processing male courtship cues and regulating female mating receptivity. Elevated cAMP levels in pC1 neurons reduce EHP and reinstate their responsiveness to male courtship cues, promoting re-mating with faster sperm ejection. This study established MIES as a genetically tractable model of sexual plasticity with a conserved neural mechanism.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93604">Glial ferritin maintains neural stem cells via transporting iron required for self-renewal in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Stem cell niche is critical for regulating the behavior of stem cells. <i>Drosophila</i> neural stem cells (Neuroblasts, NBs) are encased by glial niche cells closely, but it still remains unclear whether glial niche cells can regulate the self-renewal and differentiation of NBs. Here, we show that ferritin produced by glia, cooperates with Zip13 to transport iron into NBs for the energy production, which is essential to the self-renewal and proliferation of NBs. The knockdown of glial ferritin encoding genes causes energy shortage in NBs via downregulating aconitase activity and NAD<sup>+</sup> level, which leads to the low proliferation and premature differentiation of NBs mediated by Prospero entering nuclei. More importantly, ferritin is a potential target for tumor suppression. In addition, the level of glial ferritin production is affected by the status of NBs, establishing a bicellular iron homeostasis. In this study, we demonstrate that glial cells are indispensable to maintain the self-renewal of NBs, unveiling a novel role of the NB glial niche during brain development.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95443">Mechanical force of uterine occupation enables large vesicle extrusion from proteostressed maternal neurons</a></h4>

              
                Large vesicle extrusion from neurons may contribute to spreading pathogenic protein aggregates and promoting inflammatory responses, two mechanisms leading to neurodegenerative disease. Factors that regulate the extrusion of large vesicles, such as exophers produced by proteostressed <i>C. elegans</i> touch neurons, are poorly understood. Here, we document that mechanical force can significantly potentiate exopher extrusion from proteostressed neurons. Exopher production from the <i>C. elegans</i> ALMR neuron peaks at adult day 2 or 3, coinciding with the <i>C. elegans</i> reproductive peak. Genetic disruption of <i>C. elegans</i> germline, sperm, oocytes, or egg/early embryo production can strongly suppress exopher extrusion from the ALMR neurons during the peak period. Conversely, restoring egg production at the late reproductive phase through mating with males or inducing egg retention via genetic interventions that block egg-laying can strongly increase ALMR exopher production. Overall, genetic interventions that promote ALMR exopher production are associated with expanded uterus lengths and genetic interventions that suppress ALMR exopher production are associated with shorter uterus lengths. In addition to the impact of fertilized eggs, ALMR exopher production can be enhanced by filling the uterus with oocytes, dead eggs, or even fluid, supporting that distention consequences, rather than the presence of fertilized eggs, constitute the exopher-inducing stimulus. We conclude that the mechanical force of uterine occupation potentiates exopher extrusion from proximal proteostressed maternal neurons. Our observations draw attention to the potential importance of mechanical signaling in extracellular vesicle production and in aggregate spreading mechanisms, making a case for enhanced attention to mechanobiology in neurodegenerative disease.

">Systemic injection of scopolamine increased the variability of temporal prediction in head-fixed mice.</a></h4>

              
                Several theories propose a close relationship between interval timing and the temporal properties of memory. Systemic administration of scopolamine, a muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist, is known to induce memory deficits and impair temporal prediction. However, existing studies on timing using free-moving animals are challenging to interpret due to the confounding effects of movement on interval timing. In this study, we examined the effects of scopolamine on timing behavior in mice using a head-fixed experimental setup. Mice were trained on a fixed-time schedule task with a peak procedure, where a 10% sucrose solution was delivered every 10 seconds through a spout placed within the licking distance of the mice. Following training, the mice exhibited anticipatory licking behavior in response to the timing of sucrose delivery, indicating that they could predict the reward timing. Systemic administration of scopolamine increased the variability of temporal prediction in a dose-dependent manner but did not affect the mean temporal prediction. Single-trial bout analysis revealed that scopolamine impaired the duration of licking bouts without affecting the total number of licks in peak trials, suggesting that the mice were unable to sustain licking at the spout. Additionally, we assessed the effects of scopolamine on spontaneous locomotor activity and excretion in a free-moving open-field task. Scopolamine injections increased locomotor activity and decreased fecal output. Taken together, these findings suggest that the increased variability in timing behavior induced by scopolamine may be attributed to changes in transitions between behavioral states.

">Generating human parvalbumin interneurons through 3D glia reprogramming</a></h4>

              
                Parvalbumin (PV) interneurons are crucial for synaptic plasticity, and their damage or loss is linked to various neurological disorders. Yet, generating these cells of human source in vitro is challenging, limiting advancements in cell repair and disease modelling. We introduce a novel approach to derive human PV neurons through direct reprogramming of glial precursor cells (GPCs). Using ectopic expression of GABAergic neuronal genes, GPCs efficiently convert into GABAergic interneurons in 3D culture environment within weeks and achieve functional neuronal maturity. Single-nuclei RNA sequencing identified a distinct PV neuronal cluster with high maturity and characteristics of PV chandelier subclass that are equivalent to bona fide human interneurons. Trajectory analysis revealed a distinct glia-to-PV interneuron conversion pathway, involving several new transitory genes, with potential for functional importance for PV derivation. Our data introduces a new strategy for generating human PV interneurons, promising significant implications for future generation of patient-specific PV neurons both in vitro and in vivo.

">Astrocyte ezrin defines resilience to stress-induced depressive behaviours in mice</a></h4>

              
                Astrocyte atrophy is the main histopathological hallmark of major depressive disorder (MDD) in humans and in animal models of depression. Here we demonstrated that manipulating with ezrin expression specifically in astrocytes significantly increases the resilience of mice to chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS). Overexpression of ezrin in astrocytes from prefrontal cortex (PFC) rescued depressive-like behaviours induced by CUMS, whereas down-regulation of ezrin in astrocytes from PFC increased mice susceptibility to CUMS and promoted depressive-like behaviours. These behavioural changes correlated with astrocytic morphology. Astrocytes from PFC of mice sensitive to CUMS demonstrated significant atrophy; similar atrophy was found in astrocytes from animals with down-regulated ezrin expression. To the contrary morphology remains unchanged astrocytes in animals resistant to CUMS and in animals with astrocytic overexpression of ezrin. Morphological changes also correlated with ezrin immunoreactivity which was low in mice with depressive-like behaviours and high in mice resistant to stress. We conclude that Ezrin-dependent morphological remodelling of astrocytes defines the sensitivity of mice to stress: high ezrin expression renders them stress resilient, whereas low ezrin expression promotes depressive-like behaviour in response to chronic stress.

">Riemannian Geometry for the Classification of Brain States with fNIRS</a></h4>

              
                Background: Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) has recently gained momentum as a reliable and accurate tool for assessing brain states. This increase in popularity is due to its robustness to movement, non-invasive nature, portability, and user-friendly application. However, compared to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), fNIRS is less sensitive to deeper brain activity and offers less coverage. Additionally, due to fewer advancements in method development, the performance of fNIRS-based brain-state classification still lags behind more prevalent methods like fMRI. Methods: We introduce a novel classification approach grounded in Riemannian geometry for the classification of kernel matrices, leveraging the temporal and spatial channel relationships and inherent duality of fNIRS signals-more specifically, oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin. For the Riemannian geometry-based models, we compared different kernel matrix estimators and two classifiers: Riemannian Support Vector Classifier and Tangent Space Logistic Regression. These were benchmarked against four models employing traditional feature extraction methods. Our approach was tested in two brain-state classification scenarios based on the same fNIRS dataset: an 8-choice classification, which includes seven established plus an individually selected imagery task, and a 2-choice classification of all possible 28 2-task combinations. Results: The novel approach achieved a mean 8-choice classification accuracy of 65%, significantly surpassing the mean accuracy of 42% obtained with traditional methods. Additionally, the best-performing model achieved an average accuracy of 96% for 2-choice classification across all possible 28 task combinations, compared to 78% with traditional models. Conclusion: To our knowledge, we are the first to demonstrate that the proposed Riemannian geometry-based classification approach is both powerful and viable for fNIRS data, considerably increasing the accuracy in binary and multi-class classification of brain activation patterns.

">DendroTweaks: An interactive approach for unraveling dendritic dynamics</a></h4>

              
                Neurons rely on the interplay between dendritic morphology and ion channels to transform synaptic inputs into a sequence of somatic spikes. Detailed biophysical models with active dendrites have been instrumental in exploring this interaction. However, such models can be challenging to understand and validate due to the large number of parameters involved. In this work, we introduce DendroTweaks -- a toolbox designed to illuminate how morpho-electric properties map to dendritic events and how these dendritic events shape neuronal output. DendroTweaks features a web-based graphical interface, where users can explore single-cell neuronal models and adjust their morphological and biophysical parameters with real-time visual feedback. In particular, DendroTweaks is tailored to interactive fine-tuning of subcellular properties, such as kinetics and distributions of ion channels, as well as the dynamics and allocation of synaptic inputs. It offers an automated approach for standardization and refinement of voltage-gated ion channel models to make them more comprehensible and reusable. The toolbox allows users to run various experimental protocols and record data from multiple dendritic and somatic locations, thereby enhancing model validation. Finally, it aims to deepen our understanding of which dendritic properties are essential for neuronal input-output transformation. Using this knowledge, one can simplify models through a built-in morphology reduction algorithm and export them for further use in faster, more interpretable networks. With DendroTweaks, users can gain better control and understanding of their models, advancing research on dendritic input-output transformations and their role in network computations.

">There is no Biophysical Distinction between Temporal Interference Stimulation and Direct kHz Stimulation for Actuation of Peripheral Nerves</a></h4>

              
                Temporal interference stimulation (TIS) has attracted increasing attention as a promising noninvasive electrical stimulation method. Despite positive results and optimistic expectations, the TIS field has been beset by misunderstandings concerning its mechanism of action and efficacy in safely targeting deep neural structures. Various studies posit that TIS exploits the interference of multiple supraphysiological frequency (kHz range) carriers to essentially deliver low-frequency stimulation at the intersection of the carriers, thereby circumventing limitations associated with tissue impedance and depth penetration. Due to the documented electrophysiological effects of kHz-range electric stimuli, such a picture is an oversimplification. Moreover, recent theoretical modelling work has established that the biophysics of TIS is based on kHz stimulation mechanisms. This paper presents experimental evidence supporting this conclusion, by comparing TIS with direct kHz stimulation on peripheral nerve targets in an invertebrate model (Locusta migratoria), and in human subjects. Our findings show that the stimulation effects of TIS are achievable through two-electrode kHz stimulation, without necessitating carrier interference in tissue. By comparing four-electrode TIS with two-electrode stimulation via kHz sine waves for targeting of peripheral nerves, we demonstrate overlapping strength-frequency (s-f) dependence across all stimulation types. Since all stimulation waveforms are governed by the same s-f curve, this implicates a common underlying biophysical mechanism. This equivalence challenges the notion that TIS uniquely facilitates neural engagement via other mechanisms. Furthermore, performing TIS with higher carrier frequencies into the MHz range fails to lead to stimulation. We evaluate the regions of tonic (unmodulated) and phasic (amplitude-modulated) stimulation regions inherent when using TIS, and the associated possibility of off-target effects. Our study further suggests that possible practical advantages of TIS can be achieved in an easier way by simply using amplitude-modulated kHz waveforms.

">A physiologically inspired hybrid CPG/Reflex controller for cycling simulations that generalizes to walking</a></h4>

              
                Predictive simulations based on explicit, physiologically inspired, control policies, can be used to test theories on motor control and to evaluate the effect of interventions on the different components of control. Several control architectures have been proposed for simulating locomotor tasks, based on fully feedback, reflex-based, controllers, or on feedforward architectures mimicking the Central Pattern Generators. Recently, hybrid architectures integrating both feedback and feedforward components have been shown to represent a viable alternative to fully feedback or feedforward controllers. Current literature on controller-based simulations, however, almost exclusively presents task-specific controllers that do not generalize across different tasks. The task-specificity of current controllers limits the generalizability of the neurophysiological principles behind such controllers. Here we propose a hybrid controller for predictive simulations of cycling based where the feedforward component is based on a well-known theoretical model, the Unit Burst Generation model, and the feedback component includes a limited set of reflex pathways, expected to be active during submaximal steady cycling. We show that this controller can simulate physiological cycling patterns at different desired speeds. We also show that the controller can generalize to walking behaviors by just adding an additional control component for accounting balance needs. The controller here proposed, although simple in design, represent an instance of physiologically inspired generalizable controller for cyclical lower limb tasks.

">CD300f immune receptor is a microglial tissue damage sensor and regulates efferocytosis after brain damage</a></h4>

              
                Microglia, the resident phagocytes of the central nervous system (CNS), continuously monitor the parenchyma and surrounding borders and are the primary responders to brain damage. CD300f is a lipid-sensing immunoreceptor present in the microglial cell membrane, which binds to phosphatidylserine and other lipid mediators. Defining the functional microglial sensome is critical to understand their function and cell state determination. Using intravital two-photon microscopy we show that microglia lacking the CD300f receptor fail to detect environmental damage cues after a laser ablation injury. After a mild traumatic brain injury or after the intracortical injection of apoptotic cells, CD300f-/- microglia showed reduced capacity for detecting and phagocytosing dyeing cells, leading to the accumulation of dead cells in the neural parenchyma. Moreover, at later timepoints, increased accumulation of dyeing cells was found inside CD300f-/- microglia in vivo and in bone marrow-derived macrophages in vitro, suggesting that these cells display a reduced capacity for metabolizing phagocytosed cells. Finally, CD300f deficiency increased functional compromise after a contusive traumatic brain injury, associated to increased conservation of brain tissue. Collectively, these results suggest that CD300f function as a damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) receptor that coordinates microglial process reaction towards tissue debris and highlights its central role in microglial sensome machinery and in the modulation of in vivo microglial efferocytosis.

                Semaglutide, a GLP-1 receptor agonist used primarily to regulate blood sugar and appetite, has been studied mostly in models of obesity and diabetes. Yet, little is known about its effects on healthy animals. In this study, daily dosing of semaglutide (0.01 mg/kg) in healthy C57BL/6JRj male wildtype mice led to noticeable changes in behavioural tests commonly used to evaluate stress and motivation. The mice showed increased jumping in the open field, reduced shredding of nestlets, less interest in sniffing female urine, and heightened activity in the forced swim test. These behavioural shifts may indicate potential side effects of semaglutide in healthy animals, providing a crucial baseline for understanding how the drug could affect conditions like obesity, addiction, or cognitive decline.

">Glia multitask to compensate for neighboring glial cell dysfunction</a></h4>

              
                As glia mature, they undergo glial tiling to abut one another without invading each other's boundaries. Upon the loss of the secreted neurotrophin Sptazle3 (Spz3), Drosophila cortex glia transform morphologically and lose their intricate interactions with neurons and surrounding glial subtypes. Here, we reveal that all neighboring glial cell types (astrocytes, ensheathing glia, and subperineurial glia) react by extending processes into the previous cortex glial territory to compensate for lost cortex glial function and reduce the buildup of neuronal debris. However, the loss of Spz3 alone is not sufficient for glia to cross their natural borders, as blocking CNS growth via nutrient-restriction blocks the aberrant infiltration induced by the loss of Spz3. Surprisingly, even when these neighboring glia divert their cellular resources beyond their typical borders to take on new compensatory roles, they are able to multitask to continue to preserve their own normal functions to maintain CNS homeostasis.

">Presence of distinct operant phenotypes and transient withdrawal-induced escalation of operant ethanol intake in female rats</a></h4>

              
                Operant self-administration is frequently used to investigate the neurobiological mechanisms underlying alcohol seeking and drinking and to test the efficacy of drugs under development for the treatment of alcohol use disorder (AUD). Although widely used by the research community, there is a paucity of operant ethanol self-administration studies that include female subjects. The current study characterizes home cage drinking and operant ethanol self-administration in female Sprague Dawley, Long Evans, and Wistar rats. Rats underwent three weeks of intermittent-access two-bottle choice home cage drinking before being trained to lever press for ethanol in standard operant chambers equipped with contact lickometers. After capturing baseline operant performance, rats were chronically exposed to control or ethanol liquid diet using the Lieber-DeCarli method. Operant ethanol self-administration was re-evaluated after chronic liquid diet exposure to determine whether female rats exhibit similar withdrawal-induced escalation of ethanol intake as is regularly observed in male rats. Our findings reveal the presence of three distinct operant phenotypes (Drinker, Responder, Nonresponder), the prevalence of which within each strain is strikingly similar to our previous observations in males. Within a given phenotype, rats of each strain performed similarly during operant testing. Ethanol intake during home cage drinking was unable to predict future operant phenotype. Relative to controls, Drinkers chronically exposed to ethanol liquid diet exhibited a significant, but transient, escalation in consummatory, but not appetitive, responding during acute withdrawal. Collectively, these data closely parallel many of our previous observations in males while also highlighting potential sex differences in drinking strategies following dependence. The presence of the Responder phenotype reinforces the importance of using direct measures of ethanol consumption. Our findings provide new insight into similarities and differences in operant ethanol self-administration between males and females and emphasize the importance of including females in future studies of ethanol drinking and dependence.

">Mapping the topographic organization of the human zona incerta using diffusion MRI</a></h4>

              
                The zona incerta (ZI) is a deep brain region originally described by Auguste Forel as an "immensely confusing area about which nothing can be said." Despite the elusive nature of this structure, mounting evidence supports the role of the ZI and surrounding regions across a diverse range of brain functions and as a candidate target for neuromodulatory therapies. Using in vivo diffusion MRI and data-driven connectivity, we identify a topographic organization between the ZI and neocortex. Specifically, our methods identify a rostral-caudal gradient predominantly connecting the frontopolar and ventral prefrontal cortices with the rostral ZI, and the primary sensorimotor cortices with the caudal ZI. Moreover, we demonstrate how clustering and gradient approaches build complementary evidence including facilitating the mapping of a central region of the ZI, connected with the dorsal prefrontal cortex. These results were shown to be replicable across multiple datasets and at the individual subject level, building evidence for the important role of the ZI in mediating frontal lobe-associated tasks, ranging from motor to cognitive to emotional control. Finally, we consider the impact of this topographic organization on the refinement of neuromodulatory targets. These results pave the way for an increasingly detailed understanding of ZI substructures, and considerations for in vivo targeting of the ZI for neuromodulation.

">Hyperglycemia selectively increases cerebral non-oxidative glucose consumption without affecting blood flow</a></h4>

              
                Multiple studies have shown that hyperglycemia increases the cerebral metabolic rate of glucose (CMRglc) in subcortical white matter. This observation remains unexplained. Using positron emission tomography (PET) and euinsulinaemic glucose clamps, we found, for the first time, that acute hyperglycemia increases non-oxidative CMRglc (i.e., aerobic glycolysis (AG)) in subcortical white mater as well as in medial temporal lobe structures, cerebellum and brainstem, all areas with low euglycemic CMRglc. Surprisingly, hyperglycemia did not change regional cerebral blood flow (CBF), the cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2), or the blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) response. Regional gene expression data reveal that brain regions where CMRglc increased have greater expression of hexokinase 2 (HK2). Simulations of glucose transport revealed that, unlike hexokinase 1, HK2 is not saturated at euglycemia, thus accommodating increased AG during hyperglycemia.

">Age-associated transcriptomic and epigenetic alterations in mouse hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                Aging represents a major risk for human neurodegenerative disorders, such as dementia and Alzheimers disease, and is associated with a functional decline in neurons and impaired synaptic plasticity, leading to a gradual decline in memory. Previous research has identified molecular and functional changes associated with aging through transcriptomic studies and neuronal excitability measurements, while the role of chromatin-level regulation in vulnerability to aging-related diseases is not well understood. Moreover, the causal relationship between molecular alterations and aging-associated decline in functions of different cell types remains poorly understood. Here, we systematically characterized gene regulatory networks in a cell type-specific manner in the aging mouse hippocampus, a central brain region involved in learning and memory formation, by simultaneously profiling gene expression and chromatin accessibility at a single nuclei level. The analysis of multiome (RNA and ATAC) sequencing recapitulated the diversity of glial and neuronal cell types in the hippocampus, and allowed revealing transcriptomic and chromatin accessibility level changes in different cell types, among which oligodendrocytes and dentate gyrus (DG) neurons exhibited the most drastic changes. We found that aging-dependent chromatin-level changes were more pronounced than transcriptomic changes for genes related to synaptic plasticity among neurons. Our data suggest that BACH2, a candidate transcription factor in the aging-mediated functional decline of DG neurons, potentially regulates genes associated with synaptic plasticity, cell death, and inflammation during aging.

">Trained deep neural network models of the ventral visual pathway encode numerosity with robustness to object and scene identity</a></h4>

              
                "Number sense", the ability to quickly estimate quantities of objects in a visual scene, is present in humans and many other animals, and has recently been demonstrated in biologically inspired vision models, even before training. However, real-world number perception requires abstraction from the properties of individual objects and their contexts, in contrast to the simplified dot patterns used in previous studies. Using novel, synthetically generated photorealistic stimuli, we discovered that deep convolutional neural networks optimized for object recognition can encode numerical information across varying object and scene identities in their distributed activity patterns. In contrast, untrained networks failed to discriminate numbers, and appeared to encode low-level visual summary statistics of scenes rather than the number of discrete objects per se. These results caution against using untrained networks to model early numerical abilities and highlight the need to use more complex stimuli to understand the mechanisms behind the brain's visual number sense.

">Structured and unstructured reactivations during REM sleep are modulated by novel experiences</a></h4>

              
                Mammalian sleep is composed of two distinct phases characterized by unique neural activity patterns: rapid eye movement (REM) and non-REM (nREM) sleep. While both phases are essential for memory consolidation, neural replay of awake experience as a candidate mechanism for memory consolidation has only been shown for nREM sleep and it remains unclear whether awake experiences are reactivated during REM sleep. Here, we evaluated whether awake experiences are reactivated by hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons during REM sleep using a combination of approaches including Bayesian decoding, sequence factorization, and co-activation analysis. We confirmed that representations of awake exploration are recapitulated during subsequent REM episodes with varying levels of temporal structure. We also found that temporally organized sequences were replayed with a higher frequency during REM sleep following a novel experience. Finally, we find internalized structure in CA1 activity prior to novel task exposure that is expressed in subsequent behaviour. Altogether, these results suggest that while hippocampal ensembles appear as a result of structural priors, salient experiences refine temporal sequences during subsequent REM sleep, suggesting a unique role for REM sleep in salient-experience consolidation.

">Drift in Individual Behavioral Phenotype as a Strategy for Unpredictable Worlds</a></h4>

              
                Individuals, even with matched genetics and environment, show substantial phenotypic variability. This variability may be part of a bet-hedging strategy, where populations express a range of phenotypes to ensure survival in unpredictable environments. In addition phenotypic variability between individuals ("bet-hedging"), individuals also show variability in their phenotype across time, even absent external cues. There are few evolutionary theories that explain random shifts in phenotype across an animals life, which we term drift in individual phenotype. We use individuality in locomotor handedness in Drosophila melanogaster to characterize both bet-hedging and drift. We use a continuous circling assay to show that handedness spontaneously changes over timescales ranging from seconds to the lifespan of a fly. We compare the amount of drift and bet-hedging across a number of different fly strains and show independent strain specific differences in bet-hedging and drift. We show manipulation of serotonin changes the rate of drift, indicating a potential circuit substrate controlling drift. We then develop a theoretical framework for assessing the adaptive value of drift, demonstrating that drift may be adaptive for populations subject to selection pressures that fluctuate on timescales similar to the lifespan of an animal. We apply our model to real world environmental signals and find patterns of fluctuations that favor random drift in behavioral phenotype, suggesting that drift may be adaptive under some real world conditions. These results demonstrate that drift plays a role in driving variability in a population and may serve an adaptive role distinct from population level bet-hedging.

                The localization and clustering of neurotransmitter receptors at appropriate postsynaptic sites is a key step in the control of synaptic transmission. Here, we identify a novel paradigm for the synaptic localization of an ionotropic acetylcholine receptor (AChR) based on the direct interaction of its extracellular domain with a cell adhesion molecule of the IgLON family. Our results show that RIG-5 and ZIG-8, which encode the sole IgLONs in C. elegans, are tethered in the pre- and postsynaptic membranes, respectively, and interact in vivo through their first immunoglobulin-like (Ig) domains. In addition, ZIG-8 traps ACR-16 via a direct cis-interaction between the ZIG-8 Ig2 domain and the base of the large extracellular AChR domain. Such mechanism has never been reported, but all these molecules are conserved during evolution. Similar interactions may directly couple Ig superfamily adhesion molecules and members of the large family of Cys-loop ionotropic receptors, including AChRs, in the mammalian nervous system, and may be relevant in the context of IgLON-associated brain diseases.

">Dynamic estimation of the attentional field from visual cortical activity</a></h4>

              
                Navigating around the world, we must adaptively allocate attention to our surroundings based on anticipated future stimuli and events. This allocation of spatial attention boosts visuocortical representations at attended locations and locally enhances perception. Indeed, spatial attention has often been analogized to a 'spotlight' shining on the item of relevance. Although the neural underpinnings of the locus of this attentional spotlight have been relatively well studied, less is known about the size of the spotlight: to what extent can the attentional field be broadened and narrowed in accordance with behavioral demands? In this study, we developed a paradigm for dynamically estimating the locus and spread of covert spatial attention, inferred from visuocortical activity using fMRI in humans. We measured BOLD activity in response to an annulus while participants (4 female, 4 male) used covert visual attention to determine whether more numbers or letters were present in a cued region of the annulus. Importantly, the width of the cued area was systematically varied, calling for different sizes of the attentional spotlight. The deployment of attention was associated with an increase in BOLD activity in corresponding retinotopic regions of visual areas V1-V3. By modeling the visuocortical attentional modulation, we could reliably recover the cued location, as well as a broadening of the attentional enhancement with wider attentional cues. This modeling approach offers a useful window into the dynamics of attention and spatial uncertainty.

">The effect of unilateral hand muscle contraction on frontal alpha asymmetry and inhibitory control in intrinsic reward contexts, a randomized controlled trial</a></h4>

              
                Challenged inhibitory control has been implicated in various disorders, including addiction. Previous research suggests that asymmetry of frontal brain activity, indexed by frontal alpha asymmetry (FAA), is associated with inhibitory control and could be a target for neuromodulatory intervention. Some evidence suggests that unilateral muscle contraction (UMC) can modulate FAA; however, experimental evidence is scarce. We conducted a randomized controlled trial, with 65 participants (Mage = 26.6; SD = 7.4), 37 of whom were females. We collected EEG data to calculate FAA and assessed inhibitory performance using the Stop Signal Task (SST) in neutral and intrinsic reward (palatable food) conditions, both before and after a unilateral left-hand muscle contraction task aimed at enhancing right relative to left frontal activity. We found a significant main effect of group on FAA. Specifically, UMC group was associated with higher right relative to left frontal activity, associated with resting state inhibitory activity. Event-related potential analyses revealed a significant dissociation between the stop N2 and stop P3 components as a function of time. More specifically, as time progressed, the stop N2 was enhanced, while the stop P3 was reduced. These results did not lead to observable changes in the behavioral index of stopping. In conclusion, UMC did not affect any behavioral and brain activity indices. There is some indication of a potential effect on FAA. However, this effect could reflect coincidental differences in trait FAA. Our findings provide new insights into the temporal dynamics of brain activity indices of inhibitory control.

">Newly Acquired Word-Action Associations Trigger Auditory Cortex Activation During Movement Preparation: Implications for Hebbian Plasticity in Action Words Learning</a></h4>

              
                Hebbian learning is believed to play a key role in acquisition of action words. However, this biological mechanism requires activation of the neural assemblies representing a word form and a corresponding movement to repeatedly overlap in time. In reality, though, these associated events could be separated by seconds. In the current MEG study, we examined trial-and-error learning of associations between novel auditory pseudowords and movements of specific body parts. We aimed to explore how the brain bridges the temporal gap between the transient activity evoked by auditory input and the preparatory motor activation before the corresponding movement. To address this, we compared learning-induced changes in neuromagnetic responses locked to the onset of the stimulus and to the onset of the movement. As learning progressed, both types of neural responses showed sustained enhancement during the delay period between the auditory pseudoword and the required movement. Cortical sources of this learning-induced increase were localized bilaterally in the lateral and medial temporal cortices. Notably, the learning effect was significantly stronger when measured time-locked to the movement onset, rather than to the pseudoword onset. This suggests that, after the pseudoword-movement associations were reliably acquired, the non-primary auditory cortex was reactivated in sync with the preparation of the upcoming movement. Such reactivation likely served to bring together in time the representations of the correct action and the preceding auditory cue. This temporal alignment could enable Hebbian learning, leading to long-lasting synaptic changes in temporally correlated neural assemblies.

">Fixation Drift Increases as a Function of Time-on-Task</a></h4>

              
                Ocular fixations contain microsaccades, drift and tremor. We report an increase in the slope of linear fixation drift as a function of time-on-task (TOT). We employed a very large dataset (322 distinct subjects, multiple visits per subject). Subjects performed a random saccade task. The task, in which the target dot jumped randomly over the display area every 1 sec, was 100 sec in duration. Fixations were identified using a published classification method. For each fixation, we regressed eye position against time across multiple segment lengths (50, 100, 200, 300, 400, and 500 ms). We started with the first sample and continued until no further regressions were possible based on the particular segment length being evaluated. For each segment length, each fixation was characterized by a single value: the maximum slope over the segment length. The slopes were expressed in deg/sec. We were not interested in the direction of the linear drift so we took the absolute value of the slope as the measure. For data analysis, each 100 sec task was divided into five 20 sec epochs. We found that median slope increased across epochs in both session recordings. Although similar trends were found regardless of segment length, the results were clearer and more consistent when using segment lengths of 200 ms or greater. Although we describe these changes in linear drift as related to time-on-task (TOT), we think it is likely, though no certain, that these effects are due to some sort of short-term oculomotor fatigue.

">Evaluating noise correction approaches for non-invasive electrophysiology of the human spinal cord</a></h4>

              
                The spinal cord is a vital component of the central nervous system for the processing of sensorimotor information transmitted between the body and the brain. Electrospinography (ESG) is the most accessible non-invasive technique for recording spinal signals in humans, but the vast and detrimental impact of physiological noise (mostly of cardiac nature) has prevented widespread adoption. Here, we aim to address this issue by examining various denoising algorithms for cardiac artefact reduction - including principal component analysis-based techniques (PCA), independent component analysis-based approaches (ICA) and signal space projection (SSP). We observed that in situations where large numbers of spinal electrodes are used, SSP offers the best results in terms of balancing the removal of harmful noise and preserving neural information of interest. In cases where only a small number of electrodes are available, an approach based on PCA is deemed helpful. Approaches based on ICA were found to be unsuitable for cardiac artefact removal in ESG, due to a suboptimal balance of artefact removal and signal preservation. Finally, we also approached this issue from a signal-enhancement perspective and observed that in cases where extensive electrode arrays are used in the context of task-based designs, a spatial filtering technique based on canonical correlation analysis (CCA) reveals clear evoked spinal potentials even with single-trial resolution. Taken together, there are several appropriate algorithms for physiological noise removal in ESG, rendering this an accessible and easy-to-use technique for non-invasive assessments of human spinal cord function.

">Time-on-task-related decrements in performance in the rodent continuous performance test are not caused by physical disengagement from the task</a></h4>

              
                Attention deficits, a hallmark of many neuropsychiatric disorders, significantly impair quality of life and functional outcome for patients. Continuous Performance Tests (CPTs) are widely used to assess attentional function in clinical settings and have been adapted for mice as the rodent Continuous Performance Test (rCPT). In this study, we combined traditional analyses of rCPT performance with markerless pose estimation using DeepLabCut and visual field analysis (VFA) to objectively measure the orientation of mice toward stimuli during rCPT sessions. Additionally, we extended session lengths to assess performance decrements over time. Our findings show that extending rCPT sessions from 45 to 90 minutes results in a significant decline in performance in male mice, which aligns with performance decrements observed in clinical research. Importantly, physical engagement with the task remained relatively stable throughout the session, even as performance deteriorated. This suggests that the performance decline specifically reflects a time-on-task (TOT)-dependent vigilance decrement rather than physical disengagement. We also investigated the effects of amphetamine, an FDA-approved treatment for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), on rCPT performance. Amphetamine significantly improved rCPT performance in male mice by reducing false alarms without modulating orientation or physical engagement with the task stimuli. Collectively, these findings validate a behavioral tracking platform for objectively measuring physical engagement in the rCPT and a task modification that accentuates TOT-dependent performance decrements, enhancing the translational value of the rCPT for studies related to human neuropsychiatric disorders.

">Identifying Functional Homologues in Human and Marmoset Brain Networks via Movie-Driven Ultra-High Field fMRI</a></h4>

              
                Numerous task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have demonstrated that complex neural functions such as language processing, action observation, face recognition, and motor coordination are governed by widespread, intricate networks that span both cortical and subcortical areas. Nonhuman primate models are indispensable for advancing our understanding of the evolution of these networks and provide unique opportunities for experimental interventions that are not feasible in humans. In this study, we utilized movie-driven fMRI (md-fMRI) to investigate and delineate homologous functional networks in the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus). Both marmosets and human subjects watched the same movie which incorporated a variety of visual and auditory stimuli. This method enabled the identification of potential homologues of large-scale functional networks involved in visual, auditory, cognitive, motor, and limbic functions in marmosets, offering new insights into the shared neurofunctional architecture across species.

">Addressing inconsistency in functional neuroimaging: A replicable data-driven multi-scale functional atlas for canonical brain networks</a></h4>

              
                The advent of various neuroimaging methodologies has greatly aided in the conceptualization of large-scale brain networks in the field of cognitive neuroscience. However, there is inconsistency across studies in both nomenclature and the functional entities being described. There is a need for a unifying framework which standardizes terminology across studies while also bringing analyses and results into the same reference space. Here we present a functional whole-brain atlas of canonical brain networks derived from more than 100k resting-state fMRI datasets. These data-driven networks are highly replicable across datasets as well as multiple spatial scales. We have organized, labeled, and described them with terms familiar to the fields of cognitive and affective neuroscience in order to optimize their utility in future neuroimaging analyses and enhance the accessibility of new findings. The benefits of this atlas are not limited to future template-based or reference-guided analyses, but also extend to other data-driven neuroimaging approaches across modalities, such as those using blind independent component analysis (ICA). Future studies utilizing this atlas will contribute to greater harmonization and standardization in functional neuroimaging research.

">Distributional learning drives statistical deafening</a></h4>

              
                Humans and other animals use information about how likely it is for something to happen. The absolute and relative probability of an event influences a remarkable breadth of behaviors, from foraging for food to comprehending linguistic constructions -- even when these probabilities are learned implicitly. It is less clear how, and under what circumstances, statistical learning of simple probabilities might drive changes in perception and cognition. Here, across a series of 29 experiments, we probe listeners' sensitivity to task-irrelevant changes in the probability distribution of tones' acoustic frequency across tone-in-noise detection and tone duration decisions. We observe that the task-irrelevant frequency distribution influences the ability to detect a sound and the speed with which perceptual decisions are made. The shape of the probability distribution, its range, and a tone's relative position within that range impact observed patterns of suppression and enhancement of tone detection and decision making. Perceptual decisions are also modulated by a newly discovered perceptual bias, with lower frequencies in the distribution more often and more rapidly perceived as longer, and higher frequencies as shorter. Perception is sensitive to rapid distribution changes, but distributional learning from previous probability distributions also carries over. In fact, massed exposure to a single point along the dimension results in a sustained 'statistical deafening' along a range of subsequently encountered frequencies. This seemingly maladaptive loss of sensitivity - occurring entirely in the absence of feedback or reward - points to a gain mechanism that suppresses sensitivity to regions along a perceptual dimension that are less likely to be encountered.

                The lipids that form extracellular vesicles (EVs) play critical structural and regulatory roles, and cutting-edge bioinformatics strategies have shown the ability to decipher lipid metabolism and related molecular mechanisms. We previously demonstrated that alcohol abuse induces an inflammatory immune response through Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), leading to structural and cognitive dysfunction. This study evaluated how TLR4 and sex as a variable (male/female) impact the lipidome of plasma-resident EVs after chronic alcohol exposure. Using a mouse model of chronic ethanol exposure in wild-type and TLR4-deficient mice, enrichment networks generated by LINEX2 highlighted significant ethanol-induced changes in the EV lipid substrate-product of enzyme reactions associated with glycerophospholipid metabolism. We also demonstrated ethanol-induced differences in Lipid Ontology enrichment analysis in EVs, focusing on terms related to lipid bilayer properties. A lipid abundance analysis revealed higher amounts of significant lipid subclasses in all experimental comparisons associated with inflammatory responses and EV biogenesis/secretion. These findings suggest that interrogating EV lipid abundance with a sensitive lipidomic-based strategy can provide deep insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying biological processes associated with sex, alcohol consumption, and TLR4 immune responses and open new avenues for biomarker identification and therapeutic development.

                Lifestyle factors modulate dementia risk. We investigated mechanisms of dementia risk reduction by emerging dietary ketogenic interventions. We show that distinct interventions, a medium-chain triglycerides (MCT)-enriched diet and a carbohydrate-free, high-fat diet (CFHF), improve cognition and dendritic spine density of memory-associated hippocampal neurons in two mouse models of Alzheimer disease (AD). Only the CFHF diet drove increased circulating ketones, suggesting distinct underlying mechanisms. AD mice exhibited baseline and diet-induced susceptibility to peripheral metabolic disturbances that were improved by MCT and exacerbated by CFHF diets. Prominent AD-associated dysregulation of the liver transcriptome was largely restored by both interventions, but MCT also downregulated lipogenic enzymes and did not trigger a CFHF-like inflammatory signature. Novel AD- and diet-induced plasmatic changes in hormones and lipid species were identified. Thus, different ketogenic interventions yield cognitive benefits in AD models while showing intervention-specific modulation of peripheral metabolic defects, with implications for design of therapeutic ketogenic strategies.

">Developmental progression of prefrontal circuit dysfunction in a Shank3-/- mouse model of autism spectrum disorder</a></h4>

              
                Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) are a group of neurodevelopmental disorders with heterogeneous causes, characterized by communication deficits, impaired social interactions, and repetitive behaviors. Despite numerous studies focused on pathophysiological circuit mechanisms of ASD in mature mice, little is known regarding ASD onset and its evolution through development in these models. To explore early disruptions in mPFC development, we utilized the Shank3 knockout (Shank3-/-) mouse model, a well-established genetic model of ASD. The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is crucial for higher-order cognitive functions and social behavior, making it a key brain area of interest for understanding ASD pathology. SHANK3 is crucial for glutamatergic synapse maturation, and the Shank3-/- mouse has been well-characterized for displaying ASD-related behavioral phenotypes. We investigated network, cellular, and synaptic changes in the mPFC at two developmental stages, P14 and adulthood (>P55). Our findings revealed that while differences in neuronal excitability including hypofunction are detectable at P14, global mPFC dysfunction, including network hyperfunction and layer 5 pyramidal cell hyperexcitability, only becomes evident in adulthood. This suggests that early cellular changes that precede the development of behavioral deficits may lead to compensatory mechanisms that contribute to more pronounced mPFC deficits later in development. These results highlight the complex and evolving nature of mPFC dysfunction in ASD and suggest that early synaptic changes may set the stage for later behavioral and cognitive deficits.

	<p>Objective: Nimodipine still represents a unique selling point in the prevention of delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) following aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH). Its intrathecal effect is limited by a low oral bioavailability, leading to the development of nanocarrier systems to overcome this limitation. This study investigated the ultrasound-induced release profile of nimodipine from drug-loaded copolymers in artificial cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) within 72 h after a singular versus repeated sonication. Methods: Pluronic&amp;amp;reg; F127 copolymers (Sigma-Aldrich, Taufkirchen, Germany)were loaded with nimodipine by direct dissolution. Spontaneous and on-demand drug release by ultrasound (1 MHz at 1.7 W/cm2) was determined in artificial cerebrospinal fluid using the dialysis bag method. Nimodipine concentrations were measured at predefined time points within 72 h of sonication. Results: Spontaneous release of nimodipine was enhanced by ultrasound application with significantly increased nimodipine concentrations two hours after a repeated sonication compared to a singular sonication (median 1.62 vs. 17.48 &amp;amp;micro;g/&amp;amp;micro;L, p = 0.04). A further trend was observed after four hours (median 1.82 vs. 22.09 &amp;amp;micro;g/&amp;amp;micro;L, p = 0.06). There was no difference in the overall nimodipine concentrations between the groups with a singular versus repeated sonication (357.2 vs. 540.3 &amp;amp;micro;g/&amp;amp;micro;L, p = 0.60) after 72 h. Conclusions: Repeated sonication resulted in an acceleration of nimodipine release from the drug-loaded copolymer in a CSF medium. These findings confirm the proof of principle of an on-demand guidance of nimodipine release from nimodipine-loaded nanodrugs by means of ultrasound, which suggests that evaluating the concept in an animal model may be appropriate.</p>

	<p>The aim of this study is to present the outcomes of cerebral aneurysm treatment with the DERIVO&amp;amp;reg; mini Embolisation Device (DMD), which is compatible with microcatheters with 0.021-inch inner diameters. Consecutive patients treated with DMD were identified retrospectively. Patient and aneurysm characteristics, procedural findings, clinical outcomes and follow-up imaging results were evaluated. A total of 44 target aneurysms in 30 patients were treated with DMD. The mean age of the patients was 49.9 (range, 4&amp;amp;ndash;77 years). Four patients with five aneurysms presented with acute subarachnoid hemorrhage. The mean aneurysm size was 6.8 mm (range, 1.5&amp;amp;ndash;22 mm). In 29 (65.9%) aneurysms, adjunctive devices were used for endovascular treatment. The overall mortality rate was 3.3% and procedure-related mortality was 0%. Overall neurologic morbidity was 6.6% and none of the patients had a permanent sequela secondary to the procedure. The mean clinical follow-up period was 20.9 months (range, 3 days&amp;amp;ndash;46 months) and the mean DSA follow-up period was 10.9 months. A total of 37 (84.1%) aneurysms demonstrated total occlusion (Raymond&amp;amp;ndash;Roy [RR 1]); 3 (6.8%) aneurysms had a neck remnant or infundibular filling at the origin of the jailed side branch (RR 2), 4 (9.1%) aneurysms had residual aneurysm filling (RR 3). For those aneurysms treated with bare DMD, the total occlusion rate was 73.3% at a mean follow-up of 16.1 months. In this initial clinical single-center experience, DMD had a good safety profile and efficacy comparable with the currently used flow diverters.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012433">A comparison of EEG encoding models using audiovisual stimuli and their unimodal counterparts</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Maansi Desai, Alyssa M. Field, Liberty S. Hamilton</p>

Communication in the real world is inherently multimodal. When having a conversation, typically sighted and hearing people use both auditory and visual cues to understand one another. For example, objects may make sounds as they move in space, or we may use the movement of a person’s mouth to better understand what they are saying in a noisy environment. Still, many neuroscience experiments rely on unimodal stimuli to understand encoding of sensory features in the brain. The extent to which visual information may influence encoding of auditory information and vice versa in natural environments is thus unclear. Here, we addressed this question by recording scalp electroencephalography (EEG) in 11 subjects as they listened to and watched movie trailers in audiovisual (AV), visual (V) only, and audio (A) only conditions. We then fit linear encoding models that described the relationship between the brain responses and the acoustic, phonetic, and visual information in the stimuli. We also compared whether auditory and visual feature tuning was the same when stimuli were presented in the original AV format versus when visual or auditory information was removed. In these stimuli, visual and auditory information was relatively uncorrelated, and included spoken narration over a scene as well as animated or live-action characters talking with and without their face visible. For this stimulus, we found that auditory feature tuning was similar in the AV and A-only conditions, and similarly, tuning for visual information was similar when stimuli were presented with the audio present (AV) and when the audio was removed (V only). In a cross prediction analysis, we investigated whether models trained on AV data predicted responses to A or V only test data similarly to models trained on unimodal data. Overall, prediction performance using AV training and V test sets was similar to using V training and V test sets, suggesting that the auditory information has a relatively smaller effect on EEG. In contrast, prediction performance using AV training and A only test set was slightly worse than using matching A only training and A only test sets. This suggests the visual information has a stronger influence on EEG, though this makes no qualitative difference in the derived feature tuning. In effect, our results show that researchers may benefit from the richness of multimodal datasets, which can then be used to answer more than one research question.

                Prosthetic joint loosening due to Brucella spp. is a rare event. In this report, we describe a rare case of prosthetic infection caused by brucella. A 71-year-old woman reported a six-month history of progressing pain in the right prosthetic knee, which had been implanted for arthrosis four years prior to admission, associated with fever. No night sweats were noted. On examination, the right knee appeared slightly swollen and painful on mobilization, and the surgical wound was normal. Blood tests showed increased C-Reactive Protein (CRP) (34mg/L) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (34mm/hr). A CT scan of her right knee was performed, showing loosening of the prosthesis, joint effusion, and osteolysis in contact with the internal tibial component measuring 16mm maximum with bone remodeling of the epiphysis and metaphysis regions. Rose Bengal test was positive for brucellosis, a standard brucella tube agglutination test was positive at a titer of 1/80, blood cultures for brucella were negative and a PCR for detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis was negative. The patient was diagnosed as having Brucella infection of his total knee arthroplasty. Favorable outcome was observed after medical and surgical treatment. We believe this is the first detailed report of Brucella prosthetic infection in the country despite the endemicity of this type of zoonosis.

                Background Treatment expectations influence clinical outcomes in various physical and psychological conditions; however, no studies have explored their role in endometriosis treatment. It is necessary to understand how these expectations can be measured to study treatment expectations and their effects in clinical practice. This study aimed to psychometrically analyze and compare different treatment expectation measurements and describe treatment expectations in women with suspected endometriosis. Method Analysis of cross-sectional baseline data of a mixed-method clinical observational study of N=699 patients undergoing laparoscopy in Germany. Descriptives, bivariate associations, convergent and discriminant validity of four expectation measurements (Treatment Expectation Questionnaire (TEX-Q); Generic rating scale for previous treatment experiences, treatment expectations, and treatment effects (GEEE); numerical rating scales (NRS) assessing improvement and worsening of endometriosis symptoms, expected Pain Disability Index (PDI); range: 0 to 10) were estimated. A cluster analysis was performed on the three GEEE items. Results Most participants expected high improvement (M=6.68 to 7.20, SD=1.90 to 2.09) and low worsening (M=1.09 to 2.52, SD=1.80 to 2.25) of disability from laparoscopy. Participants who expected greater worsening expected more side effects (r=.31 to .60, p<.001). Associations between the positive and negative expectation dimensions, including side effects, were small to non-significant (r =|.24| to .00, p<.001 to.978). Four distinct clusters, described as’positive’, ‘no pain, no gain’, ‘diminished’, and ‘uniform’ were found, with a total PVE of 62.2%. Conclusions Women with suspected endometriosis reported positive expectations concerning laparoscopy, but wide ranges indicated interindividual differences. Treatment expectations seem to be a multidimensional construct in this patient group. The investigated measurements did not correlate to the extent that they measured exactly the same construct. The selection of measurements should be carefully considered and adapted for the study purposes. Clusters provide initial indications for individualized interventions that target expectation manipulation. Trial Registration Number ID NCT05019612 (ClinicalTrials.gov)

                Background The significant challenge in adolescent and young adult therapy lies in the fact that research in this field does not provide many clinical indications. This study addresses domains contributing to the establishment and sustenance of engagement, satisfaction, and progress among adolescents and young adults in their treatment by delving into the impact of events that, from the perspective of clients, have positively influenced their therapeutic process. Methods Employing a qualitative research approach, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 13 adolescents and young adults undergoing therapy, recounting positive and constructive events during their treatment. Results A structured thematic analysis revealed six primary domains of positive events: events linked to the management of the setting, events shaping the definition of therapy goals, occurrences tied to the therapist’s active role, collaborative events between therapists and clients, and events associated with both clients’ external and internal worlds. Conclusions The findings suggest that working with adolescents shares similarities with psychotherapy involving adult clients but demands specific attention to adolescents and young adults’ families, surrounding environment, and rapidly changing needs.

                Abstract Paragangliomas are rare neuroendocrine tumors, often associated with catecholamine secretion. These tumors can arise in various locations, with the majority found in the abdomen and pelvis, while a smaller percentage occurs in the thorax and head and neck regions. Diaphragmatic paragangliomas are exceedingly rare, with only two documented cases in the literature. This report details a case of a primary diaphragmatic paraganglioma in a 59-year-old patient presenting with unexplained weight loss, tremors, and diaphoresis. Imaging studies revealed a mass in the right lobe of the liver, later identified as a diaphragmatic paraganglioma during surgery. The case underscores the importance of preoperative catecholamine assessment and careful surgical planning due to the risks associated with tumor manipulation. Complete surgical resection, although challenging, remains the definitive treatment, especially in hypervascular tumors located near major vascular structures.

                Background Age-related central auditory processing disorder and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) can be concomitant in older adults, making it difficult to communicate, especially in challenging listening conditions. This preliminary study investigated the efficacy of auditory-based cognitive training on the auditory processing abilities and cognitive functions of older adults with MCI. Methods In this randomized controlled trial twenty-two older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) were randomly assigned to either an experimental (n=11) or a control group (n=11). The experimental group received 15 cognitive training sessions through tasks involving the auditory domain. The outcome measures of this study included auditory resolution (Temporal gap detection, frequency discrimination, and modulation detection) and cognitive measures (Trail making tests and digit recall), which were administered at three-time points (before training, post-training, and follow-up). The linear mixed model computed the effects of training on the outcome measures. Results A significant improvement was observed in the modulation detection threshold between baseline and follow-up and between post-training and follow-up sessions. However, GDT and FD thresholds did not reveal any statistically significant difference. In the trail making test, Part B showed consistent significance across the time points, whereas Part A and the delayed recall task showed no significant difference. Conclusion Auditory-based cognitive training may improve auditory processing and executive function in older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI).

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The findings concerning the association between endocannabinoid system (ECS) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) exhibited inconsistencies when examining the expression levels of endocannabinoids. This study aimed to provide a comprehensive summary of the studies regarding alterations of the ECS in AD. Six databases were thoroughly searched for literature to select relevant studies investigating the ECS in AD, including changes in cannabinoid receptors (CB1R and CB2R), endocannabinoids (2-AG and AEA), and their associated enzymes (FAAH and MAGL). Traditional meta-analysis evaluated the expression levels of the ECS in AD, and the results showed no significant differences in ECS components between healthy controls and AD patients. However, subgroup analysis revealed significantly lower expression levels of CB1R in AD than in controls, particularly in studies using western blot (SMD = −0.88, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.01) and in studies testing CB1R of frontal cortex (SMD = −1.09, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.01). For studies using HPLC, the subgroup analysis indicated significantly higher 2-AG levels in AD than in controls (SMD = 0.46, <i>p</i> = 0.02). Network meta-analysis examined the rank of ECS alterations in AD compared to controls, and the findings revealed that 2-AG and MAGL exhibited the largest increase and CB1R showed the largest decrease relative to the control group. Based on the findings of traditional meta-analysis and network meta-analysis, we proposed that AD patients may present decreased expression levels of CB1R and increased expression levels of 2-AG and its degrading enzyme MAGL. Our results may contribute to the growing body of research supporting the therapeutic potential of ECS modulation in the management of AD.</p>

                Hüser et al. show that an age-associated decline in CD9 expression in dermal fibroblasts promotes the secretion of CD9-low and ANGPTL2-high extracellular vesicles. The loss of CD9 promotes angiogenesis and presents an age-related mechanism, which could drive melanoma progression.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98175">SRSF2 is a key player in orchestrating the directional migration and differentiation of MyoD progenitors during skeletal muscle development</a></h4>

              
                SRSF2 plays a dual role, functioning both as a transcriptional regulator and a key player in alternative splicing. The absence of Srsf2 in MyoD + progenitors resulted in perinatal mortality in mice, accompanied by severe skeletal muscle defects. SRSF2 deficiency disrupts the directional migration of MyoD progenitors, causing them to disperse into both muscle and non-muscle regions. Single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis revealed significant alterations in Srsf2-deficient myoblasts, including a reduction in extracellular matrix components, diminished expression of genes involved in ameboid-type cell migration and cytoskeleton organization, mitosis irregularities, and premature differentiation. Notably, one of the targets regulated by Srsf2 is the serine/threonine kinase Aurka. Knockdown of <i>Aurka</i> led to reduced cell proliferation, disrupted cytoskeleton, and impaired differentiation, reflecting the effects seen with <i>Srsf2</i> knockdown. Crucially, the introduction of exogenous Aurka in <i>Srsf2</i>-knockdown cells markedly alleviated the differentiation defects caused by <i>Srsf2</i> knockdown. Furthermore, our research unveiled the role of Srsf2 in controlling alternative splicing within genes associated with human skeletal muscle diseases, such as <i>BIN1</i>, <i>DMPK</i>, <i>FHL1</i>, and <i>LDB3</i>. Specifically, the precise knockdown of the <i>Bin1</i> exon17-containing variant, which is excluded following <i>Srsf2</i> depletion, profoundly disrupted C2C12 cell differentiation. In summary, our study offers valuable insights into the role of SRSF2 in governing MyoD progenitors to specific muscle regions, thereby controlling their differentiation through the regulation of targeted genes and alternative splicing during skeletal muscle development.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99172">Proteomic landscape of tunneling nanotubes reveals CD9 and CD81 tetraspanins as key regulators</a></h4>

              
                Tunneling nanotubes (TNTs) are open actin- and membrane-based channels, connecting remote cells and allowing direct transfer of cellular material (e.g. vesicles, mRNAs, protein aggregates) from the cytoplasm to the cytoplasm. Although they are important especially, in pathological conditions (e.g. cancers, neurodegenerative diseases), their precise composition and their regulation were still poorly described. Here, using a biochemical approach allowing to separate TNTs from cell bodies and from extracellular vesicles and particles (EVPs), we obtained the full composition of TNTs compared to EVPs. We then focused on two major components of our proteomic data, the CD9 and CD81 tetraspanins, and further investigated their specific roles in TNT formation and function. We show that these two tetraspanins have distinct non-redundant functions: CD9 participates in stabilizing TNTs, whereas CD81 expression is required to allow the functional transfer of vesicles in the newly formed TNTs, possibly by regulating docking to or fusion with the opposing cell.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93968">Allosteric modulation of the CXCR4:CXCL12 axis by targeting receptor nanoclustering via the TMV-TMVI domain</a></h4>

              
                CXCR4 is a ubiquitously expressed chemokine receptor that regulates leukocyte trafficking and arrest in both homeostatic and pathological states. It also participates in organogenesis, HIV-1 infection, and tumor development. Despite the potential therapeutic benefit of CXCR4 antagonists, only one, plerixafor (AMD3100), which blocks the ligand-binding site, has reached the clinic. Recent advances in imaging and biophysical techniques have provided a richer understanding of the membrane organization and dynamics of this receptor. Activation of CXCR4 by CXCL12 reduces the number of CXCR4 monomers/dimers at the cell membrane and increases the formation of large nanoclusters, which are largely immobile and are required for correct cell orientation to chemoattractant gradients. Mechanistically, CXCR4 activation involves a structural motif defined by residues in TMV and TMVI. Using this structural motif as a template, we performed in silico molecular modeling followed by in vitro screening of a small compound library to identify negative allosteric modulators of CXCR4 that do not affect CXCL12 binding. We identified AGR1.137, a small molecule that abolishes CXCL12-mediated receptor nanoclustering and dynamics and blocks the ability of cells to sense CXCL12 gradients both in vitro and in vivo while preserving ligand binding and receptor internalization.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94899">Machine learning approaches identify immunologic signatures of total and intact HIV DNA during long-term antiretroviral therapy</a></h4>

              
                Understanding the interplay between the HIV reservoir and the host immune system may yield insights into HIV persistence during antiretroviral therapy (ART) and inform strategies for a cure. Here, we applied machine learning (ML) approaches to cross-sectional high-parameter HIV reservoir and immunology data in order to characterize host–reservoir associations and generate new hypotheses about HIV reservoir biology. High-dimensional immunophenotyping, quantification of HIV-specific T cell responses, and measurement of genetically intact and total HIV proviral DNA frequencies were performed on peripheral blood samples from 115 people with HIV (PWH) on long-term ART. Analysis demonstrated that both intact and total proviral DNA frequencies were positively correlated with T cell activation and exhaustion. Years of ART and select bifunctional HIV-specific CD4 T cell responses were negatively correlated with the percentage of intact proviruses. A leave-one-covariate-out inference approach identified specific HIV reservoir and clinical–demographic parameters, such as age and biological sex, that were particularly important in predicting immunophenotypes. Overall, immune parameters were more strongly associated with total HIV proviral frequencies than intact proviral frequencies. Uniquely, however, expression of the IL-7 receptor alpha chain (CD127) on CD4 T cells was more strongly correlated with the intact reservoir. Unsupervised dimension reduction analysis identified two main clusters of PWH with distinct immune and reservoir characteristics. Using reservoir correlates identified in these initial analyses, decision tree methods were employed to visualize relationships among multiple immune and clinical–demographic parameters and the HIV reservoir. Finally, using random splits of our data as training-test sets, ML algorithms predicted with approximately 70% accuracy whether a given participant had qualitatively high or low levels of total or intact HIV DNA . The techniques described here may be useful for assessing global patterns within the increasingly high-dimensional data used in HIV reservoir and other studies of complex biology.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93243">Rifampicin tolerance and growth fitness among isoniazid-resistant clinical Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates from a longitudinal study</a></h4>

              
                Antibiotic tolerance in <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> reduces bacterial killing, worsens treatment outcomes, and contributes to resistance. We studied rifampicin tolerance in isolates with or without isoniazid resistance (IR). Using a minimum duration of killing assay, we measured rifampicin survival in isoniazid-susceptible (IS, n=119) and resistant (IR, n=84) isolates, correlating tolerance with bacterial growth, rifampicin minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs), and isoniazid-resistant mutations. Longitudinal IR isolates were analyzed for changes in rifampicin tolerance and genetic variant emergence. The median time for rifampicin to reduce the bacterial population by 90% (MDK90) increased from 1.23 days (IS) and 1.31 days (IR) to 2.55 days (IS) and 1.98 days (IR) over 15–60 days of incubation, indicating fast and slow-growing tolerant sub-populations. A 6 log10-fold survival fraction classified tolerance as low, medium, or high, showing that IR is linked to increased tolerance and faster growth (OR = 2.68 for low vs. medium, OR = 4.42 for low vs. high, p-trend = 0.0003). High tolerance in IR isolates was associated with rifampicin treatment in patients and genetic microvariants. These findings suggest that IR tuberculosis should be assessed for high rifampicin tolerance to optimize treatment and prevent the development of multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis.

	<p>The present study analyzed the association between anxiety, repetitive behavior and parental stress in individuals with autism from Spain (n = 60, mean age = 8.52, SD = 4.41) and Colombia (n = 58, mean age = 10.29, SD = 4.98). Similarly, differences in anxiety, repetitive behavior and parental stress between both countries were analyzed. Outcomes revealed a strong relationship between anxiety and repetitive behavior in both populations. Furthermore, moderate positive associations were observed between anxiety, repetitive behavior and parental stress in the Spanish sample. However, parental stress was found to be moderately and negatively related with anxiety and repetitive behavior in the Colombian sample. Finally, no differences were found in anxiety and repetitive behavior between countries, but differences did emerge for parental stress which was found to be higher in the Colombian sample. In conclusion, differences in parental stress may be due to regional differences in socio-health resources, socio-economics, parenting styles, etc.</p>

                <p>Slowly expanding lesions (SELs) in adults with multiple sclerosis (MS) indicate a progressive pathological process. Whether SELs are present in pediatric-onset MS (POMS) or myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody-associated disease (MOGAD) is unknown. We studied 19 children with POMS and 14 with MOGAD (median age 14.3 and 9.4 years, respectively) recruited to the Canadian Pediatric Demyelinating Disease Study with: (1) ≥3 research scans 12 months apart; and (2) ≥1 T2-lesions on the earliest scan. A total of 70 SELs from 16 POMS participants and 1 SEL in the MOGAD group were detected. SELs are an early feature of POMS and essentially not a feature of MOGAD. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

                Many animal species use olfaction to extract information about objects in their environment. Yet, the specific molecular signature that any given object emits varies due to various factors. Here, we detail why such variability makes chemosensory-mediated object recognition such a hard problem, and we propose that a major function of the elaborate chemosensory network is to overcome it. We describe previous work addressing different elements of the problem and outline future research directions that we consider essential for a full understanding of object-oriented olfaction. In particular, we call for extensive representation of olfactory object variability in chemical, behavioral, and electrophysiological analyses. While written with an emphasis on macrosmatic mammalian species, our arguments apply to all organisms that employ chemosensation to navigate complex environments.

	<p>Objective: This meta-analysis with a systematic review was undertaken to assess the association between APOE allelic genotypes and the risk of Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (AD) in the Italian population. Methods: The Web of Science, PubMed, and Scopus databases were searched until 15 November 2023. The odds ratio (OR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated using fixed and random effect models, depending on the I2 statistic value. The systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted in agreement with the PRISMA guideline and registered with PROSPERO (CRD42023492580). Results: Our meta-analysis based on 15 studies revealed a higher risk of AD among Italian individuals carrying the APOE &amp;amp;epsilon;4 allele (OR = 3.60, 95% CI [2.90&amp;amp;ndash;4.47], p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001). The association of AD genotype APOE &amp;amp;epsilon;2&amp;amp;epsilon;4 (OR = 1.36, 95% CI [0.76&amp;amp;ndash;2.41], p = 0.29) was not statistically significant, while APOE &amp;amp;epsilon;3&amp;amp;epsilon;4 (OR = 3.43, 95% CI [2.95&amp;amp;ndash;3.99], p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001) has a high risk of AD development; the risk is more notably in the APOE &amp;amp;epsilon;4&amp;amp;epsilon;4 genotype (OR = 7.08, 95% CI [4.22&amp;amp;ndash;11.86], p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001). The APOE &amp;amp;epsilon;2 allele has a protective effect (APOE &amp;amp;epsilon;2 (OR = 0.47, 95% CI [0.29&amp;amp;ndash;0.74], p = 0.0013)), and similar results were achieved by APOE &amp;amp;epsilon;3 (OR&amp;amp;thinsp; = &amp;amp;thinsp;0.49, 95% CI [0.37&amp;amp;ndash;0.65], p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001). Subgroup analysis of three areas of Italy (southern, northern, and center) revealed that that APOE&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;epsilon;4 allele was a risk factor with a higher OR in northern Italy (OR 4.22; 95% CI [3.46&amp;amp;ndash;5.16], p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001) compared to southern and center Italy (OR 3.02; 95% CI [2.28&amp;amp;ndash;4.01], p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001 and OR 3.97; 95% CI [1.37&amp;amp;ndash;11.56], p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001, respectively). As well, APOE &amp;amp;epsilon;4&amp;amp;epsilon;4 genotype carriers had a significantly higher OR in northern Italy (OR 9.69; 95% CI [4.94&amp;amp;ndash;18.99], p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001) compared to in southern and center Italy (OR 4.38; 95% CI [1.54&amp;amp;ndash;12.47], p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001 and OR 3.59; 95% CI [0.87&amp;amp;ndash;14.86], p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001, respectively). Conclusions: This systematic review with a meta-analysis of the Italian population on APOE alleles, genotyping, and AD incidence, highlights that individuals harboring APOE &amp;amp;epsilon;4 have a higher risk of developing AD compared to those with other alleles. It also supports the protective effect of the APOE &amp;amp;epsilon;2 allele against the progress of AD. The qualitative analysis on the complex genetic interactions influencing Alzheimer risk emphasizes the need for further research on genetic and environmental factors for effective prevention strategies.</p>

	<p>In this narrative review, we explore the latest evidence on semantic interventions for older adults, including both prevention and rehabilitation/remediation efforts, discussing them particularly in the context of dementia. Cognitive interventions vary in their level of structure, encompassing standardized (task-focused tasks) and unstandardized tasks (person-centered tasks). These interventions also differ in their target: rehabilitation or prevention. Addressing semantic knowledge/semantic memory/semantics is important, primarily because its efficiency impacts other cognitive domains. Semantic tasks are commonly included in preventive and rehabilitation programs, typically as standardized tasks with pre-defined semantic referents. On the other hand, person-centered approaches introduce personally relevant semantics, allowing patients to share thoughts and experiences with expressive language. Although these approaches offer benefits beyond cognitive improvement, their lack of structure may pose challenges. Our question club (CQ) program blends structured activities with personally relevant semantics, aiming to harness the advantages of both methods. Additionally, in this narrative review, we discuss future challenges and directions in the field of semantic interventions.</p>

                Background Insufficient awareness of foot self-care among diabetic individuals results in diabetic foot ulcers. The management of diabetes and diabetic foot ulcers demands a well-coordinated approach that involves multiple healthcare providers (HCPs). The present study aims to develop and validate an interprofessional collaborative (IPC) educational program involving HCPs to efficiently oversee and instruct the public on appropriate strategies for self-managing diabetic foot health. Methods The research group worked on creating an educational module titled ‘An Interprofessional Collaborative Educational Module on Self-Management of Foot for Individuals with Type II Diabetes Mellitus.’ The objective of this module was to promote the adoption of proper practices in self-managing foot health for individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus. A panel of 13 experts participated in a two-stage validation process using the Delphi method to assess the module and its educational resources. Subsequently, the module was tested on a group of 30 participants, i.e., individuals with diabetes, with its efficacy evaluated through conversation analysis and in-depth interviews. Results The three-month-long module included three sessions • 1: Diabetes and its health implications • 2: Diabetic foot and self-management • 3: Interprofessional education in diabetic foot care The mode of content delivery was via Whatsapp, and the educational resources, in the form of pamphlets, flowcharts, handouts, case-based cartoons, and videos on diabetes, including diabetic foot, its risks, and self-management, were shared regularly. All participating experts consensually validated the module and educational resources. Analysis of in-depth interviews revealed that the module immensely benefitted the participants and helped them improve their knowledge and practices of foot care in diabetes. Conclusions The study concludes that IPC educational modules can enhance adherence to proper diabetic foot care practices, potentially reducing the occurrence of foot ulcers and amputations, and ultimately improving the quality of life for individuals with diabetes.

                Background An entrepreneurial mindset is widely recognized as crucial for success in today’s fast-paced competitive world. People across various sectors—businesses, schools, politics, the military, and the public— benefit from a developed entrepreneurial mindset. Consequently, an accurate entrepreneurial mind-sets is becoming increasingly vital. This systematic literature review comprehensively analyzed the research on methods used to assess entrepreneurial mindsets. This inquiry was explored in terms of the fundamental characteristics of the reviewed documents, common entrepreneurial mindset traits or skills, evidence of validity and reliability, research methods employed, study participants, focus areas, and key findings from recent studies. Methods A systematic literature review using the PRISMA framework was utilized, and 39 documents published in the period 2015–2024 were extracted from the EBSCO, ERIC, and SCOPUS databases. Results Researchers from the USA dominated the field of this study. These assessment practices mainly target the educational sector, especially engineering education, where students are the primary participants. Currently, researchers are actively creating new assessment tools for entrepreneurial mind-sets tailored to students in entrepreneurial programs at engineering institutions. Most of these tools have been shown to be valid and reliable. The KEEN 3C framework is the most common assessment tool, emphasizing curiosity (CU), connections (CON), and creating value (CV). Conclusions This study makes significant contributions by compiling the existing literature on entrepreneurial mindset assessment, which presents the most up-to-date knowledge in the field. Educational institutions and business organizations can utilize the entrepreneurial mind-set assessment approaches highlighted in this review. This article is unique in that it enhances the field of entrepreneurship by presenting a new systematic literature review of entrepreneurial mindset assessment approaches.

                Background Piezoceramic materials have unique property which enables direct and bilateral conversion between mechanical and electrical energy. This ability facilitates significant miniaturisation of technology and opens many opportunities in design of new actuators and energy harvesters. Mathematical modelling of piezoelectric modules is notoriously hard due to complex constitutive equations defining mechanical and electrical energy conversion. Methods The article presents research on a new synthesis method based on the Cauer’s method. Mechanical damping is introduced with the use of Rayleigh’s approximation. A discrete electromechanical model is formed based on the Mason’s piezoelectric model. The proposed approach allows modelling of piezoelectric systems based on a set of characteristic frequencies. The method allows a more general approach to the problem of modelling new systems, as opposed to application-oriented methods seen in literature. A non-standard model analysis method using edge graphs and structural numbers is also verified as a potential alternative for matrix-based method. The authors compare their precision and computation requirements. Results The structural method of mechanical model analysis gave identical results as the reference matrix method. However, the non-classical algorithm took much longer to calculate and was using more memory. The electromechanical model analysis has shown an error of 5% in comparison to resonance frequencies taken from a reference plate specification. The calculated magnitude of displacement was well above the capability of a 3.5mm thick piezoelectric plate. Conclusions The synthesis method presented in this paper allows synthesizing piezoelectric cascade models based on limited information in form of characteristic frequencies. Currently this method allows a coarse approximation of the real piezoelectric parameters with limited number of inputs. The additional method of analysis based on structural numbers offers a promising alternative to matrix calculations but requires a more thorough investigation of the computational power required to determine whether it can compete with existing algorithms.

                Abstract Background Melanoma, an aggressive malignant skin cancer, has the ability to spread both locoregionally and to distant sites. The risk of metastasis is correlated to invasion depth and the presence of ulceration. Although gastrointestinal (GI) metastases are uncommon, gastric involvement is particularly rare. Case presentation We report a case of a 62-year-old male who presented with abdominal pain, dyspepsia, anorexia, and weight loss. On physical examination abdominal masses and hepatomegaly were detected. Radiological imaging showed widespread masses in the abdominal and thoracic regions. Upper GI endoscopy identified an umbilicated protruded lesion with central dark pigmentation at the antro-fundic junction. Histopathological examination and immunohistochemical staining were consistent with melanoma. A subsequent rigorous skin examination uncovered a primary malignant skin melanoma. Due to worsening general condition, the patient received palliative hospice care. Conclusion This report highlights the critical need for vigilant skin examination when encountering gastric lesions with dark pigmentation, which led to the identification of initially undetected cutaneous melanoma.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1018/v1?src=rss">Development of an educational model with a management approach to improve the competency of diabetes educator nurses; utilizing King's conceptual framework and goal attainment theory [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Education for diabetes patients is not managed well by diabetes nurse educators because the competency of diabetes nurse educators is low, and the number of diabetes nurse educators in hospitals is not commensurate with the number of diabetes patients, which is much larger. Methods This qualitative phenomenological research uses an exploratory design. Twenty nurse managers and forty staff nurses who participated in the focus group discussion (FGD) were selected using purposive sampling. Nine staff nurses who participated in in-depth interviews were selected using the snowball method. The results of the FGD exploration and in-depth interviews produced components for developing an educational model with a management approach. The development of this educational model uses an input, process, output, and outcome approach. The input uses King’s conceptual framework approach, the method uses the theory of goal attainment and management functions, the output is the competency of nurses to educate diabetes patients, and the outcome is the health literacy of diabetes patients. This educational model was reviewed by three experts: a nursing management expert, a diabetes mellitus expert, and a health literacy expert. Results The educational model for Diabetes nurse educators with a management approach consists of five stages: 1) Educational planning includes identifying educational targets, strategy formulation, and situation analysis. 2) Organizing nursing resources includes strengthening the role of nurses as diabetes educators. 3) Nursing staff includes intraprofessional collaboration and collaboration between nurses and patient families. 4) Direction includes nurses’ motivation for diabetes patients and respecting the culture and values of diabetes patients. 5) Control includes evaluating nurse education for diabetes patients. Conclusion This education model has five competencies, which are structured and systematic so that diabetes nurse educators have the competence to manage diabetes patient education: the personal system, interpersonal system, and social system influence nurse competency.

                Background Muscarinic receptor agonism is a promising mechanism of action for treating psychosis, not present in most D2R-blocking antipsychotics. Xanomeline, an M1/M4-preferring agonist, has shown efficacy in late-stage clinical trials, with more compounds being investigated. Therefore, we aim to synthesize evidence on the preclinical efficacy of muscarinic receptor agonists in animal models of psychosis to provide unique insights and evidence-based information to guide drug development. Methods We plan a systematic review and meta-analysis of in vivo animal studies comparing muscarinic receptor agonists or positive allosteric modulators with control conditions and existing D2R-blocking antipsychotics in animals subjected to any method that induces behavioural changes of relevance for psychosis. We will identify eligible studies by searching multiple electronic databases. At least two independent reviewers will conduct the study selection and data extraction using prespecified forms and assess the risk of bias with the SYRCLE’s tool. Our primary outcomes include locomotor activity and prepulse inhibition measured with standardized mean differences. We will examine other behavioural readouts of relevance for psychosis as secondary outcomes, such as social interaction and cognitive function. We will synthesize the data using multi-level meta-analysis with a predefined random-effects structure, considering the non-independence of the data. In meta-regressions we will explore potential sources of heterogeneity from a predefined list of characteristics of the animal population, model, and intervention. We will assess the confidence in the evidence considering a self-developed instrument thatconsiders the internal and external validity of the evidence.

                Background Patients with chronic low back pain (CLBP) frequently present with kinesiophobia. Although kinesiophobia is found to affect outcomes such as affect pain and quality of life in patients with CLBP, it is unclear whether kinesiophobia is linked to reduction of muscle endurance in these patients. The primary aim of the study was to analyze the impact of kinesiophobia on lumbar extensor endurance in patients with CLBP and asymptomatic individuals. Methods This case-control study was proceeded with 200 patients with CLBP and 400 controls. Kinesiophobia, lumbar endurance and Pain intensity were assessed with Tampa Scale, Soren’s lumbar extensor test and visual analog scale respectively. Regression model was administered to explore the relationship between kinesiophobia and lumbar extensor endurance. Results Prevalence of kinesiophobia was found to be higher in patients with CLBP (30%) than in controls (11%) which is (6.49 ± 0.52, d= 1.07) more in CLBP than controls. Lumbar endurance was significantly lower in CLBP than controls (-20.5±6.84), further affected by the presence of kinesiophobia as lumbar endurance was negatively correlated (r = - 0.09) to Kinesiophobia. Moreover, VAS (r = 0.2) was positively correlated with kinesiophobia in patients with CLBP. Discussion and conclusion A high prevalence of kinesiophobia was reported by patients with CLBP. The presence of kinesiophobia exhibited strong linear relationship with lumbar endurance, and pain intensity among patients with CLBP. Hence management of CLBP should comprise of an assessment of kinesiophobia and appropriate treatment strategies to address it in preventing persistent CLBP.

                Background Dietary habits play a significant role in health and well-being. Nutritional knowledge can influence dietary habits. This study investigated the level of nutrition knowledge and factors affecting nutrition knowledge among student migrants in the West Midlands of the United Kingdom. Method Data were collected from 372 participants using the General Nutrition Knowledge Questionnaire (GNKQ). The effects of gender, length of UK residency, program and level of study, marital status, and history of diet-related diseases on nutrition knowledge were assessed. Results The students generally demonstrated good nutrition knowledge. The overall mean score was 52.3 ± 2.4, and the median score was 54. Mean scores for dietary recommendations (11.9±0.4, 348 participants), food classification (21.3±1.0, 264 participants) and diet-related diseases/weight management (13.2±0.6, 324 participants) are indicative of good nutrition knowledge. Poor knowledge of food choices was observed (5.9±0.4, 156 participants). Females, postgraduates, and married students, as well as those with ≤3 years of UK residency, had higher mean scores compared to those in the opposite groups. BMI and a history of diet-related diseases did not significantly affect nutritional knowledge. Conclusion Gender, level and type of study, marital status, and length of stay in the UK were predictors of good nutrition knowledge. Interventions to improve the knowledge of food choices among student migrants are needed.

                <p>by Eslam Abousamra, Marlin Figgins, Trevor Bedford</p>

Genomic surveillance of pathogen evolution is essential for public health response, treatment strategies, and vaccine development. In the context of SARS-COV-2, multiple models have been developed including Multinomial Logistic Regression (MLR) describing variant frequency growth as well as Fixed Growth Advantage (FGA), Growth Advantage Random Walk (GARW) and Piantham parameterizations describing variant <i>R</i><sub>t</sub>. These models provide estimates of variant fitness and can be used to forecast changes in variant frequency. We introduce a framework for evaluating real-time forecasts of variant frequencies, and apply this framework to the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 during 2022 in which multiple new viral variants emerged and rapidly spread through the population. We compare models across representative countries with different intensities of genomic surveillance. Retrospective assessment of model accuracy highlights that most models of variant frequency perform well and are able to produce reasonable forecasts. We find that the simple MLR model provides ∼0.6% median absolute error and ∼6% mean absolute error when forecasting 30 days out for countries with robust genomic surveillance. We investigate impacts of sequence quantity and quality across countries on forecast accuracy and conduct systematic downsampling to identify that 1000 sequences per week is fully sufficient for accurate short-term forecasts. We conclude that fitness models represent a useful prognostic tool for short-term evolutionary forecasting.

                <p>by Aakash Agrawal, Stanislas Dehaene</p>

Learning to read places a strong challenge on the visual system. Years of expertise lead to a remarkable capacity to separate similar letters and encode their relative positions, thus distinguishing words such as FORM and FROM, invariantly over a large range of positions, sizes and fonts. How neural circuits achieve invariant word recognition remains unknown. Here, we address this issue by recycling deep neural network models initially trained for image recognition. We retrain them to recognize written words and then analyze how reading-specialized units emerge and operate across the successive layers. With literacy, a small subset of units becomes specialized for word recognition in the learned script, similar to the visual word form area (VWFA) in the human brain. We show that these units are sensitive to specific letter identities and their ordinal position from the left or the right of a word. The transition from retinotopic to ordinal position coding is achieved by a hierarchy of “space bigram” unit that detect the position of a letter relative to a blank space and that pool across low- and high-frequency-sensitive units from early layers of the network. The proposed scheme provides a plausible neural code for written words in the VWFA, and leads to predictions for reading behavior, error patterns, and the neurophysiology of reading.

                <p>by Alia Abbara, Lisa Pagani, Celia García-Pareja, Anne-Florence Bitbol</p>

In nature, most microbial populations have complex spatial structures that can affect their evolution. Evolutionary graph theory predicts that some spatial structures modelled by placing individuals on the nodes of a graph affect the probability that a mutant will fix. Evolution experiments are beginning to explicitly address the impact of graph structures on mutant fixation. However, the assumptions of evolutionary graph theory differ from the conditions of modern evolution experiments, making the comparison between theory and experiment challenging. Here, we aim to bridge this gap by using our new model of spatially structured populations. This model considers connected subpopulations that lie on the nodes of a graph, and allows asymmetric migrations. It can handle large populations, and explicitly models serial passage events with migrations, thus closely mimicking experimental conditions. We analyze recent experiments in light of this model. We suggest useful parameter regimes for future experiments, and we make quantitative predictions for these experiments. In particular, we propose experiments to directly test our recent prediction that the star graph with asymmetric migrations suppresses natural selection and can accelerate mutant fixation or extinction, compared to a well-mixed population.

                <p>by Breanne Sparta, Timothy Hamilton, Gunalan Natesan, Samuel D. Aragones, Eric J. Deeds</p>

Effective analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data requires a rigorous distinction between technical noise and biological variation. In this work, we propose a simple feature selection model, termed “Differentially Distributed Genes” or DDGs, where a binomial sampling process for each mRNA species produces a null model of technical variation. Using scRNA-seq data where cell identities have been established <i>a priori</i>, we find that the DDG model of biological variation outperforms existing methods. We demonstrate that DDGs distinguish a validated set of real biologically varying genes, minimize neighborhood distortion, and enable accurate partitioning of cells into their established cell-type groups.

                <p>by Joseph Shingleton, David Mustard, Steven Dyke, Hannah Williams, Emma Bennett, Thomas Finnie</p>

Reverse epidemiology is a mathematical modelling tool used to ascertain information about the source of a pathogen, given the spatial and temporal distribution of cases, hospitalisations and deaths. In the context of a deliberately released pathogen, such as <i>Bacillus anthracis</i> (the disease-causing organism of anthrax), this can allow responders to quickly identify the location and timing of the release, as well as other factors such as the strength of the release, and the realized wind speed and direction at release. These estimates can then be used to parameterise a predictive mechanistic model, allowing for estimation of the potential scale of the release, and to optimise the distribution of prophylaxis.
In this paper we present two novel approaches to reverse epidemiology, and demonstrate their utility in responding to a simulated deliberate release of <i>B. anthracis</i> in ten locations in the UK and compare these to the standard grid-search approach. The two methods—a modified MCMC and a Recurrent Convolutional Neural Network—are able to identify the source location and timing of the release with significantly better accuracy compared to the grid-search approach. Further, the neural network method is able to do inference on new data significantly quicker than either the grid-search or novel MCMC methods, allowing for rapid deployment in time-sensitive outbreaks.

Modular organization at approximately 1 mm scale could be fundamental to cortical processing, but its presence in human association cortex is unknown. Using custom-built, high-density electrode arrays placed on the cortical surface of 7 patients undergoing awake craniotomy for tumor excision, we investigated receptive speech processing in the left (dominant) human posterior superior temporal gyrus. Responses to consonant-vowel syllables and noise-vocoded controls recorded with 1,024 channel micro-grids at 200 μm pitch demonstrated roughly circular domains approximately 1.7 mm in diameter, with sharp boundaries observed in 128 channel linear arrays at 50 μm pitch, possibly consistent with a columnar organization. Peak latencies to syllables in different modules were bimodally distributed centered at 252 and 386 ms. Adjacent modules were sharply delineated from each other by their distinct time courses and stimulus selectivity. We suggest that receptive language cortex may be organized in discrete processing modules.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3002735">LXR-dependent enhancer activation regulates the temporal organization of the liver’s response to refeeding leading to lipogenic gene overshoot</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Noga Korenfeld, Tali Gorbonos, Maria C. Romero Florian, Dan Rotaro, Dana Goldberg, Talia Radushkevitz-Frishman, Meital Charni-Natan, Meirav Bar-Shimon, Carolyn L. Cummins, Ido Goldstein</p>

Transitions between the fed and fasted state are common in mammals. The liver orchestrates adaptive responses to feeding/fasting by transcriptionally regulating metabolic pathways of energy usage and storage. Transcriptional and enhancer dynamics following cessation of fasting (refeeding) have not been explored. We examined the transcriptional and chromatin events occurring upon refeeding in mice, including kinetic behavior and molecular drivers. We found that the refeeding response is temporally organized with the early response focused on ramping up protein translation while the later stages of refeeding drive a bifurcated lipid synthesis program. While both the cholesterol biosynthesis and lipogenesis pathways were inhibited during fasting, most cholesterol biosynthesis genes returned to their basal levels upon refeeding while most lipogenesis genes markedly overshoot above pre-fasting levels. Gene knockout, enhancer dynamics, and ChIP-seq analyses revealed that lipogenic gene overshoot is dictated by LXRα. These findings from unbiased analyses unravel the mechanism behind the long-known phenomenon of refeeding fat overshoot.

                Brouwer et al. develop a pipeline to map polyclonal antibody responses to the Lassa virus glycoprotein using electron microscopy. By applying this to serum from rabbits vaccinated with different vaccine modalities, they reveal and structurally characterize vaccine-specific off- and on-target antibody responses to the Lassa virus glycoprotein.

                Kushinsky et al. demonstrate that the appearance of daylight induces, in visual cortex excitatory neurons, gene expression as well as rapid increases in E/I ratio and neural activity that are subsequently normalized. The light-induced transcription factor NPAS4 drives this daily downward firing rate homeostasis by promoting inhibitory inputs to stabilize visual processing.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92545">The function of juvenile–adult transition axis in female sexual receptivity of Drosophila melanogaster</a></h4>

              
                Female sexual receptivity is essential for reproduction of a species. Neuropeptides play the main role in regulating female receptivity. However, whether neuropeptides regulate female sexual receptivity during the neurodevelopment is unknown. Here, we found the peptide hormone prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH), which belongs to the insect PG (prothoracic gland) axis, negatively regulated virgin female receptivity through ecdysone during neurodevelopment in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>. We identified PTTH neurons as doublesex-positive neurons, they regulated virgin female receptivity before the metamorphosis during the third-instar larval stage. PTTH deletion resulted in the increased EcR-A expression in the whole newly formed prepupae. Furthermore, the ecdysone receptor EcR-A in pC1 neurons positively regulated virgin female receptivity during metamorphosis. The decreased EcR-A in pC1 neurons induced abnormal morphological development of pC1 neurons without changing neural activity. Among all subtypes of pC1 neurons, the function of EcR-A in pC1b neurons was necessary for virgin female copulation rate. These suggested that the changes of synaptic connections between pC1b and other neurons decreased female copulation rate. Moreover, female receptivity significantly decreased when the expression of PTTH receptor Torso was reduced in pC1 neurons. This suggested that PTTH not only regulates female receptivity through ecdysone but also through affecting female receptivity associated neurons directly. The PG axis has similar functional strategy as the hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis in mammals to trigger the juvenile–adult transition. Our work suggests a general mechanism underlying which the neurodevelopment during maturation regulates female sexual receptivity.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/87335">The protein domains of vertebrate species in which selection is more effective have greater intrinsic structural disorder</a></h4>

              
                The nearly neutral theory of molecular evolution posits variation among species in the effectiveness of selection. In an idealized model, the census population size determines both this minimum magnitude of the selection coefficient required for deleterious variants to be reliably purged, and the amount of neutral diversity. Empirically, an ‘effective population size’ is often estimated from the amount of putatively neutral genetic diversity and is assumed to also capture a species’ effectiveness of selection. A potentially more direct measure of the effectiveness of selection is the degree to which selection maintains preferred codons. However, past metrics that compare codon bias across species are confounded by among-species variation in %GC content and/or amino acid composition. Here, we propose a new Codon Adaptation Index of Species (CAIS), based on Kullback–Leibler divergence, that corrects for both confounders. We demonstrate the use of CAIS correlations, as well as the Effective Number of Codons, to show that the protein domains of more highly adapted vertebrate species evolve higher intrinsic structural disorder.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92135">Early moderate prenatal alcohol exposure and maternal diet impact offspring DNA methylation across species</a></h4>

              
                Alcohol consumption in pregnancy can affect genome regulation in the developing offspring but results have been contradictory. We employed a physiologically relevant murine model of short-term moderate prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) resembling common patterns of alcohol consumption in pregnancy in humans. Early moderate PAE was sufficient to affect site-specific DNA methylation in newborn pups without altering behavioural outcomes in adult littermates. Whole-genome bisulfite sequencing of neonatal brain and liver revealed stochastic influence on DNA methylation that was mostly tissue-specific, with some perturbations likely originating as early as gastrulation. DNA methylation differences were enriched in non-coding genomic regions with regulatory potential indicative of broad effects of alcohol on genome regulation. Replication studies in human cohorts with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder suggested some effects were metastable at genes linked to disease-relevant traits including facial morphology, intelligence, educational attainment, autism, and schizophrenia. In our murine model, a maternal diet high in folate and choline protected against some of the damaging effects of early moderate PAE on DNA methylation. Our studies demonstrate that early moderate exposure is sufficient to affect fetal genome regulation even in the absence of overt phenotypic changes and highlight a role for preventative maternal dietary interventions.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95494">ImmCellTyper facilitates systematic mass cytometry data analysis for deep immune profiling</a></h4>

              
                Mass cytometry is a cutting-edge high-dimensional technology for profiling marker expression at the single-cell level, advancing clinical research in immune monitoring. Nevertheless, the vast data generated by cytometry by time-of-flight (CyTOF) poses a significant analytical challenge. To address this, we describe ImmCellTyper (<a href="https://github.com/JingAnyaSun/ImmCellTyper">https://github.com/JingAnyaSun/ImmCellTyper</a>), a novel toolkit for CyTOF data analysis. This framework incorporates BinaryClust, an in-house developed semi-supervised clustering tool that automatically identifies main cell types. BinaryClust outperforms existing clustering tools in accuracy and speed, as shown in benchmarks with two datasets of approximately 4 million cells, matching the precision of manual gating by human experts. Furthermore, ImmCellTyper offers various visualisation and analytical tools, spanning from quality control to differential analysis, tailored to users’ specific needs for a comprehensive CyTOF data analysis solution. The workflow includes five key steps: (1) batch effect evaluation and correction, (2) data quality control and pre-processing, (3) main cell lineage characterisation and quantification, (4) in-depth investigation of specific cell types; and (5) differential analysis of cell abundance and functional marker expression across study groups. Overall, ImmCellTyper combines expert biological knowledge in a semi-supervised approach to accurately deconvolute well-defined main cell lineages, while maintaining the potential of unsupervised methods to discover novel cell subsets, thus facilitating high-dimensional immune profiling.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/90082">Using recurrent neural network to estimate irreducible stochasticity in human choice behavior</a></h4>

              
                Theoretical computational models are widely used to describe latent cognitive processes. However, these models do not equally explain data across participants, with some individuals showing a bigger predictive gap than others. In the current study, we examined the use of theory-independent models, specifically recurrent neural networks (RNNs), to classify the source of a predictive gap in the observed data of a single individual. This approach aims to identify whether the low predictability of behavioral data is mainly due to noisy decision-making or misspecification of the theoretical model. First, we used computer simulation in the context of reinforcement learning to demonstrate that RNNs can be used to identify model misspecification in simulated agents with varying degrees of behavioral noise. Specifically, both prediction performance and the number of RNN training epochs (i.e., the point of early stopping) can be used to estimate the amount of stochasticity in the data. Second, we applied our approach to an empirical dataset where the actions of low IQ participants, compared with high IQ participants, showed lower predictability by a well-known theoretical model (i.e., Daw’s hybrid model for the two-step task). Both the predictive gap and the point of early stopping of the RNN suggested that model misspecification is similar across individuals. This led us to a provisional conclusion that low IQ subjects are mostly noisier compared to their high IQ peers, rather than being more misspecified by the theoretical model. We discuss the implications and limitations of this approach, considering the growing literature in both theoretical and data-driven computational modeling in decision-making science.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99702">Empowering AlphaFold2 for protein conformation selective drug discovery with AlphaFold2-RAVE</a></h4>

              
                Small-molecule drug design hinges on obtaining co-crystallized ligand-protein structures. Despite AlphaFold2’s strides in protein native structure prediction, its focus on apo structures overlooks ligands and associated holo structures. Moreover, designing selective drugs often benefits from the targeting of diverse metastable conformations. Therefore, direct application of AlphaFold2 models in virtual screening and drug discovery remains tentative. Here, we demonstrate an AlphaFold2-based framework combined with all-atom enhanced sampling molecular dynamics and Induced Fit docking, named AF2RAVE-Glide, to conduct computational model-based small-molecule binding of metastable protein kinase conformations, initiated from protein sequences. We demonstrate the AF2RAVE-Glide workflow on three different mammalian protein kinases and their type I and II inhibitors, with special emphasis on binding of known type II kinase inhibitors which target the metastable classical DFG-out state. These states are not easy to sample from AlphaFold2. Here, we demonstrate how with AF2RAVE these metastable conformations can be sampled for different kinases with high enough accuracy to enable subsequent docking of known type II kinase inhibitors with more than 50% success rates across docking calculations. We believe the protocol should be deployable for other kinases and more proteins generally.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91605">Novel cyclic homogeneous oscillation detection method for high accuracy and specific characterization of neural dynamics</a></h4>

              
                Determining the presence and frequency of neural oscillations is essential to understanding dynamic brain function. Traditional methods that detect peaks over 1/<i>f</i> noise within the power spectrum fail to distinguish between the fundamental frequency and harmonics of often highly non-sinusoidal neural oscillations. To overcome this limitation, we define fundamental criteria that characterize neural oscillations and introduce the cyclic homogeneous oscillation (CHO) detection method. We implemented these criteria based on an autocorrelation approach to determine an oscillation’s fundamental frequency. We evaluated CHO by verifying its performance on simulated non-sinusoidal oscillatory bursts and validated its ability to determine the fundamental frequency of neural oscillations in electrocorticographic (ECoG), electroencephalographic (EEG), and stereoelectroencephalographic (SEEG) signals recorded from 27 human subjects. Our results demonstrate that CHO outperforms conventional techniques in accurately detecting oscillations. In summary, CHO demonstrates high precision and specificity in detecting neural oscillations in time and frequency domains. The method’s specificity enables the detailed study of non-sinusoidal characteristics of oscillations, such as the degree of asymmetry and waveform of an oscillation. Furthermore, CHO can be applied to identify how neural oscillations govern interactions throughout the brain and to determine oscillatory biomarkers that index abnormal brain function.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93146">Reversions mask the contribution of adaptive evolution in microbiomes</a></h4>

              
                When examining bacterial genomes for evidence of past selection, the results depend heavily on the mutational distance between chosen genomes. Even within a bacterial species, genomes separated by larger mutational distances exhibit stronger evidence of purifying selection as assessed by d<sub>N</sub>/d<sub>S</sub>, the normalized ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous mutations. Here, we show that the classical interpretation of this scale dependence, weak purifying selection, leads to problematic mutation accumulation when applied to available gut microbiome data. We propose an alternative, adaptive reversion model with opposite implications for dynamical intuition and applications of d<sub>N</sub>/d<sub>S</sub>. Reversions that occur and sweep within-host populations are nearly guaranteed in microbiomes due to large population sizes, short generation times, and variable environments. Using analytical and simulation approaches, we show that adaptive reversion can explain the d<sub>N</sub>/d<sub>S</sub> decay given only dozens of locally fluctuating selective pressures, which is realistic in the context of <i>Bacteroides</i> genomes. The success of the adaptive reversion model argues for interpreting low values of d<sub>N</sub>/d<sub>S</sub> obtained from long timescales with caution as they may emerge even when adaptive sweeps are frequent. Our work thus inverts the interpretation of an old observation in bacterial evolution, illustrates the potential of mutational reversions to shape genomic landscapes over time, and highlights the importance of studying bacterial genomic evolution on short timescales.

	<p>A major scientific objective of cognitive neuroscience is to define cortico-cortical functional connections supporting cognitive functions. Here, we use an original approach combining frequency-tagging and direct electrical stimulation (DES) to test for bidirectional and cross-hemispheric category-specific modulations within the human cortical face network. A unique patient bilaterally implanted with depth electrodes in multiple face-selective cortical regions of the ventral occipito-temporal cortex (VOTC) was shown 70 s sequences of variable natural object images at a 6 Hz rate, objectively identifying deviant face-selective neural activity at 1.2 Hz (i.e., every five images). Concurrent electrical stimulation was separately applied for 10 seconds on four independently defined face-selective sites in the right and left VOTC. Upon stimulation, we observed reduced or even abolished face-selective neural activity locally and, most interestingly, at distant VOTC recording sites. Remote DES effects were found up to the anterior temporal lobe (ATL) in both forward and backward directions along the VOTC, as well as across the two hemispheres. This reduction was specific to face-selective neural activity, with the general 6 Hz visual response being mostly unaffected. Overall, these results shed light on the functional connectivity of the cortical face-selective network, supporting its non-hierarchical organization as well as bidirectional effective category-selective connections between posterior &amp;amp;lsquo;core&amp;amp;rsquo; regions and the ATL. They also pave the way for widespread and systematic development of this approach to better understand the functional and effective connectivity of human brain networks.</p>

	<p>Medulloblastoma, a malignant brain tumor primarily affecting children, poses significant challenges to patients and clinicians due to its complex treatment and potential long-term cognitive consequences. While recent advancements in treatment have significantly improved survival rates, survivors often face cognitive impairments, particularly in reading, impacting their quality of life. According to the double deficit theory, reading impairments are caused by deficits in one or both of two independent reading-related functions: phonological awareness and rapid visual naming. This longitudinal study investigates neurofunctional changes related to reading in medulloblastoma survivors in comparison to controls using functional MRI acquired during rapid automatized naming tasks over three annual visits. Support vector machine classification of functional MRI data reveals a progressive divergence in brain activity patterns between medulloblastoma survivors and healthy controls over time, suggesting delayed effects of cancer treatment on brain function. Alterations in brain regions involved in visual processing and orthographic recognition during rapid naming tasks imply disruptions in the ventral visual pathway associated with normal orthographic processing. These alterations are correlated with performance in tasks involving sound awareness, reading fluency, and word attack. These findings underscore the dynamic nature of post-treatment neurofunctional alterations and the importance of early identification and intervention to address cognitive deficits in survivors.</p>

	<p>Members of three generations of a Norwegian family (N = 9) with a rare demyelinating disease were studied. Neuropsychological testing was performed using the Mini Mental Status Examination (MMSE), Wechsler Intelligence Scale-III (WAIS-III), and Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised (HVLT-R). EEGs were recorded with grand averaging spectrograms and event-related potentials (ERPs) in rest and cued GO/NOGO task conditions. The results were within the normal range on the MMSE. Full-scale WAIS-III results were in the range of 69&amp;amp;ndash;113, with lower scores in verbal understanding than in perceptual organization, and low scores also in indications of working memory and processing speed difficulties. The HVLT-R showed impairment of both immediate and delayed recall. Quantitative EEG showed an increase in low alpha (around 7.5 Hz) activity in the temporofrontal areas, mostly on the left side. There was a deviation in the late (&amp;amp;gt;300 ms) component in response to the NOGO stimuli. A strong correlation (r = 0.78, p = 0.01) between the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test (delayed recall) and the amplitude of the NOGO ERP component was observed. The EEG spectra showed deviations from the healthy controls, especially at frontotemporal deviations. Deviations in the ERP component of the NOGO trials were related to delayed recall in the Hopkins Verbal learning test.</p>

	<p>Gonadal steroids exert different effects on the central nervous system (CNS), such as preserving neuronal function and promoting neuronal survival. Estradiol, progesterone, and testosterone reduce neuronal loss in the CNS in animal models of neurodegeneration. However, hormone replacement therapy has been associated with higher rates of endometrial, prostate, and breast cancer. Tibolone (TIB), the metabolites of which show estrogenic and progestogenic effects, is an alternative to reduce this risk. However, the impact of TIB on memory and learning, as well as on choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) and tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH) levels in the hippocampus of aging males, is unknown. We administered TIB to aged C57BL/6J male mice at different doses (0.01 or 1.0 mg/kg per day for 12 weeks) and evaluated its effects on memory and learning and the content of ChAT and TPH. We assessed memory and learning with object recognition and elevated T-maze tasks. Additionally, we determined ChAT and TPH protein levels in the hippocampus by Western blotting. TIB administration increased the percentage of time spent on the novel object in the object recognition task. In addition, the latency of leaving the enclosed arm increased in both TIB groups, suggesting an improvement in fear-based learning. We also observed decreased ChAT content in the group treated with the 0.01 mg/kg TIB dose. In the case of TPH, no changes were observed with either TIB dose. These results show that long-term TIB administration improves memory without affecting locomotor activity and modulates cholinergic but not serotonergic systems in the hippocampus of aged male mice.</p>

	<p>Extensive research has shed light on the cellular and functional underpinnings of higher cognition as influenced by the prefrontal cortex. Neurotransmitters act as key regulatory molecules within the PFC to assist with synchronizing cognitive state and arousal levels. The monoamine family of neurotransmitters, including dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine, play multifaceted roles in the cognitive processes behind learning and memory. The present review explores the organization and signaling patterns of monoamines within the PFC, as well as elucidates the numerous roles played by monoamines in learning and higher cognitive function.</p>

	<p>Tai Chi (TC) practice has been shown to improve both cognitive and physical function in older adults. However, the neural mechanisms underlying the benefits of TC remain unclear. Our primary aims are to explore whether distinct age-related and TC-practice-related relationships can be identified with respect to either temporal or spatial (within/between-network connectivity) differences. This cross-sectional study examined recurrent neural network dynamics, employing an adaptive, data-driven thresholding approach to source-localized resting-state EEG data in order to identify meaningful connections across time-varying graphs, using both temporal and spatial features derived from a hidden Markov model (HMM). Mann&amp;amp;ndash;Whitney U tests assessed between-group differences in temporal and spatial features by age and TC practice using either healthy younger adult controls (YACs, n = 15), healthy older adult controls (OACs, n = 15), or Tai Chi older adult practitioners (TCOAs, n = 15). Our results showed that aging is associated with decreased within-network and between-network functional connectivity (FC) across most brain networks. Conversely, TC practice appears to mitigate these age-related declines, showing increased FC within and between networks in older adults who practice TC compared to non-practicing older adults. These findings suggest that TC practice may abate age-related declines in neural network efficiency and stability, highlighting its potential as a non-pharmacological intervention for promoting healthy brain aging. This study furthers the triple-network model, showing that a balancing and reorientation of attention might be engaged not only through higher-order and top-down mechanisms (i.e., FPN/DAN) but also via the coupling of bottom-up, sensory&amp;amp;ndash;motor (i.e., SMN/VIN) networks.</p>

                <p>Musicians can have better abilities to understand speech in adverse condition such as background noise than non-musicians. However, the neural mechanisms behind such enhanced behavioral performances remain largely unclear. Studies have found that the subcortical frequency-following response to the fundamental frequency of speech and its higher harmonics (speech-FFR) may be involved since it is larger in people with musical training than in those without. Recent research has shown that the speech-FFR consists of a cortical contribution in addition to the subcortical sources. Both the subcortical and the cortical contribution are modulated by selective attention to one of two competing speakers. However, it is unknown whether the strength of the cortical contribution to the speech-FFR, or its attention modulation, is influenced by musical training. Here we investigate these issues through magnetoencephalographic (MEG) recordings of 52 subjects (18 musicians, 25 non-musicians, and 9 neutral participants) listening to two competing male speakers while selectively attending one of them. The speech-in-noise comprehension abilities of the participants were not assessed. We find that musicians and non-musicians display comparable cortical speech-FFRs and additionally exhibit similar subject-to-subject variability in the response. Furthermore, we also do not observe a difference in the modulation of the neural response through selective attention between musicians and non-musicians. Moreover, when assessing whether the cortical speech-FFRs are influenced by particular aspects of musical training, no significant effects emerged. Taken together, we did not find any effect of musical training on the cortical speech-FFR.</p>

                Background Tonsillectomy is among the standard procedures performed on the head and neck. Acute pain following tonsillectomy impairs recovery and contributes to physical discomfort. Adequate pharmacological management of post-operative pain increases the satisfaction and well-being of a patient. The aim of this study was to determine the pharmacological management of acute pain post-tonsillectomy in the otorhinolaryngology department at Muhimbili National Hospital (MNH) Methods A hospital-based prospective cohort study was carried out among 72 patients. A structured questionnaire was used to collect data from selected patients who underwent cold tonsillectomy. Postoperative pain assessment was conducted at six, 12, and 18 hours from initiation of pharmacological management following tonsillectomy. An interviewer-administered numerical rating scale was used for assessing postoperative pain scores. Results A total of 72 patients were enrolled, of which most were female (73.6%). The majority of patients were in the age group of 8–15 years (50%). Paracetamol was the commonest analgesia prescribed (37.5%) post-tonsillectomy. The majority of patients experienced moderate pain at six- and 12-hours following tonsillectomy, 55.6% and 65.3%, respectively, whereas 88.9% of patients had mild pain at 18 hours after initial analgesic administration. Pain relief was attained by all patients aged 16–23 years (96.6%), all being female patients, and these differences were statistically insignificant. Paracetamol achieved pain reduction from moderate pain (59.3%) and severe pain (37.0%) at six hours to mild pain at 18 hours (88.9%). Conclusions Paracetamol was the commonly prescribed analgesic following tonsillectomy with majority of patients attaining moderate pain; however, there was no significant difference between the use of combined drugs and single drug use. This could be influenced by the sample size of the studied population and individual variations in pain perception.

                Background Digital elevation models (DEMs) are important in many fields, such as geomatics and water conservation in mountainous areas. Geomorphic feature lines are necessary for topography interpolation and computation from DEMs. Methods Instead of a parameter space, we propose a novel automatic extraction of geomorphic feature lines in the feature space from discrete airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data by the tensor voting method (TVM), which was originally developed for image data. A tensor field for discrete airborne LiDAR points was first established, and then, utilizing the TVM, a new geometric feature metric of data, the line feature strength, was captured. A practical line-growing method based on the local maxima line feature strength is proposed in this study. Results Compared with general line growing, which is based on a certain threshold, our line growing method is quite effective, particularly for the extraction of primary and minor ridge and valley lines in mountainous areas. Conclusions The method presented in this paper is fast and automated, and can furnish operators with a wealth of detailed information about minor line features. This enables the extraction of ridge and valley lines that are tailored to specific requirements. Undoubtedly, the method developed here can be generalized to a large amount of LiDAR data.

                SPARC-related modular calcium-binding protein 1, otherwise known as SMOC-1, is a secreted glycoprotein involved in various cell biological processes including cell-matrix interactions, osteoblast differentiation, embryonic development, and homeostasis. SMOC-1 was found to be elevated in asymptomatic Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patient cortex as well as being enriched in amyloid plaques and in AD patientcerebrospinal fluid, arguing for SMOC-1 as a promising biomarker for AD. Having access to high-quality SMOC-1 antibodies is crucial for the scientific community. It can ensure the consistency and reliability of SMOC-1 research, and further the exploration of its potential as both a therapeutic target or diagnostic marker..

                Background Dendritic spines are tiny protrusions found along the dendrites of neurons, and their number is a measure of the density of synaptic connections. Altered density and morphology is observed in several pathologies, and spine formation as well as morphological changes correlate with learning and memory. The detection of spines in microscopy images and the analysis of their morphology is therefore a prerequisite for many studies. We have developed a new open-source, freely available, plugin for ImageJ/FIJI, called Spot Spine, that allows detection and morphological measurements of spines in three dimensional images. Method Local maxima are detected in spine heads, and the intensity distribution around the local maximum is computed to perform the segmentation of each spine head. Spine necks are then traced from the spine head to the dendrite. Several parameters can be set to optimize detection and segmentation, and manual correction gives further control over the result of the process. Results The plugin allows the analysis of images of dendrites obtained with various labeling and imaging methods. Quantitative measurements are retrieved including spine head volume and surface, and neck length. Conclusion The plugin and instructions for use are available at https://imagej.net/plugins/spot-spine.

Surveillance systems that monitor pathogen genome sequences are critical for rapidly detecting the introduction and emergence of pathogen variants. To evaluate how interactions between surveillance capacity, variant properties, and the epidemiological context influence the timeliness of pathogen variant detection, we developed a geographically explicit stochastic compartmental model to simulate the transmission of a novel SARS-CoV-2 variant in New York City. We measured the impact of (1) testing and sequencing volume, (2) geographic targeting of testing, (3) the timing and location of variant emergence, and (4) the relative variant transmissibility on detection speed and on the undetected disease burden. Improvements in detection times and reduction of undetected infections were driven primarily by increases in the number of sequenced samples. The relative transmissibility of the new variant and the epidemic context of variant emergence also influenced detection times, showing that individual surveillance strategies can result in a wide range of detection outcomes, depending on the underlying dynamics of the circulating variants. These findings help contextualize the design, interpretation, and trade-offs of genomic surveillance strategies of pandemic respiratory pathogens.

                <p>by Hao Duan, Qingchen Zhang, Feifei Cui, Quan Zou, Zilong Zhang</p>

Spatial transcriptome technology can parse transcriptomic data at the spatial level to detect high-throughput gene expression and preserve information regarding the spatial structure of tissues. Identifying spatial domains, that is identifying regions with similarities in gene expression and histology, is the most basic and critical aspect of spatial transcriptome data analysis. Most current methods identify spatial domains only through a single view, which may obscure certain important information and thus fail to make full use of the information embedded in spatial transcriptome data. Therefore, we propose an unsupervised clustering framework based on multiview graph convolutional networks (MVST) to achieve accurate spatial domain recognition by the learning graph embedding features of neighborhood graphs constructed from gene expression information, spatial location information, and histopathological image information through multiview graph convolutional networks. By exploring spatial transcriptomes from multiple views, MVST enables data from all parts of the spatial transcriptome to be comprehensively and fully utilized to obtain more accurate spatial expression patterns. We verified the effectiveness of MVST on real spatial transcriptome datasets, the robustness of MVST on some simulated datasets, and the reasonableness of the framework structure of MVST in ablation experiments, and from the experimental results, it is clear that MVST can achieve a more accurate spatial domain identification compared with the current more advanced methods. In conclusion, MVST is a powerful tool for spatial transcriptome research with improved spatial domain recognition.

                <p>by Caterina Millevoi, Damiano Pasetto, Massimiliano Ferronato</p>

Compartmental models provide simple and efficient tools to analyze the relevant transmission processes during an outbreak, to produce short-term forecasts or transmission scenarios, and to assess the impact of vaccination campaigns. However, their calibration is not straightforward, since many factors contribute to the rapid change of the transmission dynamics. For example, there might be changes in the individual awareness, the imposition of non-pharmacological interventions and the emergence of new variants. As a consequence, model parameters such as the transmission rate are doomed to vary in time, making their assessment more challenging. Here, we propose to use Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to track the temporal changes in the model parameters and the state variables. PINNs recently gained attention in many engineering applications thanks to their ability to consider both the information from data (typically uncertain) and the governing equations of the system. The ability of PINNs to identify unknown model parameters makes them particularly suitable to solve ill-posed inverse problems, such as those arising in the application of epidemiological models. Here, we develop a reduced-split approach for the implementation of PINNs to estimate the temporal changes in the state variables and transmission rate of an epidemic based on the SIR model equation and infectious data. The main idea is to split the training first on the epidemiological data, and then on the residual of the system equations. The proposed method is applied to five synthetic test cases and two real scenarios reproducing the first months of the Italian COVID-19 pandemic. Our results show that the split implementation of PINNs outperforms the joint approach in terms of accuracy (up to one order of magnitude) and computational times (speed up of 20%). Finally, we illustrate that the proposed PINN-method can also be adopted to produced short-term forecasts of the dynamics of an epidemic.

                <p>by Ariel Rokem</p>

As large, high-dimensional data have become more common, software development is playing an increasingly important role in research across many different fields. This creates a need to adopt software engineering practices in research settings. Code review is the engineering practice of giving and receiving detailed feedback on a computer program. Consistent and continuous examination of the evolution of computer programs by others has been shown to be beneficial, especially when reviewers are familiar with the technical aspects of the software and also when they possess relevant domain expertise. The rules described in the present article provide information about the why, when, and how of code review. They provide the motivation for continual code reviews as a natural part of a rigorous research program. They provide practical guidelines for conducting review of code both in person, as a “lab meeting for code,” as well as asynchronously, using industry-standard online tools. A set of guidelines is provided for the nitty-gritty details of code review, as well as for the etiquette of such a review. Both the technical and the social aspects of code review are covered to provide the reader with a comprehensive approach that facilitates an effective, enjoyable, and educational approach to code review.

                <p>by Gustavo Menesse, Joaquín J. Torres</p>

The relation between electroencephalography (EEG) rhythms, brain functions, and behavioral correlates is well-established. Some physiological mechanisms underlying rhythm generation are understood, enabling the replication of brain rhythms <i>in silico</i>. This offers a pathway to explore connections between neural oscillations and specific neuronal circuits, potentially yielding fundamental insights into the functional properties of brain waves. Information theory frameworks, such as Integrated information Decomposition (Φ-ID), relate dynamical regimes with informational properties, providing deeper insights into neuronal dynamic functions. Here, we investigate wave emergence in an excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) balanced network of <i>integrate and fire</i> neurons with short-term synaptic plasticity. This model produces a diverse range of EEG-like rhythms, from low <i>δ</i> waves to high-frequency oscillations. Through Φ-ID, we analyze the network’s information dynamics and its relation with different emergent rhythms, elucidating the system’s suitability for functions such as robust information transfer, storage, and parallel operation. Furthermore, our study helps to identify regimes that may resemble pathological states due to poor informational properties and high randomness. We found, e.g., that <i>in silico</i> <i>β</i> and <i>δ</i> waves are associated with maximum information transfer in inhibitory and excitatory neuron populations, respectively, and that the coexistence of excitatory <i>θ</i>, <i>α</i>, and <i>β</i> waves is associated to information storage. Additionally, we observed that high-frequency oscillations can exhibit either high or poor informational properties, potentially shedding light on ongoing discussions regarding physiological versus pathological high-frequency oscillations. In summary, our study demonstrates that dynamical regimes with similar oscillations may exhibit vastly different information dynamics. Characterizing information dynamics within these regimes serves as a potent tool for gaining insights into the functions of complex neuronal networks. Finally, our findings suggest that the use of information dynamics in both model and experimental data analysis, could help discriminate between oscillations associated with cognitive functions and those linked to neuronal disorders.

Inferring the driving regulatory programs from comparative analysis of gene expression data is a cornerstone of systems biology. Many computational frameworks were developed to address this problem, including our iPAGE (information-theoretic Pathway Analysis of Gene Expression) toolset that uses information theory to detect non-random patterns of expression associated with given pathways or regulons. Our recent observations, however, indicate that existing approaches are susceptible to the technical biases that are inherent to most real world annotations. To address this, we have extended our information-theoretic framework to account for specific biases and artifacts in biological networks using the concept of conditional information. To showcase pyPAGE, we performed a comprehensive analysis of regulatory perturbations that underlie the molecular etiology of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). pyPAGE successfully recapitulated several known AD-associated gene expression programs. We also discovered several additional regulons whose differential activity is significantly associated with AD. We further explored how these regulators relate to pathological processes in AD through cell-type specific analysis of single cell and spatial gene expression datasets. Our findings showcase the utility of pyPAGE as a precise and reliable biomarker discovery in complex diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease.

                <p>by Yann Le Cunff, Laurent Chesneau, Sylvain Pastezeur, Xavier Pinson, Nina Soler, Danielle Fairbrass, Benjamin Mercat, Ruddi Rodriguez-Garcia, Zahraa Alayan, Ahmed Abdouni, Gary de Neidhardt, Valentin Costes, Mélodie Anjubault, Hélène Bouvrais, Christophe Héligon, Jacques Pécréaux</p>

How can inter-individual variability be quantified? Measuring many features per experiment raises the question of choosing them to recapitulate high-dimensional data. Tackling this challenge on spindle elongation phenotypes, we showed that only three typical elongation patterns describe spindle elongation in <i>C. elegans</i> one-cell embryo. These archetypes, automatically extracted from the experimental data using principal component analysis (PCA), accounted for more than 95% of inter-individual variability of more than 1600 experiments across more than 100 different conditions. The two first archetypes were related to spindle average length and anaphasic elongation rate. The third archetype, accounting for 6% of the variability, was novel and corresponded to a transient spindle shortening in late metaphase, reminiscent of kinetochore function-defect phenotypes. Importantly, these three archetypes were robust to the choice of the dataset and were found even considering only non-treated conditions. Thus, the inter-individual differences between genetically perturbed embryos have the same underlying nature as natural inter-individual differences between wild-type embryos, independently of the temperatures. We thus propose that beyond the apparent complexity of the spindle, only three independent mechanisms account for spindle elongation, weighted differently in the various conditions. Interestingly, the spindle-length archetypes covered both metaphase and anaphase, suggesting that spindle elongation in late metaphase is sufficient to predict the late anaphase length. We validated this idea using a machine-learning approach. Finally, given amounts of these three archetypes could represent a quantitative phenotype. To take advantage of this, we set out to predict interacting genes from a seed based on the PCA coefficients. We exemplified this firstly on the role of <i>tpxl-1</i> whose homolog <i>tpx2</i> is involved in spindle microtubule branching, secondly the mechanism regulating metaphase length, and thirdly the central spindle players which set the length at anaphase. We found novel interactors not in public databases but supported by recent experimental publications.

Centrosome amplification is a feature of cancer cells associated with chromosome instability and invasiveness. Enhancing chromosome instability and subsequent cancer cell death via centrosome unclustering and multipolar divisions is an aimed-for therapeutic approach. Here, we show that centrosome amplification potentiates responses to conventional chemotherapy in addition to its effect on multipolar divisions and chromosome instability. We perform single-cell live imaging of chemotherapy responses in epithelial ovarian cancer cell lines and observe increased cell death when centrosome amplification is induced. By correlating cell fate with mitotic behaviors, we show that enhanced cell death can occur independently of chromosome instability. We identify that cells with centrosome amplification are primed for apoptosis. We show they are dependent on the apoptotic inhibitor BCL-XL and that this is not a consequence of mitotic stresses associated with centrosome amplification. Given the multiple mechanisms that promote chemotherapy responses in cells with centrosome amplification, we assess such a relationship in an epithelial ovarian cancer patient cohort. We show that high centrosome numbers associate with improved treatment responses and longer overall survival. Our work identifies apoptotic priming as a clinically relevant consequence of centrosome amplification, expanding our understanding of this pleiotropic cancer cell feature.

                Abstract* Background Digital addictions are a major problem worldwide, which has increased considerably during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this scenario, two important impact factors to explain this problem are stress and anxiety because of COVID-19. The objective of this research was to determine the impact of distress and anxiety due to COVID-19 on digital addictions. Methods cross-sectional, explanatory study. A total of 802 students from public and private universities residing in the city of Lima and Callao (Peru), with a mean age of 21.68 (SD = 3.11), selected by convenience sampling, participated in the study. The MULTICAGE CAD-4 questionnaire, the distress scale, and the COVID-19 worry scale were applied. Results two models examined with structural equation modeling showed good fit indices (CFI and TLI > .95, RMSEA and SRMR < .06). The first model shows that the latent variables distress and anxiety due to COVID-19 have direct effects on digital addictions as a general construct (R2 = 22%). The second model shows that the exogenous latent variables (stress and anxiety) have direct effects of different magnitudes on each digital technology, so the variance explained on smartphone addiction was higher (R2 = 25%) with respect to internet (R2 = 19%) and video game addiction (R2 = 6%). It was also found that for every male, there are two females with high levels of distress and anxiety. Regarding the problematic use of smartphones and internet, there is a prevalence of 40% regardless of sex; but as for the problematic use of video games, there is a marked difference between males (18.8%) and females (2.7%). Conclusion the distress and anxiety caused by COVID-19 have a direct impact in aggravating digital addictions.

<p>Immune cell-derived IL-4 induces Ly6C<sup>+</sup> macrophages to express BDNF. Following the injection of IL-4 neutralizing antibody into the infarct, the BDNF, IL-4 protein lev and the quantity of BDNF<sup>+</sup>/Ly6C<sup>+</sup> cells significantly decreased.</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>We reported that infiltrated Ly6C<sup>+</sup> macrophages express brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) only at the cerebral cortex infarct in a rat dMCAO model. However, the changein neuron-expressed BDNF, the niche components that induce the Ly6C<sup>+</sup> cells to express BDNF, and the cellular sources of these components, remain unclear. In this study, immunofluorescence double staining was performed to label BDNF and Ly6C on brain sections at 3, 24, and 48 h following distal middle cerebral artery occlusion (dMCAO) of male rats, and to stain BDNF with Ly6C, IL-4R, and IL-10R. A neutralizing anti-IL-4 antibody was injected into the infarct, and the IL-4 and BDNF concentrations in the subareas of the infarct were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. To find out the cellular sources of IL-4, the markers for microglia, T cells, and neurons were co-stained with IL-4 separately. In certain infarct subareas, the main BDNF-expressing cells shifted quickly from NeuN<sup>+</sup> neurons to Ly6C<sup>+</sup> cells during 24–48 h post-stroke, and the Ly6C<sup>+</sup>/BDNF<sup>+</sup> cells mostly expressed IL-4 receptor. Following IL-4 neutralizing antibody injection, the BDNF, IL-4 protein levels, and BDNF<sup>+</sup>/Ly6C<sup>+</sup> cells decreased significantly. The main IL-4-expressing cell type in this infarct subarea is not neuron either, but immune cells, including microglia, monocyte, macrophages, and T cells. The neurons, maintained BDNF and IL-4 expression in the peri-infarct area. In conclusion, in a specific cerebral subarea of the rat dMCAO model, IL-4 secreted by immune cells is one of the main inducers for Ly6C<sup>+</sup> cells to express BDNF.</p>

                Background: Many randomized trials measure a continuous outcome simultaneously at baseline and after taking the drug. For a single continuous post-treatment outcome, the sample size calculation is simple, but if there are assessments at multiple time points post-treatment then this longitudinal data may give more insights by analyzing the data using the repeated measures method. Also, if the sample size is calculated using the single time-point method for longitudinal data, it may lead to a larger than required sample size, increasing the cost and time. Methods: In this research, an effort is made to determine the size of the sample for repeated measures case and then compared with the single post-baseline case. The sample sizes were examined under different scenarios for the continuous type of response variable. Under Mean contrast and Diff contrast the sample sizes were calculated with different correlations. These two scenarios were again examined under compound symmetry as well as Auto regressive of order 1 type of correlation structure in longitudinal data. The graphical presentation is given for better visualization of the scenarios. Results: Sample size required for highly correlated longitudinal data using multi timepoint sample size derivation method led to much smaller sample size requirement as compared to single timepoint sample size calculation method. Conclusions: This study will help researchers to make better decisions in choosing the right method for sample size determination which may reduce the time and cost of carrying out the experiment. Also, we must carefully assess which method to go with when the correlation is weak. More complex correlation structures are not studied in this article but can be studied in the same fashion.

                Background: In the evaluation of research proposals, reviewers are often required to provide their opinions using various forms of quantitative and qualitative criteria. In 2020, the European Commission removed, for the Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions (MSCA) Innovative Training Networks (ITN) funding scheme, the numerical scores from the individual evaluations but retained them in the consensus report. This study aimed to assess whether there were any differences in reviewer comments’ linguistic characteristics after the numerical scoring was removed, compared to comments from 2019 when numerical scoring was still present. Methods: This was an observational study and the data were collected for the Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions (MSCA) Innovative Training Networks (ITN) evaluation reports from the calls of 2019 and 2020, for both individual and consensus comments and numerical scores about the quality of the research proposal on three evaluation criteria: Excellence, Impact and Implementation. All comments were analyzed using the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) program. Results: For both years, the comments for proposal’s strengths were written in a style that reflects objectivity, clout, and positive affect, while in weaknesses cold and objective style dominated, and that pattern remained stable across proposal status and research domains. Linguistic variables explained a very small proportion of the variance of the differences between 2019 and 2020 (McFadden R2=0.03). Conclusions: Removing the numerical scores was not associated with the differences in linguistic characteristics of the reviewer comments. Future studies should adopt a qualitative approach to assess whether there are conceptual changes in the content of the comments.

                Background: The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has affected people's economies, lifestyles, and physical, emotional, and sleep health. This research aimed to estimate the prevalence of insomnia and symptoms of stress, anxiety, and depression among teachers with the resumption of in-person instruction at schools following a hiatus after COVID-19 lockdowns in India. We also studied the association of teachers' insomnia with psychological symptoms and demographic variables. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional survey between October –November 2021 after schools had reopened during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data was collected using standard questionnaires online among schoolteachers. We explored the association of insomnia with teachers' symptoms of stress, anxiety, depression, sex, school boards, and age groups. Results: Of 124 schoolteachers surveyed, the prevalence of insomnia was 37.9% (subthreshold in 25% and clinical in 12.9%). The prevalence of stress, depression, and anxiety was 20.2%, 30.6%, and 45.2%, respectively. There was a significant association (p<0.001) of insomnia with symptoms of anxiety, stress, and depression in univariate analysis. On multivariate analysis, we found that those feeling stressed had a 6.4 times higher risk of insomnia (95% CI: 1.5-28.3, p - 0.01). There was no association of insomnia with age, sex, school educational boards, and type of institution. Conclusions: Over one-third (37.9%) of teachers reported having trouble sleeping when they returned to the school's typical face-to-face instruction modalities through COVID-19 times, and insomnia was more prevalent in those with stress.

                Background The concept of euthanasia has recently come into the spotlight, and cases such as those of Aruna Shanbaug have heavily influenced people’s opinions on the topic. Whether euthanasia is performed with the intention of ending suffering that otherwise cannot be helped should truly be supported. The thoughts on this topic- especially of those who work closely with patients who suffer from terminal illnesses- healthcare providers must be analyzed. Their perception and views on legalizing the procedure and their hesitancy or lack thereof to perform such a procedure would give the rest of the world a clearer picture- a better standpoint to understand what to do. This study attempted to quantify and analyze the views of doctors and medical students regarding euthanasia. Methods A cross-sectional survey of 212 doctors and medical students at a private medical college in South India was conducted to determine their attitudes toward euthanasia. Results Most participants (66%) supported the practice of euthanasia. The majority of participants also believed that euthanasia should only be performed with the explicit consent of the patient (71.7%). It was also observed that those who had heard about euthanasia via hearsay mostly agreed that it must only be performed with the explicit consent of the patient. Moreover, the study showed that those who had heard about it from hearsay and news mostly stood for it. Conclusion It has been noted that news and media all around us heavily influence people’s opinions. It is concluded that these opinions have changed from the past, and will likely do so depending on the environment and media around the topic.

<p>We identify a novel ganglion cell type in marmoset retina, named tufted cell, which expresses the transcription factor Foxp2. Tufted cells are characterized by bare primary dendrites which branch frequently in the peripheral dendritic field to form dense tufts. The dendritic stratification and overall dendritic field size of tufted cells is otherwise comparable to that of broad thorny ganglion cells. 

</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The transcription factor forkhead/winged-helix domain proteins Foxp1 and Foxp2 have previously been studied in mouse retina, where they are expressed in retinal ganglion cells named F-mini and F-midi. Here we show that both transcription factors are expressed by small subpopulations (on average less than 10%) of retinal ganglion cells in the retina of the marmoset monkey (<i>Callithrix jacchus</i>). The morphology of Foxp1- and Foxp2-expressing cells was revealed by intracellular DiI injections of immunofluorescent cells. Foxp1- and Foxp2-expressing cells comprised multiple types of wide-field ganglion cells, including broad thorny cells, narrow thorny cells, and tufted cells. The large majority of Foxp2-expressing cells were identified as tufted cells. Tufted cells stratify broadly in the middle of the inner plexiform layer. They resemble broad thorny cells but their proximal dendrites are bare of branches and the distal dendrites branch frequently forming dense dendritic tufts. Double labeling with calretinin, a previously established marker for broad thorny and narrow thorny cells, showed that only a small proportion of ganglion cells co-expressed calretinin and Foxp1 or Foxp2 supporting the idea that the two markers are differentially expressed in retinal ganglion cells of marmoset retina.</p>

After forelimb input loss, the anterior FBS immediately responds to lower jaw stimulation, with the entire FBS doing so in 7 weeks. The lower jaw barrel subfield (LJBSF) supplies immediate input, whereas the ventral posterior lateral (VPL) thalamus provides new delayed input to the posterior FBS.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Previously, we reported an immediate emergence of new lower jaw input to the anterior forepaw barrel subfield (FBS) in primary somatosensory cortex (SI) following forelimb deafferentation. However, a delay of 7 weeks or more post-amputation results in the presence of this new input to both anterior and posterior FBS. The immediate change suggests pre-existing latent lower jaw input in the FBS, whereas the delayed alteration implies the involvement of alternative sources. One possible source for immediate lower jaw responses is the neighboring lower jaw barrel subfield (LJBSF). We used anatomical tracers to investigate the possible projection of LJBSF to the FBS in normal and forelimb-amputated rats. Our findings are as follows: (1) anterograde tracer injection into LJBSF in normal and amputated rats labeled fibers and terminals exclusively in the anterior FBS; (2) retrograde tracer injection in the anterior FBS in normal and forelimb-amputated rats, heavily labeled cell bodies predominantly in the posterior LJBSF, with fewer in the anterior LJBSF; (3) retrograde tracer injection in the posterior FBS in normal and forelimb-amputated rats, sparsely labeled cell bodies in the posterior LJBSF; (4) retrograde tracer injection in anterior and posterior FBS in normal and forelimb-amputated rats, labeled cells exclusively in ventral posterior lateral (VPL) nucleus and posterior thalamus (PO); (5) retrograde tracer injection in LJBSF-labeled cell bodies exclusively in ventral posterior medial thalamic nucleus and PO. These findings suggest that LJBSF facilitates rapid lower jaw reorganization in the anterior FBS, whereas VPL and/or other subcortical sites provide a likely substrate for delayed reorganization observed in the posterior FBS.</p>

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>We have investigated the hippocampal connectivity of the marmoset presubiculum (PreS) and reported that major connections of PreS in the rat were conserved in the marmoset. Moreover, our results indicated the presence of several additional projections that were almost absent in the rat brain, but abundant in the marmoset, such as direct projections from CA1 to PreS. However, little is known about the connectivity between the frontal brain regions and PreS or hippocampal formation. Therefore, we investigated the distribution of cells of the origins and terminals of the presubicular and hippocampal projections in the marmoset frontal brain regions using the retrograde and anterograde tracer cholera toxin B subunit. In cases of tracer injections into all layers of PreS, many neurons and terminals were labeled in the claustrum–endopiriform (Cl–En) complex almost entirely along the rostrocaudal axis. Even in cases where the injection site involved the superficial (not deep) layers of PreS, labeled neurons and terminals were distributed over a wide rostrocaudal range of the Cl–En complex, but their number and density were significantly lower than the whole-layer injection cases. In cases where the injection site was confined to the hippocampal formation, labeled cells and terminals were localized at a restricted portion of the Cl–En complex. Here, we demonstrate for what we believe to be the first time the strong, reciprocal connections of the Cl–En complex with PreS and projections from the Cl–En complex to the hippocampal regions (CA1 and the subiculum) in the marmoset. Our findings indicate that the Cl–En complex may exert a strong influence on the cortical and subcortical outputs from PreS and, in turn, the entire memory circuitry in the marmoset brain.</p>

     alt="Scaled Complexity of Mammalian Astrocytes: Insights From Mouse and Macaque"/>
<p>We used a multi-technique approach (including immunohistochemistry, AAV-mediated transduction of astrocytes, diOlistics, confocal imaging, and electron microscopy) to label astrocytes in mice and rhesus macaques and conducted a comprehensive morphological analysis. 

</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Astrocytes intricately weave within the neuropil, giving rise to characteristic bushy morphologies. Pioneering studies suggested that primate astrocytes are more complex due to increased branch numbers and territory size compared to rodent counterparts. However, there has been no comprehensive comparison of astrocyte morphology across species. We employed several techniques to investigate astrocyte morphology and directly compared them between mice and rhesus macaques in cortical and subcortical regions. We assessed astrocyte density, territory size, branching structure, fine morphological complexity, and interactions with neuronal synapses using a combination of techniques, including immunohistochemistry, adeno-associated virus–mediated transduction of astrocytes, diOlistics, confocal imaging, and electron microscopy. We found significant morphological similarities between primate and rodent astrocytes, suggesting that astrocyte structure has scaled with evolution. Our findings show that primate astrocytes are larger and more numerous than those in rodents but contest the view that primate astrocytes are morphologically far more complex.</p>
