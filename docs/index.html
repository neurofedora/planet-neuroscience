	<p>Background: Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is related to mental and somatic disorders that result in alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS), with 30% of AWS cases leading to life-threatening delirium tremens (DTs). Currently, studies do not support using any one biomarker in DTs. Neurotrophins affect neuromodulation, playing a role in the pathogenesis of AUD, AWS, and DTs. Methods: This review aims to summarize experimental and clinical data related to neurotrophins and S100B in neuroplasticity, as well as neurodegeneration in the context of AUD, AWS, and DTs. This work used publications that were selected based on the protocol consistent with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) statement. Results: The BDNF level could be a good candidate biomarker for relapse susceptibility, as it is significantly reduced during consumption and gradually increases during abstinence. GDNF influences AUD through its integral role in the function of dopaminergic neurons and ablates the return to alcohol-drinking behavior. NGF protects neurons from ethanol-induced cytotoxic damage and affects recovery from cognitive deficits after brain damage. The NT-3 level is decreased after alcohol exposure and is involved in compensatory mechanisms for cognitive decline in AUD. NT-4 affects oxidative stress, which is associated with chronic alcohol consumption. S100B is used as a biomarker of brain damage, with elevated levels in serum in AUD, and can protect 5-HT neurons from the damage caused by alcohol. Conclusions: BDNF, GDNF, NT-3, NT-4, NGF, and S100B may be valuable markers for withdrawal syndrome. In particular, the most relevant is their association with the development of delirium complications. However, there are few data concerning some neurotrophins in AWS and DTs, suggesting the need for further research.</p>

                <p>Drugs of abuse cause changes in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and associated regions that impair inhibitory control over drug-seeking. Breaking the contingencies between drug-associated cues and the delivery of the reward during extinction learning reduces relapse. Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) has previously been shown to enhance extinction learning and reduce drug-seeking. Here we determined the effects of VNS-mediated release of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) on extinction and cue-induced reinstatement in male rats trained to self-administer cocaine. Pairing 10&nbsp;d of extinction training with VNS facilitated extinction and reduced drug-seeking behavior during reinstatement. Rats that received a single extinction session with VNS showed elevated BDNF levels in the medial PFC as determined via an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Systemic blockade of tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) receptors during extinction, via the TrkB antagonist ANA-12, decreased the effects of VNS on extinction and reinstatement. Whole-cell recordings in brain slices showed that cocaine self-administration induced alterations in the ratio of AMPA and NMDA receptor-mediated currents in Layer 5 pyramidal neurons of the infralimbic cortex (IL). Pairing extinction with VNS reversed cocaine-induced changes in glutamatergic transmission by enhancing AMPAR currents, and this effect was blocked by ANA-12. Our study suggests that VNS consolidates the extinction of drug-seeking behavior by reversing drug-induced changes in synaptic AMPA receptors in the IL, and this effect is abolished by blocking TrkB receptors during extinction, highlighting a potential mechanism for the therapeutic effects of VNS in addiction.</p>

                <p>Interneurons in the medial prefrontal cortex (PFC) regulate local neural activity to influence cognitive, motivated, and emotional behaviors. Parvalbumin-expressing (PV+) interneurons are the primary mediators of thalamus-evoked feed-forward inhibition across the mouse cortex, including the anterior cingulate cortex, where they are engaged by inputs from the mediodorsal (MD) thalamus. In contrast, in the adjacent prelimbic (PL) cortex, we find that PV+ interneurons are scarce in the principal thalamorecipient layer 3 (L3), suggesting distinct mechanisms of inhibition. To identify the interneurons that mediate MD-evoked inhibition in PL, we combine slice physiology, optogenetics, and intersectional genetic tools in mice of both sexes. We find interneurons expressing cholecystokinin (CCK+) are abundant in L3 of PL, with cells exhibiting fast-spiking (fs) or non&ndash;fast-spiking (nfs) properties. MD inputs make stronger connections onto fs-CCK+ interneurons, driving them to fire more readily than nearby L3 pyramidal cells and other interneurons. CCK+ interneurons in turn make inhibitory, perisomatic connections onto L3 pyramidal cells, where they exhibit cannabinoid 1 receptor (CB1R) mediated modulation. Moreover, MD-evoked feed-forward inhibition, but not direct excitation, is also sensitive to CB1R modulation. Our findings indicate that CCK+ interneurons contribute to MD-evoked inhibition in PL, revealing a mechanism by which cannabinoids can modulate MD-PFC communication.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/23/e1095232024?rss=1">An Aggressive Interaction Rapidly Increases Brain Androgens in a Male Songbird during the Non-breeding Season</a></h4>

              
                <p>Aggression is a crucial behavior that impacts access to limited resources in different environmental contexts. Androgens synthesized by the gonads promote aggression during the breeding season. However, aggression can be expressed during the non-breeding season, despite low androgen synthesis by the gonads. The brain can also synthesize steroids ("neurosteroids"), including androgens, which might promote aggression during the non-breeding season. Male song sparrows, <I>Melospiza melodia</I>, are territorial year-round and allow the study of seasonal changes in the steroid modulation of aggression. Here, we quantified steroids following a simulated territorial intrusion (STI) for 10&nbsp;min in wild adult male song sparrows during the breeding and non-breeding seasons. Using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), we examined 11 steroids: pregnenolone, progesterone, corticosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone, androstenedione, testosterone, 5&alpha;-dihydrotestosterone, 17&beta;-estradiol, 17&alpha;-estradiol, estriol, and estrone. Steroids were measured in blood and 10 microdissected brain regions that regulate social behavior. In both seasons, STI increased corticosterone in the blood and brain. In the breeding season, STI had no rapid effects on androgens or estrogens. Intriguingly, in the non-breeding season, STI increased testosterone and androstenedione in several behaviorally relevant regions, but not in the blood, where androgens remained non-detectable. Also in the non-breeding season, STI increased progesterone in the blood and specific brain regions. Overall, rapid socially modulated changes in brain steroid levels are more prominent during the non-breeding season. Brain steroid levels vary with season and social context in a region-specific manner and suggest a role for neuroandrogens in aggression during the non-breeding season.</p>

                <p>Humans need social closeness to prosper. There is evidence that empathy can induce social closeness. However, it remains unclear how empathy-related social closeness is formed and how stable it is as time passes. We applied an acquisition&ndash;extinction paradigm combined with computational modeling and fMRI, to investigate the formation and stability of empathy-related social closeness. Female participants observed painful stimulation of another person with high probability (acquisition) and low probability (extinction) and rated their closeness to that person. The results of two independent studies showed increased social closeness in the acquisition block that resisted extinction in the extinction block. Providing insights into underlying mechanisms, reinforcement learning modeling revealed that the formation of social closeness is based on a learning signal (prediction error) generated from observing another&rsquo;s pain, whereas maintaining social closeness is based on a learning signal generated from observing another&rsquo;s pain relief. The results of a reciprocity control study indicate that this feedback recalibration is specific to learning of empathy-related social closeness. On the neural level, the recalibration of the feedback signal was associated with neural responses in anterior insula and adjacent inferior frontal gyrus and the bilateral superior temporal sulcus/temporoparietal junction. Together, these findings show that empathy-related social closeness generated in bad times, that is, empathy with the misfortune of another person, transfers to good times and thus may form one important basis for stable social relationships.</p>

                <p>The behavioral and neural effects of the endogenous release of acetylcholine following stimulation of the nucleus basalis (NB) of Meynert have been recently examined in two male monkeys (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B53">Qi et al., 2021</cross-ref>). Counterintuitively, NB stimulation enhanced behavioral performance while broadening neural tuning in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). The mechanism by which a weaker mnemonic neural code could lead to better performance remains unclear. Here, we show that increased neural excitability in a simple continuous bump attractor model can induce broader neural tuning and decrease bump diffusion, provided neural rates are saturated. Increased memory precision in the model overrides memory accuracy, improving overall task performance. Moreover, we show that bump attractor dynamics can account for the nonuniform impact of neuromodulation on distractibility, depending on distractor distance from the target. Finally, we delve into the conditions under which bump attractor tuning and diffusion balance in biologically plausible heterogeneous network models. In these discrete bump attractor networks, we show that reducing spatial correlations or enhancing excitatory transmission can improve memory precision. Altogether, we provide a mechanistic understanding of how cholinergic neuromodulation controls spatial working memory through perturbed attractor dynamics in the PFC.</p>

                <p>Cocaine use disorder is a significant public health issue without an effective pharmacological treatment. Successful treatments are hindered in part by an incomplete understanding of the molecular mechanisms that underlie long-lasting maladaptive plasticity and addiction-like behaviors. Here, we leverage a large RNA sequencing dataset to generate gene coexpression networks across six interconnected regions of the brain's reward circuitry from mice that underwent saline or cocaine self-administration. We identify phosphodiesterase 1b (<I>Pde1b</I>), a Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent enzyme that increases cAMP and cGMP hydrolysis, as a central hub gene within a nucleus accumbens (NAc) gene module that was bioinformatically associated with addiction-like behavior. Chronic cocaine exposure increases <I>Pde1b</I> expression in NAc D2 medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in male but not female mice. Viral-mediated <I>Pde1b</I> overexpression in NAc reduces cocaine self-administration in female rats but increases seeking in both sexes. In female mice, overexpressing <I>Pde1b</I> in D1 MSNs attenuates the locomotor response to cocaine, with the opposite effect in D2 MSNs. Overexpressing <I>Pde1b</I> in D1/D2 MSNs had no effect on the locomotor response to cocaine in male mice. At the electrophysiological level, <I>Pde1b</I> overexpression reduces sEPSC frequency in D1 MSNs and regulates the excitability of NAc MSNs. Lastly, <I>Pde1b</I> overexpression significantly reduced the number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in NAc following chronic cocaine, with discordant effects on gene transcription between sexes. Together, we identify novel gene modules across the brain's reward circuitry associated with addiction-like behavior and explore the role of <I>Pde1b</I> in regulating the molecular, cellular, and behavioral responses to cocaine.</p>

                <p>According to the predictive processing framework, perception emerges from the reciprocal exchange of predictions and prediction errors (PEs) between hierarchically organized neural circuits. The nonlemniscal division of the inferior colliculus (IC) is the earliest source of auditory PE signals, but their neuronal generators, properties, and functional relevance have remained mostly undefined. We recorded single-unit mismatch responses to auditory oddball stimulation at different intensities, together with activity evoked by two sequences of alternating tones to control frequency-specific effects. Our results reveal a differential treatment of the unpredictable "many-standards" control and the predictable "cascade" control by lemniscal and nonlemniscal IC neurons that is not present in the auditory thalamus or cortex. Furthermore, we found that frequency response areas of nonlemniscal IC neurons reflect their role in subcortical predictive processing, distinguishing three hierarchical levels: (1) nonlemniscal neurons with sharply tuned receptive fields exhibit mild repetition suppression without signaling PEs, thereby constituting the input level of the local predictive processing circuitry. (2) Neurons with broadly tuned receptive fields form the main, "spectral" PE signaling system, which provides dynamic gain compensation to near-threshold unexpected sounds. This early enhancement of saliency reliant on spectral features was not observed in the auditory thalamus or cortex. (3) Untuned neurons form an accessory, "nonspectral" PE signaling system, which reports all surprising auditory deviances in a robust and consistent manner, resembling nonlemniscal neurons in the auditory cortex. These nonlemniscal IC neurons show unstructured and unstable receptive fields that could result from inhibitory input controlled by corticofugal projections conveying top-down predictions.</p>

                <p>Behaviors and their execution depend on the context and emotional state in which they are performed. The contextual modulation of behavior likely relies on regions such as the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) that multiplex information about emotional/autonomic states and behaviors. The objective of the present study was to understand how the representations of behaviors by ACC neurons become modified when performed in different emotional states. A pipeline of machine learning techniques was developed to categorize and classify complex, spontaneous behaviors in male rats from the video. This pipeline, termed Hierarchical Unsupervised Behavioural Discovery Tool (HUB-DT), discovered a range of statistically separable behaviors during a task in which motivationally significant outcomes were delivered in blocks of trials that created three unique "emotional contexts." HUB-DT was capable of detecting behaviors specific to each emotional context and was able to identify and segregate the portions of a neural signal related to a behavior and to emotional context. Overall, ~10<FONT FACE="arial,helvetica">x</FONT> as many neurons responded to behaviors in a contextually dependent versus a fixed manner, highlighting the extreme impact of emotional state on representations of behaviors that were precisely defined based on detailed analyses of limb kinematics. This type of modulation may be a key mechanism that allows the ACC to modify the behavioral output based on emotional states and contextual demands.</p>

                <p>The hippocampus is a brain structure that plays key roles in a variety of cognitive processes. Critically, a wide range of neurological disorders are associated with degeneration of the hippocampal microstructure, defined as neurons, dendrites, glial cells, and more. Thus, the hippocampus is a key target for methods that are sensitive to these microscale properties. Diffusion MRI is one such method, which can noninvasively probe neural architecture. Here we review the extensive use of diffusion MRI to capture hippocampal microstructure in both health and disease. The results of these studies indicate that (1) diffusion tensor imaging is sensitive but not specific to the hippocampal microstructure; (2) biophysical modeling of diffusion MRI signals is a promising avenue to capture more specific aspects of the hippocampal microstructure; (3) use of ultra-short diffusion times have shown unique laminar-specific microstructure and response to hippocampal injury; (4) dispersion of microstructure is likely abundant in the hippocampus; and (5) the angular richness of the diffusion MRI signal can be leveraged to improve delineation of the internal hippocampal circuitry. Overall, extant findings suggest that diffusion MRI offers a promising avenue for characterizing hippocampal microstructure.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/23/e1751232024?rss=1">Revisiting the Potency of Tbx2 Expression in Transforming Outer Hair Cells into Inner Hair Cells at Multiple Ages In Vivo</a></h4>

              
                <p>The mouse auditory organ cochlea contains two types of sound receptors: inner hair cells (IHCs) and outer hair cells (OHCs). Tbx2 is expressed in IHCs but repressed in OHCs, and neonatal OHCs that misexpress Tbx2 transdifferentiate into IHC-like cells. However, the extent of this switch from OHCs to IHC-like cells and the underlying molecular mechanism remain poorly understood. Furthermore, whether Tbx2 can transform fully mature adult OHCs into IHC-like cells is unknown. Here, our single-cell transcriptomic analysis revealed that in neonatal OHCs misexpressing Tbx2, 85.6% of IHC genes, including <I>Slc17a8</I>, are upregulated, but only 38.6% of OHC genes, including <I>Ikzf2</I> and <I>Slc26a5</I>, are downregulated. This suggests that Tbx2 cannot fully reprogram neonatal OHCs into IHCs. Moreover, Tbx2 also failed to completely reprogram cochlear progenitors into IHCs. Lastly, restoring Ikzf2 expression alleviated the abnormalities detected in Tbx2+ OHCs, which supports the notion that Ikzf2 repression by Tbx2 contributes to the transdifferentiation of OHCs into IHC-like cells. Our study evaluates the effects of ectopic Tbx2 expression on OHC lineage development at distinct stages of either male or female mice and provides molecular insights into how Tbx2 disrupts the gene expression profile of OHCs. This research also lays the groundwork for future studies on OHC regeneration.</p>

                <p>Latrophilin-1 (Lphn1, aka CIRL1 and CL1; gene symbol <I>Adgrl1</I>) is an adhesion GPCR that has been implicated in excitatory synaptic transmission as a candidate receptor for &alpha;-latrotoxin. Here we analyzed conditional knock-in/knock-out mice for Lphn1 that contain an extracellular myc epitope tag. Mice of both sexes were used in all experiments. Surprisingly, we found that Lphn1 is localized in cultured neurons to synaptic nanoclusters that are present in both excitatory and inhibitory synapses. Conditional deletion of Lphn1 in cultured neurons failed to elicit a detectable impairment in excitatory synapses but produced a decrease in inhibitory synapse numbers and synaptic transmission that was most pronounced for synapses close to the neuronal soma. No changes in axonal or dendritic outgrowth or branching were observed. Our data indicate that Lphn1 is among the few postsynaptic adhesion molecules that are present in both excitatory and inhibitory synapses and that Lphn1 by itself is not essential for excitatory synaptic transmission but is required for some inhibitory synaptic connections.</p>

                <p>Physical exercise is a robust lifestyle intervention known for its enhancement of cognitive abilities. Nevertheless, the extent to which these benefits can be transmitted across generations (intergenerational inheritance to F1, and transgenerational to F2 and beyond) remains a topic of limited comprehension. We have already shown that cognitive improvements resulting from physical exercise can be inherited from parents to their offspring, proving intergenerational effects. So, we set out to explore whether these enhancements might extend transgenerationally, impacting the F2 generation. In this study, we initially examined the behavioral traits of second generation (F2) male mice, whose grandfathers (F0) had an exercise intervention. Our findings revealed that F2 mice with physically active grandpaternal F0 progenitors displayed significantly improved memory recall, encompassing both spatial and non-spatial information when compared to their counterparts from sedentary F0 progenitors, and proving for the first time the transgenerational inheritance of physical exercise induced cognitive enhancement. Surprisingly, while F2 memory improved (as was the case with F1), adult hippocampal neurogenesis remained unchanged between experimental and control groups (unlike in F1). Additionally, our analysis of small RNA sequences in the hippocampus identified 35 differentially expressed miRNAs linked to important brain function categories. Notably, two of these miRNAs, miRNA-144 and miRNA-298, displayed a robust negative correlation with cognitive performance. These findings highlight the enduring transgenerational transmission of cognitive benefits associated with exercise, even after two generations, suggesting that moderate exercise training can have lasting positive effects, possibly orchestrated by a specific set of miRNAs that exert their influence across multiple generations.</p>

                <p>A decade ago, in 2013, and over the course of 4 summer months, three separate observations were reported that each shed light independently on a new molecular organization that fundamentally reshaped our perception of excitatory synaptic transmission (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B35">Fukata et al., 2013</cross-ref>; <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B81">MacGillavry et al., 2013</cross-ref>; <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B90">Nair et al., 2013</cross-ref>). This discovery unveiled an intricate arrangement of AMPA-type glutamate receptors and their principal scaffolding protein PSD-95, at synapses. This breakthrough was made possible, thanks to advanced super-resolution imaging techniques. It fundamentally changed our understanding of excitatory synaptic architecture and paved the way for a brand-new area of research. In this Progressions article, the primary investigators of the nanoscale organization of synapses have come together to chronicle the tale of their discovery. We recount the initial inquiry that prompted our research, the preceding studies that inspired our work, the technical obstacles that were encountered, and the breakthroughs that were made in the subsequent decade in the realm of nanoscale synaptic transmission. We review the new discoveries made possible by the democratization of super-resolution imaging techniques in the field of excitatory synaptic physiology and architecture, first by the extension to other glutamate receptors and to presynaptic proteins and then by the notion of trans-synaptic organization. After describing the organizational modifications occurring in various pathologies, we discuss briefly the latest technical developments made possible by super-resolution imaging and emerging concepts in synaptic physiology.</p>

                <p>Foraging decisions involve assessing potential risks and prioritizing food sources, which can be challenging when confronted with changing and conflicting circumstances. A crucial aspect of this decision-making process is the ability to actively overcome defensive reactions to threats and focus on achieving specific goals. The ventral pallidum (VP) and basolateral amygdala (BLA) are two brain regions that play key roles in regulating behavior motivated by either rewards or threats. However, it is unclear whether these regions are necessary in decision-making processes involving competing motivational drives during conflict. Our aim was to investigate the requirements of the VP and BLA for foraging choices in conflicts involving overcoming defensive responses. Here, we used a novel foraging task and pharmacological techniques to inactivate either the VP or BLA or to disconnect these brain regions before conducting a conflict test in male rats. Our findings showed that BLA is necessary for making risky choices during conflicts, whereas VP is necessary for invigorating the drive to obtain food, regardless of the presence of conflict. Importantly, our research revealed that the connection between VP and BLA is critical in controlling risky food-seeking choices during conflict situations. This study provides a new perspective on the collaborative function of VP and BLA in driving behavior, aimed at achieving goals in the face of dangers.</p>

                <p>High-throughput gene expression profiling measures individual gene expression across conditions. However, genes are regulated in complex networks, not as individual entities, limiting the interpretability of gene expression data. Machine learning models that incorporate prior biological knowledge are a powerful tool to extract meaningful biology from gene expression data. Pathway-level information extractor (PLIER) is an unsupervised machine learning method that defines biological pathways by leveraging the vast amount of published transcriptomic data. PLIER converts gene expression data into known pathway gene sets, termed latent variables (LVs), to substantially reduce data dimensionality and improve interpretability. In the current study, we trained the first mouse PLIER model on 190,111 mouse brain RNA-sequencing samples, the greatest amount of training data ever used by PLIER. We then validated the mousiPLIER approach in a study of microglia and astrocyte gene expression across mouse brain aging. mousiPLIER identified biological pathways that are significantly associated with aging, including one latent variable (LV41) corresponding to striatal signal. To gain further insight into the genes contained in LV41, we performed <I>k</I>-means clustering on the training data to identify studies that respond strongly to LV41. We found that the variable was relevant to striatum and aging across the scientific literature. Finally, we built a Web server (<A HREF="http://mousiplier.greenelab.com/">http://mousiplier.greenelab.com/</A>) for users to easily explore the learned latent variables. Taken together, this study defines mousiPLIER as a method to uncover meaningful biological processes in mouse brain transcriptomic studies.</p>

                <p>Social behavior is important for our well-being, and its dysfunctions impact several pathological conditions. Although the involvement of glutamate is undeniable, the relevance of vesicular glutamate transporter type 3 (VGluT3), a specific vesicular transporter, in the control of social behavior is not sufficiently explored. Since midbrain median raphe region (MRR) is implicated in social behavior and the nucleus contains high amount of VGluT3+ neurons, we compared the behavior of male VGluT3 knock-out (KO) and VGluT3-Cre mice, the latter after chemogenetic MRR-VGluT3 manipulation. Appropriate control groups were included. Behavioral test battery was used for social behavior (sociability, social discrimination, social interaction, resident intruder test) and possible confounding factors (open field, elevated plus maze, Y-maze tests). Neuronal activation was studied by c-Fos immunohistochemistry. Human relevance was confirmed by VGluT3 gene expression in relevant human brainstem areas. VGluT3 KO mice exhibited increased anxiety, social interest, but also aggressive behavior in anxiogenic environment and impaired social memory. For KO animals, social interaction induced lower cell activation in the anterior cingulate, infralimbic cortex, and medial septum. In turn, excitation of MRR-VGluT3+ neurons was anxiolytic. Inhibition increased social interest 24&nbsp;h later but decreased mobility and social behavior in aggressive context. Chemogenetic activation increased the number of c-Fos+ neurons only in the MRR. We confirmed the increased anxiety-like behavior and impaired memory of VGluT3 KO strain and revealed increased, but inadequate, social behavior. MRR-VGluT3 neurons regulated mobility and social and anxiety-like behavior in a context-dependent manner. The presence of VGluT3 mRNA on corresponding human brain areas suggests clinical relevance.</p>

                Background Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a condition that affects 5–12% of the general population. Endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) is the preferred treatment because of its few adverse effects and highest success rates. The most common post-operative consequences include synechia, nasal blockage, and disease recurrence. Spray cryotherapy is a novel therapeutic approach with promising outcomes for the treatment of upper airway disorders. This review aimed to investigate the effects of spray cryotherapy (SCT) following ESS in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis. Methods Six electronic databases were searched for randomized clinical trials (RCTs). The selected trials were evaluated for methodological quality, and data were extracted by two independent reviewers. The Cochrane risk-of-bias tool was used to assess the quality of evidence. Results Three RCTs with 85 patients were included in the final analysis. SCT was related to -16 and -77 reductions in Lund-McKay and SNOT-22 scores after 36 weeks of follow-up, in contrast to a placebo, which showed -10.4, -65. Regarding the side effects of SCT, no adverse effects were reported, and visual assessments showed no pain, visual field loss, or any other ocular complications. Conclusions SCT is a new treatment modality after endoscopic sinus surgery that shows an effective post-operative management strategy with better post-operative scales (Lund-McKay, SNOT-22, POSE, and Lund-Kennedy) and less edema, obstruction, crusting, and inflammation with minimal or no side effects. However, further research with longer follow-ups, a larger sample size, and subjective assessment is needed to assess any possible long-term side effects.

                Background Car painting workers are at risk because of the use of solvents containing benzene as the main ingredient in the car painting process. One of the clinical effects of systemic benzene is kidney disorders. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to analyze the relationship between benzene and Risk Quotient (RQ) benzene concentrations with Malondialdehyde (MDA), Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN), and creatinine levels in workers exposed to benzene in car painting workshops in Surabaya. Methods This study used an observational design with a cross-sectional method conducted at two car paint workshops in Surabaya. The study population was all workers exposed to benzene in the two car paint workshops, aged between 20-65 years in 2019. The sample was taken using an accidental sampling method, involving 30 respondents. Inclusion criteria included workers exposed to benzene and willing to participate, while exclusion criteria included workers with a liver or kidney disease history. The variables studied included benzene concentration, benzene RQ (benzene metabolite), malondialdehyde (MDA) levels as a marker of oxidative stress, and indicators of kidney function (BUN and creatinine levels). Data were analyzed using descriptive and bivariate analysis with Pearson correlation test. Results There was no significant relationship between concentrations, RQ benzene, and MDA levels in workers in painting in Surabaya (p> 0.05). There was no significant relationship between benzene concentration, BUN levels, and creatinine levels in paint workers in Surabaya (p> 0.05). There was no significant relationship between benzene RQ and BUN and creatinine levels in paint workers in Surabaya (p> 0.05). Conclusions This study's results indicate that benzene's effects do not lead to impaired kidney function. The benzene RQ variable in this study did not become a determining factor in BUN and creatinine levels in workers.

                Improvements in DNA sequencing technology are allowing the dramatic increase of whole genome data for a wide variety of species. Such genome sequence data can assist the monitoring of intraspecific genetic diversity, but is often lacking for threatened species. In this project, we focused on the national Red List, a catalog of extinct and threatened species, issued by the Japanese government. We combined the data included in it with the record of genome assembly in NCBI and tabulated the assembly availability of the species in the list. The combined data shows a low percentage (2.1%) of the availability of whole genome sequence data for the taxa ranked on the Japanese Red List as well as a strong bias towards mammals and birds in Animalia and vascular plants in Plantae. Our data presentation highlights potential systematic limitations in genome sequencing (e.g., budget for sequencing large genomes of amphibians) and instructs future policies including which taxon needs more effort for genome sequencing. The resultant tables are available in the original website https://treethinkers.nig.ac.jp/redlist/ and are regularly updated.

                Background Pelvic masses in females often present a diagnostic challenge, necessitating accurate detection and characterization for appropriate clinical management. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) has emerged as a valuable tool in pelvic mass evaluation, offering superior soft tissue contrast and multiplanar imaging capabilities. This prospective observational study aims to assess the diagnostic accuracy of pelvic MRI, determine anatomic origin, classify masses, estimate local spread, and evaluate the impact of gadolinium contrast in a tertiary care hospital in Central India. Methods The study will be conducted over a two-year period, enrolling female patients with lower back pain and clinical suspicion or inconclusive ultrasonographic findings of pelvic masses. A systematic approach to participant identification, recruitment, and engagement will be employed, with both verbal and written informed consent obtained. The imaging protocol will involve T1 and T2 weighted images, and gadolinium contrast administration when necessary. Data collection will encompass demographic information, medical history, clinical details, and MRI findings. Statistical analyses, including sensitivity, specificity, prevalence estimates, and regression analyses, will be performed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of pelvic MRI. Expected outcome We anticipate that pelvic MRI will exhibit high diagnostic accuracy in detecting and characterizing pelvic masses, providing valuable information on anatomic origin and pelvic compartment localization. The study aims to contribute evidence on the impact of gadolinium contrast in enhancing diagnostic capabilities. The findings are expected to optimize clinical decision-making for effective management of females with pelvic masses, leading to timely interventions and improved patient outcomes.

                Background Malaria in pregnancy leads to placental malaria. The primary pathogenesis of the complex fetal implications in placental malaria is tissue hypoxia due to sequestrations of Plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes in the placenta. However, the pathomechanism of placental Plasmodium vivax infection has not been thoroughly investigated. Hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) is a key transcriptional mediator of the response to hypoxic conditions, which interacts with the change and imbalances of many chemical mediators, including angiogenic factors, leading to fetal growth abnormality. Methods This study was conducted cross-sectionally in Maumere, Sikka Regency, East Nusa Tenggara Province, previously known as one of the malaria endemic areas with a high incidence of low birth weight (LBW) cases. This study collected peripheral and umbilical blood samples and placental tissues from mothers who delivered their babies with LBW at the TC Hiller Regional Hospital. All of the blood samples were examined for parasites by microscopic and PCR techniques, while the plasma levels of VEGF, PlGF, VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2, and HIF-1α were determined using ELISA. The sequestration of infected erythrocytes and hemozoin was determined from placental histological slides, and the expression of placenta angiogenic factors was observed using the immunofluorescent technique. Results In this study, 33 cases had complete data to be analyzed. Of them, 19 samples were diagnosed as vivax malaria and none of falciparum malaria. There were significant differences in Δ 10th percentile growth curve of baby's body weights and also all angiogenic factors in placental tissues {VEGF, PlGF, and VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2, and HIF-1α} between those infected and not infected cases (p<0.05), but not for VEGF and VEGFR-2 in the plasma. Conclusion This study indicated that Plasmodium vivax sequestration may promote LBW through alterations and imbalances in angiogenic factors led by HIF-1α.

                Background Geopolymers are alternative materials to cement because they require less energy in their production process; hence, they contribute to the reduction in CO2 emissions. This study aims to evaluate the possibility of using industrial residues such as silica fume (SF) to improve the physical and mechanical properties of a pumice stone (PS)-based geopolymer. Methods Through an experimental methodology, the process starts with the extraction, grinding, and sieving of the raw material to carry out the physical and chemical characterization of the resulting material, followed by the dosage of the geopolymer mixture considering the factors that influence the resistance mechanical strength. Finally, the physical and mechanical properties of the geopolymer were characterized. This research was carried out in four stages: characterization of the pumice stone, design of the geopolymer through laboratory tests, application according to the dosage of the concrete, and analysis of the data through a multi-criteria analysis. Results It was determined that the optimal percentage of SF replacement is 10%, which to improves the properties of the geopolymer allowing to reach a maximum resistance to compression and flexion of 14.10 MPa and 4.78 MPa respectively, showing that there is a direct relationship between the percentage of SF and the resistance. Conclusions Geopolymer preparation involves the use of PS powder with a composition rich in silicon and aluminum. The factors influencing strength include the ratio of sodium silicate to sodium hydroxide, water content, temperature, curing time, molarity of sodium hydroxide, and binder ratio. The results showed an increase in the compression and flexural strength with 10% SF replacement. The geopolymer’s maximum compressive strength indicates its non-structural use, but it can be improved by reducing the PS powder size.

                Village tanks, prevalent since ancient times, were an integrated part of the irrigation system in Sri Lanka (‘Ceylon’ till 1972). It was under these village tanks that paddy cultivation took place, and they were a part of the socially, technologically, and ecologically cohesive way of village life. The colonial authorities, who tried to renovate that ancient system, perceived village tanks as technically inefficient due to excessive evaporation and uneconomical land use. However, for several reasons, that perception could not be materialized during their renovation works. During the post-colonial period, with the implementation of the land colonization schemes in the 1930’s and the multipurpose river valley development schemes in the 1960’s, the scenario took a different shape. The technically perceived inferiority of the village tanks was brought into the new water management policies and the engineering designs. As a result, many of the village tanks were demolished, and those lands were converted to the farmlands. Instead of water availabilities assured through village tanks, canal irrigation became prominent. The socio-technical bondage between the village tanks and the village communities was not considered, presenting a classic case study for the consequences of neglecting social component of the technology. This paper discusses the social, political, and technical implications of these moves and their influence on shaping the present irrigation setup in the island.

                Background SARS-CoV-2 first appeared in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. Looking at the prevalence data in the world and in Indonesia, the highest mortality rate due to COVID-19 involves age, gender and comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus. Severity of the condition also refers to coagulation abnormalities, such as abnormal prothrombin time values. Methods This systematic review study and meta-analysis used online literature sourced from PubMed, Science Direct, EBSCO, Cochrane and Google Scholar. The literature used here is literature that has data on age, sex and prothrombin time of COVID-19 patients with diabetes mellitus whose quality is assessed by the NOS (Newcastle-Ottawa Scale) criteria and processing data using Review Manager 5.4. Results Out of 8711 literatures that were traced from various search sources, there were 46 literatures that were included in this study. The results of the analysis on age showed the Standardized Mean Difference (SMD) value of 0.45 and P <0.0001 (95% CI: 0.23–0.68), the gender analysis showed an Odds Ratio (OR) value of 3.28 and P = 0.01 (95% CI: 1.26–8.52) and the prothrombin time analysis showed SMD values of 0.41 and P = 0.07 (95%CI = -0.03–0.85). Conclusion Older and male COVID-19 patients have a higher risk of having diabetes compared to younger and female COVID-19 patients. As diabetes is a comorbidity in COVID-19, it can be concluded that old age and male sex are associated with a more severe disease.

                <p>by Xiaoman Xie, Saurabh Sinha</p>

Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have received attention in recent years for their regulatory roles in diverse biological contexts including cancer, yet large gaps remain in our understanding of their mechanisms and global maps of their targets. In this work, we investigated a basic unanswered question of lncRNA systems biology: to what extent can gene expression variation across individuals be attributed to lncRNA-driven regulation? To answer this, we analyzed RNA-seq data from a cohort of breast cancer patients, explaining each gene’s expression variation using a small set of automatically selected lncRNA regulators. A key aspect of this analysis is that it accounts for confounding effects of transcription factors (TFs) as common regulators of a lncRNA-mRNA pair, to enrich the explained gene expression for lncRNA-mediated regulation. We found that for 16% of analyzed genes, lncRNAs can explain more than 20% of expression variation. We observed 25–50% of the putative regulator lncRNAs to be in ‘cis’ to, i.e., overlapping or located proximally to the target gene. This led us to quantify the global regulatory impact of such cis-located lncRNAs, which was found to be substantially greater than that of trans-located lncRNAs. Additionally, by including statistical interaction terms involving lncRNA-protein pairs as predictors in our regression models, we identified cases where a lncRNA’s regulatory effect depends on the presence of a TF or RNA-binding protein. Finally, we created a high-confidence lncRNA-gene regulatory network whose edges are supported by co-expression as well as a plausible mechanism such as cis-action, protein scaffolding or competing endogenous RNAs. Our work is a first attempt to quantify the extent of gene expression control exerted globally by lncRNAs, especially those located proximally to their regulatory targets, in a specific biological (breast cancer) context. It also marks a first step towards systematic reconstruction of lncRNA regulatory networks, going beyond the current paradigm of co-expression networks, going beyond the current paradigm of co-expression networks, and motivates future analyses assessing the generalizability of our findings to additional biological contexts.

                <p>by Lu Zhang, Gang Xue, Xiaolin Zhou, Jiandong Huang, Zhiyuan Li</p>

In embryonic development and organogenesis, cells sharing identical genetic codes acquire diverse gene expression states in a highly reproducible spatial distribution, crucial for multicellular formation and quantifiable through positional information. To understand the spontaneous growth of complexity, we constructed a one-dimensional division-decision model, simulating the growth of cells with identical genetic networks from a single cell. Our findings highlight the pivotal role of cell division in providing positional cues, escorting the system toward states rich in information. Moreover, we pinpointed lateral inhibition as a critical mechanism translating spatial contacts into gene expression. Our model demonstrates that the spatial arrangement resulting from cell division, combined with cell lineages, imparts positional information, specifying multiple cell states with increased complexity—illustrated through examples in <i>C.elegans</i>. This study constitutes a foundational step in comprehending developmental intricacies, paving the way for future quantitative formulations to construct synthetic multicellular patterns.

                Background The purpose of the study was to compare the effectiveness of yoga as a form of Vestibular Rehabilitation (VR) to standard VR for managing patients with symptoms such as dizziness, disequilibrium and gait instability. Methods 150 participants based on 18-point difference in the DHI score were randomly assigned to group 1- Yoga, group 2- VR and group 3- control group using block randomization. The intervention was provided for 12 weeks. The participants were assessed for Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI) at baseline, 4th, 8th and 12th week. Results The mean DHI for group 1(41.12±7.13) group 2 (42.96±10.54) group 3 (50.84±10.78), p<0.001 decreased significantly in group 1 and 2 when compared to baseline. There was no statistically significant difference in overall Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI) scores between the Yoga and Physiotherapy groups after one month; however, both groups resulted in a significant decrease in scores when compared to the control group. Similarly, by the end of the second and third months, there was no significant distinction between the Yoga and Physiotherapy groups, even though both had a considerable decrease in DHI scores when compared to the control group. Furthermore, an examination of the functional, emotional, and physical components of DHI demonstrated persistent trends of significant improvement in both the Yoga and Physiotherapy groups as compared to the control group over a three-month period. Conclusions In addition to VR, Yoga and medications administered concurrently can provide effective therapeutic effects. Yoga has an advantage over VR since it offers a customized cure for giddiness in addition to symptom relief. Yoga might be a great alternative to the conventional VR because along with enhancing overall body relaxation, it is affordable and is easy to learn.

                Background Cardiac rehabilitation is a multifaceted program implemented after adverse events. It aims at facilitating the return to normal life. This review aimed to examine the impact of cardiac rehabilitation on psychosocial risk factors, functional capacity, and left ventricular function. Methods The following databases: CINAHL, Scopus, PubMed, and Cochrane Library have been searched to retrieve the randomized controlled trials that investigate the effectiveness of cardiac rehabilitation versus usual care on anxiety, depression, peak oxygen consumption, six-minute walk distance, left ventricular ejection fraction, and left ventricular end-systolic and diastolic dimensions. Filters were set to retrieve trials that were published in the English Language between 2000 and 2024. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool (Rob2). Data were analysed meta-analytically. Results Twenty two (22) trials were included, randomized 2283 participants. A significant improvement favouring intervention groups was observed in anxiety SMD = -0.3890 (95% CI: -0.5640 to -0.2140; p˂0.001), depression SMD = -0.4032 (95% CI: -0.7114 to -0.0950; p= 0.002), peak oxygen consumption MD = 1.2471 (95% CI: 0.3963 to 2.0979; p = 0.004), six-minute walk distance MD = 36.0290 (95% CI: 7.7497 to 64.3082; p = 0.013), and left ventricular ejection fraction MD = 3.0650 (95% CI: 1.1279 to 5.0022; p = 0.001), Although cardiac rehabilitation had no significant effect in decreasing left ventricular end-diastolic dimension MD = -0.0480 (95% CI: -0.2609 to 0.1648; p = 0.658) and left ventricular end-systolic and MD = -0.0670 (95% CI: -0.2829 to 0.1489; p = 0.543) a favourable trend toward intervention group was seen. Risk of bias was high in 1 study and unclear in 7 studies. Conclusion For patients with Coronary Artery Disease, cardiac rehabilitation demonstrated effectiveness in improving psychological symptoms such as anxiety and depression, functional capacity as measured by peak oxygen consumption and six-minute walk test, and left ventricular function.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Remembering what just happened is a crucial prerequisite to form long-term memories but also for establishing and maintaining working memory. So far there is no general agreement about cortical mechanisms that support short-term memory. Using a classifier-based decoding approach, we report that hippocampal activity during few sparsely distributed brief time intervals contains information about the previous sensory motor experience of rodents. These intervals are characterized by only a small increase of firing rate of only a few neurons. These low-rate predictive patterns are present in both working memory and non-working memory tasks, in two rodent species, rats and Mongolian gerbils, are strongly reduced for rats with medial entorhinal cortex lesions, and depend on the familiarity of the sensory-motor context.</p>

                Sporadic Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and autosomal dominant Alzheimer’s disease (ADAD) share pathological features, but differing mechanisms, leading to disease. In this issue of Neuron, Almeida, Eger, et al. uncovered molecular processes that may distinguish sporadic AD from ADAD and how the APOE-Christchurch variant may be protective.

                In this issue of Neuron, Li, Zhang, et al. find that the bile acid receptor TGR5 in the lateral hypothalamus influences neuronal dynamics underlying stress-induced depression-like behaviors. Inhibition of these neurons produces antidepressant-like effects through a circuit that includes hippocampal CA3 and dorsolateral septum, revealing a novel potential therapeutic for depression.

                While effective analgesics, TRPV1 antagonists can dangerously alter thermoregulation. In this issue of Neuron, Huang et al. demonstrate that interaction with the S4-S5 linker of TRPV1 determines whether an antagonist affects core body temperature, with promising implications for analgesic development.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93457">Loss of ninein interferes with osteoclast formation and causes premature ossification</a></h4>

              
                Ninein is a centrosome protein that has been implicated in microtubule anchorage and centrosome cohesion. Mutations in the human <i>NINEIN</i> gene have been linked to Seckel syndrome and to a rare form of skeletal dysplasia. However, the role of ninein in skeletal development remains unknown. Here, we describe a ninein knockout mouse with advanced endochondral ossification during embryonic development. Although the long bones maintain a regular size, the absence of ninein delays the formation of the bone marrow cavity in the prenatal tibia. Likewise, intramembranous ossification in the skull is more developed, leading to a premature closure of the interfrontal suture. We demonstrate that ninein is strongly expressed in osteoclasts of control mice, and that its absence reduces the fusion of precursor cells into syncytial osteoclasts, whereas the number of osteoblasts remains unaffected. As a consequence, ninein-deficient osteoclasts have a reduced capacity to resorb bone. At the cellular level, the absence of ninein interferes with centrosomal microtubule organization, reduces centrosome cohesion, and provokes the loss of centrosome clustering in multinucleated mature osteoclasts. We propose that centrosomal ninein is important for osteoclast fusion, to enable a functional balance between bone-forming osteoblasts and bone-resorbing osteoclasts during skeletal development.

                Tuft cells are a group of rare epithelial cells that can detect pathogenic microbes and parasites. Many of these cells express signaling proteins initially found in taste buds. It is, however, not well understood how these taste signaling proteins contribute to the response to the invading pathogens or to the recovery of injured tissues. In this study, we conditionally nullified the signaling G protein subunit G<i>γ</i>13 and found that the number of ectopic tuft cells in the injured lung was reduced following the infection of the influenza virus H1N1. Furthermore, the infected mutant mice exhibited significantly larger areas of lung injury, increased macrophage infiltration, severer pulmonary epithelial leakage, augmented pyroptosis and cell death, greater bodyweight loss, slower recovery, worsened fibrosis and increased fatality. Our data demonstrate that the G<i>γ</i>13-mediated signal transduction pathway is critical to tuft cells-mediated inflammation resolution and functional repair of the damaged lungs.To our best knowledge, it is the first report indicating subtype-specific contributions of tuft cells to the resolution and recovery.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/89306">Partitioning to ordered membrane domains regulates the kinetics of secretory traffic</a></h4>

              
                The organelles of eukaryotic cells maintain distinct protein and lipid compositions required for their specific functions. The mechanisms by which many of these components are sorted to their specific locations remain unknown. While some motifs mediating subcellular protein localization have been identified, many membrane proteins and most membrane lipids lack known sorting determinants. A putative mechanism for sorting of membrane components is based on membrane domains known as lipid rafts, which are laterally segregated nanoscopic assemblies of specific lipids and proteins. To assess the role of such domains in the secretory pathway, we applied a robust tool for synchronized secretory protein traffic (RUSH, <i>R</i>etention <i>U</i>sing <i>S</i>elective <i>H</i>ooks) to protein constructs with defined affinity for raft phases. These constructs consist solely of single-pass transmembrane domains (TMDs) and, lacking other sorting determinants, constitute probes for membrane domain-mediated trafficking. We find that while raft affinity can be sufficient for steady-state PM localization, it is not sufficient for rapid exit from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which is instead mediated by a short cytosolic peptide motif. In contrast, we find that Golgi exit kinetics are highly dependent on raft affinity, with raft preferring probes exiting the Golgi ~2.5-fold faster than probes with minimal raft affinity. We rationalize these observations with a kinetic model of secretory trafficking, wherein Golgi export can be facilitated by protein association with raft domains. These observations support a role for raft-like membrane domains in the secretory pathway and establish an experimental paradigm for dissecting its underlying machinery.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92262">A parameterized two-domain thermodynamic model explains diverse mutational effects on protein allostery</a></h4>

              
                New experimental findings continue to challenge our understanding of protein allostery. Recent deep mutational scanning study showed that allosteric hotspots in the tetracycline repressor (TetR) and its homologous transcriptional factors are broadly distributed rather than spanning well-defined structural pathways as often assumed. Moreover, hotspot mutation-induced allostery loss was rescued by distributed additional mutations in a degenerate fashion. Here, we develop a two-domain thermodynamic model for TetR, which readily rationalizes these intriguing observations. The model accurately captures the in vivo activities of various mutants with changes in physically transparent parameters, allowing the data-based quantification of mutational effects using statistical inference. Our analysis reveals the intrinsic connection of intra- and inter-domain properties for allosteric regulation and illustrate epistatic interactions that are consistent with structural features of the protein. The insights gained from this study into the nature of two-domain allostery are expected to have broader implications for other multi-domain allosteric proteins.

">Functional and structural maturation of auditory cortex from 2 months to 2 years old</a></h4>

              
                In school-age children, the myelination of the auditory radiation thalamocortical pathway is associated with the latency of auditory evoked responses, with the myelination of thalamocortical axons facilitating the rapid propagation of acoustic information. Little is known regarding this auditory system function-structure association in infants and toddlers. The present study tested the hypothesis that maturation of auditory radiation white-matter microstructure (e.g., fractional anisotropy (FA); measured using diffusion-weighted MRI) is associated with the latency of the infant auditory response (P2m measured using magnetoencephalography, MEG) in a cross-sectional (2 to 24 months) as well as longitudinal cohort (2 to 29 months) of typically developing infants and toddlers. In the cross-sectional sample, non-linear maturation of P2m latency and auditory radiation diffusion measures were observed. After removing the variance associated with age in both P2m latency and auditory radiation diffusion measures, auditory radiation still accounted for significant variance in P2m latency. In the longitudinal sample, latency and FA associations could be observed at the level of a single child. Findings provide strong support for a contribution of auditory radiation white matter to rapid cortical auditory encoding processes in infants.

">Expression and regulation of SETBP1 in the song system of male zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) during singing</a></h4>

              
                Rare de novo heterozygous loss-of-function SETBP1 variants lead to a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by speech deficits, indicating a potential involvement of SETBP1 in human speech. However, the expression pattern of SETBP1 in brain regions associated with language remains poorly understood, along with the underlying molecular mechanisms linking it to speech. In this study, we examined SETBP1 expression in the brain of male zebra finches, a well-established model for studying vocal production learning. We demonstrated that zebra finch SETBP1 exhibits a greater number of exons and isoforms compared to its human counterpart. We characterized a SETBP1 antibody and showed that SETBP1 colocalized with FoxP1, FoxP2, and Parvalbumin in key song nuclei. Moreover, SETBP1 expression in neurons in Area X is significantly higher in zebra finches singing alone, than those singing courtship song to a female, or non-singers. Importantly, we found a distinctive neuronal protein expression of SETBP1 and FoxP2 in Area X only in zebra finches singing alone, but not in the other conditions. We demonstrated SETBP1`s regulatory role on FoxP2 promoter activity in vitro. Taken together, these findings provide compelling evidence for SETBP1 expression in brain regions to be crucial for vocal learning and its modulation by singing behavior.

">Spatial Single-cell Analysis Decodes Cortical Layer and Area Specification</a></h4>

              
                The human cerebral cortex, pivotal for advanced cognitive functions, is composed of six distinct layers and dozens of functionally specialized areas. The layers and areas are distinguished both molecularly, by diverse neuronal and glial cell subtypes, and structurally, through intricate spatial organization. While single-cell transcriptomics studies have advanced molecular characterization of human cortical development, a critical gap exists due to the loss of spatial context during cell dissociation. Here, we utilized multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridization (MERFISH), augmented with deep-learning-based cell segmentation, to examine the molecular, cellular, and cytoarchitectural development of human fetal cortex with spatially resolved single-cell resolution. Our extensive spatial atlas, encompassing 16 million single cells, spans eight cortical areas across four time points in the second and third trimesters. We uncovered an early establishment of the six-layer structure, identifiable in the laminar distribution of excitatory neuronal subtypes by mid-gestation, long before the emergence of cytoarchitectural layers. Notably, while anterior-posterior gradients of neuronal subtypes were generally observed in most cortical areas, a striking exception was the sharp molecular border between primary (V1) and secondary visual cortices (V2) at gestational week 20. Here we discovered an abrupt binary shift in neuronal subtype specification at the earliest stages, challenging the notion that continuous morphogen gradients dictate mid-gestation cortical arealization. Moreover, integrating single-nuclei RNA-sequencing and in situ whole transcriptomics revealed an early upregulation of synaptogenesis in V1-specific Layer 4 neurons, suggesting a role of synaptogenesis in this discrete border formation. Collectively, our findings underscore the crucial role of spatial relationships in determining the molecular specification of cortical layers and areas. This work not only provides a valuable resource for the field, but also establishes a spatially resolved single-cell analysis paradigm that paves the way for a comprehensive developmental atlas of the human brain.

">PAK6 promotes neuronal autophagy by regulating TFEB nuclear translocation.</a></h4>

              
                Autophagy is a highly conserved homeostatic process essential for the bulk degradation of cytoplasmic components and aggregated proteins. Multiple evidence indicates that impairment of (macro)autophagy leads to neurodegeneration, such as Parkinson disease (PD). Our previous work showed that p21 activated kinase 6 (PAK6) interacts with the PD-associated leucine-rich repeat kinase (LRRK2) to promote neurite outgrowth in the mouse striatum; still the function of PAK6 in the brain is largely unknown. Here, we found that downregulation of neuronal but not glial mbt, the D. melanogaster homolog of PAK6, impairs autophagy-lysosomal function. PAK6 overexpression in cells and in C. elegans increases transcription factor EB (TFEB) nuclear translocation in a kinase activity-dependent manner. Mechanistically, PAK6 forms a complex with TFEB to regulate its nuclear localization in a manner dependent on phosphorylation of and binding to 14-3-3 proteins and phosphorylation of TFEB at S467. In line with its ability to promote neuronal autophagy, mbt downregulation exacerbates alpha-synuclein toxicity in Drosophila dopaminergic neurons. Moreover, PAK6 overexpression in the substantia nigra of mutant LRRK2 mice reduces the burden of phosphorylated alpha-synuclein in dopaminergic neurons. Altogether, our study uncovers a novel role of PAK6 as a positive regulator of autophagy via TFEB and suggests that modulating its activity may represent a way to selectively turn on autophagy in neurons, with implications for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders.

">A combinatorial neural code for long-term motor memory</a></h4>

              
                Motor skill repertoire can be stably retained over long periods, but the neural mechanism underlying stable memory storage remains poorly understood. Moreover, it is unknown how existing motor memories are maintained as new motor skills are continuously acquired. Here we tracked neural representation of learned actions throughout a significant portion of a mouse lifespan, and we show that learned actions are stably retained in motor memory in combination with context, which protects existing memories from erasure during new motor learning. We used automated home-cage training to establish a continual learning paradigm in which mice learned to perform directional licking in different task contexts. We combined this paradigm with chronic two-photon imaging of motor cortex activity for up to 6 months. Within the same task context, activity driving directional licking was stable over time with little representational drift. When learning new task contexts, new preparatory activity emerged to drive the same licking actions. Learning created parallel new motor memories while retaining the previous memories. Re-learning to make the same actions in the previous task context re-activated the previous preparatory activity, even months later. At the same time, continual learning of new task contexts kept creating new preparatory activity patterns. Context-specific memories, as we observed in the motor system, may provide a solution for stable memory storage throughout continual learning. Learning in new contexts produces parallel new representations instead of modifying existing representations, thus protecting existing motor repertoire from erasure.

">CHRFAM7A overexpression in human iPSC-derived Interneurons dysregulates α7-nAChR surface expression and alters response to oligomeric β-amyloid peptide</a></h4>

              
                The alpha7 neuronal nicotinic receptor (alpha7-nAChR) gene, CHRNA7, is widely expressed within the brain and at the periphery. It plays various important roles in cognition and immune functions. Decreased expression of alpha7-nAChR has been associated with Alzheimer disease (AD) triggered by the accumulation of the 42-amino acid beta-amyloid peptide (ABeta1-42). The interactions of this peptide with alpha7-nAChR may represent a pivotal mechanism that is involved in pathogenesis of AD. The regulation of CHRNA7 is a complex process. Normal function of alpha7-nAChR in mammalian cells requires the co-expression of chaperone proteins such as RIC3 and NACHO which facilitate the formation of cell surface receptors. In humans, CHRNA7 regulation also involves the specific chimeric CHRFAM7A gene product dupalpha7, which may assemble with alpha7 subunits and lead to dominant negative regulation of alpha7-nAChR function. To further elucidate the complex interplay between CHRFAM7A gene product (dupalpha7), alpha7-nAChRs and ABeta1-42, we used human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC)-derived interneurons (INs). Four iPSC lines were analyzed for the presence of CHRFAM7A copies. Among them, a cell line with a null genotype was selected for the lentiviral overexpression of CHRFAM7A. Our data show that overexpression of CHRFAM7A led to a reduction in the surface detection of alpha7-nAChR ligand binding sites in iPSC-derived INs. INs expressing the alpha7-dupalpha7 subunit (alpha7-dupalpha7-INs) exhibited lower levels of RIC3 and NACHO. Upon agonist treatment by nicotine, an up-regulation of alpha7-nAChR ligand binding sites was observed in alpha7-dupalpha7-INs as compared to non-transduced INs (alpha7-INs). At low levels of ABeta treatment, alpha7-INs displayed a significant reduction in production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), while high levels resulted in a slight increase. In contrast, alpha7-dupalpha7-INs exhibited lower baseline levels of ROS that remained unaltered by A Beta treatment. ROS are known to exacerbate AD pathogenesis. We hypothesize that such effects may also be triggered by alpha7-dupalpha7-INs in the brain of patients. Further investigations are currently undertaken to confirm this hypothesis.

">At the onset of active whisking, the input layer of barrel cortex exhibits a 24 h window of increased excitability that depends on prior experience.</a></h4>

              
                The development of motor control over sensory organs is a critical milestone in sensory processing, enabling active exploration and shaping of the sensory environment. However, whether the onset of sensory organ motor control directly influences the development of corresponding sensory cortices remains unknown. Here, we exploit the late onset of whisking behavior in mice to address this question in the somatosensory system. Using ex vivo electrophysiology, we discovered a transient increase in the intrinsic excitability of excitatory neurons in layer IV of the barrel cortex, which processes whisker input, precisely coinciding with the onset of active whisking at postnatal day 14 (P14). This increase in neuronal gain was specific to layer IV, independent of changes in synaptic strength, and required prior sensory experience. Strikingly, the effect was not observed in layer II/III of the barrel cortex or in the visual cortex upon eye opening, suggesting a unique interaction between the development of active sensing and the thalamocortical input layer in the somatosensory system. Predictive modeling indicated that changes in active membrane conductances alone could reliably distinguish P14 neurons in control but not whisker-deprived hemispheres. Our findings demonstrate an experience-dependent, lamina-specific refinement of neuronal excitability tightly linked to the emergence of active whisking. This transient increase in the gain of the thalamic input layer coincides with a critical period for synaptic plasticity in downstream layers, suggesting a role in facilitating cortical maturation and sensory processing. Together, our results provide evidence for a direct interaction between the development of motor control and sensory cortex, offering new insights into the experience-dependent development and refinement of sensory systems. These findings have broad implications for understanding the interplay between motor and sensory development, and how the mechanisms of perception cooperate with behavior.

">Wound closure after brain injury relies on force generation by microglia in zebrafish</a></h4>

              
                Wound closure after a brain injury is critical for tissue restoration but this process is still not well characterized at the tissue level. We use live observation of wound closure in larval zebrafish after inflicting a stab wound to the brain. We demonstrate that the wound closes in the first 24 hours after injury by global tissue contraction. Microglia accumulation at the point of tissue convergence precedes wound closure and computational modelling of this process indicates that physical traction by microglia could lead to wound closure. Indeed, genetically or pharmacologically depleting microglia leads to defective tissue repair. Live observations indicate centripetal deformation of astrocytic processes contacted by migrating microglia. Severing such contacts leads to retraction of cellular processes, indicating tension. Weakening tension by disrupting the F-Actin stabilising gene lcp1 in microglial cells, leads to failure of wound closure. Therefore, we propose a previously unidentified mechanism of brain repair in which microglia has an essential role in contracting spared tissue. Understanding the mechanical role of microglia will support advances in traumatic brain injury therapies

">Peptidergic neurons with extensive branching orchestrate the internal states and energy balance of male Drosophila melanogaster.</a></h4>

              
                Neuropeptide SIFamide (SIFa) neurons in Drosophila melanogaster have been characterized by their exceptionally elaborate arborization patterns, which extend from the brain into the ventral nerve cord (VNC). SIFa neurons are equipped to receive signals that integrate both internal physiological cues and external environmental stimuli. These signals enable the neurons to regulate energy balance, sleep patterns, metabolic status, and circadian timing. These peptidergic neurons are instrumental in orchestrating the animal's internal states and refining its behavioral responses, yet the precise molecular underpinnings of this process remain elusive. Here we demonstrate that SIFa neurons coordinate a range of behavioral responses by selectively integrating inputs and outputs in a context-dependent manner. These neurons engage in a feedback loop with sNPF neurons in the ventral nerve cord, modifying behaviors such as long mating duration (LMD) and shorter mating duration (SMD). Furthermore, SIFa neurons receive essential inputs from neuropeptides Dsk, sNPF, and dilp2, which regulate interval timing behaviors. Activating SIFa neurons leads to reduced mating duration and increased food intake, while deactivating them reduces food intake. Overall, these findings demonstrate the importance of SIFa neurons in absorbing inputs and turning them into behavioral outputs, shedding light on animal's intricate behavioral orchestration.

">Bistable perception of symbolic numbers</a></h4>

              
                Numerals, i.e., semantic expressions of numbers, enable us to have an exact representation of the amount of things. Visual processing of numerals plays an indispensable role in the recognition and interpretation of numbers. Here, we investigate how visual information from numerals is processed to achieve semantic understanding. We first found that partial occlusion of some digital numerals introduces bistable interpretations. Next, by using the visual adaptation method, we investigated the origin of this bistability in human participants. We showed that adaptation to digital and normal Arabic numerals, as well as homologous shapes, but not Chinese numerals, biases the interpretation of a partially occluded digital numeral. We suggest that this bistable interpretation is driven by intermediate shape processing stages of vision, i.e., by features more complex than local visual orientations but more basic than the abstract concepts of numerals.

">Binocular combination in the autonomic nervous system</a></h4>

              
                The diameter of the pupil fluctuates in response to levels of ambient light and is regulated by the autonomic nervous system. Increasing light in one eye causes both pupils to constrict, implying the system must combine signals across the two eyes - a process of binocular integration occurring independently of visual cortex. Distinct classes of retinal photoreceptor are involved in controlling and maintaining pupil diameter, with cones and rods driving the initial constriction and intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells maintaining diameter over prolonged time periods. Here, we investigate binocular combination by targeting different photoreceptor pathways using the silent substitution method to modulate the input spectra. We find different patterns of binocular response in each pathway, and across the first and second harmonic frequencies. At the first harmonic, luminance and S-cone responses showed strong binocular facilitation, and weak interocular suppression. Melanopsin responses were invariant to the number of eyes stimulated. Notably, the L-M pathway involved binocular inhibition, whereby responses to binocular stimulation were weaker than for monocular stimulation. The second harmonic involved strong interocular suppression in all pathways, but with some evidence of binocular facilitation. Our results are consistent with a computational model of binocular signal combination (implemented in a Bayesian hierarchical framework), in which the weight of interocular suppression differs across pathways. We also find pathway differences in response phase, consistent with different lag times for phototransduction. This work demonstrates for the first time the algorithm governing binocular combination in the autonomic nervous system.

">OSBA: An open neonatal neuroimaging atlas and template for spina bifida aperta</a></h4>

              
                We present the Open Spina Bifida Aperta (OSBA) atlas, an open atlas and set of neuroimaging templates for spina bifida aperta (SBA). Traditional brain atlases may not adequately capture anatomical variations present in pediatric or disease-specific cohorts. The OSBA atlas fills in this gap by representing the computationally averaged anatomy of the neonatal brain with SBA after fetal surgical repair. The OSBA atlas was constructed using structural T2-weighted and diffusion tensor MRI of 28 newborns with SBA who underwent prenatal surgical correction. The corrected gestational age at MRI was 38.1 {+/-} 1.1 weeks (mean {+/-} SD). The OSBA atlas consists of T2-weighted and fractional anisotropy templates, along with 9 tissue prior maps and region of interest (ROI) delineations. The OSBA atlas offers a standardized reference space for spatial normalization and anatomical ROI definition. Our image segmentation and cortical ribbon definition is based on a human-in-the-loop approach including manual segmentation. The precise alignment of the ROIs was achieved by a combination of manual image alignment and automated, non-linear image registration. By providing a dedicated neonatal atlas for SBA, we enable more accurate spatial standardization and support advanced analyses such as diffusion tractography and connectomic studies in newborns affected by this condition.

">Sampling bias corrections for accurate neural measures of redundant, unique, and synergistic information</a></h4>

              
                Shannon Information theory has long been a tool of choice to measure empirically how populations of neurons in the brain encode information about cognitive variables. Recently, Partial Information Decomposition (PID) has emerged as principled way to break down this information into components identifying not only the unique information carried by each neuron, but also whether relationships between neurons generate synergistic or redundant information. While it has been long recognized that Shannon information measures on neural activity suffer from a (mostly upward) limited sampling estimation bias, this issue has largely been ignored in the burgeoning field of PID analysis of neural activity. We used simulations to investigate the limited sampling bias of PID computed from discrete probabilities (suited to describe neural spiking activity). We found that PID suffers from a large bias that is uneven across components, with synergy by far the most biased. Using approximate analytical expansions, we found that the bias of synergy increases quadratically with the number of discrete responses of each neuron, whereas the bias of unique and redundant information increase only linearly or sub-linearly. Based on the understanding of the PID bias properties, we developed simple yet effective procedures that correct for the bias effectively, and that improve greatly the PID estimation with respect to current state-of-the-art procedures. We apply these PID bias correction procedures to datasets of 53117 pairs neurons in auditory cortex, posterior parietal cortex and hippocampus of mice performing cognitive tasks, deriving precise estimates and bounds of how synergy and redundancy vary across these brain regions.

                Nogo-A is a major regulator of neural development and regeneration, but its role in tooth innervation remains largely unknown. Neurons from trigeminal ganglia support teeth homeostasis and regeneration, and disorders of their function could have significant pathophysiological consequences. In this study, we show that Nogo-A is expressed in the trigeminal ganglia and in the neurons innervating the teeth, and that its deletion affects both the number and patterning of neurons in teeth. In organotypic cultures, Nogo-A blocking antibodies affect the trigeminal ganglia-derived neuronal outgrowths and allow premature innervation of tooth germs. RNA sequencing analysis revealed that Nogo-A deletion induces alterations linked to functions at synapses and interference with neurotrophin signalling during the differentiation and maturation of trigeminal neurons. Taken together, these results reveal for the first time the importance of Nogo-A as a major regulator of tooth innervation and point to its potential as a clinical therapeutic target.

">Individual differences in uncertainty evaluation explain opposing exploratory behaviors in anxiety and apathy</a></h4>

              
                Navigating uncertain environments is a fundamental challenge for adaptive behavior, and affective states such as anxiety and apathy can profoundly influence an individual's response to uncertainty. Uncertainty encompasses both volatility and stochasticity, where volatility refers to how rapidly the environment changes and stochasticity describes outcomes resulting from random chance. This study investigates how anxiety and apathy modulate perceptions of environmental volatility and stochasticity and how these perceptions impact exploratory behavior. In a large online sample (N = 1001), participants completed a restless three-armed bandit task, and their choices were analyzed using latent state models to quantify the computational processes. We found that anxious individuals attributed uncertainty more to environmental volatility than stochasticity, leading to increased exploration, particularly after reward omission. Conversely, apathetic individuals perceived uncertainty as more stochastic than volatile, resulting in decreased exploration. The ratio of perceived volatility to stochasticity mediated the relationship between anxiety and exploratory behavior following adverse outcomes. These findings reveal distinct computational mechanisms underlying anxiety and apathy in uncertain environments. Our results provide a novel framework for understanding the cognitive and affective processes driving adaptive and potentially maladaptive behaviors under uncertainty, with implications for the characterization and treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders.

">The node of Ranvier influences the in vivo axonal transport of mitochondria and signalling endosomes</a></h4>

              
                Efficient long-range axonal transport is essential for maintaining neuronal function, and perturbations in this process underlie severe neurological diseases. We have previously demonstrated that signalling endosomes are transported in vivo at comparable speeds across motor neurons (MNs) innervating different hindlimb muscles, as well as between forelimb and hindlimb peripheral nerves. In contrast, axonal transport is faster in MNs compared to sensory neurons innervating the same muscle. Found periodically across the myelin sheath, Nodes of Ranvier (NoR) are short uncovered axonal domains that facilitate action potential propagation. Currently, it remains unresolved how the distinct molecular structures of the NoR impact axonal transport dynamics. Here, using intravital time-lapse microscopy of sciatic nerves in live, anaesthetised mice, we assessed diverse organelle dynamics at the NoR. We first observed that axonal morphologies were similar between fast and slow MNs, and found that signalling endosomes and mitochondria accumulate on the distal side of the NoR in both motor neuron subtypes. Assessment of axonal transport of signalling endosomes and mitochondria revealed a decrease in velocity and increase in pausing as the organelles transit through the NoR, followed by an increase in speed in the adjacent intranodal region. Collectively, this study has established axonal transport dynamics of two independent organelles at the NoR in vivo, and has relevance for several pathologies affecting peripheral nerves and the NoR, such as peripheral neuropathy, motor neuron diseases, and/or multiple sclerosis.

">Arid1b haploinsufficiency in pyramidal neurons causes cellular and circuit changes in neocortex but is not sufficient to produce behavioral or seizure phenotypes</a></h4>

              
                Arid1b is a high confidence risk gene for autism spectrum disorder that encodes a subunit of a chromatin remodeling complex expressed in neuronal progenitors. Haploinsufficiency causes a broad range of social, behavioral, and intellectual disability phenotypes, including Coffin-Siris syndrome. Recent work using transgenic mouse models suggests pathology is due to deficits in proliferation, survival, and synaptic development of cortical neurons. However, there is conflicting evidence regarding the relative roles of excitatory projection neurons and inhibitory interneurons in generating abnormal cognitive and behavioral phenotypes. Here, we conditionally knocked out either one or both copies of Arid1b from excitatory projection neuron progenitors and systematically investigated the effects on intrinsic membrane properties, synaptic physiology, social behavior, and seizure susceptibility. We found that disrupting Arid1b expression in excitatory neurons alters their membrane properties, including hyperpolarizing action potential threshold; however, these changes depend on neuronal subtype. Using paired whole-cell recordings, we found increased synaptic connectivity rate between projection neurons. Furthermore, we found reduced strength of excitatory synapses to parvalbumin (PV)-expression inhibitory interneurons. These data suggest an increase in the ratio of excitation to inhibition. However, the strength of inhibitory synapses from PV interneurons to excitatory neurons was enhanced, which may rebalance this ratio. Indeed, Arid1b haploinsufficiency in projection neurons was insufficient to cause social deficits and seizure phenotypes observed in a preclinical germline haploinsufficient mouse model. Our data suggest that while excitatory projection neurons likely contribute to autistic phenotypes, pathology in these cells is not the primary cause.

">The prelimbic prefrontal cortex mediates the development of lasting social phobia as a consequence of social threat conditioning.</a></h4>

              
                Social phobia is highly detrimental for social behavior, mental health, and productivity. Despite much previous research, the behavioral and neurobiological mechanisms associated with the development of social phobia remain elusive. To investigate these issues, the present study implemented a mouse model of social threat conditioning in which mice received electric shock punishment upon interactions with unfamiliar conspecifics. This resulted in immediate reductions in social behavior and robust increases in defensive mechanisms such as avoidance, freezing, darting, and ambivalent stretched posture. Furthermore, social deficits lasted for prolonged periods and were independent of contextual settings, sex variables, or particular identity of the social stimuli. Shedding new light into the neurobiological factors contributing to this phenomenon, we found that optogenetic silencing of the prelimbic (PL), but not the infralimbic (IL), subregion of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) during training led to subsequent forgetting and development of lasting social phobia. Similarly, pharmacological inhibition of NMDARs in PL also impaired the development of social phobia. These findings are consistent with the notion that social-related trauma is a prominent risk factor for the development of social phobia, and that this phenomenon engages learning-related mechanisms within the prelimbic prefrontal cortex to promote prolonged representations of social threat.

                Cortical circuit activity is controlled by GABA-mediated inhibition in a spatiotemporally restricted manner. Much is known about fast GABA currents, GABAB receptor (GABABR) signalling exerts powerful slow inhibition that controls synaptic, dendritic and neuronal activity. However, little is known about how GABABRs contribute to circuit-level inhibition over the lifespan of rodents and humans. In this study, we quantitatively determine the functional contribution of GABABR signalling to pre- and postsynaptic domains in rat and human cortical principal cells (PC). We find that postsynaptic GABABR differentially control pyramidal cell activity within the cortical column as a function of age and species, and that these receptors contribute to co-ordination of local information processing in a layer- and species-dependent manner. These data directly increase our knowledge of translationally relevant local circuit dynamics, with direct impact on understanding the role of GABABRs in the treatment of seizure disorders.

">The dominance of global phase dynamics in human cortex, from delta to gamma</a></h4>

              
                The organization of the phase of electrical activity in the cortex is critical to inter-site communication, but the balance of this communication across macroscopic (>15cm), mesoscopic (1 to 15cm) and microscopic (<1cm) ranges is an open question. Traveling waves in the cortex are spatial phase gradients, such that phase values change smoothly through the cortical sheet over time. Macroscopic cortical traveling waves have been understudied compared to micro- or mesoscopic waves. The spatial frequencies (i.e., the characteristic scales) of cortical waves have been characterized in the grey-matter for micro- and mesoscopic scales of cortex and show decreasing spatial power with increasing spatial frequency. This research, however, has been limited by the size of the measurement array, thus excluding macroscopic traveling waves. Obversely, poor spatial resolution of extra-cranial measurements prevents incontrovertible macroscopic estimates of spatial power via electroencephalogram and magnetoencephalogram. We apply a novel method to estimate the spatial frequency spectrum of phase dynamics in order to quantify the uncertain macroscopic scale. Stereotactic electroencephalogram is utilized to leverage measurements of local-field potentials within the grey matter, while also taking advantage of the sometimes large extent of spatial coverage. Irregular sampling of the cortical sheet is offset by use of linear algebra techniques to empirically estimate the spatial frequency spectrum. We find the spatial power of the phase is highest at the lowest spatial frequencies (longest wavelengths), consistent with the power spectra ranges for micro- and meso-scale dynamics, but here shown up to the size of the measurement array (15-25cm), i.e., approaching the entire extent of cortex. Low spatial frequencies dominate the cortical phase dynamics. This has important functional implications as it means that the phase measured at a single contact in the grey-matter is more strongly a function of global phase organization than local. This result arises across a wide range of temporal frequencies, from the delta band (2Hz) through to the high gamma range (100Hz).

Consequently, defective mitochondrial trafficking is implicated in various neurological and neurodegenerative diseases. A key signal regulating mitochondrial transport is intracellular calcium. Elevated Ca2+ levels have been demonstrated to inhibit mitochondrial transport in many cell types, including neurons. However, it is currently unclear to what extent calcium-signaling regulates axonal mitochondrial transport during realistic neuronal activity patterns. We created a robust pipeline to quantify with high spatial resolution, absolute Ca2+ concentrations. This allows us to monitor Ca2+ dynamics with pixel precision in the axon and other neuronal compartments. We found that axonal calcium levels scale with firing frequency in the range of 0.1-1M, whereas KCl-induced depolarization generated levels almost a magnitude higher. As expected, prolonged KCl-induced depolarization did inhibit axonal mitochondrial transport in primary hippocampal neurons. However, physiologically relevant neuronal activity patterns only inhibited mitochondrial transport in axonal segments which made connections to a target neuron. In non-connecting axonal segments, we were unable to trigger this inhibitory mechanism using realistic firing patterns. Thus, we confirm that neuronal activity can indeed regulate axonal mitochondrial transport, and reveal a spatial pattern to this regulation which went previously undetected. Together, these findings indicate a potent, but localized role for activity-related calcium fluctuations in the regulation of axonal mitochondrial transport.

	<p>Ageing is a continuous process that can cause neurodevelopmental changes in the body. Several studies have examined its effects, but few have focused on how time affects biological processes in the early stages of brain development. As studying the changes that occur in the early stages of life is important to prevent age-related neurological and psychiatric disorders, we aim to focus on these changes. The transcriptomic markers of ageing that are common to the analysed brain regions of C57Bl/6J mice were identified after conducting two-way ANOVA tests and effect size analysis on the time courses of gene expression profiles in various mouse brain regions. A total of 16,374 genes (59.9%) significantly changed their expression level, among which 7600 (27.8%) demonstrated tissue-dependent differences only, and 1823 (6.7%) displayed time-dependent and tissue-independent responses. Focusing on genes with at least a large effect size gives the list of potential biomarkers 12,332 (45.1%) and 1670 (6.1%) genes, respectively. There were 305 genes that exhibited similar significant time response trends (independently of the brain region). Samples from an 11-day-old mouse embryo validated the identified early-stage brain ageing markers. The overall functional analysis revealed tRNA and rRNA processing in the mitochondrion and contact activation system (CAS), as well as the kallikrein/kinin system (KKS), together with clotting cascade and defective factor F9 activation being affected by ageing. Most ageing-related pathways were significantly enriched, especially those that are strongly connected to development processes and neurodegenerative diseases.</p>

	<p>The present study explores comparatively the effectiveness of a cognitive (verbal short-term memory (vSTM), verbal working memory (vWM)) and of a linguistic training (10-week duration each) in the diffusion of gains in cognitive abilities (vSTM and vWM) of in school-aged Greek-speaking children with developmental language disorder (DLD). To this purpose, two computerized training programs i.e., a linguistic and a cognitive one, were developed and applied to three groups (A, B, and C) of children with DLD (N = 49, in total). There were three assessments with two vSTM tasks (non-word repetition and forward digit span) and a vWM task (backward digit span): pre-therapeutically (time 1), where no significant between-group differences were found, post-therapeutically I (time 2), and post-therapeutically II (time 3) and two training phases. In phase &amp;amp;Iota;, group A received meta-syntactic training, whereas group B vSTM/vWM training and group C received no training. In phase &amp;amp;Iota;&amp;amp;Iota;, a reversal of treatment was performed for groups A and B: group A received vSTM/vWM while group B meta-syntactic training. Again, group C received no training. Overall, the results indicated a significant performance improvement for the treatment groups and revealed beneficial far-transfer effects as language therapy can affect vSTM and vWM in addition to direct and near transfer effects. In addition, the intervention type order affected performance as follows: first, better performance on the vSTM task (non-word repetition) was shown when the linguistic treatment was delivered first; second, better performance on the vWM in Time 2 and Time 3 was shown by group B, for which the cognitive treatment was delivered first. Concluding, not only intervention type but also intervention type order can affect performance in DLD.</p>

	<p>Interoceptive dysfunctions are increasingly implicated in a number of physical and mental health conditions. Accordingly, there is a pertinent need for therapeutic interventions which target interoceptive deficits. Heartrate and heartrate variability biofeedback therapy (HR(V)-BF), interventions which train individuals to regulate their cardiovascular signals and constrain these within optimal parameters through breathing, could enhance the functioning of interoceptive pathways via stimulation of the vagus nerve. Consequently, this narrative systematic review sought to synthesise the current state of the literature with regard to the potential of HR(V)-BF as an interoceptive intervention across behavioural, physiological and neural outcome measures related to interoception. In total, 77 papers were included in this review, with the majority using physiological outcome measures. Overall, findings were mixed with respect to improvements in the outcome measures after HR(V)-BF. However, trends suggested that effects on measures related to interoception were stronger when resonance frequency breathing and an intense treatment protocol were employed. Based on these findings, we propose a three-stage model by which HR(V)-BF may improve interoception which draws upon principles of interoceptive inference and predictive coding. Furthermore, we provide specific directions for future research, which will serve to advance the current knowledge state.</p>

	<p>(1) Background: Neurofeedback training (NFT) has emerged as a promising approach for enhancing cognitive functions and reducing anxiety, yet its specific impact on university student populations requires further investigation. This study aims to examine the effects of NFT on working memory improvement and anxiety reduction within this demographic. (2) Methods: A total of forty healthy university student volunteers were randomized into two groups: an experimental group that received NFT and a control group. The NFT protocol was administered using a 14-channel Emotiv Epoc X headset (EMOTIV, Inc., San Francisco, CA 94102, USA) and BrainViz software version Brain Visualizer 1.1 (EMOTIV, Inc., San Francisco, CA 94102, USA), focusing on the alpha frequency band to target improvements in working memory and reductions in anxiety. Assessment tools, including the Corsi Block and Memory Span tests for working memory and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-2 (STAI-2) for anxiety, were applied pre- and post-intervention. (3) Results: The findings indicated an increase in alpha wave amplitude in the experimental group from the second day of NFT, with statistically significant differences observed on days 2 (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05) and 8 (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01). Contrary to expectations based on the previous literature, the study did not observe a concurrent positive impact on working memory. Nonetheless, a significant reduction in state anxiety levels was recorded in the experimental group (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), corroborating NFT&amp;amp;rsquo;s potential for anxiety management. (4) Conclusions: While these results suggest some potential of the technique in enhancing neural efficiency, the variability across different days highlights the need for further investigation to fully ascertain its effectiveness. The study confirms the beneficial impact of NFT on reducing state anxiety among university students, underscoring its value in psychological and cognitive performance enhancement. Despite the lack of observed improvements in working memory, these results highlight the need for continued exploration of NFT applications across different populations and settings, emphasizing its potential utility in educational and therapeutic contexts.</p>

	<p>Ischemic stroke is a significant public health concern, with its incidence expected to double over the next 40 years, particularly among individuals over 75 years old. Previous studies, such as the DAWN trial, have highlighted the importance of correlating clinical severity with ischemic stroke volume to optimize patient management. Our study aimed to correlate the clinical severity of ischemic stroke, as assessed by the NIHSS score, with ischemic stroke volume measured using DWI, and short-term prognosis quantified by the mRS score at discharge. Conducted at the largest hospital in Gorj County from January 2023 to December 2023, this study enrolled 43 consecutive patients with acute ischemic stroke. In our patient cohort, we observed a strong positive correlation between NIHSS score and ischemic stroke volume (Spearman correlation coefficient = 0.982, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01), and a strong negative correlation between ASPECTS-DWI score and mRS score (Spearman correlation coefficient = &amp;amp;minus;0.952, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01). Multiple linear regression analysis revealed a significant collective relationship between ASPECTS score, ischemic stroke volume, and NIHSS score (F(1, 41) = 600.28, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001, R2 = 0.94, R2adj = 0.93). These findings underscore the importance of DWI in assessing ischemic stroke severity and prognosis, warranting further investigation for its integration into clinical practice.</p>

	<p>Background: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by impairments in social interaction and restricted and repetitive behaviors. Oxidative stress may be a critical link between mitochondrial dysfunction and ASD as reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated from pro-oxidant environmental toxicants and activated immune cells can result in mitochondrial failure. Recently, mitochondrial dysfunction, autoimmunity, and abnormal lipid mediators have been identified in multiple investigations as an acknowledged etiological mechanism of ASD that can be targeted for therapeutic intervention. Methods: The relationship between lipid mediator markers linked to inflammation induction, such as phospholipase A2/cyclooxygenase-2 (PLA2/Cox-2), and the mitochondrial dysfunction marker anti-mitochondrial antibodies (AMA-M2), and anti-histone autoantibodies in the etiology of ASD was investigated in this study using combined receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses. This study also sought to identify the linear combination for a given set of markers that optimizes the partial area under ROC curves. This study included 40 age- and sex-matched controls and 40 ASD youngsters. The plasma of both groups was tested for PLA2/COX-2, AMA-M2, and anti-histone autoantibodies&amp;amp;rsquo; levels using ELISA kits. ROC curves and logistic regression models were used in the statistical analysis. Results: Using the integrated ROC curve analysis, a notable rise in the area under the curve was noticed. Additionally, the combined markers had markedly improved specificity and sensitivity. Conclusions: The current study suggested that measuring the predictive value of selected biomarkers related to mitochondrial dysfunction, autoimmunity, and lipid metabolism in children with ASD using a ROC curve analysis could lead to a better understanding of the etiological mechanism of ASD as well as its relationship with metabolism.</p>

                Back ground Code Blue is a common emergency code used in cases of cardiac arrest in hospitals to alert trained emergency response teams. The use of codes is mainly to convey essential information quickly to staff while preventing misunderstandings and panic among hospital visitors. This study aimed to determine the profiles and outcomes of patients with activated code blue calls. Methods This retrospective record-based study included all patients who had a code blue declared in the year 2022. Data was collected from the patient files from medical records department and analyzed with descriptive and inferential statistical methods. Results A total of 86 code blue calls were analyzed in this study. In terms of age distribution, the age group 60-80 years had the highest percentage of code blue cases. Code blue cases were more announced in males in the study (55.8%). For the announced code blue cases, it was identified that CPR if initiated by the staff on scene before the arrival of the code blue team had higher survival chance (60.0%). Asystole was the most common rhythm detected initially (66.3%) upon arrival of the code blue team. It was found that if the response time was lesser than 2 min, the patients had a higher chance of survival (53.3%). Conclusions In conclusion, CPR performed by a trained code blue team in a hospital can help improve outcomes. The initiation of bystander CPR has been proven to have favorable outcomes. Better training of staff can result in better outcomes.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-573/v1?src=rss">Case series: Management and outcomes of five cases of blunt and open pancreatic trauma [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction Pancreatic trauma is notably less frequent than injuries affecting other solid organs, such as the liver or spleen. Despite their infrequency, pancreatic injuries can pose significant risks, with mortality rates ranging from 5 to 30% and morbidity rates reaching 50%. Managing such injuries remains contentious because of the anatomical complexity, lesion extent, and close proximity to neighboring organs. Methods Our study aimed to delineate the clinical and biological characteristics of pancreatic trauma and specify diagnostic and therapeutic modalities. This study was conducted retrospectively from 2010 to 2021 at Mahmoud El Matri Hospital’s General Surgery Department in Ariana, TUNISIA, and included five cases of blunt and open pancreatic trauma. Results Although rare, pancreatic injuries can lead to serious consequences, prompting the development of a diverse array of therapeutic options. Pancreatic trauma presents a complex clinical challenge, necessitating a comprehensive approach that considers various factors, such as injury severity, anatomical location, and patient condition. Advanced imaging techniques, including computed tomography (CT) scanning, Wirsung-MRI, and ERCP, aid in the accurate diagnosis and assessment of canal involvement. Conservative management was considered for cases with limited canal rupture, whereas endoscopic treatments showed promise for hemodynamically stable cases. Surgical interventions, such as duodenopancreatectomy, are reserved for exceptional cases with severe injuries. Conclusion Pancreatic trauma requires a comprehensive approach that considers factors such as injury severity, anatomical location, and patient condition. Ongoing research and collaboration are vital for refining pancreatic trauma management and proposing guidelines for facilitating decision-making.

                <p>Sleep's contribution to affective regulation is insufficiently understood. Previous human research has focused on memorizing or rating affective pictures and less on physiological affective responsivity. This may result in overlapping definitions of affective and declarative memories and inconsistent deductions for how rapid eye movement sleep (REMS) and slow-wave sleep (SWS) are involved. Literature associates REMS theta (4&ndash;8&nbsp;Hz) activity with emotional memory processing, but its contribution to social stress habituation is unknown. Applying selective sleep stage suppression and oscillatory analyses, we investigated how sleep modulated affective adaptation toward social stress and retention of neutral declarative memories. Native Finnish participants (<I>N</I> = 29; age, <I>M</I> = 25.8&nbsp;years) were allocated to REMS or SWS suppression conditions. We measured physiological (skin conductance response, SCR) and subjective stress response and declarative memory retrieval thrice: before laboratory night, the next morning, and after 3&nbsp;d. Linear mixed models were applied to test the effects of condition and sleep parameters on emotional responsivity and memory retrieval. Greater overnight increase in SCR toward the stressor emerged after suppressed SWS (intact REMS) relative to suppressed REMS (20.1% vs 6.1%; <I>p</I> = 0.016). The overnight SCR increase was positively associated with accumulated REMS theta energy irrespective of the condition (<I>r</I> = 0.601; <I>p</I> = 0.002). Subjectively rated affective response and declarative memory recall were comparable between the conditions. The contributions of REMS and SWS to habituation of social stress are distinct. REMS theta activity proposedly facilitates the consolidation of autonomic affective responses. Declarative memory consolidation may not have greater dependence on intact SWS relative to intact REMS.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/11/6/ENEURO.0540-23.2024?rss=1">Exploring Ca2+ Dynamics in Myelinating Oligodendrocytes through rAAV-Mediated jGCaMP8s Expression in Developing Spinal Cord Organ Cultures</a></h4>

              
                <p>Oligodendrocytes, the myelin-producing glial cells of the central nervous system (CNS), crucially contribute to myelination and circuit function. An increasing amount of evidence suggests that intracellular calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) dynamics in oligodendrocytes mediates activity-dependent and activity-independent myelination. Unraveling how myelinating oligodendrocytes orchestrate and integrate Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals, particularly in relation to axonal firing, is crucial for gaining insights into their role in the CNS development and function, both in health and disease. In this framework, we used the recombinant adeno-associated virus/Olig001 capsid variant to express the genetically encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator jGCaMP8s, under the control of the myelin basic protein promoter. In our study, this tool exhibits excellent tropism and selectivity for myelinating and mature oligodendrocytes, and it allows monitoring Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity in myelin-forming cells, both in isolated primary cultures and organotypic spinal cord explants. By live imaging of myelin Ca<sup>2+</sup> events in oligodendrocytes within organ cultures, we observed a rapid decline in the amplitude and duration of Ca<sup>2+</sup> events across different in vitro developmental stages. Active myelin sheath remodeling and growth are modulated at the level of myelin&ndash;axon interface through Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling, and, during early myelination in organ cultures, this phase is finely tuned by the firing of axon action potentials. In the later stages of myelination, Ca<sup>2+</sup> events in mature oligodendrocytes no longer display such a modulation, underscoring the involvement of complex Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in CNS myelination.</p>

                Background Indonesia is one of the countries that is endemic to avian influenza virus subtype H9N2. This study aims to compare the molecular characteristics of avian influenza virus (AIV) subtype H9N2 from West Java. Methods Specific pathogen-free (SPF) embryonated chicken eggs were used to inoculate samples. RNA extraction and RT–qPCR confirmed the presence of H9 and N2 genes in the samples. RT–PCR was employed to amplify the H9N2-positive sample. Nucleotide sequences were obtained through Sanger sequencing and analyzed using MEGA 7. Homology comparison and phylogenetic tree analysis, utilizing the neighbor-joining tree method, assessed the recent isolate’s similarity to reference isolates from GenBank. Molecular docking analysis was performed on the HA1 protein of the recent isolate and the A/Layer/Indonesia/WestJava-04/2017 isolate, comparing their interactions with the sialic acids Neu5Ac2-3Gal and Neu5Ac2-6Gal. Results RT–qPCR confirmed the isolate samples as AIV subtype H9N2. The recent virus exhibited 11 amino acid residue differences compared to the A/Layer/Indonesia/WestJava-04/2017 isolate. Phylogenetically, the recent virus remains within the h9.4.2.5 subclade. Notably, at antigenic site II, the recent isolate featured an amino acid N at position 183, unlike A/Layer/Indonesia/WestJava-04/2017. Molecular docking analysis revealed a preference of HA1 from the 2017 virus for Neu5Ac2-3Gal, while the 2023 virus displayed a tendency to predominantly bind with Neu5Ac2-6Gal. Conclusion In summary, the recent isolate displayed multiple mutations and a strong affinity for Neu5Ac2-6Gal, commonly found in mammals.

                <p>by Frank Hawkins</p>

The potentially catastrophic loss of biodiversity happening around the globe is largely caused by economic activity that is not connected to its environmental impacts. To improve positive and reduce negative outcomes for nature, investment decision-makers in companies, governments, and the finance sector need data on the impacts of economic activity, especially production of food and other commodities, on biodiversity, at fine geographical scales. This Essay argues that the data allowing us to identify the most important factors causing biodiversity loss are already available. However, we need more data to track impacts on biodiversity up value chains into pathways, toolkits, and approaches that will facilitate verified, concrete actions by companies and consumers to reduce threats to biodiversity in particular places. Our current knowledge is insufficient to deliver complete responses to the biodiversity crisis, but this is no excuse for delaying action.

                <p>by Laura Dearden, Isadora C. Furigo, Lucas C. Pantaleão, L W. P. Wong, Denise S. Fernandez-Twinn, Juliana de Almeida-Faria, Katherine A. Kentistou, Maria V. Carreira, Guillaume Bidault, Antonio Vidal-Puig, Ken K. Ong, John R. B. Perry, Jose Donato Jr, Susan E. Ozanne</p>

In utero exposure to maternal obesity programs increased obesity risk. Animal models show that programmed offspring obesity is preceded by hyperphagia, but the mechanisms that mediate these changes are unknown. Using a mouse model of maternal obesity, we observed increased intake of a high-fat diet (HFD) in offspring of obese mothers that precedes the development of obesity. Through small RNA sequencing, we identified programmed overexpression of hypothalamic miR-505-5p that is established in the fetus, lasts to adulthood and is maintained in hypothalamic neural progenitor cells cultured in vitro. Metabolic hormones and long-chain fatty acids associated with obesity increase miR-505-5p expression in hypothalamic neurons in vitro. We demonstrate that targets of miR-505-5p are enriched in fatty acid metabolism pathways and overexpression of miR-505-5p decreased neuronal fatty acid metabolism in vitro. miR-505-5p targets are associated with increased BMI in human genetic studies. Intra-cerebroventricular injection of miR-505-5p in wild-type mice increased HFD intake, mimicking the phenotype observed in offspring exposed to maternal obesity. Conversely, maternal exercise intervention in an obese mouse pregnancy rescued the programmed increase of hypothalamic miR-505-5p in offspring of obese dams and reduced HFD intake to control offspring levels. This study identifies a novel mechanism by which maternal obesity programs obesity in offspring via increased intake of high-fat foods.

                Efforts have been made over the last five decades to create effective ultrasonic contrast media (UCM) for cardiac and noncardiac applications. The initial UCM was established in the 1980s, following publications from the 1960s that detailed the discovery of ultrasonic contrast enhancement using small gaseous bubbles in echocardiographic examinations. An optimal contrast agent for echography should possess the following characteristics: non-toxicity, suitability for intravenous injection, ability to traverse pulmonary, cardiac, and capillary circulations, and stability for recirculation. Definity, Optison, Sonazoid, and SonoVue are examples of current commercial contrast media. These contrast media have shown potential for various clinical reasons, both on-label and off-label. Several possible UCMs have been developed or are in progress. Advancements in comprehending the physical, chemical, and biological characteristics of microbubbles have significantly improved the visualization of tumor blood vessels, the identification of areas with reduced blood supply, and the enhanced detection of narrowed blood vessels. Innovative advances are expected to enhance future applications such as ultrasonic molecular imaging and therapeutic utilization of microbubbles.

                Background Measures of hemiparetic ankle dorsiflexor muscle strength and rate of force development (RFD) are often used to determine the efficacy of rehabilitation interventions after stroke. However, evidence supporting the reliability of these measures is limited. This brief report provides a secondary analysis investigating the between-session reliability of isometric ankle dorsiflexor muscle strength, rate of force development (RFD), and tibialis anterior electromyography (TA EMG), in people with chronic stroke. Method Participants (n=15) completed three maximal isometric contractions of the ankle dorsiflexor muscles as fast as possible using a rigid dynamometer. Tests were repeated seven days later. Outcomes included ankle dorsiflexor isometric maximal voluntary contraction (MVC), RFD in the first 200ms (RFD200ms), time to reach 90% MVC, and peak TA EMG. Data were analysed for 13 participants using intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC) and standard error of the measure percentage (SEM%). Results Reliability was higher when analysing the mean of three trials rather than the best of three trials. There was excellent reliability for isometric dorsiflexor MVC (ICC 0.97 [95% CI 0.92, 0.99], SEM% 7%). However, for other outcomes, while the ICC indicated good reliability, the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval of the ICC fell in the moderate range for TA EMG (ICC 0.86 [95% CI 0.60, 0.96], SEM% 25%) and time to reach 90% MVC (ICC 0.8 [95% CI 0.53, 0.93], SEM% 23%) and in the poor range for dorsiflexor RFD200ms (ICC 0.79 [95% CI 0.48, 0.92], SEM% 24%). Conclusion The findings raise concerns about the reliability of measures of rapid force production in the dorsiflexor muscles after stroke. Given the functional significance of the ankle dorsiflexors, larger studies should be conducted to further investigate these concerns and explore reliable methods for measuring rapid force production in the hemiparetic dorsiflexor muscles.

                Introduction Rectal bleeding commonly occurs in elderly patients using blood thinners, posing management challenges due to limited guidance on reversal agents and medication restart criteria. This study aims to review the demographics and management of elderly patients with rectal bleeding while on blood thinners. Methods A retrospective analysis of patients aged 60 or older presenting with rectal bleeding at West Suffolk Hospital’s emergency department was conducted from January 2018 to December 2020. Data were extracted from electronic records, focusing on patients using blood thinners and adhering to British Society of Gastroenterology guidelines. All patients ceased blood-thinning medications upon admission. The hospital’s ethics committee approved the study, which focused on demographics, diagnosis, and management, particularly regarding re-initiation of blood-thinning medicines. Results During the study period, 170 patients were admitted to the emergency department of West Suffolk Hospital. 93 (54.71%) patients were included in the study. The average age of the participants was 82 years, and 62.3% were male. All patients were followed up for three months. Atrial fibrillation accounted for 52% of patients, while previous strokes accounted for 20%. The most typical pathology was diverticulosis. Regarding restarting of anticoagulants, Among patients on DOAC (Direct oral anticoagulant), 39% were restarted on discharge, 23% were switched to warfarin, and another 23% were not restarted; 15% planned to restart after seven days. For those on Warfarin, 62% were restarted on discharge, 22% stopped the medication, and the rest were switched to Dual Oral Anticoagulant. Among aspirin patients, 60% were restarted at discharge, while the remaining discontinued. All patients receiving clopidogrel and dual antiplatelet therapy were started at discharge. None of the patients were readmitted during the follow-up period of 3 months. Conclusion Restarting of blood-thinning drugs in patients with rectal bleeding is subject to individual patient variation. Necessitates more extensive trials to achieve greater standardization.

<p>An expression atlas and database of 38 neuropeptide genes and GABAergic/glutamatergic neuron marker genes in the adult zebrafish forebrain were constructed. The zebrafish hypothalamus was subdivided into finer subregions and its organization was reassessed based on the profiles of neuropeptide expression. The obtained expression data in the telencephalon and hypothalamus were compared with those from mice, revealing several similarities between these two vertebrate species.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Zebrafish is a useful model organism in neuroscience; however, its gene expression atlas in the adult brain is not well developed. In the present study, we examined the expression of 38 neuropeptides, comparing with GABAergic and glutamatergic neuron marker genes in the adult zebrafish brain by comprehensive in situ hybridization. The results are summarized as an expression atlas in 19 coronal planes of the forebrain. Furthermore, the scanned data of all brain sections were made publicly available in the Adult Zebrafish Brain Gene Expression Database (<a target="_blank"

   href="https://ssbd.riken.jp/azebex/">https://ssbd.riken.jp/azebex/</a>). Based on these data, we performed detailed comparative neuroanatomical analyses of the hypothalamus and found that several regions previously described as one nucleus in the reference zebrafish brain atlas contain two or more subregions with significantly different neuropeptide/neurotransmitter expression profiles. Subsequently, we compared the expression data in zebrafish telencephalon and hypothalamus obtained in this study with those in mice, by performing a cluster analysis. As a result, several nuclei in zebrafish and mice were clustered in close vicinity. The present expression atlas, database, and anatomical findings will contribute to future neuroscience research using zebrafish.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/85567">Ingestible pills reveal gastric correlates of emotions</a></h4>

              
                Although it is generally held that gastrointestinal (GI) signals are related to emotions, direct evidence for such a link is currently lacking. One of the reasons why the internal milieu of the GI system is poorly investigated is because visceral organs are difficult to access and monitor. To directly measure the influence of endoluminal markers of GI activity on the emotional experience, we asked a group of healthy male participants to ingest a pill that measured pH, pressure, and temperature of their GI tract while they watched video clips that consistently induced disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, or a control neutral state. In addition to the objective physiological markers of GI activity, subjective ratings of perceived emotions and visceral (i.e. gastric, respiratory and cardiac) sensations were recorded, as well as changes in heart rate (HR), heart rate variability (HRV) and spontaneous eyes blinks as non-gastric behavioral and autonomic markers of the emotional experience. We found that when participants observed fearful and disgusting video clips, they reported to perceive not only cardiac and respiratory sensations but also gastric sensations, such as nausea. Moreover, we found that there was a clear relation between the physiology of the stomach and the perceived emotions. Specifically, when disgusting video clips were displayed, the more acidic the pH, the more participants reported feelings of disgust and fear; the less acidic the pH, the more they reported happiness. Complementing the results found in the deep gastric realm, we found that disgusting stimuli induced a significant increase in HRV compared to the neutral scenarios, and together with fearful video clips a decrease in HR. Our findings suggest that gastric signals contribute to unique emotional states and that ingestible pills may open new avenues for exploring the deep-body physiology of emotions.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92861">The evolution of olfactory sensitivity, preferences, and behavioral responses in Mexican cavefish is influenced by fish personality</a></h4>

              
                Animals are adapted to their natural habitats and lifestyles. Their brains perceive the external world via their sensory systems, compute information together with that of internal states and autonomous activity, and generate appropriate behavioral outputs. However, how do these processes evolve across evolution? Here, focusing on the sense of olfaction, we have studied the evolution in olfactory sensitivity, preferences, and behavioral responses to six different food-related amino acid odors in the two eco-morphs of the fish <i>Astyanax mexicanus</i>. To this end, we have developed a high-throughput behavioral setup and pipeline of quantitative and qualitative behavior analysis, and we have tested 489 six-week-old <i>Astyanax</i> larvae. The blind, dark-adapted morphs of the species showed markedly distinct basal swimming patterns and behavioral responses to odors, higher olfactory sensitivity, and a strong preference for alanine, as compared to their river-dwelling eyed conspecifics. In addition, we discovered that fish have an individual ‘swimming personality’, and that this personality influences their capability to respond efficiently to odors and find the source. Importantly, the personality traits that favored significant responses to odors were different in surface fish and cavefish. Moreover, the responses displayed by second-generation cave × surface F2 hybrids suggested that olfactory-driven behavior and olfactory sensitivity is a quantitative genetic trait. Our findings show that olfactory processing has rapidly evolved in cavefish at several levels: detection threshold, odor preference, and foraging behavior strategy. Cavefish is therefore an outstanding model to understand the genetic, molecular, and neurophysiological basis of sensory specialization in response to environmental change.

                Large-scale microbiome studies are progressively utilizing multiomics designs, which include the collection of microbiome samples together with host genomics and metabolomics data. Despite the increasing number of data sources, there remains a bottleneck in understanding the relationships between different data modalities due to the limited number of statistical and computational methods for analyzing such data. Furthermore, little is known about the portability of general methods to the metagenomic setting and few specialized techniques have been developed. In this review, we summarize and implement some of the commonly used methods. We apply these methods to real data sets where shotgun metagenomic sequencing and metabolomics data are available for microbiome multiomics data integration analysis. We compare results across methods, highlight strengths and limitations of each, and discuss areas where statistical and computational innovation is needed.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/90600">Adult-born granule cells modulate CA2 network activity during retrieval of developmental memories of the mother</a></h4>

              
                Adult-born granule cells (abGCs) project to the CA2 region of the hippocampus, but it remains unknown how this circuit affects behavioral function. Here, we show that abGC input to the CA2 of adult mice is involved in the retrieval of remote developmental memories of the mother. Ablation of abGCs impaired the ability to discriminate between a caregiving mother and a novel mother, and this ability returned after abGCs were regenerated. Chemogenetic inhibition of projections from abGCs to the CA2 also temporarily prevented the retrieval of remote mother memories. These findings were observed when abGCs were inhibited at 4–6 weeks old, but not when they were inhibited at 10–12 weeks old. We also found that abGCs are necessary for differentiating features of CA2 network activity, including theta-gamma coupling and sharp wave ripples, in response to novel versus familiar social stimuli. Taken together, these findings suggest that abGCs are necessary for neuronal oscillations associated with discriminating between social stimuli, thus enabling retrieval of remote developmental memories of the mother by their adult offspring.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/88480">Evolutionary druggability for low-dimensional fitness landscapes toward new metrics for antimicrobial applications</a></h4>

              
                The term ‘druggability’ describes the molecular properties of drugs or targets in pharmacological interventions and is commonly used in work involving drug development for clinical applications. There are no current analogues for this notion that quantify the drug-target interaction with respect to a given target variant’s sensitivity across a breadth of drugs in a panel, or a given drug’s range of effectiveness across alleles of a target protein. Using data from low-dimensional empirical fitness landscapes composed of 16 β-lactamase alleles and 7 β-lactam drugs, we introduce two metrics that capture (i) the average susceptibility of an allelic variant of a drug target to any available drug in a given panel (‘<i>variant vulnerability’</i>), and (ii) the average applicability of a drug (or mixture) across allelic variants of a drug target (‘<i>drug applicability</i>’). Finally, we (iii) disentangle the quality and magnitude of interactions between loci in the drug target and the seven drug environments in terms of their mutation by mutation by environment (G x G x E) interactions, offering mechanistic insight into the variant variability and drug applicability metrics. Summarizing, we propose that our framework can be applied to other datasets and pathogen-drug systems to understand which pathogen variants in a clinical setting are the most concerning (low variant vulnerability), and which drugs in a panel are most likely to be effective in an infection defined by standing genetic variation in the pathogen drug target (high drug applicability).

                Copy number variation in large gene families is well characterized for plant resistance genes, but similar studies are rare in animals. The zebrafish (<i>Danio rerio</i>) has hundreds of NLR immune genes, making this species ideal for studying this phenomenon. By sequencing 93 zebrafish from multiple wild and laboratory populations we identified a total of 1,513 NLRs, many more than the previously known 400. Approximately half of those are present in all wild populations, but only 4% were found in 80% or more of the individual fish. Wild fish have up to two times as many NLRs per individual and up to four times as many NLRs per population than laboratory strains. In contrast to the massive variability of gene copies, nucleotide diversity in zebrafish NLR genes is very low: around half of the copies are monomorphic and the remaining ones have very few polymorphisms, likely a signature of purifying selection.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91452">Potassium-mediated bacterial chemotactic response</a></h4>

              
                Bacteria in biofilms secrete potassium ions to attract free swimming cells. However, the basis of chemotaxis to potassium remains poorly understood. Here, using a microfluidic device, we found that <i>Escherichia coli</i> can rapidly accumulate in regions of high potassium concentration on the order of millimoles. Using a bead assay, we measured the dynamic response of individual flagellar motors to stepwise changes in potassium concentration, finding that the response resulted from the chemotaxis signaling pathway. To characterize the chemotactic response to potassium, we measured the dose–response curve and adaptation kinetics via an Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay, finding that the chemotaxis pathway exhibited a sensitive response and fast adaptation to potassium. We further found that the two major chemoreceptors Tar and Tsr respond differently to potassium. Tar receptors exhibit a biphasic response, whereas Tsr receptors respond to potassium as an attractant. These different responses were consistent with the responses of the two receptors to intracellular pH changes. The sensitive response and fast adaptation allow bacteria to sense and localize small changes in potassium concentration. The differential responses of Tar and Tsr receptors to potassium suggest that cells at different growth stages respond differently to potassium and may have different requirements for potassium.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92189">Syntaxin 17 recruitment to mature autophagosomes is temporally regulated by PI4P accumulation</a></h4>

              
                During macroautophagy, cytoplasmic constituents are engulfed by autophagosomes. Lysosomes fuse with closed autophagosomes but not with unclosed intermediate structures. This is achieved in part by the late recruitment of the autophagosomal SNARE syntaxin 17 (STX17) to mature autophagosomes. However, how STX17 recognizes autophagosome maturation is not known. Here, we show that this temporally regulated recruitment of STX17 depends on the positively charged C-terminal region of STX17. Consistent with this finding, mature autophagosomes are more negatively charged compared with unclosed intermediate structures. This electrostatic maturation of autophagosomes is likely driven by the accumulation of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P) in the autophagosomal membrane. Accordingly, dephosphorylation of autophagosomal PI4P prevents the association of STX17 to autophagosomes. Furthermore, molecular dynamics simulations support PI4P-dependent membrane insertion of the transmembrane helices of STX17. Based on these findings, we propose a model in which STX17 recruitment to mature autophagosomes is temporally regulated by a PI4P-driven change in the surface charge of autophagosomes.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94561">Tracking the neurodevelopmental trajectory of beta band oscillations with optically pumped magnetometer-based magnetoencephalography</a></h4>

              
                Neural oscillations mediate the coordination of activity within and between brain networks, supporting cognition and behaviour. How these processes develop throughout childhood is not only an important neuroscientific question but could also shed light on the mechanisms underlying neurological and psychiatric disorders. However, measuring the neurodevelopmental trajectory of oscillations has been hampered by confounds from instrumentation. In this paper, we investigate the suitability of a disruptive new imaging platform – optically pumped magnetometer-based magnetoencephalography (OPM-MEG) – to study oscillations during brain development. We show how a unique 192-channel OPM-MEG device, which is adaptable to head size and robust to participant movement, can be used to collect high-fidelity electrophysiological data in individuals aged between 2 and 34 years. Data were collected during a somatosensory task, and we measured both stimulus-induced modulation of beta oscillations in sensory cortex, and whole-brain connectivity, showing that both modulate significantly with age. Moreover, we show that pan-spectral bursts of electrophysiological activity drive task-induced beta modulation, and that their probability of occurrence and spectral content change with age. Our results offer new insights into the developmental trajectory of beta oscillations and provide clear evidence that OPM-MEG is an ideal platform for studying electrophysiology in neurodevelopment.

">Comparative Analysis of Human-Chimpanzee Divergence in Brain Connectivity and its Genetic Underpinnings</a></h4>

              
                Chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) are humans' closest living evolutionary relatives, making them the most directly relevant comparison point for understanding human brain evolution. By zeroing in on the differences in brain connectivity between humans and chimpanzees, it can provide key insights into the specific evolutionary changes that occurred along the human lineage. However, conducting fair comparisons of brain connectivity between humans and chimpanzees remains challenging, as cross-species brain atlases established within the same framework are currently lacking. Without the availability of cross-species brain atlases, the region-wise connectivity patterns between humans and chimpanzees cannot be directly compared. To address this gap, we built the first Chimpanzee Brainnetome Atlas (ChimpBNA) by following the well-established connectivity-based parcellation framework. Leveraging this new resource, we found substantial divergence in connectivity patterns across most association cortices, notably in the lateral temporal and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex between the two species. Intriguingly, these patterns significantly deviate from the expected cortical expansion during brain evolution. Additionally, we identified regions displaying connectional asymmetries between species, likely resulting from evolutionary divergence. Genes associated with these divergent connectivities were found to be enriched in cell types crucial for cortical projection circuits and synapse formation. These genes exhibited more pronounced differences in expression patterns in regions with higher connectivity divergence, suggesting a potential foundation for brain connectivity evolution. Therefore, our study not only provides a fine-scale brain atlas of chimpanzees but also highlights the connectivity divergence between humans and chimpanzees in a more rigorous and comparative manner and suggests potential genetic underpinnings for the observed divergence in brain connectivity patterns between the two species. This can help us better understand the origins and development of uniquely human cognitive capabilities.

">APOE Christchurch enhances a disease-associated microglial response to plaque but suppresses response to tau pathology</a></h4>

              
                Background: Apolipoprotein E {epsilon}4 (APOE4) is the strongest genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD). A recent case report identified a rare variant in APOE, APOE3-R136S (Christchurch), proposed to confer resistance to autosomal dominant Alzheimer's Disease (AD). However, it remains unclear whether and how this variant exerts its protective effects. Methods: We introduced the R136S variant into mouse Apoe (ApoeCh) and investigated its effect on the development of AD-related pathology using the 5xFAD model of amyloidosis and the PS19 model of tauopathy. We used immunohistochemical and biochemical analysis along with single-cell spatial transcriptomics and proteomics to explore the impact of the ApoeCh variant on AD pathological development and the brain's response to plaques and tau. Results: In 5xFAD mice, ApoeCh enhances a Disease-Associated Microglia (DAM) phenotype in microglia surrounding plaques, and reduces plaque load, dystrophic neurites, and plasma neurofilament light chain. By contrast, in PS19 mice, ApoeCh suppresses the microglial and astrocytic responses to tau-laden neurons and does not reduce tau accumulation or phosphorylation, but partially rescues tau-induced synaptic and myelin loss. We compared how microglia responses differ between the two mouse models to elucidate the distinct DAM signatures induced by ApoeCh. We identified upregulation of antigen presentation-related genes in the DAM response in a PS19 compared to a 5xFAD background, suggesting a differential response to amyloid versus tau pathology that is modulated by the presence of ApoeCh. Conclusions: These findings highlight the ability of the ApoeCh variant to modulate microglial responses based on the type of pathology, enhancing DAM reactivity in amyloid models and dampening neuroinflammation to promote protection in tau models. This suggests that the Christchurch variant's protective effects likely involve multiple mechanisms, including changes in receptor binding and microglial programming.

                Neuropeptides play crucial roles in regulating context-dependent behaviors, but the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. We investigate the role of the neuropeptide SIFa and its receptor SIFaR in regulating two distinct mating duration behaviors in male Drosophila: Longer-Mating-Duration (LMD) and Shorter-Mating-Duration (SMD). We found that SIFaR expression in specific neurons is required for both LMD and SMD behaviors. Social context and sexual experience lead to synaptic reorganization between SIFa and SIFaR neurons, altering internal states of brain. We revealed that the SIFa-SIFaR/Crz-CrzR neuropeptide relay pathway is essential for generating distinct interval timing behaviors, with Crz neurons being responsive to the activity of SIFa neurons. Additionally, CrzR expression in non-neuronal cells is critical for regulating LMD and SMD behaviors. Our study provides insights into how neuropeptides and their receptors modulate context-dependent behaviors through synaptic plasticity and calcium signaling, with implications for understanding the neural circuitry underlying interval timing and neuropeptidergic system modulation of behavioral adaptations.

">Magnified interaural level differences enhance spatial release from masking in bilateral cochlear implant users</a></h4>

              
                Bilateral cochlear implant (BiCI) usage makes binaural benefits a possibility. However, access to interaural time difference (ITD) cues is limited, leaving users reliant on interaural level difference (ILD) cues for binaural tasks. But even ILD cues may not be as salient for BiCI users as for normal-hearing (NH) listeners. Thus, the benefits that BiCI listeners obtain when target and masker are spatially separated are limited. Here, we explore whether magnifying ILD cues improves masked speech intelligibility for BiCI listeners in a symmetrical-masker configuration, which controls for improvements to target-to-masker ratio (TMR) at the ear nearer the target from naturally occurring ILD cues. We magnified ILDs by estimating moment-tomoment ITDs in 1-octave-wide frequency bands and applying corresponding ILDs to the targetmasker mixtures at each ear in two experiments: with NH listeners using vocoded stimuli and with BiCI users. ILD magnification significantly improved intelligibility in both experiments. CI listeners showed no improvement with natural ILDs, even for the largest target-masker separation. Because ILD magnification is applied to the mixed signals at each ear, the strategy does not alter the TMR; therefore, the improvements to masked speech intelligibility observed are not due to improved TMR, but likely from improved perceptual separation of the competing sources.

">Mild traumatic brain injury is associated with increased thalamic subregion volume in the subacute period following injury</a></h4>

              
                Structural vulnerability of the thalamus remains under investigated in mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), and few studies have addressed its constituent nuclei using robust segmentation methods. This study aimed to investigate thalamic subnuclei volume in the subacute period following mTBI. Trauma control (TC) and mTBI patients aged 18 to 60 years old completed an MRI neuroimaging protocol including both high resolution structural (T1w) and diffusion weighted sequences at 6 to 11 weeks following injury (mean: 57 days; sd 11). Each thalamus was segmented into its constituent subnuclei, which were grouped into eight lateralised subregions. Volumes of the subregions were calculated. Neurite Orientation Dispersion and Density (NODDI) maps with parameters optimised for grey matter were computed for the same subregions. Group differences in subregion volumes and NODDI parameters were investigated using Bayesian linear modelling, with age, sex, and intracranial volume included as covariates. Comparisons of mTBI (n = 39) and TC (n = 28) groups revealed evidence of relatively increased grey matter volume in the mTBI group for the bilateral medial and right intralaminar subregions (BF10 > 3). Of the subregions which showed volume differences, there was no evidence for differences in NODDI metrics between groups. This study demonstrates that in the subacute period following mTBI, there is evidence of increased volume in specific thalamic subregions. Putative mechanisms underpinning the increased volume observed here are disordered remyelination, or myelin debris yet to be cleared.

">Evidence of Activity-Silent Working Memory in Prefrontal Cortex</a></h4>

              
                The lateral prefrontal cortex encodes working memory and motor preparation information, but the underlying neural mechanisms are debated. Recurrent neural network models relying on persistent neural activity have been challenged by the observation of periods of absent activity and information during memory maintenance, implying the existence of activity-silent mechanisms. To assess whether activity-silent mechanisms are needed for working memory maintenance we recorded neural activity in macaque prefrontal cortex during a delayed-saccade task. We replicated the observation of periods of absent activity and decreased information between bursts of gamma power, but we show that these results are consistent with models that rely exclusively on persistent activity. However, an assessment of the length of periods with absent selective activity across the population revealed that activity-silent mechanisms are indeed needed to maintain memory information, although this is only evidenced in a small fraction of trials.

">Deep homologies in chordate caudal central nervous systems</a></h4>

              
                Invertebrate chordates, such as the tunicate Ciona, can offer insight into the evolution of the chordate phylum. Anatomical features that are shared between invertebrate chordates and vertebrates may be taken as evidence of their presence in a common chordate ancestor. The central nervous systems of Ciona larvae and vertebrates share a similar anatomy despite the Ciona CNS having ~180 neurons. However, the depth of conservation between the Ciona CNS and those in vertebrates is not resolved. The Ciona caudal CNS, while appearing spinal cord-like, has hitherto been thought to lack motor neurons, bringing into question its homology with the vertebrate spinal cord. We show here that the Ciona larval caudal CNS does, in fact, have functional motor neurons along its length, pointing to the presence of a spinal cord-like structure at the base of the chordates. We extend our analysis of shared CNS anatomy further to explore the Ciona motor ganglion, which has been proposed to be a homolog of the vertebrate hindbrain, spinal cord, or both. We find that a cluster of neurons in the dorsal motor ganglion shares anatomical location, developmental pathway, neural circuit architecture, and gene expression with the vertebrate cerebellum. However, functionally, the Ciona cluster appears to have more in common with vertebrate cerebellum-like structures, insofar as it receives and processes direct sensory input. These findings are consistent with earlier speculation that the cerebellum evolved from a cerebellum-like structure, and suggest that the latter structure was present in the dorsal hindbrain of a common chordate ancestor.

">The FGFR inhibitor Rogaratinib reduces microglia reactivity and synaptic loss in TBI</a></h4>

              
                Background: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) induces an acute reactive state of microglia, which contribute to secondary injury processes through phagocytic activity and release of cytokines. Several receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) are activated in microglia upon TBI, and their blockade may reduce the acute inflammation and decrease the secondary loss of neurons; thus RTKs are potential therapeutic targets. We have previously demonstrated that several members of the FGFR family are transiently phosporylated upon TBI; the availability for drug repurposing of FGFR inhibitors makes worthwhile the elucidation of the role of FGFR in the acute phases of the response to TBI and the effect of FGFR inhibition. Methods: A closed, blunt, weight-drop mild TBI protocol was employed. The pan-FGFR inhibitor Rogaratinib was administered to mice 30min after the TBI and daily up to 7 days post injury. Phosphor-RTK Arrays and proteomic antibody arrays were used to determine target engagement and large-scale impact of the FGFR inhibitor. pFGFR1 and pFGFR3 immunostaining were employed for validation. As outcome parameters of the TBI injury immunostainings for NeuN, VGLUT1, VGAT at 7dpi were considered. Results: Inhibition of FGFR during TBI restricted phosphorylation of FGFR1, FGFR3, FGFR4 and ErbB4. Phosphorylation of FGFR1 and FGFR3 during TBI was traced back to Iba1+ microglia. Rogaratinib substantially dowregulated the proteomic signature of the neuroimmunological response to trauma, including the expression of CD40L, CXCR3, CCL4, CCR4, ILR6, MMP3 and OPG. Protracted Rogaratinib treatment exhibited a neuroprotective effect on neuronal density at 7dpi and limited the loss of excitatory (vGLUT+) synapses. Conclusion: The FGFR family is involved in the early induction of reactive microglia in TBI. FGFR inhibition selectively prevented FGFR phosphorylation in the microglia, dampened the overall neuroimmunological response and enhanced the preservation of neuronal and synaptic integrity. Thus, FGFR inhibitors display potential as microglial modulators in TBI.

	<p>Clinical cognitive advancement within the Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (AD) continuum is intimately connected with sustained accumulation of tau protein pathology. The biological brain age and its gap show great potential for pathological risk and disease severity. In the present study, we applied multivariable linear support vector regression to train a normative brain age prediction model using tau brain images. We further assessed the predicted biological brain age and its gap for patients within the AD continuum. In the AD continuum, evaluated pathologic tau binding was found in the inferior temporal, parietal-temporal junction, precuneus/posterior cingulate, dorsal frontal, occipital, and inferior-medial temporal cortices. The biological brain age gaps of patients within the AD continuum were notably higher than those of the normal controls (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001). Significant positive correlations were observed between the brain age gap and global tau protein accumulation levels for mild cognitive impairment (r = 0.726, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), AD (r = 0.845, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), and AD continuum (r = 0.797, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). The pathologic tau-based age gap was significantly linked to neuropsychological scores. The proposed pathologic tau-based biological brain age model could track the tau protein accumulation trajectory of cognitive impairment and further provide a comprehensive quantification index for the tau accumulation risk.</p>

	<p>Tobacco and alcohol have been identified as health risk behaviors associated with significant unfavorable health consequences, ranking within the list of the top ten causes of mortality and disability-adjusted life years (DALY). The combustion of tobacco leads to the formation of acrylamide (ACR), which is well known for its neurotoxic effects. Similarly, alcohol consumption has also been widely recognized for its neurotoxic effects. Both substances can affect neurons and neuroglia cells through various pathways. This study sought to examine the impacts of co-administration of ACR and intermittent-access ethanol (IAE) consumption over a period of one month. The experimental group received 20 mg/kg of ACR, administered orally, along with IAE of 20% ethanol sessions lasting 24 h, three times per week. The cognitive outcomes were assessed utilizing the elevated plus maze (EPM), which was employed as a means of assessing the capability to learn and remember, the novel object recognition (NOR) test, which was employed to assess recognition memory, and the Y-maze, which was used to explore a new environment and navigate. Additionally, ELISA assays were performed to examine underlying mechanisms, including markers associated with inflammation (NF-&amp;amp;kappa;B, PGE2, and TNF-&amp;amp;alpha;), apoptosis (Bcl2, Bax, and Caspase-3), and oxidative stress (MDA, catalase, and GSH). These markers were assessed in the brain homogenate as part of the investigation. Furthermore, a histopathological study was conducted. The findings indicated that NF-&amp;amp;kappa;B levels increased significantly in the combination of ACR and IAE groups (ACR + IAE) compared to either the ACR-alone or IAE-alone groups. However, parallel changes were observed in TNF-&amp;amp;alpha;, PGE2, Bax, Bcl-2, Caspase-3, GSH, and CAT levels when comparing the ACR + IAE group to the ACR-alone group. Comparable alterations were noted between the ACR + IAE treatment and IAE-alone groups in TNF-&amp;amp;alpha;, Bcl-2, MDA, GSH, and CAT levels. Moreover, the histopathological analysis revealed significant changes between the ACR + IAE and the ACR- or IAE-alone groups. Regarding memory parameters assessed using tests including EPM, NOR, and Y-maze, considerable changes were observed across all treatment groups as opposed to the control. Surprisingly, there were no notable differences in the NOR and Y-maze tasks between the alone and combination treatment. Further study is necessary to explore the long-term alteration of co-administering ACR and IAE on behavior, memory, and neurotoxicity-related mechanisms, in order to elucidate their combined effects more clearly.</p>

                Background Empyema (the presence of pus in the pleural space) is a severe complication of community-acquired pneumonia and significant cause of morbidity, but, fortunately, not mortality in children. Between 0.6 and 2% of pneumonias are complicated by empyema and the three main pathogens involved are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus and group A Streptococcus 1,2,3,4. Optimal management in children, especially the choice of antibiotics, method of administration and duration of therapy, pleural dranage or surgery, are still a matter of debate and currently, lack of strong specific recommendations. This paper displays the study protocol for a scoping review that aims to summarize the available literature on the microbiological epidemiology, the medical and surgical treatment options, and the outcomes of pleural empyema in pediatric population. Methods Comprehensive research combining the terms pediatric (children aged 0 to 18 years) and pleural empyema will be performed on PubMed and SCOPUS to identify all eligible studies. At first, two reviewers will screen the abstract and then their full text to determine the articles that meet the inclusion criteria. This work will be carried out independently, everyone on a different Excel spreadsheet and each researcher will be blinded to the decision of the other researcher. When the process is completed, in case of discordance, any disagreement will be identified and resolved through discussion or with help of a third author. Dissemination The findings of this review will be published in a peer-reviewed journal.

                Background Numerous tools are available for evaluation of upper limb (UL) functions among stroke survivors. Despite the excellent psychometric properties, many require considerable amount of time, are resource-intensive, and often impractical for bedside evaluation. Objectives To develop and concurrently validate a simple, resource-efficient, and time-efficient bedside tool for evaluating UL function in stroke survivors. Methods Relevant literature review was carried out to conceptualize and define the theoretical framework of day-to-day UL movement tasks. Subsequently, an item pool of 18 UL movements was developed. A mini-Delphi method was employed to verify content validity. During the iterative rounds, 18-items were revised and refined to a 12-items scale. The final bedside upper limb evaluation tool (BUFET) scale underwent concurrent validation by correlating the scores with Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT) scores using Spearman’s correlation coefficient. Internal consistency was evaluated through Cronbach’s alpha. Results Concurrent validity and internal consistency of the scale were supported by a high correlation coefficient (r = 0.937; p<0.001) with WMFT and high Cronbach’s alpha (0.948). Conclusions Newly developed BUFET was found to be a valid and reliable bedside tool in the evaluation of upper limb functions and can be administered in a resource and time-efficient manner.

                <p>Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), the most common subtype of hemorrhagic stroke, leads to cognitive impairment and imposes significant psychological burdens on patients. Hippocampal neurogenesis has been shown to play an essential role in cognitive function. Our previous study has shown that tetrahydrofolate (THF) promotes the proliferation of neural stem cells (NSCs). However, the effect of THF on cognition after ICH and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we demonstrated that administration of THF could restore cognition after ICH. Using Nestin-GFP mice, we further revealed that THF enhanced the proliferation of hippocampal NSCs and neurogenesis after ICH. Mechanistically, we found that THF could prevent ICH-induced elevated level of PTEN and decreased expressions of phosphorylated AKT and mTOR. Furthermore, conditional deletion of PTEN in NSCs of the hippocampus attenuated the inhibitory effect of ICH on the proliferation of NSCs and abnormal neurogenesis. Taken together, these results provide molecular insights into ICH-induced cognitive impairment and suggest translational clinical therapeutic strategy for hemorrhagic stroke.</p>

                <p>The Cre-lox system is an indispensable tool in neuroscience research for targeting gene deletions to specific cellular populations. Here we assess the utility of several transgenic <I>Cre</I> lines, along with a viral approach, for targeting cerebellar Purkinje cells (PCs) in mice. Using a combination of a fluorescent reporter line (<I>Ai14</I>) to indicate <I>Cre</I>-mediated recombination and a floxed Dystroglycan line (<I>Dag1<sup>flox</sup></I>), we show that reporter expression does not always align precisely with loss of protein. The commonly used <I>Pcp2<sup>Cre</sup></I> line exhibits a gradual mosaic pattern of <I>Cre</I> recombination in PCs from Postnatal Day 7 (P7) to P14, while loss of Dag1 protein is not complete until P30. <I>Ptf1a<sup>Cre</sup></I> drives recombination in precursor cells that give rise to GABAergic neurons in the embryonic cerebellum, including PCs and molecular layer interneurons. However, due to its transient expression in precursors, <I>Ptf1a<sup>Cre</sup></I> results in stochastic loss of Dag1 protein in these neurons. <I>Nestin<sup>Cre</sup></I>, which is often described as a "pan-neuronal" <I>Cre</I> line for the central nervous system, does not drive <I>Cre</I>-mediated recombination in PCs. We identify a <I>Calb1<sup>Cre</sup></I> line that drives efficient and complete recombination in embryonic PCs, resulting in loss of Dag1 protein before the period of synaptogenesis. <I>AAV8</I>-mediated delivery of <I>Cre</I> at P0 results in gradual transduction of PCs during the second postnatal week, with loss of Dag1 protein not reaching appreciable levels until P35. These results characterize several tools for targeting conditional deletions in cerebellar PCs at different developmental stages and illustrate the importance of validating the loss of protein following recombination.</p>

                Background The quality of COVID-19 preprints should be considered with great care, as their contents can influence public policy. Surprisingly little has been done to calibrate the public’s evaluation of preprints and their contents. The PRECHECK project aimed to generate a tool to teach and guide scientifically literate non-experts to critically evaluate preprints, on COVID-19 and beyond. Methods To create a checklist, we applied a four-step procedure consisting of an initial internal review, an external review by a pool of experts (methodologists, meta-researchers/experts on preprints, journal editors, and science journalists), a final internal review, and a Preliminary implementation stage. For the external review step, experts rated the relevance of each element of the checklist on five-point Likert scales, and provided written feedback. After each internal review round, we applied the checklist on a small set of high-quality preprints from an online list of milestone research works on COVID-19 and low-quality preprints, which were eventually retracted, to verify whether the checklist can discriminate between the two categories. Results At the external review step, 26 of the 54 contacted experts responded. The final checklist contained four elements (Research question, study type, transparency and integrity, and limitations), with ‘superficial’ and ‘deep’ evaluation levels. When using both levels, the checklist was effective at discriminating a small set of high- and low-quality preprints. Its usability for assessment and discussion of preprints was confirmed in workshops with Bachelors students in Psychology and Medicine, and science journalists. Conclusions We created a simple, easy-to-use tool for helping scientifically literate non-experts navigate preprints with a critical mind and facilitate discussions within, for example, a beginner-level lecture on research methods. We believe that our checklist has potential to help guide decisions about the quality of preprints on COVID-19 in our target audience and that this extends beyond COVID-19.

                The subtypes of breast cancer exhibit diverse histology, molecular features, therapeutic response, aggressiveness, and patient outcomes. Multi-omics high-throughput technologies, which are widely used in cancer research, generated waste amounts of multimodal omic datasets calling for new approaches of integrated analyses to uncover patterns of transcriptomic, genomic, and epigenetic changes in breast cancer subtypes and connect them to disease clinical characteristics. Here, we applied multi-layer self-organizing map (ml-SOM) algorithms to PAM50-classified TCGA breast cancer samples to disentangle the diversity of the effects of gene expression, methylation, copy number, and somatic single nucleotide variation in the disease subtypes. Furthermore, we studied the association of perturbed gene modules with survival, prognosis, and other clinical characteristics. Our findings highlight the power of multi-omic analyses to offer a better understanding of the molecular diversity of breast cancer subtypes compared to single-omic analyses. Moreover, they highlight the complex subtype-characteristic associations between gene expression and epigenetic/genomic factors and their implications for survival and clinical outcomes.

                Periodontitis, a chronic inflammatory condition affecting the periodontal tissues and underlying bone, is now acknowledged as more than just a localized oral disease. With a global prevalence ranging from 20% to 50%, the implications of periodontitis extend beyond oral health, presenting significant concerns for public health. Research has demonstrated a strong association between periodontitis and cardiovascular disease, with shared risk factors encompassing age, smoking, socioeconomic status, and metabolic syndrome. Understanding the intricate relationship between periodontal disease and cardiovascular diseases, especially the development of arrhythmias like atrial fibrillation, is crucial. A comprehensive literature search using PubMed was conducted, employing keywords such as periodontitis, cardiovascular disease, cardiac arrhythmia, atrial fibrillation, and related terms. No exclusion criteria were used. This article reviews the current literature on the association between periodontitis and cardiovascular diseases, including atrial fibrillation. Atrial fibrillation, the most common cardiac arrhythmia, is influenced by various risk factors including alcohol consumption, advanced age, underlying heart and lung diseases, with poor oral hygiene emerging as a notable contributing factor. The direct invasion of endothelial cells by periodontal pathogens, the indirect pathway where periodontal disease triggers a systemic inflammatory response, and a shared genetic basis are three theories that explain this link. Patients with periodontal disease face an elevated risk of major cardiovascular events, especially arrhythmias, and recognizing this association is essential for healthcare practitioners to provide comprehensive care to patients with cardiac conditions.

                Background Enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC) is associated with acute and chronic diarrhea worldwide. EAEC is thought to form thick biofilms on the intestinal mucosa. Epidemiological data suggest that SepA, a serine protease autotransporter of Enterobacteriaceae (SPATE), is important for EAEC disease. The genes for SepA, and some proteins that are important for EAEC biofilm formation and aggregative adherence, are encoded by the pAA plasmid. Methods We deleted sepA 49-4043 from six EAEC clinical isolates and inserted a chloramphenicol resistance gene (cat) in place of the sepA coding sequence. In vitro biofilm formation was assessed after growth in 96-well plates. Complementation studies were conducted with genetic and protein-based techniques. We moved the pAA plasmid from EAEC strains into a commensal E. coli. Finally, we sequenced the pAA of several strains. Results All of the wild-type EAEC strains secreted similar amounts of SepA as assessed by Western blot analysis. Four of the six mutant EAEC strains exhibited increased biofilm staining when sepA was deleted. Additionally, we found that introduction of pAAΔsepA K261 into a nalidixic acid resistant commensal E. coli strain, (HSNalR) resulted in significantly increased biofilm staining relative to HSNalR (pAAK261). Therefore, pAAΔsepA K261 alone was sufficient to confer the elevated biofilm phenotype onto HSNalR. However, introduction of sepA via a plasmid or on the pAA did not restore biofilm staining to wild-type levels in the ΔsepA mutant strains that showed elevated biofilm staining. Furthermore, the addition of exogenous SepA to the biofilm in vitro did not reduce biofilm staining. Conclusions Taken together, our results suggest that deletion of sepA causes elevated biofilm formation in some EAEC strains, but that the increased biofilm staining is not directly due to the loss of SepA.

                Seed priming enhances germination and growth, which are important determinants of crop yield. This study was carried out to assess the effect of priming duration and metabolite concentration on the priming of five (5) different crops, using the metabolites of five (5) bacterial isolates. The crop seeds were treated in the cold-extracted metabolites of the five isolates at five (5) different priming durations (1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 h) and then in five metabolite concentrations (200, 400, 600, 800, and 1000 mg/L) of the five extracted metabolites at the optimal priming duration determined in the first experiment. Characterization of the cold-extracted metabolites was also carried out using gas-chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Results revealed that priming cowpea and soybean for longer durations (< 3 h) could hinder their growth and development. Lower concentrations were observed to be optimal for cowpea and soybean, but for sesame and okra, there was no detectable pattern with metabolite concentration. The GC-MS revealed the presence of some molecules (e.g. hexadecanoic acid) that have shown plant growth promotion potential in other studies. This study showed that seeds with large endosperm, such as, cowpea and soybean, are more prone to the deleterious effects of treatment for longer durations. Further experiments should be carried out to isolate and purify the bioactive moieties for further studies and onward application.

                Background Perioperative thoracic epidural analgesia (TEA) is commonly used in hepatectomy patients since it is opioid-sparing and reduces cardiorespiratory complications. However, TEA has a high failure rate and is associated with potentially devastating complications (particularly spinal haematoma) and the risk is increased with hepatectomy. Thus, some centres favour systemic opioid-based modalities which, in turn, are associated with inferior analgesia and well-known risks/side-effects. Hence, alternative analgesic methods are desirable. Paravertebral block (PVB) has been used in liver resection with advantages including haemodynamic stability, low failure rates, and low risk of spinal haematoma. Our purpose is to conduct a blinded, pilot RCT with hepatectomy patients randomised to receive TEA or PVB for perioperative analgesia. We hypothesise that opioid consumption, time to first analgesic request, and pain scores will be comparable between groups, but PVB patients will require fewer perioperative vasopressors/blood products, and have fewer adverse events and a shorter hospital stay. Methods With ethics approval, this non-inferiority, pilot RCT with a convenience sample of 50 hepatectomy patients will examine whether PVB imparts analgesia comparable to TEA but with fewer adverse effects. Primary outcomes are surrogates of analgesia for 72 h postoperatively (i.e., opioid consumption, time to first analgesic request and pain scores at rest and with coughing); Secondary outcomes are blood products/fluids administered; side effects/complications until 72 h postoperatively; length of hospital stay. The results will be used to plan a large multicentre trial comparing TEA vs. PVB in hepatectomy patients. This study has a high potential to positively impact the quality/safety of patient care.

Multi-factor screenings are commonly used in diverse applications in medicine and bioengineering, including optimizing combination drug treatments and microbiome engineering. Despite the advances in high-throughput technologies, large-scale experiments typically remain prohibitively expensive. Here we introduce a machine learning platform, structure-augmented regression (SAR), that exploits the intrinsic structure of each biological system to learn a high-accuracy model with minimal data requirement. Under different environmental perturbations, each biological system exhibits a unique, structured phenotypic response. This structure can be learned based on limited data and once learned, can constrain subsequent quantitative predictions. We demonstrate that SAR requires significantly fewer data comparing to other existing machine-learning methods to achieve a high prediction accuracy, first on simulated data, then on experimental data of various systems and input dimensions. We then show how a learned structure can guide effective design of new experiments. Our approach has implications for predictive control of biological systems and an integration of machine learning prediction and experimental design.

Striking progress has been made in understanding cognition by analyzing how the brain is engaged in different modes of information processing. For instance, so-called <i>synergistic</i> information (information encoded by a set of neurons but not by any subset) plays a key role in areas of the human brain linked with complex cognition. However, two questions remain unanswered: (a) how and why a cognitive system can become highly synergistic; and (b) how informational states map onto artificial neural networks in various learning modes. Here we employ an information-decomposition framework to investigate neural networks performing cognitive tasks. Our results show that synergy increases as networks learn multiple diverse tasks, and that in tasks requiring integration of multiple sources, performance critically relies on synergistic neurons. Overall, our results suggest that synergy is used to combine information from multiple modalities—and more generally for flexible and efficient learning. These findings reveal new ways of investigating how and why learning systems employ specific information-processing strategies, and support the principle that the capacity for general-purpose learning critically relies on the system’s information dynamics.

Neuroscientists studying the neural correlates of mouse behavior often lack access to the brain-wide activity patterns elicited during a specific task of interest. Fortunately, large-scale imaging is becoming increasingly accessible thanks to modalities such as Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging and functional ultrasound (fUS). However, these and other techniques often involve challenging cranial window procedures and are difficult to combine with other neuroscience tools. We address this need with an open-source 3D-printable cranial implant—the COMBO (ChrOnic Multimodal imaging and Behavioral Observation) window. The COMBO window enables chronic imaging of large portions of the brain in head-fixed mice while preserving orofacial movements. We validate the COMBO window stability using both brain-wide fUS and multisite two-photon imaging. Moreover, we demonstrate how the COMBO window facilitates the combination of optogenetics, fUS, and electrophysiology in the same animals to study the effects of circuit perturbations at both the brain-wide and single-neuron level. Overall, the COMBO window provides a versatile solution for performing multimodal brain recordings in head-fixed mice.

Deuterostomes are a monophyletic group of animals that includes Hemichordata, Echinodermata (together called Ambulacraria), and Chordata. The diversity of deuterostome body plans has made it challenging to reconstruct their ancestral condition and to decipher the genetic changes that drove the diversification of deuterostome lineages. Here, we generate chromosome-level genome assemblies of 2 hemichordate species, <i>Ptychodera flava</i> and <i>Schizocardium californicum</i>, and use comparative genomic approaches to infer the chromosomal architecture of the deuterostome common ancestor and delineate lineage-specific chromosomal modifications. We show that hemichordate chromosomes (1<i>N</i> = 23) exhibit remarkable chromosome-scale macrosynteny when compared to other deuterostomes and can be derived from 24 deuterostome ancestral linkage groups (ALGs). These deuterostome ALGs in turn match previously inferred bilaterian ALGs, consistent with a relatively short transition from the last common bilaterian ancestor to the origin of deuterostomes. Based on this deuterostome ALG complement, we deduced chromosomal rearrangement events that occurred in different lineages. For example, a fusion-with-mixing event produced an Ambulacraria-specific ALG that subsequently split into 2 chromosomes in extant hemichordates, while this homologous ALG further fused with another chromosome in sea urchins. Orthologous genes distributed in these rearranged chromosomes are enriched for functions in various developmental processes. We found that the deeply conserved Hox clusters are located in highly rearranged chromosomes and that maintenance of the clusters are likely due to lower densities of transposable elements within the clusters. We also provide evidence that the deuterostome-specific pharyngeal gene cluster was established via the combination of 3 pre-assembled microsyntenic blocks. We suggest that since chromosomal rearrangement events and formation of new gene clusters may change the regulatory controls of developmental genes, these events may have contributed to the evolution of diverse body plans among deuterostomes.

                Background Neonatal healthcare-associated infection (HAI) globally is the leading preventable cause of neonatal mortality. Neonatal mortality in India is also very high. Considering that HAIs can be prevented globally, there are disparities in resources; the current study aimed at developing locally feasible and effective prevention bundles for neonatal HAIs. Methods A mixed-method study was conducted at one tertiary care teaching hospital's level IV Neonatal Intensive Care Unit. The study explores the causes of neonatal HAIs, current processes, benchmark practices, gaps in current practices with HAIs, root-cause analysis and system process mapping, and failure mode effect analysis. Observations, interviews, brainstorming activities, and a survey were conducted. Written and audio-video recorded prevention bundle was developed and implemented using a quasi-experimental study design. Results Process standardisation, healthcare worker training, hand hygiene practices, nursing care process and vascular access process were identified as key improvement areas to prevent neonatal HAIs. Out of eighteen identified processes, three processes were standardised. All the healthcare providers were trained at three-time intervals of three months each. After implementing the prevention bundle, there was a significant decline in the rate of HAIs, reducing it from 9.6 to 7.0 per 100 admissions >48 hours. The bacteraemia rate fell from 5.2 per 1000 patient days to 2.6 per 1000 patient days and was statistically significant on a two-tailed student t-test with 95% CI with p-value=0.00073. Conclusions Our developed prevention bundle for neonatal HAIs was significantly effective and reproducible for healthcare workers' training and development. Considering variations in global infection control practices and resources constraint, it is effective to develop a local prevention bundle for neonatal HAIs.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/90972">Glutamatergic supramammillary nucleus neurons respond to threatening stressors and promote active coping</a></h4>

              
                Threat-response neural circuits are conserved across species and play roles in normal behavior and psychiatric diseases. Maladaptive changes in these neural circuits contribute to stress, mood, and anxiety disorders. Active coping in response to stressors is a psychosocial factor associated with resilience against stress-induced mood and anxiety disorders. The neural circuitry underlying active coping is poorly understood, but the functioning of these circuits could be key for overcoming anxiety and related disorders. The supramammillary nucleus (SuM) has been suggested to be engaged by threat. SuM has many projections and a poorly understood diversity of neural populations. In studies using mice, we identified a unique population of glutamatergic SuM neurons (SuM<sup>VGLUT2+</sup>::POA) based on projection to the preoptic area of the hypothalamus (POA) and found SuM<sup>VGLUT2+</sup>::POA neurons have extensive arborizations. SuM<sup>VGLUT2+</sup>::POA neurons project to brain areas that mediate features of the stress and threat responses including the paraventricular nucleus thalamus (PVT), periaqueductal gray (PAG), and habenula (Hb). Thus, SuM<sup>VGLUT2+</sup>::POA neurons are positioned as a hub, connecting to areas implicated in regulating stress responses. Here we report SuM<sup>VGLUT2+</sup>::POA neurons are recruited by diverse threatening stressors, and recruitment correlated with active coping behaviors. We found that selective photoactivation of the SuM<sup>VGLUT2+</sup>::POA population drove aversion but not anxiety like behaviors. Activation of SuM<sup>VGLUT2+</sup>::POA neurons in the absence of acute stressors evoked active coping like behaviors and drove instrumental behavior. Also, activation of SuM<sup>VGLUT2+</sup>::POA neurons was sufficient to convert passive coping strategies to active behaviors during acute stress. In contrast, we found activation of GABAergic (VGAT+) SuM neurons (SuM<sup>VGAT+</sup>) neurons did not alter drive aversion or active coping, but termination of photostimulation was followed by increased mobility in the forced swim test. These findings establish a new node in stress response circuitry that has projections to many brain areas and evokes flexible active coping behaviors.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91924">Agent-based model demonstrates the impact of nonlinear, complex interactions between cytokines on muscle regeneration</a></h4>

              
                Muscle regeneration is a complex process due to dynamic and multiscale biochemical and cellular interactions, making it difficult to identify microenvironmental conditions that are beneficial to muscle recovery from injury using experimental approaches alone. To understand the degree to which individual cellular behaviors impact endogenous mechanisms of muscle recovery, we developed an agent-based model (ABM) using the Cellular-Potts framework to simulate the dynamic microenvironment of a cross-section of murine skeletal muscle tissue. We referenced more than 100 published studies to define over 100 parameters and rules that dictate the behavior of muscle fibers, satellite stem cells (SSCs), fibroblasts, neutrophils, macrophages, microvessels, and lymphatic vessels, as well as their interactions with each other and the microenvironment. We utilized parameter density estimation to calibrate the model to temporal biological datasets describing cross-sectional area (CSA) recovery, SSC, and fibroblast cell counts at multiple timepoints following injury. The calibrated model was validated by comparison of other model outputs (macrophage, neutrophil, and capillaries counts) to experimental observations. Predictions for eight model perturbations that varied cell or cytokine input conditions were compared to published experimental studies to validate model predictive capabilities. We used Latin hypercube sampling and partial rank correlation coefficient to identify in silico perturbations of cytokine diffusion coefficients and decay rates to enhance CSA recovery. This analysis suggests that combined alterations of specific cytokine decay and diffusion parameters result in greater fibroblast and SSC proliferation compared to individual perturbations with a 13% increase in CSA recovery compared to unaltered regeneration at 28 days. These results enable guided development of therapeutic strategies that similarly alter muscle physiology (i.e. converting extracellular matrix [ECM]-bound cytokines into freely diffusible forms as studied in cancer therapeutics or delivery of exogenous cytokines) during regeneration to enhance muscle recovery after injury.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/90497">Physiological roles of endocytosis and presynaptic scaffold in vesicle replenishment at fast and slow central synapses</a></h4>

              
                After exocytosis, release sites are cleared of vesicular residues to replenish with transmitter-filled vesicles. Endocytic and scaffold proteins are thought to underlie this site-clearance mechanism. However, the physiological significance of this mechanism at diverse mammalian central synapses remains unknown. Here, we tested this in a physiologically optimized condition using action potential evoked EPSCs at fast calyx synapse and relatively slow hippocampal CA1 synapse, in post-hearing mice brain slices at 37°C and in 1.3 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]. Pharmacological block of endocytosis enhanced synaptic depression at the calyx synapse, whereas it attenuated synaptic facilitation at the hippocampal synapse. Block of scaffold protein activity likewise enhanced synaptic depression at the calyx but had no effect at the hippocampal synapse. At the fast calyx synapse, block of endocytosis or scaffold protein activity significantly enhanced synaptic depression as early as 10 ms after the stimulation onset. Unlike previous reports, neither endocytic blockers nor scaffold protein inhibitors prolonged the recovery from short-term depression. We conclude that the release-site clearance by endocytosis can be a universal phenomenon supporting vesicle replenishment at both fast and slow synapses, whereas the presynaptic scaffold mechanism likely plays a specialized role in vesicle replenishment predominantly at fast synapses.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91288">Near-perfect precise on-target editing of human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells</a></h4>

              
                Precision gene editing in primary hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) would facilitate both curative treatments for monogenic disorders as well as disease modelling. Precise efficiencies even with the CRISPR/Cas system, however, remain limited. Through an optimization of guide RNA delivery, donor design, and additives, we have now obtained mean precise editing efficiencies &gt;90% on primary cord blood HSCPs with minimal toxicity and without observed off-target editing. The main protocol modifications needed to achieve such high efficiencies were the addition of the DNA-PK inhibitor AZD7648, and the inclusion of spacer-breaking silent mutations in the donor in addition to mutations disrupting the PAM sequence. Critically, editing was even across the progenitor hierarchy, did not substantially distort the hierarchy or affect lineage outputs in colony-forming cell assays or the frequency of high self-renewal potential long-term culture initiating cells. As modelling of many diseases requires heterozygosity, we also demonstrated that the overall editing and zygosity can be tuned by adding in defined mixtures of mutant and wild-type donors. With these optimizations, editing at near-perfect efficiency can now be accomplished directly in human HSPCs. This will open new avenues in both therapeutic strategies and disease modelling.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/89017">DUX4 is a common driver of immune evasion and immunotherapy failure in metastatic cancers</a></h4>

              
                Cancer immune evasion contributes to checkpoint immunotherapy failure in many patients with metastatic cancers. The embryonic transcription factor DUX4 was recently characterized as a suppressor of interferon-γ signaling and antigen presentation that is aberrantly expressed in a small subset of primary tumors. Here, we report that <i>DUX4</i> expression is a common feature of metastatic tumors, with ~10–50% of advanced bladder, breast, kidney, prostate, and skin cancers expressing <i>DUX4. DUX4</i> expression is significantly associated with immune cell exclusion and decreased objective response to PD-L1 blockade in a large cohort of urothelial carcinoma patients. <i>DUX4</i> expression is a significant predictor of survival even after accounting for tumor mutational burden and other molecular and clinical features in this cohort, with <i>DUX4</i> expression associated with a median reduction in survival of over 1 year. Our data motivate future attempts to develop DUX4 as a biomarker and therapeutic target for checkpoint immunotherapy resistance.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93686">Structures of wild-type and a constitutively closed mutant of connexin26 shed light on channel regulation by CO2</a></h4>

              
                Connexins allow intercellular communication by forming gap junction channels (GJCs) between juxtaposed cells. Connexin26 (Cx26) can be regulated directly by CO<sub>2</sub>. This is proposed to be mediated through carbamylation of K125. We show that mutating K125 to glutamate, mimicking the negative charge of carbamylation, causes Cx26 GJCs to be constitutively closed. Through cryo-EM we observe that the K125E mutation pushes a conformational equilibrium towards the channel having a constricted pore entrance, similar to effects seen on raising the partial pressure of CO<sub>2</sub>. In previous structures of connexins, the cytoplasmic loop, important in regulation and where K125 is located, is disordered. Through further cryo-EM studies we trap distinct states of Cx26 and observe density for the cytoplasmic loop. The interplay between the position of this loop, the conformations of the transmembrane helices and the position of the N-terminal helix, which controls the aperture to the pore, provides a mechanism for regulation.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92909">The archerfish uses motor adaptation in shooting to correct for changing physical conditions</a></h4>

              
                The archerfish is unique in its ability to hunt by shooting a jet of water from its mouth that hits insects situated above the water’s surface. To aim accurately, the fish needs to overcome physical factors including changes in light refraction at the air-water interface. Nevertheless, archerfish can still hit the target with a high success rate under changing conditions. One possible explanation for this extraordinary ability is that it is learned by trial and error through a motor adaptation process. We tested this possibility by characterizing the ability of the archerfish to adapt to perturbations in the environment to make appropriate adjustments to its shots. We introduced a perturbing airflow above the water tank of the archerfish trained to shoot at a target. For each trial shot, we measured the error, i.e., the distance between the center of the target and the center of the water jet produced by the fish. Immediately after the airflow perturbation, there was an increase in shot error. Then, over the course of several trials, the error was reduced and eventually plateaued. After the removal of the perturbation, there was an aftereffect, where the error was in the opposite direction but washed out after several trials. These results indicate that archerfish can adapt to the airflow perturbation. Testing the fish with two opposite airflow directions indicated that adaptation took place within an egocentric frame of reference. These results thus suggest that the archerfish is capable of motor adaptation, as indicated by data showing that the fish produced motor commands that anticipated the perturbation.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/87434">Styxl2 regulates de novo sarcomere assembly by binding to non-muscle myosin IIs and promoting their degradation</a></h4>

              
                Styxl2, a poorly characterized pseudophosphatase, was identified as a transcriptional target of the Jak1-Stat1 pathway during myoblast differentiation in culture. Styxl2 is specifically expressed in vertebrate striated muscles. By gene knockdown in zebrafish or genetic knockout in mice, we found that Styxl2 plays an essential role in maintaining sarcomere integrity in developing muscles. To further reveal the functions of Styxl2 in adult muscles, we generated two inducible knockout mouse models: one with <i>Styxl2</i> being deleted in mature myofibers to assess its role in sarcomere maintenance, and the other in adult muscle satellite cells (MuSCs) to assess its role in de novo sarcomere assembly. We find that Styxl2 is not required for sarcomere maintenance but functions in de novo sarcomere assembly during injury-induced muscle regeneration. Mechanistically, Styxl2 interacts with non-muscle myosin IIs, enhances their ubiquitination, and targets them for autophagy-dependent degradation. Without Styxl2, the degradation of non-muscle myosin IIs is delayed, which leads to defective sarcomere assembly and force generation. Thus, Styxl2 promotes de novo sarcomere assembly by interacting with non-muscle myosin IIs and facilitating their autophagic degradation.

">Time-division multiplexing (TDM) sequence removes bias in T2 estimation and relaxation-diffusion measurements</a></h4>

              
                Purpose: To compare the performance of multi-echo (ME) and time-division multiplexing (TDM) sequences for accelerated relaxation-diffusion MRI (rdMRI) acquisition and to examine their reliability in estimating accurate rdMRI microstructure measures. Method: The ME, TDM, and the reference single-echo (SE) sequences with six echo times (TE) were implemented using Pulseq with single-band (SB-) and multi-band 2 (MB2-) acceleration factors. On a diffusion phantom, the image intensities of the three sequences were compared, and the differences were quantified using the normalized root mean squared error (NRMSE). For the in-vivo brain scan, besides the image intensity comparison and T2-estimates, different methods were used to assess sequence-related effects on microstructure estimation, including the relaxation diffusion imaging moment (REDIM) and the maximum-entropy relaxation diffusion distribution (MaxEnt-RDD). Results: TDM performance was similar to the gold standard SE acquisition, whereas ME showed greater biases (3-4X larger NRMSEs for phantom, 2X for in-vivo). T2 values obtained from TDM closely matched SE, whereas ME sequences underestimated the T2 relaxation time. TDM provided similar diffusion and relaxation parameters as SE using REDIM, whereas SB-ME exhibited a 60% larger bias in the <R2> map and on average 3.5X larger bias in the covariance between relaxation-diffusion coefficients. Conclusion: Our analysis demonstrates that TDM provides a more accurate estimation of relaxation-diffusion measurements while accelerating the acquisitions by a factor of 2 to 3.

	<p>Aging contributes significantly to cognitive decline. Aerobic exercise (AE) has been shown to induce substantial neuroplasticity changes, enhancing cognitive and brain health. Likewise, recent research underscores the cognitive benefits of foreign language learning (FLL), indicating improvements in brain structure and function across age groups. However, the lack of a comprehensive paradigm integrating language learning with exercise limits research on combined effects in older adults. In order to address this gap, we devised a novel approach using a virtual world tourism scenario for auditory-based language learning combined with aerobic cycling. Our study examines the impact of simultaneous AE and FLL integration on cognitive and language learning outcomes compared to FLL alone. A total of 20 older adults were randomly assigned to AE + FLL and FLL-only groups. The results revealed significantly improved Spanish language learning outcomes in both combined and language learning-only groups. Additionally, significant cognitive function improvement was observed in the FLL group following short-term language learning.</p>

	<p>As cancer progresses, patients may experience physical decline, which can impair their ability to carry out essential daily tasks. The aim of this study was to analyze the levels of physical activity in patients with advanced cancer undergoing systemic treatment and its relationship with sociodemographic, clinical, and psychological factors. A prospective, cross-sectional, multicenter study was carried out in 15 oncology departments in Spain. Patients with locally advanced, unresectable, or metastatic cancer who were candidates for systemic treatment were included. Participants completed demographic information and psychological scales. In total, 508 patients were included in the study, the majority of whom were male, over the age of 65, and diagnosed with bronchopulmonary tumors (36%) and metastatic disease. Based on their physical activity levels, participants were categorized as sedentary (20%, n = 190), engaging in light physical activity (43%, n = 412), or demonstrating moderate physical activity (37%, n = 351). Patients who were over 65 years old; had a worse baseline status (ECOG &amp;amp;ge; 1); lacked a partner; had a lower educational level; or were retired or unemployed were found to have lower levels of physical activity. Those with sedentary physical activity reported higher levels of psychological distress, anxiety, depression, somatization, and physical symptoms, as well as worse functional status, global health status, and well-being. Understanding the complex interplay between physical activity and sociodemographic, clinical, and psychological factors can help neuroscientists develop tailored exercise interventions that address the unique needs of advanced cancer patients.</p>

	<p>Background: Vestibular schwannoma (VS), also known as acoustic neuroma, is a benign, well-encapsulated, and slow-growing tumor that originates from Schwann cells, which form the myelin sheath around the vestibulocochlear nerve (VIII cranial nerve). The surgical treatment of this condition presents a challenging task for surgeons, as the tumor&amp;amp;rsquo;s location and size make it difficult to remove without causing damage to the surrounding structures. In recent years, fluorescein sodium (FS) has been proposed as a tool to enhance surgical outcomes in VS surgery. This essay will provide an analytical comparison of the use of FS in VS surgery, evaluating its benefits and limitations and comparing surgical outcomes with and without FS-assisted surgery. Methods: In a retrospective study conducted at San Filippo Neri Hospital, we examined VS cases that were operated on between January 2017 and December 2023. The patients were divided into two groups: group A, which consisted of patients who underwent surgery without the use of FS until January 2020 (102 cases), and group B, which included patients who underwent surgery with FS after January 2020 (55 cases). All operations were performed using the retrosigmoid approach, and tumor size was classified according to the Koos classification system. The extent of surgical removal was evaluated using both the intraoperative surgeon&amp;amp;rsquo;s opinion and postoperative MRI imaging. Preoperatively and postoperatively, facial nerve function and hearing were assessed. In group B, FS was used to assist the surgical procedures, which were performed using a surgical microscope equipped with an integrated fluorescein filter. Postoperative clinical and MRI controls were performed at six months and annually, with no patients lost to follow-up. Results: This study investigated the impact of intraoperative fluorescein exposure on tumor resection and clinical outcomes in patients with VS. The study found a statistically significant difference in the tumor resection rates between patients who received fluorescein intraoperatively (p = 0.037). Further analyses using the Koos classification system revealed a significant effect of fluorescein exposure, particularly in the Koos 3 subgroup (p = 0.001). Notably, no significant differences were observed in hearing loss or facial nerve function between the two groups. A Spearman correlation analysis revealed a positive correlation between tumor size and Koos, age, and size, but no significant correlation was found between facial nerve function tests. Conclusions: FS-assisted surgery for VS may potentially enhance tumor resection, allowing for more comprehensive tumor removal.</p>

	<p>Background: Despite substantial progress in investigating its psychophysical complexity, tinnitus remains a scientific and clinical enigma. The present study, through an ecological and multidisciplinary approach, aims to identify associations between electroencephalographic (EEG) and psycho-audiological variables. Methods: EEG beta activity, often related to stress and anxiety, was acquired from 12 tinnitus patients (TIN group) and 7 controls (CONT group) during an audio cognitive task and at rest. We also investigated psychological (SCL-90-R; STAI-Y; BFI-10) and audiological (THI; TQ12-I; Hyperacusis) variables using non-parametric statistics to assess differences and relationships between and within groups. Results: In the TIN group, frontal beta activity positively correlated with hyperacusis, parietal activity, and trait anxiety; the latter is also associated with depression in CONT. Significant differences in paranoid ideation and openness were found between groups. Conclusions: The connection between anxiety trait, beta activity in the fronto-parietal cortices and hyperacusis provides insights into brain functioning in tinnitus patients, offering quantitative descriptions for clinicians and new multidisciplinary treatment hypotheses.</p>

	<p>This study was designed to examine the relationships among the impulsivity construct as a personality trait, the dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S), and testosterone in a sample of 120 healthy middle-aged males (Mage = 44.39; SD = 12.88). The sum of the three BIS-11 scales, the SR, and the five UPPS-P scales correlated with DHEA-S 0.23 (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.006) and testosterone 0.19 (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.04), controlling for age. Partial correlations showed that DHEA-S was significantly related to motor impulsivity (0.24; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.008), Sensitivity to Reward (0.29; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.002), Lack of Premeditation (0.26; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05), and, to a lesser extent, Sensation Seeking (0.19; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.04) and Positive Urgency (0.19; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.04). Testosterone correlated with attention impulsivity (0.18; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.04), Sensation Seeking (0.18; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.04), and Positive Urgency (0.22; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01). Sensitivity to Reward, Negative Urgency, and Positive Urgency were significant predictors of DHEA-S (R2 = 0.28), and Positive Urgency for testosterone (R2 = 0.09). Non-parametric LOESS graphical analyses for local regression allowed us to visualize the non-linear relationships between the impulsivity scales with the two androgens, including non-significant trends. We discuss the implications of these results for impulsive biological personality traits, the limitations of our analyses, and the possible development of future research.</p>

	<p>Positive symptoms of schizophrenia have been proposed to be an intrusion of dreaming in wakefulness; conversely, psychotic patients&amp;amp;rsquo; abnormal cognitive and behavioral features could overflow into sleep, so that their dreams would differ from those of healthy people. Here we assess this hypothesis by comparing dream features of 46 patients affected by schizophrenic spectrum disorders to those of 28 healthy controls. In patients, we also investigated correlations of dream variables with symptom severity and verbal fluency. Overall, patients reported fewer and shorter dreams, with a general impoverishment of content (including characters, settings, interactions) and higher spatiotemporal bizarreness. The number of emotions, mainly negative ones, was lower in patients&amp;amp;rsquo; reports and correlated inversely with symptom severity. Verbal fluency correlated positively with dream report length and negatively with perceptive bizarreness. In conclusion, our data show a significant impoverishment of dream reports in psychotic patients versus controls. Future research should investigate to what extent this profile of results depends on impaired verbal fluency or on impaired mechanisms of dream generation in this population. Moreover, in line with theories on the role of dreaming in emotion regulation, our data suggest that this function could be impaired in psychoses and related to symptom severity.</p>

	<p>Earlier research has suggested gender differences in event-related potentials/oscillations (ERPs/EROs). Yet, the alteration in event-related oscillations (EROs) in the delta and theta frequency bands have not been explored between genders across the three age groups of adulthood, i.e., 18&amp;amp;ndash;50, 51&amp;amp;ndash;65, and &amp;amp;gt;65 years. Data from 155 healthy elderly participants who underwent a neurological examination, comprehensive neuropsychological assessment (including attention, memory, executive function, language, and visuospatial skills), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) from past studies were used. The delta and theta ERO powers across the age groups and between genders were compared and correlational analyses among the ERO power, age, and neuropsychological tests were performed. The results indicated that females displayed higher theta ERO responses than males in the frontal, central, and parietal regions but not in the occipital location between 18 and 50 years of adulthood. The declining theta power of EROs in women reached that of men after the age of 50 while the theta ERO power was more stable across the age groups in men. Our results imply that the cohorts must be recruited at specified age ranges across genders, and clinical trials using neurophysiological biomarkers as an intervention endpoint should take gender into account in the future.</p>

Purbey et al. show that, while IRF1 in immune cells is required for antitumor immunity, tumor cell IRF1 suppresses Toll-like receptor- and interferon-induced antitumor lymphocyte activation and regulates select immunosuppressive and MHC genes in interferon-stimulated tumor cells.

	<p>The prevalence of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is increasing, with a tendency for co-occurrence. Some studies indicate a connection between atypical sensory processing and executive function. This study aims to explore the distinctive etiology of executive function deficits in children with ASD+ADHD by investigating the relationship between sensory processing and executive function, comparing children with ASD, ASD+ADHD, ADHD, and typically developing children (TD). Method: Sensory Profile 2 (SP-2) and Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function 2 (BRIEF-2) were measured in 120 school-aged children. The results of the above scales were compared across these four groups, and correlation and regression analyses between BRIEF2 and SP2 were conducted. Results: Our research revealed varying levels of atypical sensory processing and executive function anomalies across the three neurodevelopmental disorder groups compared to the TD group. The ASD+ADHD group showed particularly significant differences. The heightened emotional problems observed in ASD+ADHD children may be associated with more prominent atypical sensory processing. Variance analysis of inhibitory function revealed differences between ASD+ADHD and ADHD children, suggesting distinct etiological mechanisms for attention issues between ASD+ADHD and ADHD. Conclusions: ASD+ADHD represents a phenotype distinct from both ASD and ADHD. Special consideration should be given to interventions for children with ASD+ADHD. The results of this study may offer a new perspective on understanding the occurrence of ASD+ADHD and potential individualized intervention methods.</p>

The added value of deep brain stimulation (DBS) instead of continued VNS optimization is unknown. In a prospective, non-blinded, randomized patient preference trial of 18 children (aged 8–17 years) who did not respond to VNS after at least 1 year, add-on DBS resulted in greater seizure reduction compared with an additional year of VNS optimization (51.9% vs. 12.3%, <i>p</i> = 0.047). Add-on DBS also resulted in less bothersome seizures (<i>p</i> = 0.03), but no change in quality of life. DBS may be considered earlier for childhood epilepsy after non-response to VNS.

	<p>This study introduces Multi-Threshold Recurrence Rate Plots (MTRRP), a novel methodology for analyzing dynamic patterns in complex systems, such as those influenced by neurodegenerative diseases in brain activity. MTRRP characterizes how recurrence rates evolve with increasing recurrence thresholds. A key innovation of our approach, Recurrence Complexity, captures structural complexity by integrating local randomness and global structural features through the product of Recurrence Rate Gradient and Recurrence Hurst, both derived from MTRRP. We applied this technique to resting-state EEG data from patients diagnosed with Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s Disease (AD), Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD), and age-matched healthy controls. The results revealed significantly higher recurrence complexity in the occipital areas of AD and FTD patients, particularly pronounced in the Alpha and Beta frequency bands. Furthermore, EEG features derived from MTRRP were evaluated using a Support Vector Machine with leave-one-out cross-validation, achieving a classification accuracy of 87.7%. These findings not only underscore the utility of MTRRP in detecting distinct neurophysiological patterns associated with neurodegenerative diseases but also highlight its broader applicability in time series analysis, providing a substantial tool for advancing medical diagnostics and research.</p>
