              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/79765">Adaptation to glucose starvation is associated with molecular reorganization of the circadian clock in Neurospora crassa</a></h4>

              
                The circadian clock governs rhythmic cellular functions by driving the expression of a substantial fraction of the genome and thereby significantly contributes to the adaptation to changing environmental conditions. Using the circadian model organism <i>Neurospora crassa,</i> we show that molecular timekeeping is robust even under severe limitation of carbon sources, however, stoichiometry, phosphorylation and subcellular distribution of the key clock components display drastic alterations. Protein kinase A, protein phosphatase 2 A and glycogen synthase kinase are involved in the molecular reorganization of the clock. RNA-seq analysis reveals that the transcriptomic response of metabolism to starvation is highly dependent on the positive clock component WC-1. Moreover, our molecular and phenotypic data indicate that a functional clock facilitates recovery from starvation. We suggest that the molecular clock is a flexible network that allows the organism to maintain rhythmic physiology and preserve fitness even under long-term nutritional stress.

                The conformational state of DNA fine-tunes the transcriptional rate and abundance of RNA. Here we report that DNA G-quadruplex (G4-DNA) accumulates in neurons in an experience-dependent manner, and that this is required for the transient silencing and activation of genes that are critically involved in learning and memory. In addition, site-specific resolution of G4-DNA by dCas9-mediated deposition of the helicase DHX36 impairs fear extinction memory. Dynamic DNA structure states therefore represent a key molecular mechanism underlying memory consolidation.

	<p>Modified pharyngeal electrical stimulation (mPES) is a novel therapeutic method for patients with neurogenic dysphagia and tracheostomy. However, the underlying neural mechanisms are still unclear. This study aims to investigate the impact of mPES on swallowing-related neural networks and involuntary swallowing frequency using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). 20 healthy volunteers participated in this study, including two separate experimental paradigms. Experiment 1: Immediate effect observation, 20 participants (10 female; mean age 47.65 &amp;amp;plusmn; 10.48) were delivered with real and sham mPES in random order for 8 repetitions. fNIRS signals were collected during the whole period of Experiments 1. Swallowing frequency was assessed during sham/real mPES. Experiment 2: Prolonged effect observation, 7 out of the 20 participants (4 female; mean age 49.71 &amp;amp;plusmn; 6.26) completed real mPES for 5 sessions (1 session/day). 13 of the 20 participants withdrew for personal reasons. Hemodynamic changes were recorded by fNIRS on day 1 and 5. Results show that mPES evoked cortical activation over a distributed network in bilateral primary somatosensory, primary motor, somatosensory association cortex, pre-motor and supplementary motor area, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, Broca&amp;amp;rsquo;s area, and supramarginal gyrus part of Wernicke&amp;amp;rsquo;s area. Meanwhile, the increased frequency of involuntary swallowing was associated with decreased frontopolar activation (frontopolar cortex: Channel 6, p = 0.024, r = &amp;amp;minus;0.529; Channel 23, p = 0.019, r = &amp;amp;minus;0.545). Furthermore, after five days of mPES, decreased cortical activations were observed in the right dorsolateral prefrontal and supramarginal gyrus part of Wernicke&amp;amp;rsquo;s area, and left frontopolar and M1 areas. Overall, these results might suggest that mPES could elicit changes in neuroplasticity that could reorganize the swallowing-related neural network and increase involuntary swallow frequency.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/11-956/v2?src=rss">The influence of strategic innovation management on firm innovation performance in the Indonesian mid-size telecommunication industry [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The telecommunication industry was one of the Indonesian government's priorities in the national development plan 2015-2035. “Primary Industry” was the term for the priority industries with the central role as the prime mover in the future national economy. Various natural, human, technological, innovative, and creative resources were imperative in supporting the underlining national industry development plan. Strategic innovation management refers to the entire sequence of innovation practices, including competition mechanism analysis, such as creating an innovative vision, business strategy alignment, disseminating strategy at an entire organizational level, market tendency, technology, and competitor’s action. Firm innovation performance refers to the measurement of innovation efficiency (the number of new products, product novelty, new product development speed, and new product success rate) and innovation profitability (new product revenue proportion, quality enhancement, cost reduction, and value improvement) conducted by the firm. This study investigates the effect of Innovation Strategy, Organizational Structure, Innovation Culture, Technological Capability, and Customer-Supplier Relationship (these were the practice of Strategic Innovation Management mentioned in various literature) on Firm Innovation Performance.  Methods: A quantitative method, from a practical perspective, was employed to investigate the causal relationship between strategic innovation management and firm innovation performance. Data was gathered through a validated and reliable questionnaire disseminated to 90 respondents. It included a representative from the four sub-sectors of the telecommunication industry, namely fixed networks, wireless networks, telecommunication services, and special telecommunication.  Results: The survey found that firms within the telecommunication industry already employed Strategic Innovation Management practices. Moreover, this study also found that Innovation Culture, Technological Capability, and Customer-Suppler Relationship significantly influence Firm Innovation Performance.  Conclusion:   The implementation of Strategic Innovation Management in the mid-size companies within Indonesia's telecommunication industry appears to be relatively high. It indicates that firms within the industry were able to strategically compete by implementing Strategic Innovation Management.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/12-33/v1?src=rss">Dance/movement therapy as a holistic approach to diminish health discrepancies and promote wellness for people with schizophrenia: a review of the literature [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Individuals with a diagnosis of schizophrenia face a myriad of obstacles to wellness, beginning with diagnostic discrepancies including over- and misdiagnoses on the schizophrenia spectrum. People with schizophrenia experience profound amounts of stigmatization from the general population, their healthcare providers, and even themselves. Such stigmatization creates a barrier for wellness, poorer prognoses, and often limits adherence to physical and mental healthcare. Moreover, it can exacerbate the already stifling symptomatology of their diagnoses, including specific bodily-related symptomatology. Oftentimes, a diagnosis of schizophrenia disrupts one’s relationship with their body including a diminished mind-body connection, decreased interoceptive awareness, and thus unsuccessful intra- and interpersonal relationships. Some recent research suggests the use of mind-body therapies, however, if these practices are internalizing, they may not be appropriate for people with schizophrenia experiencing more acute symptomatology excluding them from treatment. Dance/movement therapy (DMT) is an embodied psychotherapeutic treatment option that can support participants in improving mind-body connection, social relationships, and self-regulatory skill development. Research on DMT has shown promising results for people with schizophrenia, however such research is limited and would benefit from increased studies that particularly measure the effects of DMT on mind-body connection and increased interoception for people with schizophrenia. Moreover, integrative and collaborative treatment models that couple DMT and biofeedback may further our understanding of the physiological and neurological effects of DMT interventions for people with schizophrenia and beyond. This review will examine the recent literature on health inequities for people with schizophrenia, their specific body-based disruptions and needs, and DMT as a promising treatment model, particularly when coupled with biofeedback.

              <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/10/1/ENEURO.0144-22.2022?rss=1">A General Framework for Inferring Bayesian Ideal Observer Models from Psychophysical Data</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>A central question in neuroscience is how sensory inputs are transformed into percepts. At this point, it is clear that this process is strongly influenced by prior knowledge of the sensory environment. Bayesian ideal observer models provide a useful link between data and theory that can help researchers evaluate how prior knowledge is represented and integrated with incoming sensory information. However, the statistical prior employed by a Bayesian observer cannot be measured directly, and must instead be inferred from behavioral measurements. Here, we review the general problem of inferring priors from psychophysical data, and the simple solution that follows from assuming a prior that is a Gaussian probability distribution. As our understanding of sensory processing advances, however, there is an increasing need for methods to flexibly recover the shape of Bayesian priors that are not well approximated by elementary functions. To address this issue, we describe a novel approach that applies to arbitrary prior shapes, which we parameterize using mixtures of Gaussian distributions. After incorporating a simple approximation, this method produces an analytical solution for psychophysical quantities that can be numerically optimized to recover the shapes of Bayesian priors. This approach offers advantages in flexibility, while still providing an analytical framework for many scenarios. We provide a MATLAB toolbox implementing key computations described herein.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Accurate and efficient quantification of animal behavior facilitates the understanding of the brain. An emerging approach within machine learning (ML) field is to combine multiple ML-based algorithms to quantify animal behavior. These so-called hybrid models have emerged because of limitations associated with supervised [e.g., random forest (RF)] and unsupervised [e.g., hidden Markov model (HMM)] ML models. For example, RF models lack temporal information across video frames, and HMM latent states are often difficult to interpret. We sought to develop a hybrid model, and did so in the context of a study of mouse risk assessment behavior. We used DeepLabCut to estimate the positions of mouse body parts. Positional features were calculated using DeepLabCut outputs and were used to train RF and HMM models with equal number of states, separately. The per-frame predictions from RF and HMM models were then passed to a second HMM model layer ("reHMM"). The outputs of the reHMM layer showed improved interpretability over the initial HMM output. Finally, we combined predictions from RF and HMM models with selected positional features to train a third HMM model ("reHMM+"). This reHMM+ layered hybrid model unveiled distinctive temporal and human-interpretable behavioral patterns. We applied this workflow to investigate risk assessment to trimethylthiazoline and snake feces odor, finding unique behavioral patterns to each that were separable from attractive and neutral stimuli. We conclude that this layered, hybrid ML workflow represents a balanced approach for improving the depth and reliability of ML classifiers in chemosensory and other behavioral contexts.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Huntington disease (HD), caused by dominantly inherited expansions of a CAG repeat results in characteristic motor dysfunction. Although gross motor defects have been extensively characterized in multiple HD mouse models using tasks such as rotarod and beam walking, less is known about forelimb deficits. We develop a high-throughput alternating reward/nonreward water-reaching task and training protocol conducted daily over approximately two months to simultaneously monitor forelimb impairment and mesoscale cortical changes in GCaMP activity, comparing female zQ175 (HD) and wild-type (WT) littermate mice, starting at ~5.5 months. Behavioral analysis of the water-reaching task reveals that HD mice, despite learning the water-reaching task as proficiently as wild-type mice, take longer to learn the alternating event sequence as evident by impulsive (noncued) reaches and initially display reduced cortical activity associated with successful reaches. At this age gross motor defects determined by tapered beam assessment were not apparent. Although wild-type mice displayed no significant changes in cortical activity and reaching trajectory throughout the testing period, HD mice exhibited an increase in cortical activity, especially in the secondary motor and retrosplenial cortices, over time, as well as longer and more variable reaching trajectories by approximately seven months. HD mice also experienced a progressive reduction in successful performance. Tapered beam and rotarod tests as well as reduced DARPP-32 expression (striatal medium spiny neuron marker) after water-reaching assessment confirmed HD pathology. The water-reaching task can be used to inform on a daily basis, HD and other movement disorder onset and manifestation, therapeutic intervention windows, and test drug efficacy.</p>

                Background and Aim: The Kacang goat (Capra hircus) is an indigenous livestock species in Indonesia that is at risk of extinction due to cross-breeding. Artificial insemination (AI) techniques are expected to increase the population of these goats. This study aimed to determine the addition of epigallocatechin-3-gallate chitosan nanoparticles (EGCG CNPs) to skim milk–egg yolk (SM–EY) extender to obtain the best possible quality of post-thawed Kacang buck semen for AI. Materials and Methods:  Fresh Kacang buck semen was diluted in SM–EY without or with the addition of 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, or 2.0 µg of EGCG CNPs/mL extender. Extended semen was packaged in French mini straws, frooze, and stored in liquid nitrogen at −196℃ for 24 hours. Six replicates from each treatment group were thawed for catalase, 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging, malondialdehyde (MDA), sperm intact plasma membrane (IPM), viability and motility analyses. Results: Post-thawed semen that was previously frozen without EGCG CNPs in the extender (control group) exhibited the lowest levels of catalase, DPPH, sperm viability, sperm motility, IPM, and the highest levels of MDA. However, the addition of EGCG CNPs at doses of 1.5 µg/mL extender increased post-thawed catalase, DPPH, sperm IPM, viability, and sperm motility and decreased MDA levels (p < 0.05) than those of control group. Conclusion: This study was the first in which EGCG CNPs were used in SM–EY extender, and the addition of only 1.0 µg/mL of EGCG CNPs in this extender increased the antioxidant capacity and post-thawed quality of Kacang buck semen.

                Background  The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused uncertainty in many economic sectors. An entrepreneurial leadership style can become an alternative method of leadership for facing uncertainty.    Methods   This study uses secondary data from the Scopus website as samples. The samples are papers from Indonesia, China, and the USA. Data were collected through the Scopus website, using keywords entrepreneurial and leadership, saved into a CSV file, and processed using VOSviewer. The findings were analyzed using a systematic search.     Results   Entrepreneurial leadership as a topic was more prevalent in China than Indonesia and the USA. There were 101 papers from Chinese authors, 28 from Indonesian authors, and 575 from USA authors. However, there was no topic of entrepreneurial leadership connected to the strings of the topic of COVID-19. This study also found that inclusive leadership was used in China and local government leadership was used by the USA government to anticipate the impact of COVID-19.   Conclusions   Entrepreneurial leadership was not used for COVID-19 pandemic management in USA, China, and Indonesia as a research trend.

                Background and aims: Natural compounds extracted from medicinal plants have recently gained attention in therapeutics as they are considered to have lower toxicity and higher tolerability relative to chemically synthesized compounds. Bakuchiol is one such compound; it is a type of meroterpene derived from the leaves and seeds of Psoralea corylifolia plants. Natural sources of bakuchiol have been used in traditional Chinese and Indian medicine for centuries due to its preventive benefits against tumors and inflammation. It plays a strong potential role as an antioxidant with impressive abilities to remove Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS). This review has focused on bakuchiol's extraction, therapeutic applications, and pharmacological benefits. Methods: A search strategy has been followed to retrieve the relevant newly published literature on the pharmacological benefits of bakuchiol. After an extensive study of the retrieved articles and maintaining the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 106 articles were finally selected for this review. Results: Strong support of primary research on the protective effects via antitumorigenic, anti-inflammatory, antioxidative, antimicrobial, and antiviral activities are delineated. Conclusions: From ancient to modern life, medicinal plants have always been drawing the attention of human beings to alleviate ailments for a healthy and balanced lifestyle. This review is a comprehensive approach to highlighting bona fide essential pharmacological benefits and mechanism of action of therapeutic implications.

                DNA samples are often used to identify fish before they are utilised in other experiments. Our recent research has shown that skin swabbing can be used to collect DNA for genotyping, and that swabbing causes less harm to fish than fin clipping, another common technique. In this study we investigated potential refinements to the skin swabbing protocol by pre-treating fish with the analgesic lidocaine. We could not detect any differences in cortisol release, behaviour or expression of stress axis marker genes in skin swabbed sticklebacks or zebrafish regardless of lidocaine application. In contrast, fin clipping caused changes in cortisol release, gene expression and behaviour when analgesia was not used. These changes were rescued by pre-treatment with lidocaine confirming that analgesia was effective. The results demonstrates that skin swabbing is a refined technique for DNA collection that does not require analgesia.

                Background: The majority of Indonesians believe and act as if the only people who can learn and be taught Arabic are Muslims. This fact goes against the basic idea that language is a way to communicate. So, the goal of this study is to find out what opportunities and plans there are for non-Muslims in Indonesia to learn Arabic. The goal of this study is to get language back to its basic function of being a way to communicate. It can also be the basis for putting Wasathiyah Islam into practise in Indonesia. Methods: This study was carried out in accordance with the official guidelines for research ethics established by the Ministry of Higher Education Research in the Republic of Indonesia. Between June 11 and August 30, 2022, the research was done. The research was carried out with two approaches, namely quantitative first and followed by qualitative. After collecting and analysing data for a study, researchers submit their findings to reviewers appointed by Indonesia's Ministry of Research and Technology. Results: A total of 64 participants were surveyed, and based on their responses, the following was determined; Researchers conduct interviews directly with informants who are considered to have the ability to provide information related to research themes. Therefore, researchers conducted interviews with 24. First, non-Muslims in Indonesia should study Arabic since language is a communication instrument. This includes religion, ethnicity, and race not limiting language acquisition. Second, teaching non-Muslims Arabic in Indonesia will help to implement Wasathiyah Islam there. Non-Indonesian Muslims who know Arabic will be more tolerant. Third, because Arabic is a communication tool, there is no big challenge for non-Muslims to learn Arabic. Conclusion: However, in terms of obstacles, of course, there are many big obstacles, namely the unsupportive Arabic learning.

                Background: Glutamate signaling in the brain is regulated by release, reuptake, and receptor responsiveness. In diseased conditions, glutamate signaling can exceed normal regulatory processes, giving rise to a condition called excitotoxicity. Although regional differences in the excitotoxic effects of glutamate in the brain have been reported, the extent and characteristics of these potential differences are not clear.  Here we compared the excitotoxic resiliency of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), anterior hypothalamus (AH) and cortex.  Methods: We treated acute brain slices containing either the SCN and AH or the cortex from adult male mice at different times across the diurnal cycle with varying concentrations of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), NMDA+ α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) or control medium. The extent of cell damage was assessed using propidium iodide (PI), a cell death marker. Results: The results indicate that all three brain regions exhibited increasing cell damage/death when treated with increasing concentrations of NMDA. However, higher concentrations of NMDA were needed to significantly increase cell damage in the SCN compared to the cortex and AH.  All three brain regions also exhibited greater cell death/damage when treated in the nighttime compared to the daytime, although the SCN exhibited increased cell death during a more restricted time interval compared to the AH and cortex.  Conclusions: Together, these data confirm previous studies showing excitotoxic resiliency in the SCN, while extending them in two ways.  First, we demonstrate a dose-dependency in excitotoxic susceptibility that differentiates the SCN from the surrounding AH and the cortex using a brain slice preparation. Second, we demonstrate a diurnal rhythm in excitotoxic susceptibility with a broadly similar phase across all three brain regions. These data increase our understanding of the extent and nature of the SCN excitotoxic resiliency, which will inform future studies on the cellular mechanisms underlying this phenomenon.

                Background: Rhizocephalan barnacles stand out in the diverse world of metazoan parasites. The body of a rhizocephalan female is modified beyond revealing any recognizable morphological features, consisting of the interna, a system of rootlets, and the externa, a sac-like reproductive body. Moreover, rhizocephalans have an outstanding ability to control their hosts, literally turning them into “zombies”. Despite all these amazing traits, there are no genomic or transcriptomic data about any Rhizocephala. Methods: We collected transcriptomes from four body parts of an adult female rhizocephalan Peltogaster reticulata: the externa, and the main, growing, and thoracic parts of the interna. We used all prepared data for the de novo assembly of the reference transcriptome. Next, a set of encoded proteins was determined, the expression levels of protein-coding genes in different parts of the parasite’s body were calculated and lists of enriched bioprocesses were identified. We also in silico identified and analyzed sets of potential excretory / secretory proteins. Finally, we applied phylostratigraphy and evolutionary transcriptomics approaches to our data.  Results: The assembled reference transcriptome included transcripts of 12,620 protein-coding genes and was the first for any rhizocephalan. Based on the results obtained, the spatial heterogeneity of protein-coding gene expression in different regions of the adult female body of P. reticulata was established. The results of both transcriptomic analysis and histological studies indicated the presence of germ-like cells in the lumen of the interna. The potential molecular basis of the interaction between the nervous system of the host and the parasite's interna was also determined. Given the prolonged expression of development-associated genes, we suggest that rhizocephalans “got stuck in their metamorphosis”, even at the reproductive stage. Conclusions: The results of the first comparative transcriptomic analysis for Rhizocephala not only clarified but also expanded the existing ideas about the biology of these extraordinary parasites.

                Abortion is defined as the termination of pregnancy which is a crucial issue to be addressed by multiple regulating systems such as health care providers and policy makers. The main aim of the study was to assess the attitudes of medical students in Imam Abdulrahman bin Faisal university towards abortion in different circumstances. This is a descriptive cross-sectional study in which a 20-items online questionnaire was distributed through social media platforms to medical students. The results of the study showed that the majority of the students believe abortion should be determined by law, religion and spousal consent. The majority as well support abortion in cases of endangered mother’s life, fetal life compromise and rape victims. However, they were against abortion in cases of financial incapacity of the parents and cases of unplanned pregnancy. The results of the study can be applied to improve medical education of abortion. More studies in this field of research are recommended for the purpose of providing more inclusive assessment of abortion attitudes in different medical education settings.

However, it is ineffective because of the lack of viability and differentiation of transplanted stem cells, resulting in low adaptation and survival rates. We aimed to determine whether stem cells cultured under low oxygen (O2) tension improves the adaptability and viability of stem cells, as well as ovarian failure. Methods: After four days of culturing mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in 21% oxygen (normoxia) as the T2 group and 1% oxygen (low O2 or hypoxia) as the T1 group, 200 million bone marrow-derived MSCs per rat were transplanted into female rats with ovarian failure (15 rats per treatment group). A total of 15 fertile and 15 infertile rats were categorized as the C+ and C− groups, respectively. Results: The slight increase in cells expressing HSP70 (C+, T2, T1, and C− groups were 0.5a±0.53, 1.7a±0.82, 6.2b±1.5, and 9.6c±1.3, respectively), decrease in cells expressing caspase-3 as an apoptotic inhibitor (C+, T2, T1, and C− groups were 0.2a±0.42, 0.6a±0.52, 4.8b±1.03, and 7.3c±1.42, respectively), and increase in cells expressing VEGF-1 (C+, T2, T1, and C− groups were 10.8c±1.55, 8.7b±0.48, 0.4a±0.52, and 0.2a±0.42, respectively) and GDF-9 (C+, T2, T1, and C− groups were 5.8c±1.47, 4.6b±0.97, 0.5a±0.53, and 0.3a±0.48, respectively) were used as markers for viability and differentiation in ovarian tissue, indicating that MSCs cultured under low O2 tension were more effective than those cultured under normoxic conditions as a treatment for female rats with ovarian failure. Furthermore, infertile female rats treated with MSCs cultivated under low O2 tension had an enhanced ovarian tissue shape, as indicated by the increasing Graafian follicle count (C+, T2, T1, and C− groups were 8.9c±0.74, 4.5b±0.71, 0.5a±0.53, and 0.4a±0.52, respectively). Conclusions: MSCs cultured under low O2 tension are an effective treatment for malnourished rats with ovarian failure.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/12-23/v1?src=rss">Interactions between special education teachers and children with chronic complex conditions: A qualitative study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The number of children with complex medical conditions has increased in recent decades. In this context, a complex chronic condition is characterized by multiple morbidities that require intensive or continuous health care according to the level of severity. Given their various health conditions, it is challenging to provide special education to these children, but there is still insufficient evidence regarding the practical experiences of educators. The aim of this study was to investigate special education teacher’s perceptions, experiences, and challenges while developing interpersonal relationships and communicating with children who have complex chronic conditions.   Methods: We recruited and interviewed 21 special education school teachers. The transcripts of the interviews were analyzed using thematic analysis.   Results: Our analysis revealed four themes, including “searching for the meaning,” “complex chronic conditions as a difficult reality,” “widening experience for the future,” and “priority for interacting with children.” These themes reflect the perceptions, experiences, and challenges of the special education teachers.   Conclusions: In cases where children have severe functional limitations, it is more challenging to understand child-teacher interactions. This highlights the importance of searching for meaning in educational practices used among children with complex chronic conditions. Our findings may provide helpful insight into the experiences and challenges faced by special educators who engage with these children.

                Background: Gastritis is an inflammation of the stomach lining often caused by Helicobacter pylori infection. Among three H. pylori genes coding for hemolytic toxins, the clinical outcome of hp0499 and hp1490 is unclear. We conducted molecular and histological analyses to evaluate the correlation between these genes and gastritis severity. Methods: We analyzed the hp0499 and hp1490 variants of 116 Indonesian samples using next generation sequencing and validated them using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The updated Sydney system was used to grade gastritis through histological analyses. We then calculated the influence of hp0499 and hp1490 on the gastritis severity, using multivariate analysis and cagA and vacA as major H. pylori virulence factors. Results: Two variants of each gene were identified and named hp0499-1 and -2, and hp1490-1 and -2. We noted that hp0499 expression was significantly correlated with corporal atrophy (p = 0.037). H. pylori hp1490 significantly correlated with antral acute and chronic inflammation as well as corporal density (p = 0.025, p = 0.07, p = 0.010, respectively). After adjusting for age and sex, we found that vacA s1m1 was an independent risk factor for acute antral inflammation (p = 0.032). hp1490 and vacA s1m1 were independent risk factors for chronic antral inflammation (p = 0.030 and p = 0.031, respectively). Conclusions: We identified the variants hp0499-1 and -2 and hp1490-1 and -2 and demonstrated that hp0499 plays a significant role in the severity of corporal atrophy. Moreover, hp1490 was characterized as an independent risk factor for chronic inflammation in the antral region. Therefore, hp0499 and hp1490 are new potential targets for therapeutics.

There is an ongoing explosion of scientific datasets being generated, brought on by recent technological advances in many areas of the natural sciences. As a result, the life sciences have become increasingly computational in nature, and bioinformatics has taken on a central role in research studies. However, basic computational skills, data analysis, and stewardship are still rarely taught in life science educational programs, resulting in a skills gap in many of the researchers tasked with analysing these big datasets. In order to address this skills gap and empower researchers to perform their own data analyses, the Galaxy Training Network (GTN) has previously developed the Galaxy Training Platform (https://training.galaxyproject.org), an open access, community-driven framework for the collection of FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) training materials for data analysis utilizing the user-friendly Galaxy framework as its primary data analysis platform. Since its inception, this training platform has thrived, with the number of tutorials and contributors growing rapidly, and the range of topics extending beyond life sciences to include topics such as climatology, cheminformatics, and machine learning. While initially aimed at supporting researchers directly, the GTN framework has proven to be an invaluable resource for educators as well. We have focused our efforts in recent years on adding increased support for this growing community of instructors. New features have been added to facilitate the use of the materials in a classroom setting, simplifying the contribution flow for new materials, and have added a set of train-the-trainer lessons. Here, we present the latest developments in the GTN project, aimed at facilitating the use of the Galaxy Training materials by educators, and its usage in different learning environments.

                Background: Delivery of safe and reliable healthcare to patients and the healthcare workforce shortage amidst growing demand has been major challenge to the healthcare system. Addressing this challenge calls for designing or redesigning of healthcare work system. Work system design which is usually associated with productivity in manufacturing offers a wide spectrum of applicability in addressing this challenge of healthcare system. Despite the availability of primary studies on work system design in healthcare, there are sparse published reviews in specific contexts. This scoping review explores the existing evidence to understand the state of the art of work system design in healthcare.  Methods: The scoping review adopts the methodology of Joanna Briggs Institute for scoping review which is based on the methodological framework of Arksey and O’Malley. The search will be done on PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science for the identification of eligible studies. A grey literature search will also be performed. A two-phase screening and extraction of data will be done by two independent reviewers. Data extraction will be done on a pre-piloted data extraction form. The findings will be presented in tables, figures, and a narrative summary. The scoping review will highlight the state of the art, gaps in knowledge and provide directions for future research.  Ethics and dissemination: This is a scoping review of primary studies and therefore ethical approval is not required. The report of the findings will be presented in line with the PRISMA reporting guidelines for scoping reviews (PRISMA-ScR). The results will be submitted to a peer-reviewed scientific journal for publication and presented at relevant conferences.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/79432">EZH2/hSULF1 axis mediates receptor tyrosine kinase signaling to shape cartilage tumor progression</a></h4>

              
                Chondrosarcomas are primary cancers of cartilaginous tissue and capable of alteration to highly aggressive, metastatic, and treatment-refractory states, leading to a poor prognosis with a five-year survival rate at 11 months for dedifferentiated subtype. At present, the surgical resection of chondrosarcoma is the only effective treatment, and no other treatment options including targeted therapies, conventional chemotherapies, or immunotherapies are available for these patients. Here, we identify a signal pathway way involving EZH2/SULF1/cMET axis that contributes to malignancy of chondrosarcoma and provides a potential therapeutic option for the disease. A non-biased chromatin immunoprecipitation sequence, cDNA microarray analysis, and validation of chondrosarcoma cell lines identified sulfatase 1 (<i>SULF1</i>) as the top EZH2-targeted gene to regulate chondrosarcoma progression. Overexpressed EZH2 resulted in downregulation of SULF1 in chondrosarcoma cell lines, which in turn activated cMET pathway. Pharmaceutical inhibition of cMET or genetically silenced cMET pathway significantly retards the chondrosarcoma growth and extends mice survival. The regulation of EZH2/SULF1/cMET axis were further validated in patient samples with chondrosarcoma. The results not only established a signal pathway promoting malignancy of chondrosarcoma but also provided a therapeutic potential for further development of effective target therapy to treat chondrosarcoma.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/84424">Cryo-EM structures of mitochondrial respiratory complex I from Drosophila melanogaster</a></h4>

              
                Respiratory complex I powers ATP synthesis by oxidative phosphorylation, exploiting the energy from NADH oxidation by ubiquinone to drive protons across an energy-transducing membrane. <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> is a candidate model organism for complex I due to its high evolutionary conservation with the mammalian enzyme, well-developed genetic toolkit, and complex physiology for studies in specific cell types and tissues. Here, we isolate complex I from <i>Drosophila</i> and determine its structure, revealing a 43-subunit assembly with high structural homology to its 45-subunit mammalian counterpart, including a hitherto unknown homologue to subunit NDUFA3. The major conformational state of the <i>Drosophila</i> enzyme is the mammalian-type 'ready-to-go' active resting state, with a fully ordered and enclosed ubiquinone-binding site, but a subtly altered global conformation related to changes in subunit ND6. The mammalian-type 'deactive' pronounced resting state is not observed: in two minor states the ubiquinone-binding site is unchanged, but a deactive-type p-bulge is present in ND6-TMH3. Our detailed structural knowledge of <i>Drosophila</i> complex I provides a foundation for new approaches to disentangle mechanisms of complex I catalysis and regulation in bioenergetics and physiology.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/82241">Interdependent progression of bidirectional sister replisomes in E. coli</a></h4>

              
                Bidirectional DNA replication complexes initiated from the same origin remain colocalized in a factory configuration for part or all their lifetimes. However, there is little evidence that sister replisomes are functionally interdependent, and the consequence of factory replication is unknown. Here, we investigated the functional relationship between sister replisomes in <i>E. coli</i>, which naturally exhibits both factory and solitary configurations in the same replication cycle. Using an inducible transcription factor roadblocking system, we found that blocking one replisome caused a significant decrease in overall progression and velocity of the sister replisome. Remarkably, progression was impaired only if the block occurred while sister replisomes were still in a factory configuration - blocking one fork had no significant effect on the other replisome when sister replisomes were physically separate. Disruption of factory replication also led to increased fork stalling and requirement of fork restart mechanisms. These results suggest that physical association between sister replisomes is important for establishing an efficient and uninterrupted replication program. We discuss the implications of our findings on mechanisms of replication factory structure and function, and cellular strategies of replicating problematic DNA such as highly transcribed segments.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/82357">Temporal context and latent state inference in the hippocampal splitter signal</a></h4>

              
                The hippocampus is thought to enable the encoding and retrieval of ongoing experience, the organization of that experience into structured representations like contexts, maps, and schemas, and the use of these structures to plan for the future. A central goal is to understand what the core computations supporting these functions are, and how these computations are realized in the collective action of single neurons. A potential access point into this issue is provided by ‘splitter cells’, hippocampal neurons that fire differentially on the overlapping segment of trajectories that differ in their past and/or future. However, the literature on splitter cells has been fragmented and confusing, owing to differences in terminology, behavioral tasks, and analysis methods across studies. In this review, we synthesize consistent findings from this literature, establish a common set of terms, and translate between single-cell and ensemble perspectives. Most importantly, we examine the combined findings through the lens of two major theoretical ideas about hippocampal function: representation of temporal context and latent state inference. We find that unique signature properties of each of these models are necessary to account for the data, but neither theory, by itself, explains all of its features. Specifically, the temporal gradedness of the splitter signal is strong support for temporal context, but is hard to explain using state models, while its flexibility and task-dependence is naturally accounted for using state inference, but poses a challenge otherwise. These theories suggest a number of avenues for future work, and we believe their application to splitter cells is a timely and informative domain for testing and refining theoretical ideas about hippocampal function.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/84029">Targeted sensors for glutamatergic neurotransmission</a></h4>

              
                Optical report of neurotransmitter release allows visualization of excitatory synaptic transmission. Sensitive genetically-encoded glutamate reporters operating with a range of affinities and emission wavelengths are available. However, without targeting to synapses, the specificity of the fluorescent signal is uncertain, compared to sensors directed at vesicles or other synaptic markers. We fused the state-of-the-art reporter iGluSnFR to glutamate receptor auxiliary proteins in order to target it to postsynaptic sites. Chimeras of Stargazin and gamma-8 that we named SnFR-γ2 and SnFR-γ8, were enriched at synapses, retained function and reported spontaneous glutamate release in rat hippocampal cells, with apparently diffraction-limited spatial precision. In autaptic mouse neurons cultured on astrocytic micro islands, evoked neurotransmitter release could be quantitatively detected at tens of synapses in a field of view whilst evoked currents were recorded simultaneously. These experiments revealed a specific postsynaptic deficit from Stargazin overexpression, resulting in synapses with normal neurotransmitter release but without postsynaptic responses. This defect was reverted by delaying overexpression. By working at different calcium concentrations, we determined that SnFR-γ2 is a linear reporter of the global quantal parameters and short-term synaptic plasticity, whereas iGluSnFR is not. On average, half of iGluSnFR regions of interest showing evoked fluorescence changes had intense rundown, whereas less than 5% of SnFR-γ2 ROIs did. We provide an open-source analysis suite for extracting quantal parameters including release probability from fluorescence time series of individual and grouped synaptic responses. Taken together, postsynaptic targeting improves several properties of iGluSnFR and further demonstrates the importance of subcellular targeting for optogenetic actuators and reporters.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/81792">Kindlin-2 inhibits TNF/NF-κB-Caspase 8 pathway in hepatocytes to maintain liver development and function</a></h4>

              
                Inflammatory liver diseases are a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide; however, underlying mechanisms are incompletely understood. Here we show that deleting the focal adhesion protein Kindlin-2 expression in hepatocytes using the <i>Alb-Cre</i> transgenic mice causes a severe inflammation, resulting in premature death. Kindlin-2 loss accelerates hepatocyte apoptosis with subsequent compensatory cell proliferation and accumulation of the collagenous extracellular matrix, leading to massive liver fibrosis and dysfunction. Mechanistically, Kindlin-2 loss abnormally activates the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) pathway. Blocking activation of the TNF signaling pathway by deleting TNF receptor or deletion of Caspase 8 expression in hepatocytes essentially restores liver function and prevents premature death caused by Kindlin-2 loss. Finally, of translational significance, adeno-associated virus mediated overexpression of Kindlin-2 in hepatocytes attenuates the D-galactosamine and lipopolysaccharide-induced liver injury and death in mice. Collectively, we establish that Kindlin-2 acts as a novel intrinsic inhibitor of the TNF pathway to maintain liver homeostasis and may define a useful therapeutic target for liver diseases.

">Anti-seizure Gene Therapy for Focal Cortical Dysplasia</a></h4>

              
                Focal Cortical Dysplasias (FCDs) are a common subtype of malformation of cortical development, which frequently present with a spectrum of cognitive and behavioural abnormalities as well as pharmacoresistant epilepsy. FCD type II is typically caused by somatic mutations resulting in mTOR hyperactivity, and is the commonest pathology found in children undergoing epilepsy surgery. However, surgical resection does not always result in seizure freedom, and is often precluded by proximity to eloquent brain regions. Gene therapy is a promising potential alternative treatment and may be appropriate in cases that represent an unacceptable surgical risk. Here, we evaluated a gene therapy based on overexpression of the Kv1.1 potassium channel in a mouse model of frontal lobe FCD. An engineered potassium channel (EKC) transgene was placed under control of a human promoter that biases expression towards principal neurons (CAMK2A) and packaged in an adeno-associated viral vector (AAV9). We used an established FCD model generated by in utero electroporation of frontal lobe neural progenitors with a constitutively active human RHEB plasmid, an activator of mTOR Complex 1. First, we further characterised this by quantifying electrocorticograms and behavioural abnormalities, both in mice developing spontaneous generalised seizures and in mice only exhibiting abnormal interictal discharges. Then, using continuous video-electrocorticogram recordings from epileptic mice before and after injection of AAV9-CAMK2A-EKC in the dysplastic region, we observed a robust decrease in the frequency of seizures and in interictal activity, compared to mice injected with a control viral vector. Despite the robust anti-epileptic effect of the treatment, there was neither an improvement nor a worsening of performance in behavioural tests sensitive to frontal lobe function. AAV9-CAMK2A-EKC had no effect on interictal activity or behaviour in non-epileptic mice. AAV9-CAMK2A-EKC gene therapy is a promising therapy with translational potential to treat the epileptic phenotype of mTOR-related malformations of cortical development. Cognitive and behavioural co-morbidities may, however, resist an intervention aimed at reducing circuit excitability.

">Single-nucleus transcriptional profiling of GAD2-positive neurons from mouse lateral habenula reveals distinct expression of neurotransmission- and depression-related genes</a></h4>

              
                Glutamatergic projection neurons of the lateral habenula (LHb) drive behavioral state modulation by regulating the activity of midbrain monoaminergic neurons. Identifying circuit mechanisms that modulate LHb output is of interest for understanding control of motivated behaviors. A small population of neurons within the medial subnucleus of the mouse LHb express the GABAergic synthesizing enzyme GAD2, and they can inhibit nearby LHb projection neurons; however, these neurons lack markers of classic inhibitory interneurons and they co-express the vesicular glutamate transporter VGLUT2. To determine the molecular phenotype of these neurons, we genetically tagged the nuclei of GAD2-positive cells and used fluorescence-activated nuclear sorting to isolate and enrich these nuclei for single nuclear RNA sequencing (FANS-snRNAseq). Our data confirm that GAD2+/VGLUT2+ neurons intrinsic to the LHb co-express markers of both glutamatergic and GABAergic transmission and that they are transcriptionally distinct from either GABAergic interneurons or habenular glutamatergic neurons. We identify gene expression programs within these cells that show sex-specific differences in expression and that are implicated in major depressive disorder (MDD), which has been linked to LHb hyperactivity. Finally, we identify the Ntng2 gene encoding the cell adhesion protein Netrin-G2 as a marker of LHb GAD2+/VGLUT+ neurons and a gene product that may contribute to their target projections. These data show the value of using genetic enrichment of rare cell types for transcriptome studies, and they advance understanding of the molecular composition of a functionally important class of GAD2+ neurons in the LHb.

">Cross-β helical filaments of Tau and TMEM106B in Gray and White Matter of Multiple System Tauopathy with presenile Dementia</a></h4>

              
                Background: The Microtubule-Associated Protein Tau (MAPT) is one of the proteins that are central to neurodegenerative diseases. The nature of intracellular tau aggregates is determined by the cell types whether neuronal or glial, the participating tau isoforms, and the structure of the amyloid filament. The transmembrane protein 106B (TMEM106B) has recently emerged as another significant player in neurodegeneration and aging. In the central nervous system, the composition of the gray and white matter differs considerably. The gray matter consists of nerve cell bodies, dendrites, unmyelinated axons, synaptic terminals, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes (satellite cells) and microglia. The white matter differs from the gray for the presence of axonal tracts as the only neuronal component and for the absence of nerve cell bodies, dendrites and synaptic terminals. Cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) studies have unveiled the structure of tau and TMEM106B, from the cerebral cortex, in several neurodegenerative diseases; however, whether tau and TMEM106B filaments from the gray and white matter share a common fold requires additional investigation. Methods: We isolated tau and TMEM106B from the cerebral cortex and white matter of the frontal lobes of two individuals affected by multiple system tauopathy with presenile dementia (MSTD), a disease caused by the MAPT intron 10 mutation +3. We used immunostaining, biochemical, genetics and cryo-EM methods to characterize tau and TMEM106B. Results: We determined that tau filaments in the gray and the white matter of MSTD individuals can induce tau aggregation and have identical AGD type 2 folds. TMEM106B amyloid filaments were also found in the gray and white matter of MSTD; the filament folds were identical in the two anatomical regions. Conclusions: Our findings show for the first time that in MSTD two types of amyloid filaments extracted from the gray matter have identical folds to those extracted from the white matter. Whether in this genetic disorder there is a relationship in the pathogenesis of the tau and TMEM106B filaments, remains to be determined. Furthermore, additional studies are needed for other proteins and other neurodegenerative diseases to establish whether filaments extracted from the gray and white matter would have identical folds.

                Cre/LoxP technology has revolutionized genetic studies and allowed for spatial and temporal control of gene expression in specific cell types. The field of microglial biology has particularly benefited from this technology as microglia have historically been difficult to transduce with virus or electroporation methods for gene delivery. Here, we interrogate four of the most widely available microglial inducible Cre lines. We demonstrate varying degrees of recombination efficiency and spontaneous recombination, depending on the Cre line and loxP distance. We also establish best practice guidelines and protocols to measure recombination efficiency in microglia, which could be extended to other cell types. There is increasing evidence that microglia are key regulators of neural circuit structure and function. Microglia are also major drivers of a broad range of neurological diseases. Thus, reliable manipulation of their function in vivo is of utmost importance. Identifying caveats and benefits of all tools and implementing the most rigorous protocols are crucial to the growth of the field of microglial biology and the development of microglia-based therapeutics.

">Mapping multidimensional content representations to neural and behavioral expressions of episodic memory</a></h4>

              
                Human neuroimaging studies have shown that the contents of episodic memories are represented in distributed patterns of neural activity. However, these studies have mostly been limited to decoding simple, unidimensional properties of stimuli. Semantic encoding models, in contrast, offer a means for characterizing the rich, multidimensional information that comprises episodic memories. Here, we extensively sampled four human fMRI subjects to build semantic encoding models and then applied these models to reconstruct content from natural scene images as they were viewed and recalled from memory. First, we found that multidimensional semantic information was successfully reconstructed from activity patterns across visual and lateral parietal cortices, both when viewing scenes and when recalling them from memory. Second, whereas visual cortical reconstructions were much more accurate when images were viewed versus recalled from memory, lateral parietal reconstructions were comparably accurate across visual perception and memory. Third, by applying natural language processing methods to verbal recall data, we showed that fMRI-based reconstructions reliably matched subjects' verbal descriptions of their memories. In fact, reconstructions from ventral temporal cortex more closely matched subjects' own verbal recall than other subjects' verbal recall of the same images. Fourth, encoding models reliably transferred across subjects: memories were successfully reconstructed using encoding models trained on data from entirely independent subjects. Together, these findings provide evidence for successful reconstructions of multidimensional and idiosyncratic memory representations and highlight the differential sensitivity of visual cortical and lateral parietal regions to information derived from the external visual environment versus internally-generated memories.

">Functional Topography of the Neocortex Predicts Covariation in Complex Cognitive and Basic Motor Abilities</a></h4>

              
                Although higher-order cognitive and lower-order sensorimotor abilities are generally regarded as distinct and studied separately, there is evidence that they not only covary but also that this covariation increases across the lifespan. This pattern has been leveraged in clinical settings where a simple assessment of sensory or motor ability (e.g., hearing, gait speed) can forecast age-related cognitive decline and risk for dementia. However, the brain mechanisms underlying cognitive, sensory, and motor covariation are largely unknown. Here, we examined whether such covariation in midlife reflects variability in common versus distinct neocortical networks using individualized maps of functional topography derived from BOLD fMRI data collected in 769 45-year old members of a population-representative cohort. Analyses revealed that variability in basic motor but not hearing ability reflected individual differences in the functional topography of neocortical networks typically supporting cognitive ability. These patterns suggest that covariation in motor and cognitive abilities in midlife reflects convergence of function in higher-order neocortical networks and that gait speed may not be simply a measure of physical function but rather an integrative index of nervous system health.

">Is high-frequency activity evidence of an anterior temporal lobe network or micro-saccades?</a></h4>

              
                There is renewed interest in electrical activity that extends beyond the typical electrophysiological 100 Hz bandwidth. This activity, often in the anterior temporal lobe, has been attributed to processes ranging from memory consolidation to epileptiform activity. Here, using an open-access resting state magnetoencephalography (MEG) dataset (n = 89), and a second task-based MEG dataset, we could reliably localise high-frequency power to the temporal lobes across multiple bands up to 300-400 Hz. A functional connectivity analysis of this activity revealed a robust resting state bilateral network between the temporal lobes. However, we also found robust coherence in the 100-200 and 200-300 Hz bands between source reconstructed MEG data and the electrooculography (EOG) localised to within the temporal poles. Additional denoising schemes applied to the data could reduce power localisation to the temporal poles but the topography of the functional network did not drastically alter. Whilst it is clear that this network is biological and robust to established denoising methods, we cannot definitively rule yet on whether this is of neural or myogenic origin.

">Distinct Functional cerebral Hypersensitivity networks during incisional and inflammatory pain in rats</a></h4>

              
                Although the pathophysiology of pain has been investigated tremendously, there are still many open questions, especially with regard to specific pain entities and their pain-related symptoms. To increase the translational impact of (preclinical) animal pain neuroimaging studies, the use of disease-specific pain models, as well as relevant stimulus modalities, are critical. Yet, the challenges of identifying neuroimaging signatures at a pain entity- and modality-specific level are manifold. Therefore, we developed a comprehensive framework for brain network analysis in disease-specific pain models combining functional MRI with graph-theory and data classification by linear discriminant analysis. This enabled us to expand our knowledge of stimulus (mechanical vs. electrical) modality processing under incisional (INC) and pathogen-induced inflammatory (CFA) pain entities compared to acute pain conditions. In short, graph-theoretical analyses revealed distinct Network Signatures of Pain Hypersensitivity (NSPH) for INC and CFA, resulting in impaired discrimination of stimulus modalities in both pain models compared to control conditions (CTR). Such specific neuroimaging signatures are an important step toward identifying novel pain biomarkers for certain diseases and relevant outcomes to evaluate target engagement of novel therapeutic options, which ultimately can be translated to the clinic.

">Mapping the auditory space of Culex pipiens female mosquito in 3D</a></h4>

              
                The task of directional hearing faces most of the animals that possess ears. They approach this task in different ways, but the common trait is the usage of the binaural cues to find the direction to the source of sound. In insects, the task is further complicated by their small size and, hence, minute temporal and level differences between two ears. A way to overcome this problem is to receive the particle velocity component of sound rather than the pressure, as the former naturally involves directionality. However, even in this case, one ear is not enough for directional hearing: a single symmetric flagellar particle velocity receiver cannot discriminate between the two opposite directions along the vector of the sound wave. Insects that use flagellar auditory organs, and mosquitoes in particular, possess a pair of receivers, which presumes the usage of binaural hearing. Its mechanisms are expected to be significantly different from the ones typical for the pressure receivers. However, the directionality of flagellar auditory organs has received little attention. Here we measured the in-flight orientation of a female mosquito antennae and obtained detailed physiological mapping of the Johnston's organ directionality at the level of individual sensory units. By combining these data, we provided a three-dimensional model of the mosquito's auditory space. The natural orientation of the antennae together with angular distribution of sensory units in each of the Johnston's organs was found to be optimal for binaural hearing focused primarily in front of, above and below a flying mosquito.

">Early rise and persistent inhibition of electromyography during failed stopping</a></h4>

              
                Reactively canceling movements is a vital feature of the motor system to ensure safety. This behavior can be studied in the laboratory using the stop signal task. There remains ambiguity about whether a point-of-no-return exists, after which a response cannot be aborted. A separate question concerns whether motor system inhibition associated with attempted stopping persists when stopping is unsuccessful. We address these two questions using electromyography (EMG) in two stop signal task experiments. Experiment 1 (n = 24) involved simple right and left index finger responses in separate task blocks. Experiment 2 (n = 28) involved a response choice between the right index and pinky fingers. To evaluate the approximate point-of-no-return, we measured EMG in responding fingers during the 100 ms preceding the stop signal and observed significantly greater EMG amplitudes during failed than successful stop trials in both experiments. Thus, EMG differentiated failed from successful stopping prior to the stop signal, regardless of whether there was a response choice. To address whether motor inhibition persists after failed stopping, we assessed EMG peak-to-offset durations and slopes (i.e., the rate of EMG decline) for go, failed stop, and successful stop (partial response EMG) trials. EMG peak-to-offset was shorter and steeper in failed stop trials compared to go and successful stop partial response EMG trials, suggesting motor inhibition persists even when failing to stop. These findings indicate EMG is sensitive to a point at which participants can no longer successfully stop an ongoing movement and suggest the peak-to-offset time of response-related EMG activity during failed stopping reflects stopping-related inhibition.

">Population-level interactions among PV, SOM, and Pyramidal neurons in cortex</a></h4>

              
                The inhibitory neuron population of the cortex can be subdivided into multiple cell classes with highly specialized local circuitry, gene expression, and response properties. PV and SOM neurons are two nonoverlapping cell classes with distinct but interacting functional roles, that depend on brain state. Here, we have applied a simple approach to identify PV, SOM, and putative pyramidal (Pyr) neurons within the same mice. We imaged their spike-related calcium activity in the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) while mice voluntarily ran on a spherical treadmill. We then related the activity of the simultaneously imaged neurons to each other, revealing that the activity of all inhibitory neurons was positively correlated compared to the activity within the Pyr population, and correlations were strongest among neurons of the same type. Furthermore, these activity relationships decayed with distance when comparing Pyr and inhibitory neurons, but not PV and SOM neurons. Finally, we identified coordinated activity events that were mostly restricted to either the PV or the SOM population, and used dimensionality reduction tools to reveal that these PV and SOM events were associated with different activity states in the Pyr population. This methodology will be useful to study population-level interactions across cell types in cortical circuits, and how they depend on behavioral state and task engagement.

">Acute psilocybin enhances cognitive flexibility in rats</a></h4>

              
                Psilocybin has been shown to improve symptoms of depression and anxiety when combined with psychotherapy or other clinician-guided interventions. To understand the neural basis for this pattern of clinical efficacy, experimental and conceptual approaches that are different than traditional laboratory models of anxiety and depression are needed. A potential novel mechanism is that acute psilocybin improves cognitive flexibility, which then enhances the impact of clinician-assisted interventions. Consistent with this idea, we find that acute psilocybin robustly improves cognitive flexibility in male and female rats using a task where animals switched between previously learned strategies in response to uncued changes in the environment. Psilocybin did not influence Pavlovian reversal learning, suggesting that its cognitive effects are selective to enhanced switching between previously learned behavioral strategies. The serotonin (5HT) 2A receptor antagonist ketanserin blocked psilocybin's effect on set-shifting, while a 5HT2C-selective antagonist did not. Ketanserin alone also improved set-shifting performance, suggesting a complex relationship between psilocybin's pharmacology and its impact on flexibility. Further, the psychedelic drug 2,5-Dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine (DOI) impaired cognitive flexibility in the same task, suggesting that this effect of psilocybin does not generalize to all other serotonergic psychedelics. We conclude that the acute impact of psilocybin on cognitive flexibility provides a useful behavioral model to investigate its neuronal effects relevant to its positive clinical outcome.

                Remembering what just happened is a crucial prerequisite to form long-term memories but also for establishing and maintaining working memory. So far there is no general agreement about cortical mechanisms that support short-term memory. Using a classifier-based decoding approach, we report that hippocampal activity during few sparsely distributed brief time intervals contains information about the previous sensory motor experience of rodents. These intervals are characterized by only a small increase of firing rate of only a few neurons. These low-rate predictive patterns are present in both working memory and non-working memory tasks, in two rodent species, rats and Mongolian gerbils, are strongly reduced for rats with medial entorhinal cortex lesions, and depend on the familiarity of the sensory-motor context.

                The ability to form precise, episodic memories develops with age, with young children only able to form gist-like memories that lack precision. The cellular and molecular events in the developing hippocampus that underlie the emergence of precise, episodic-like memory formation are unclear. In mice, the absence of a competitive neuronal engram allocation process in the immature hippocampus precluded the formation of sparse engrams and precise memories until the fourth postnatal week, when inhibitory circuits in the hippocampus mature. This age-dependent shift in precision of episodic-like memories involved the functional maturation of parvalbumin-expressing interneurons in subfield CA1 by extracellular perineuronal nets which is necessary and sufficient for the onset of competitive neuronal allocation, sparse engram formation, and memory precision.

                Quantifying neural activity in natural conditions (i.e. conditions comparable to the standard clinical patient experience) during the administration of psychedelics may further our scientific understanding of the effects and mechanisms of action. This data may facilitate the discovery of novel biomarkers enabling more personalized treatments and improved patient outcomes. In this single-blind, placebo-controlled study with a non-randomized design, we use time-domain functional near-infrared spectroscopy (TD-fNIRS) to measure acute brain dynamics after intramuscular subanesthetic ketamine (0.75 mg/kg) and placebo (saline) administration in healthy participants (n = 15, 8 females, 7 males, age 32.4 +/- 7.5 years) in a clinical setting. We found that the ketamine administration caused an altered state of consciousness and changes in systemic physiology (e.g. increase in pulse rate and electrodermal activity). Furthermore, ketamine led to a brain-wide reduction in the fractional amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (fALFF), and a decrease in the global brain connectivity of the prefrontal region. Lastly, we provide preliminary evidence that a combination of neural and physiological metrics may serve as predictors of subjective mystical experiences and reductions in depressive symptomatology. Overall, our studies demonstrated the successful application of fNIRS neuroimaging to study the physiological effects of the psychoactive substance ketamine and can be regarded as an important step toward larger scale clinical fNIRS studies that can quantify the impact of psychedelics on the brain in standard clinical settings.

Such biomarkers may provide objective measures for evaluating novel therapeutic interventions in nonhuman primates often used in translational neuroimaging research. This study aimed to characterize the RSNs of awake squirrel monkeys and compare the characteristics of those networks in adolescent and adult subjects. Twenty-seven squirrel monkeys (n=12 adolescents [6 male/6 female] ~2.5 years and n=15 adults [7 male/8 female] ~9.5 years) were gradually acclimated to awake scanning procedures; whole-brain fMRI images were acquired with a 9.4 Tesla scanner. Group level independent component (IC) analysis (30 ICs) with dual regression was used to detect and compare RSNs. Twenty ICs corresponding to physiologically meaningful networks representing a range of neural functions, including motor, sensory, reward (e.g., basal ganglia), and cognitive processes were identified in both adolescent and adult monkeys. Significant age-related differences between the adult and adolescent subjects (adult > adolescent) were found in two networks of interest: (1) the right upper occipital region with an OFC IC and (2) the left temporal cortex, bilateral visual areas, and cerebellum with the cingulate IC. These results demonstrate that squirrel monkey RSNs are stable and consistent with RSNs previously identified in humans, rodents, and other nonhuman primate species. These data also identify several networks in adolescence that are conserved and others that may change into adulthood.

">Glial-dependent clustering of voltage-gated ion channels in Drosophila precedes myelin formation</a></h4>

              
                Neuronal information conductance depends on transmission of action potentials. The conductance of action potentials is based on three physical parameters: The axial resistance of the axon, the axonal insulation by glial membranes, and the positioning of voltage-gated ion channels. In vertebrates, myelin and channel clustering allow fast saltatory conductance. Here we show that in Drosophila melanogaster voltage-gated sodium and potassium channels, Para and Shal, co-localize and cluster in an area of motor axons resembling the axon initial segment. Para but not Shal localization depends on peripheral glia. In larvae, relatively low levels of Para channels are needed to allow proper signal transduction and nerves are simply wrapped by glial cells. In adults, the concentration of Para at the axon initial segment increases. Concomitantly, these axon domains are covered by a mesh of glial processes forming a lacunar structure that serves as an ion reservoir. Directly flanking the voltage-gated ion channel rich axon segment, the lacunar structures collapse forming a myelin-like insulation. Thus, Drosophila development may reflect the evolution of myelin which forms in response to increased levels of clustered voltage-gated ion channels.

">Astrocytic L-lactate signaling in the anterior cingulate cortex is essential for schema memory and neuronal mitochondrial biogenesis</a></h4>

              
                Astrocyte-derived L-lactate was shown to confer beneficial effects on synaptic plasticity and cognitive functions. However, how astrocytic Gi signaling in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) modulates L-lactate levels and schema memory is not clear. Here, using chemogenetic approach and well-established behavioral paradigm, we demonstrate that astrocytic Gi pathway activation in ACC causes significant impairment in flavor-place paired associates (PA) learning, schema formation, and PA memory retrieval in rats. It also impairs new PA learning even if a prior associative schema exists. These impairments were mediated by decreased L-lactate in ACC due to astrocytic Gi activation. Concurrent exogenous L-lactate administration bilaterally into the ACC rescues these impairments. Furthermore, we show that the impaired schema memory formation was associated with a decreased neuronal mitochondrial biogenesis caused by decreased L-lactate level in ACC upon Gi activation. Our study also reveals that L-lactate mediated mitochondrial biogenesis is dependent on monocarboxylate transporter 2 and NMDA receptor activity - discovering a previously unrecognized signaling role of L-lactate. These findings expand our understanding of the role of astrocytes and L-lactate in brain functions.

	<p>An encephalocele is a pathological brain herniation caused by osseous dural defects. Encephaloceles are known to be regions of epileptogenic foci. We describe the case of a 44-year-old woman with refractory epilepsy associated with a frontal skull base encephalocele. Epilepsy surgery for encephalocele resection was performed; however, the epilepsy was refractory. A second epilepsy surgery for frontal lobectomy using intraoperative electroencephalography was required to achieve adequate seizure control. Previous reports have shown that only encephalocele resection can result in good seizure control, and refractory epilepsy due to frontal lobe encephalocele has rarely been reported. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of frontal encephalocele plus epilepsy in which good seizure control using only encephalocele resection was difficult to achieve. Herein, we describe the possible mechanisms of encephalocele plus epilepsy and the surgical strategy for refractory epilepsy with encephalocele, including a literature review.</p>

	<p>Prism adaptation (PA) is a useful method to investigate short-term sensorimotor plasticity. Following active exposure to prisms, individuals show consistent after-effects, probing that they have adapted to the perturbation. Whether after-effects are transferable to another task or remain specific to the task performed under exposure, represents a crucial interest to understand the adaptive processes at work. Motor imagery (MI, i.e., the mental representation of an action without any concomitant execution) offers an original opportunity to investigate the role of cognitive aspects of motor command preparation disregarding actual sensory and motor information related to its execution. The aim of the study was to test whether prism adaptation through MI led to transferable after-effects. Forty-four healthy volunteers were exposed to a rightward prismatic deviation while performing actual (Active group) versus imagined (MI group) pointing movements, or while being inactive (inactive group). Upon prisms removal, in the MI group, only participants with the highest MI abilities (MI+ group) showed consistent after-effects on pointing and, crucially, a significant transfer to throwing. This was not observed in participants with lower MI abilities and in the inactive group. However, a direct comparison of pointing after-effects and transfer to throwing between MI+ and the control inactive group did not show any significant difference. Although this interpretation requires caution, these findings suggest that exposure to intersensory conflict might be responsible for sensory realignment during prism adaptation which could be transferred to another task. This study paves the way for further investigations into MI&amp;amp;rsquo;s potential to develop robust sensorimotor adaptation.</p>

	<p>Objective: To evaluate the potential of the first-trimester ultrasound (US) features for the detection of central nervous system (CNS) anomalies. Methods/Methodology: This is a prospective one-center three-year study. Unselected singleton pregnant women were examined using an extended first-trimester anomaly scan (FTAS) that included the CNS assessment: the calvaria shape, the septum (falx cerebri), the aspect of the lateral ventricles, the presence of the third ventricle and aqueduct of Sylvius (AS) and the posterior brain morphometry: the fourth ventricle, namely intracranial translucency (IT), brain stem/brain stem&amp;amp;ndash;occipital bone ratio (BS/BSOB) and cisterna magna (CM). The spine and underlying skin were also evaluated. The cases were also followed during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy and at delivery. FTAS efficiency to detect major CNS abnormalities was calculated. Results: We detected 17 cases with CNS major abnormalities in a population of 1943 first-trimester (FT) fetuses, including spina bifida with myelomeningocele, exencephaly-anencephaly, holoprosencephaly, hydrocephaly, cephalocele and Dandy-Walker malformation. The CNS features in the abnormal group are presented. In the second trimester (ST), we further diagnosed cases of corpus callosum agenesis, cerebellar hypoplasia, vein of Galen aneurysm and fetal infection features (ventriculomegaly, intraventricular bands, intraventricular cyst and hyperechoic foci), all declared normal at the FTAS. During the third trimester (TT) scan we identified a massive fetal cerebral haemorrhage absent at previous investigations. We report a detection rate of 72.7% of fetal brain anomalies in the FT using the proposed CNS parameters. The sensitivity of the examination protocol was 72.7%, and the specificity was 100%. Conclusion: A detailed FT CNS scan is feasible and efficient. The majority of cases of major CNS abnormalities can be detected early in pregnancy. The visualization rates of the CNS parameters in the FT are great with short, if any, additional investigation time. FT cerebral disorders such as haemorrhage or infections were missed in the FT even when an extended evaluation protocol was used.</p>

	<p>Suicide ideation and behaviors are major health issues in the field of mental health. Several psychological and psychosocial factors have been taken into account as possible predictors of suicidality. Only recently affective temperaments have been considered as possible factors linked to suicide. This study aims to investigate the relationship between affective temperaments and suicidality, including the lifetime onset of suicide ideation, lifetime presence of suicide attempts and the total number of lifetime suicide attempts. This is a naturalistic multicentric observational study, involving outpatient units of seven University sites in Italy. Patients were administered with the short version of TEMPS-M and the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale. A total of 653 participants were recruited, with a diagnosis of bipolar (55.7%), unipolar (35.8%) and cyclothymic disorder (8.4%). Regression models showed that the presence of lifetime suicide behaviors was increased in patients presenting trait related impulsivity (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001), poor free-interval functioning (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05), higher number of affective episodes (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01), higher number of hospitalizations (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001), cyclothymic and irritable affective temperaments (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05 and p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05, respectively). Conversely, the presence of hyperthymic affective disposition reduced the likelihood of having suicidal behaviors (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01). Lifetime suicidal ideation was associated with trait-related impulsivity (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), poor free-interval functioning (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05), higher number of affective episodes (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) and of hospitalizations (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). Depressive temperaments increased the likelihood of presenting suicidal ideation (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05), along with irritable temperaments (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01), contrary to hyperthymic affective (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). Results of the present study confirm that affective disposition has a significant impact on the onset of suicidal ideation and behaviors, and that affective dispositions should be assessed in clinical settings to identify people at risk of suicide. Moreover, a wider clinical evaluation, including different clinical psychopathological dimensions, should be taken into consideration to develop effective preventive interventions.</p>

	<p>Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) activates brain cells in a noninvasive manner and can be used for mapping brain motor functions. However, the complexity of the brain anatomy prevents the determination of the exact location of the stimulated sites, resulting in the limitation of the spatial resolution of multiple targets. The aim of this study is to map two neighboring muscles in cortical motor areas accurately and quickly. Multiple stimuli were applied to the subject using a TMS stimulator to measure the motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) in the corresponding muscles. For each stimulation condition (coil location and angle), the induced electric field (EF) in the brain was computed using a volume conductor model for an individualized head model of the subject constructed from magnetic resonance images. A post-processing method was implemented to determine a TMS hotspot using EF corresponding to multiple stimuli, considering the amplitude of the measured MEPs. The dependence of the computationally estimated hotspot distribution on two target muscles was evaluated (n = 11). The center of gravity of the first dorsal interosseous cortical representation was lateral to the abductor digiti minimi by a minimum of 2 mm. The localizations were consistent with the putative sites obtained from previous EF-based studies and fMRI studies. The simultaneous cortical mapping of two finger muscles was achieved with only several stimuli, which is one or two orders of magnitude smaller than that in previous studies. Our proposal would be useful in the preoperative mapping of motor or speech areas to plan brain surgery interventions.</p>

">Early life experience with natural odors modifies olfactory behavior through an associative process</a></h4>

              
                Past work has shown that chronic exposure of Drosophila to intense monomolecular odors in early life leads to homeostatic adaptation of olfactory neural responses and behavioral habituation to the familiar odor. Here, we found that, in contrast, persistent exposure to natural odors in early life increases behavioral attraction selectively to familiar odors. Odor experience increases the attractiveness of natural odors that are innately attractive and decreases the aversiveness of natural odors that are innately aversive. These changes in olfactory behavior are unlikely to arise from changes in the sensitivity of olfactory neurons at the first stages of olfactory processing: odor-evoked output from antennal lobe projection neurons was unchanged by chronic exposure to natural odors in terms of olfactory sensitivity, relational distances between odors, or response dynamics. We reveal a requirement for additional features of the environment beyond the odor in establishing odor experience-dependent behavioral plasticity. Passive odor exposure in a featureless environment lacking strong reinforcing cues was insufficient to elicit changes in olfactory preference; however, the same odor exposure resulted in behavioral plasticity when food was present in the environment. Together, these results indicate that behavioral plasticity elicited by persistent exposure to natural odors in early life is mediated by an associative process. In addition, they highlight the importance of using naturalistic odor stimuli for investigating olfactory function.

">Cortical astrocyte N-Methyl-D-Aspartate receptors influence whisker barrel activity and sensory discrimination</a></h4>

              
                Cortical astrocytes encode sensory information through their calcium dynamics, but it remains unclear if modulation of astrocyte calcium transients can change somatosensory circuits and behaviour in vivo. Here, we used a novel knockdown approach to selectively reduce astrocyte N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDAR). We found that these ionotropic receptors contribute to astrocyte Ca2+ transients encoding sensory information. This was essential for the optimal processing of sensory information in nearby neurons, since a reduction in astrocyte NMDARs caused circuit dysfunction and impaired neuronal responses to stimulation. This led to sensory discrimination deficits in the animal. Overall, our findings show that astrocytes can rapidly respond to glutamatergic transmission via their NMDAR and these receptors are an important component for astrocyte-neuron interactions that regulate cortical sensory discrimination in vivo.

">Electron transport chain RNAi in glutamate neurons extends life span, increases sleep, and decreases locomotor activity in Drosophila melanogaster</a></h4>

              
                RNAi targeting the electron transport chain has been proven to prolong life span in many different species, and experiments specifically with Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans have shown a distinct role for neurons. To determine which subset of neurons is implicated in this life span extension, we used the GAL4/UAS system to activate RNAi against genes of Complex I and Complex V. We found life span extension of 18 -- 24% with two glutamate neuron (D42 and VGlut) GAL4 lines. We used the GAL80 system to determine if the overlapping set of glutamate neurons in these two GAL4 lines imparts the life span extension. Limiting GAL4 activity to non-VGlut glutamate neurons in the D42 background failed to extend life span, suggesting that glutamate neurons have a unique role in aging. Interestingly, RNAi of the electron transport chain in D42 glutamate neurons also caused an increase in daytime and nighttime sleep and a decrease in nighttime locomotor activity. Changes to sleep patterns and prolonged life span were not accompanied by any changes in female fertility or response to starvation. Our findings demonstrate that a small subset of neurons can control life span, and further studies exploring the role of the electron transport chain in aging can be focused on the activity of glutamate neurons.

">Fully automated detection of dendritic spines in 3D live cell imaging data using deep convolutional neural networks</a></h4>

              
                Dendritic spines are considered a morphological proxy for excitatory synapses, rendering them a target of many different lines of research. Over recent years, it has become possible to image simultaneously large numbers of dendritic spines in 3D volumes of neural tissue. In contrast, currently no automated method for spine detection exists that comes close to the detection performance reached by human experts. However, exploiting such datasets requires new tools for the fully automated detection and analysis of large numbers of spines. Here, we developed an efficient analysis pipeline to detect large numbers of dendritic spines in volumetric fluorescence imaging data. The core of our pipeline is a deep convolutional neural network, which was pretrained on a general-purpose image library, and then optimized on the spine detection task. This transfer learning approach is data efficient while achieving a high detection precision. To train and validate the model we generated a labelled dataset using five human expert annotators to account for the variability in human spine detection. The pipeline enables fully automated dendritic spine detection and reaches a near human-level detection performance. Our method for spine detection is fast, accurate and robust, and thus well suited for large-scale datasets with thousands of spines. The code is easily applicable to new datasets, achieving high detection performance, even without any retraining or adjustment of model parameters.

">Defective phagocytosis leads to neurodegeneration through systemic increased innate immune signaling</a></h4>

              
                In nervous system development, disease and injury, neurons undergo programmed cell death, leaving behind cell corpses that are removed by phagocytic glia. Altered glial phagocytosis has been implicated in several neurological diseases including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and traumatic brain injury. To untangle the links between glial phagocytosis and neurodegeneration, we investigated Drosophila mutants lacking the phagocytic receptor Draper. Loss of Draper leads to persistent neuronal cell corpses and age-dependent neurodegeneration. Here we investigate whether the phagocytic defects observed in draper mutants lead to chronic increased immune activation that promotes neurodegeneration. A major immune response in Drosophila is the activation of two NF{kappa}B signaling pathways that produce antimicrobial peptides, primarily in the fat body. We found that the antimicrobial peptide Attacin-A is highly upregulated in the fat body of aged draper mutants and that inhibition of the Immune deficiency (Imd) pathway in the glia and fat body of draper mutants led to reduced neurodegeneration, indicating that immune activation promotes neurodegeneration in draper mutants. Taken together, these findings indicate that phagocytic defects lead to neurodegeneration via increased immune signaling, both systemically and locally in the brain.

">Temporal Dynamics of Activity in Default Mode Network Suggests a Role in Top-down processing</a></h4>

              
                The default mode network (DMN) is a collection of brain regions including midline frontal and parietal structures, medial and lateral temporal lobes, and lateral parietal cortex. Although there is evidence that the network can be subdivided into at least two subcomponents, the network reliably exhibits highly correlated activity both at rest and during task performance. Current understanding regarding the function of the DMN rests on a large body of research indicating that activity in the network decreases during task epochs of experimental paradigms relative to inter-trial intervals. A seeming contradiction arises when the experimental paradigm includes tasks involving autobiographical memory, thinking about one's self, planning for the future, or social cognition. In such cases, the DMN's activity increases and is correlated with attentional networks. Some have therefore concluded that the DMN supports advanced human cognitive abilities such as interoceptive processing and theory of mind. This conclusion may be called into question by evidence of correlated activity in homologous brain regions in other, even non-primate, species. Thus, there are contradictory findings related to the function of the DMN that have been difficult to integrate into a coherent theory regarding its function. Using data from the Human Connectome Project, we explore the temporal dynamics of activity in different regions of the DMN in relation to stimulus presentation. We show that generally the dorsal portion of the network exhibits only a transient initial decrease in activity at the start of trials that increases over trial duration. The ventral component often has more similarity in its time course to that of task-activated areas. We propose that task-associated ramping dynamics in the network are incompatible with a task-negative view of the DMN and propose the dorsal and ventral sub-components of network may rather work together to support bottom-up salience detection and subsequent top-down voluntary action. In this context, we re-interpret the body of anatomical and neurophysiological experimental evidence, arguing that this interpretation can accommodate the seeming contradictions regarding DMN function in the extant literature.

">How coupled slow oscillations, spindles and ripples control neuronal processing and communication during human sleep</a></h4>

              
                Learning and plasticity rely on fine-tuned regulation of neuronal circuits during offline periods. An unresolved puzzle is how the sleeping brain - in the absence of external stimulation or conscious effort - controls neuronal firing rates (FRs) and communication within and across circuits, supporting synaptic and systems consolidation. Using intracranial Electroencephalography (iEEG) combined with multiunit activity (MUA) recordings from the human hippocampus and surrounding medial temporal lobe (MTL) areas, we here show that governed by slow oscillation (SO) up-states, sleep spindles set a timeframe for ripples to occur. This sequential coupling leads to a stepwise increase in (i) neuronal FRs, (ii) short-latency cross-correlations among local neuronal assemblies and (iii) cross-regional MTL interactions. Triggered by SOs and spindles, ripples thus establish optimal conditions for spike-timing dependent plasticity and systems consolidation. These results unveil how the coordinated coupling of specific sleep rhythms orchestrates neuronal processing and communication during human sleep.

">The NO Answer for Autism Spectrum Disorder</a></h4>

              
                Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) include a range of developmental disorders that share a core of neurobehavioral deficits manifested by abnormalities in social interactions, deficits in communication, restricted interests, and repetitive behaviors. Several reports showed that mutations in different high-risk ASD genes, including SHANK3 and CNTNAP2, lead to ASD. However, to date, the underlying molecular mechanisms have not been deciphered, and no effective pharmacological treatment has been established for ASD. Recently, we reported a dramatic increase of nitric oxide (NO) in ASD mouse models. NO is a multifunctional neurotransmitter that plays a key role in different neurological disorders. However, its role in ASD has not yet been investigated. To reveal the novel molecular, cellular, and behavioral role of NO in ASD, we conducted multidisciplinary experiments using cellular and mouse models as well as clinical samples. First, we treated WT mice with an NO donor, which led to an autism-like phenotype. Next, we measured and found high levels of nitrosative stress biomarkers in both the Shank3 and Cntnap2 ASD mouse models. Treating both mouse models with a selective neuronal NO synthase (nNOS) inhibitor led to a reversal in the molecular, synaptic, and behavioral ASD phenotypes. Using a primary neuronal cell culture, we confirmed that NO is specifically involved in neurons in ASD pathology. Next, using genetic manipulations in the human SH-SY5Y cell line, we found that nNOS plays a key role in the pathology. Finally, we examined human plasma samples from 19 low-functioning ASD patients, compared to 20 typically developed volunteers, and found a significant elevation in the NO levels in the ASD patients. Furthermore, using the SNOTRAP technology, which is an innovative mass spectrometric method to identify the SNO-proteome (SNO: NO-mediated post-translational modification), we revealed that the complement systems in the synaptic and neuronal development processes are enriched in the ASD group. This work indicates, for the first time, that NO plays a pathological role in ASD development. Our findings will open future and novel directions to examine NO in diverse mutations on the autism spectrum as well as other neurodevelopmental disorders and psychiatric diseases. Most importantly, it suggests a novel treatment strategy for ASD.

                Transcranial low-intensity ultrasound is a promising neuromodulation modality, with the advantages of non-invasiveness, deep penetration, and high spatiotemporal accuracy. However, the underlying biological mechanism of ultrasonic neuromodulation remains unclear, hindering the development of efficacious treatments. Here, the well-known Piezo1, was studied through a conditional knockout mouse model as a major molecule for ultrasound neuromodulation ex vivo and in vivo. We showed that Piezo1 knockout in the right motor cortex of mice significantly reduced ultrasound-induced neuronal calcium responses, limb movement and muscle EMG responses. We also detected higher Piezo1 in the central amygdala (CEA) which were found more sensitive to ultrasound stimulation than that of cortex. Knocking out the Piezo1 in CEA neurons showed a significant reduction of response under ultrasound stimulation while knocking out astrocytic Piezo1 showed no obvious changes in neuronal responses. Additionally, we excluded an auditory confound by monitoring auditory cortical activation and using smooth waveform ultrasound with randomized parameters to stimulate P1KO ipsilateral and contralateral regions of the same brain and recording evoked movement in the corresponding limb. Thus, we demonstrate that Piezo1 is functionally expressed in different brain regions, and that it is an important mediator of ultrasound neuromodulation in the brain, laying the ground for further mechanistic studies of ultrasound.

                cAMP is a pivotal second messenger regulated by various upstream pathways including Ca2+ and G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). To decipher in vivo cAMP dynamics, we rationally designed cAMPinG1, an ultrasensitive genetically encoded green cAMP indicator that outperformed its predecessors in both dynamic range and cAMP affinity. Two-photon cAMPinG1 imaging detected cAMP transients in the somata and dendritic spines of neurons in the mouse visual cortex on the order of tens of seconds. In addition, multicolor imaging with a highly sensitive new red Ca2+ indicator RCaMP3 allowed simultaneous measurement of population patterns in Ca2+ and cAMP in hundreds of neurons. We identified Ca2+-induced cAMP responses that represented specific information, such as direction selectivity in vision and locomotion, as well as GPCR-induced cAMP responses. Overall, our multicolor suite revealed that information encoded in Ca2+ and GPCRs signaling is integrated and stored as cAMP transients for longer periods in vivo.

">Metabolite T1 relaxation times differ across the adult lifespan</a></h4>

              
                Purpose: To investigate the age-dependence of metabolite T1 relaxation times at 3T in both gray- and white-matter-rich voxels. Methods: This manuscript analyzes publicly available metabolite and metabolite-nulled (single inversion recovery TI = 600 ms) spectra acquired at 3T using PRESS localization. Voxels were placed in posterior cingulate cortex and centrum semiovale in 102 healthy volunteers across 5 decades of life (20s to 60s). All spectra were analyzed in Osprey v2.4.0. To estimate T1 relaxation times for tNAA2.0 and tCr3.0, the ratio of modeled metabolite residual amplitudes in the metabolite-nulled spectrum to the full metabolite signal was calculated using the single inversion recovery signal equation. Correlations between T1 and subject age were evaluated. Results: Spearman correlations revealed that estimated T1 relaxation times of tNAA2.0 (rs = -0.43; p < 0.001) and tCr3.0 (rs = -0.23; p = 0.021) decreased significantly with age in white-matter-rich CSO, and less steeply (and not significantly) for tNAA2.0 (rs = -0.15; p = 0.136) and tCr3.0 (rs = -0.10; p = 0.319) in gray-matter-rich PCC. Conclusion: The analysis harnessed a large publicly available cross-sectional dataset to test an important hypothesis, that metabolite T1 relaxation times change with age. This preliminary study stresses the importance of further work to measure age-normed metabolite T1 relaxation times for accurate quantification of metabolite levels in studies of aging.

                Three-dimensional (3D) neural cell cultures inherently lend themselves to high-throughput network electrophysiology studies addressing brain function in health and disease in a more realistic architectural complexity than two-dimensional neural networks. Epilepsy is the emblem of brain network disorders, as it reflects aberrant circuit reorganization and hyper-synchronization, resulting in sudden and uncontrolled electrical discharges (seizures). Modeling the features of epilepsy has so far relied on pharmacological, ionic or genetic manipulation of cells, ex-vivo brain tissue or intact animals, failing to recapitulate most of the epilepsies, which are triggered by unknown causes. Here, we report the spontaneous emergence of epileptiform patterns in spheroids of rodent primary hippocampal cells cultured in physiological condition, i.e., in the absence of a known initiating insult, detected by microelectrode array electrophysiology. Three distinct electrical phenotypes, i.e. interictal (between seizures), ictal (seizure) or mixed, arise from DIV10 to DIV35. In particular, the tonic-clonic ictal discharges become the most prominent at DIV28-35. These patterns exhibit electrographic and spectral features that strikingly resemble those observed in the hippocampus of in vitro and in vivo rodent epilepsy models, as well as of drug-resistant epileptic humans. Remarkably, not all spheroids exhibit full-blown ictal activity, bringing parallelism with the yet unanswered question of why a brain becomes epileptic and a seizure is generated. This evidence warrants caution against hippocampal cell-based therapies for regenerative purposes, as they may initiate epileptogenesis; at the same time, hippocampal spheroids lend themselves as reductionist model supporting high-throughput pre-clinical research on epileptic syndromes involving the hippocampus.

">Gene Expression Changes in Cultured Reactive Rat Astrocyte Models and Comparison to Device-Associated Effects in the Brain</a></h4>

              
                Implanted microelectrode arrays hold immense therapeutic potential for many neurodegenerative diseases. However, a foreign body response limits long-term device performance. Recent literature supports the role of astrocytes in the response to damage to the central nervous system (CNS) and suggests that reactive astrocytes exist on a spectrum of phenotypes, from beneficial to neurotoxic. The goal of our study was to gain insight into the subtypes of reactive astrocytes responding to electrodes implanted in the brain. In this study, we tested the transcriptomic profile of two reactive astrocyte culture models (cytokine cocktail or lipopolysaccharide, LPS) utilizing RNA sequencing, which we then compared to differential gene expression surrounding devices inserted into rat motor cortex via spatial transcriptomics. We interpreted changes in the genetic expression of the culture models to that of 24 hour, 1 week and 6 week rat tissue samples at multiple distances radiating from the injury site. We found overlapping expression of up to ~250 genes between in vitro models and in vivo effects, depending on duration of implantation. Cytokine-induced cells shared more genes in common with chronically implanted tissue ([&ge;]1 week) in comparison to LPS-exposed cells. We revealed localized expression of a subset of these intersecting genes (e.g., Serping1, Chi3l1, and Cyp7b1) in regions of device-encapsulating, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-expressing astrocytes identified with immunohistochemistry. We applied a factorization approach to assess the strength of the relationship between reactivity markers and the spatial distribution of GFAP-expressing astrocytes in vivo. We also provide lists of hundreds of differentially expressed genes between reactive culture models and untreated controls, and we observed 311 shared genes between the cytokine induced model and the LPS-reaction induced control model. Our results show that comparisons of reactive astrocyte culture models with spatial transcriptomics data can reveal new biomarkers of the foreign body response to implantable neurotechnology. These comparisons also provide a strategy to assess the development of in vitro models of the tissue response to implanted electrodes.

">A detailed input-output characterization of single neurons reveals the synaptic basis of spontaneous spiking in recurrent networks</a></h4>

              
                Self-sustained recurrent activity in cortical networks is thought to be important for multiple crucial processes, including circuit development and homeostasis. However, the precise relationship between synaptic input patterns and spiking output of individual neurons remains unresolved during spontaneous network activity. Here, using whole-network high-density microelectrode array (HD-MEA) recordings and patch clamping, we developed a novel experimental approach and analytical tools that provide a comprehensive long-term input-output characterization of individual neurons in cortical cell cultures. We found that, during in vivo-like network activity with excitation(E)-inhibition(I) balance, postsynaptic spiking coincided with the maxima of rapid, network state-dependent fluctuations in the input E/I ratio. Our approach also uncovered the underlying circuit architecture and we identified a few key inhibitory inputs -- often from special hub neurons -- that were instrumental in mediating these E/I ratio changes. Balanced network theory predicts dynamical regimes governed by input fluctuation and featuring a fast neuronal responsiveness. Our findings -- obtained in self-organized neuronal cultures -- suggest that the emergence of these favorable regimes and associated network architectures is an inherent property of all cortical networks.

">Activity Hierarchy Measurement to Establish Trace Memory-eligible "Primed" Neurons</a></h4>

              
                Episodic memory is thought to be preferentially encoded by sparsely distributed memory-eligible "primed" neurons with high excitability in memory-related regions. Based on in vivo calcium imaging on freely behaving mice, we developed an analytical method to determine the neuronal activity hierarchy and establish hippocampal primed neurons. Neurons with high activity and memory-associated burst synchronization are identified as primed neurons. When a trace fear memory is being formed or retrieved, the major pattern of the calcium dynamics is predominantly mediated by primed neurons and highly correlated with mouse freezing behaviors. In cilia knockout mice that exhibit severe learning deficits, the percentage of their primed neurons is drastically reduced, and any burst synchronization is strongly suppressed. Consistently, the first principal pattern of cilia knockout neurons does not fully distinguish itself from other minor components or correlate with mouse freezing behaviors. To reveal how a portion of neurons get primed, we developed a numerical model of a neural network that incorporates simulations of linear and non-linear weighting synaptic components, modeling AMPAR- and NMDAR-mediated conductances respectively. Moderate NMDAR to AMPAR ratios can naturally lead to the emergence of primed neurons. In such cases, the neuronal firing averages show a right-skewed log-distribution, similar to the distributions of hippocampal c-Fos expression and the activity levels measured by in vivo calcium imaging. In addition, High basal neuronal activity levels speed up the development of activity hierarchy during iterative computation. Together, this study reveals a novel method to measure neuronal activity hierarchy. Our simulation suggests that the accumulation of biased synaptic transmission mediated by the non-linear weighting synaptic component represents an important mechanism for neuronal priming.

">An axon - T cell feedback loop enhances inflammation and axon degeneration</a></h4>

              
                Inflammation is closely associated with many neurodegenerative disorders. Yet whether inflammation causes or exacerbates neurodegeneration has been challenging to define because the two processes are so closely linked. Here we disentangle inflammation from the axon damage it causes by individually blocking cytotoxic T cell function and axon degeneration. We model inflammatory damage in mouse skin, a barrier tissue that, despite frequent inflammation, must maintain proper functioning of a dense array of axon terminals. We show that sympathetic axons control skin inflammation through release of norepinephrine, which suppresses activation of gamma delta T cells via the beta2 adrenergic receptor. Strong inflammatory stimulation in the form of the toll like receptor 7 (TLR7) agonist imiquimod (IMQ) causes progressive gamma delta T cell-mediated, Sarm-1-dependent loss of these immunosuppressive sympathetic axons, a positive feedback loop that removes a physiological brake on T cells, resulting in enhanced inflammation and inflammatory axon damage.

">Diverging Parkinson's Disease Pathology between GBAN370S ,LRRK2G2019S and engineered SNCAA53T iPSC-derived Dopaminergic Neurons</a></h4>

              
                Multiple neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinson,s disease (PD) and Alzheimer,s disease-associated dementia (ADAD), are linked with dopaminergic (DA) neuron death and a resulting reduction in dopamine levels in the brain. DA neuron degeneration and the risk of developing PD is connected to genetic mutations affiliated with lysosomal function and protein degradation. Accessible human cellular models for PD-relevant genetic mutations are needed to investigate mechanisms of DA cell death and define points of therapeutic intervention. Human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived midbrain DA neurons offer a developmentally and physiologically relevant in vitro model for investigating PD pathogenic mechanisms across genetic backgrounds. In this study, we generated DA neurons using iPSCs from two clinically diagnosed PD patients, one harboring an inherited GBAN370S mutation and the other a mutation in LRRK2G2019S and compared pathophysiology against DA neurons from genetically engineered SNCAA53T iPSCs and its isogenic apparently healthy normal (AHN) iPSCs. Our results present a novel phenotype for GBAN370S and LRRK2G2019S derived DA neurons, showing that they produced and released significantly more dopamine compared to the AHN and SNCAA53T mutant DA neurons. All mutant DA neurons developed deficient glucocerebrosidase (GCase) activity, increased mitochondrial stress, aberrant neuronal activity patterns, and increased -synuclein accumulation. Together these data suggest potentially divergent origins of PD pathogenesis in GBAN370S and LRRK2G2019S DA neurons. In addition, compound screening confirmed that GCase modulators can rescue enzyme activity and impact neural activity across all DA mutant neurons, to varying degrees. These data demonstrate unique in vitro phenotypes associated with PD and suggest a diversity of underlying mechanisms across different genetic backgrounds. Together, the cell lines used in this study present a valuable tool for new therapeutic discovery.

">APOE4, Age & Sex Regulate Respiratory Plasticity Elicited By Acute Intermittent Hypercapnic-Hypoxia</a></h4>

              
                Rationale: Acute intermittent hypoxia (AIH) is a promising strategy to induce functional motor recovery following chronic spinal cord injuries and neurodegenerative diseases. Although significant results are obtained, human AIH trials report considerable inter-individual response variability. Objectives: Identify individual factors (e.g., genetics, age, and sex) that determine response magnitude of healthy adults to an optimized AIH protocol, acute intermittent hypercapnic-hypoxia (AIHH). Methods: Associations of individual factors with the magnitude of AIHH (15, 1-min O2=9.5%, CO2=5% episodes) induced changes in diaphragm motor-evoked potential amplitude (MEP) and inspiratory mouth occlusion pressures (P0.1) were evaluated in 17 healthy individuals (age=27{+/-}5 years) compared to Sham. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes linked with mechanisms of AIH induced phrenic motor plasticity (BDNF, HTR2A, TPH2, MAOA, NTRK2) and neuronal plasticity (apolipoprotein E, APOE) were tested. Variations in AIHH induced plasticity with age and sex were also analyzed. Additional experiments in humanized (h)ApoE knock-in rats were performed to test causality. Results: AIHH-induced changes in diaphragm MEP amplitudes were lower in individuals heterozygous for APOE4 (i.e., APOE3/4) allele versus other APOE genotypes (p=0.048). No significant differences were observed between any other SNPs investigated, notably BDNFval/met (all p>0.05). Males exhibited a greater diaphragm MEP enhancement versus females, regardless of age (p=0.004). Age was inversely related with change in P0.1 within the limited age range studied (p=0.007). In hApoE4 knock-in rats, AIHH-induced phrenic motor plasticity was significantly lower than hApoE3 controls (p<0.05). Conclusions: APOE4 genotype, sex and age are important biological determinants of AIHH-induced respiratory motor plasticity in healthy adults.

">Long timescale anti-directional rotation in Drosophila optomotor behavior</a></h4>

              
                Locomotor movements cause visual images to be displaced across the eye, a retinal slip that is counteracted by stabilizing reflexes in many animals. In insects, optomotor turning causes the animal to turn in the direction of rotating visual stimuli, thereby reducing retinal slip and stabilizing trajectories through the world. This behavior has formed the basis for extensive dissections of motion vision. Here, we report that under certain stimulus conditions, two Drosophila species, including the widely studied D. melanogaster, can suppress and even reverse the optomotor turning response over several seconds. Such 'anti-directional turning' is most strongly evoked by long-lasting, high-contrast, slow-moving visual stimuli that are distinct from those that promote syn-directional optomotor turning. Anti-directional turning, like the syn-directional optomotor response, requires the local motion detecting neurons T4 and T5; a subset of lobula plate tangential cells, CH cells, show involvement in these responses. Imaging from a variety of direction-selective cells in the lobula plate shows no evidence of dynamics that match the behavior, suggesting that the observed inversion in turning direction emerges downstream of the lobula plate. Further, anti-directional turning declines with age and exposure to light. These results show that Drosophila optomotor turning behaviors contain rich, stimulus-dependent dynamics that are inconsistent with simple reflexive stabilization responses.

                The detection and signaling of prediction errors is central to the theory of predictive processing. Experiments that alter the sensory outcome of an animal's behavior reveal enhanced neural responses to unexpected self-generated stimuli, including many neurons that do not respond to the same stimulus heard passively. These neurons may reflect the violation of a learned sensory-motor prediction, but could also emerge due to a combination of sound and movement in a way that is independent from expectation. Here, we train mice to expect the outcome of a simple sound-generating lever behavior and record neural responses to the expected sound and sounds that deviate from expectation in multiple distinct dimensions. Our data reveal suppression of expected sound responses that is specific across multiple stimulus dimensions simultaneously and stimulus-specific prediction error neurons that depend on sensory-motor expectations.

">Solving the spike sorting problem with Kilosort</a></h4>

              
                Spike sorting is the computational process of extracting the firing times of single neurons from recordings of local electrical fields. This is an important but hard problem in neuroscience, complicated by the non-stationarity of the recordings and the dense overlap in electrical fields between nearby neurons. To solve the spike sorting problem, we have continuously developed over the past eight years a framework known as Kilosort. This paper describes the various algorithmic steps introduced in different versions of Kilosort, which have not been described before. We also report the development of Kilosort4, a new version with substantially improved performance due to new clustering algorithms inspired by graph-based approaches. To test the performance of Kilosort, we developed a realistic simulation framework which uses densely sampled electrical fields from real experiments to generate non-stationary spike waveforms and realistic noise. We find that nearly all versions of Kilosort outperform other algorithms on a variety of simulated conditions, and Kilosort4 performs best in all cases, correctly identifying even neurons with low amplitudes and small spatial extents in high drift conditions.

">Autophagy Disruption Reduces mTORC1 Activation Leading to Retinal Ganglion Cell Neurodegeneration Associated with Glaucoma</a></h4>

              
                Autophagy dysfunction has been associated with several neurodegenerative diseases including glaucoma, characterized by the degeneration of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). However, the mechanisms by which autophagy dysfunction promotes RGC damage remain unclear. Here, we hypothesized that perturbation of the autophagy pathway results in increased autophagic demand, thereby downregulating signaling through mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), a negative regulator of autophagy, contributing to the degeneration of RGCs. We identified an impairment of autophagic-lysosomal degradation and decreased mTORC1 signaling via activation of the stress sensor adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), along with subsequent neurodegeneration in RGCs differentiated from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) with a glaucoma-associated variant of Optineurin (OPTN-E50K). Similarly, the microbead occlusion model of glaucoma resulting in ocular hypertension also exhibited autophagy disruption and mTORC1 downregulation. Pharmacological inhibition of mTORC1 in hPSC-derived RGCs recapitulated disease-related neurodegenerative phenotypes in otherwise healthy RGCs, while the mTOR-independent induction of autophagy reduced protein accumulation and restored neurite outgrowth in diseased OPTN-E50K RGCs. Taken together, these results highlight an important balance between autophagy and mTORC1 signaling essential for RGC homeostasis, while disruption to these pathways contributes to neurodegenerative features in glaucoma, providing a potential therapeutic target to prevent neurodegeneration.

">Young, but not in the Dark - the Influence of Reduced Lighting on Gait Stability in Middle-aged adults</a></h4>

              
                Background: The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of walking in reduced lighting with or without performing a secondary cognitive task on gait dynamics in middle-aged adults and to compare them with young and old adults. Methods: Twenty young (age 28.8{+/-}4.1), 20 middle-aged (age 50.2{+/-}4.4), and 19 elderly (age 70.7{+/-}4.2) subjects participated in the study. Subjects walked on an instrumented treadmill at a self-determined pace under four conditions in randomized order: (1) walking in usual lighting (1000 lumens); (2) walking in near-darkness (5 lumens); (3) walking in usual lighting with a serial-7 subtraction dual-task; and (4) walking in near-darkness with a serial-7 subtraction dual-task. Variability in stride time and variability in the trajectory of the center of pressure in the sagittal and frontal planes (anterior/posterior and lateral variability) were measured. Repeated measures ANOVA and post hoc analysis were used to determine the effects of age, lighting conditions, and cognitive task on each gait outcome. Results: Under usual lighting, stride time variability and anterior/posterior variability of the middle-aged subjects were similar to those of the young and lower than those of the old. The lateral variability of the middle-aged subjects was higher than that of young adults under both lighting conditions. Similar to the older adults, the middle-aged participants increased their stride time variability and anterior/posterior variability when walking in near-darkness, but they were the only ones to exhibit increased lateral variability in near-darkness. Young adult gait was not affected by lighting, and concurrent performance of a cognitive task while walking did not affect gait stability in all groups under any of the lighting conditions. Conclusions: Gait stability decreases in middle age when walking in the dark. Recognition of functional deficits in middle age could promote appropriate interventions to optimize aging and reduce fall risk.

">Tet-dependent 5-hydroxymethyl-Cytosine modification of mRNA regulates the axon guidance genes robo2 and slit in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Modifications of mRNA, especially methylation of adenosine, have recently drawn much attention. The much rarer modification, 5-hydroxymethylation of cytosine (5hmC), is not well understood and is the subject of this study. Vertebrate Tet proteins are 5-methylcytosine (5mC) hydroxylases enzymes catalyzing the transition of 5mC to 5hmC in DNA and have recently been shown to have the same function in messenger RNAs in both vertebrates and in Drosophila. The Tet gene is essential in Drosophila because Tet knock-out animals do not reach adulthood. We describe the identification of Tet-target genes in the embryo and larval brain by determining Tet DNA-binding sites throughout the genome and by mapping the Tet-dependent 5hmrC modifications transcriptome-wide. 5hmrC-modified sites can be found along the entire transcript and are preferentially located at the promoter where they overlap with histone H3K4me3 peaks. The identified mRNAs are frequently involved in neuron and axon development and Tet knock-out led to a reduction of 5hmrC marks on specific mRNAs. Among the Tet-target genes were the robo2 receptor and its slit ligand that function in axon guidance in Drosophila and in vertebrates. Tet knock-out embryos show overlapping phenotypes with robo2 and are sensitized to reduced levels of slit. Both Robo2 and Slit protein levels were markedly reduced in Tet KO larval brains. Our results establish a role for Tet-dependent 5hmrC in facilitating the translation of modified mRNAs, primarily in developing nerve cells.

">Scalable Apparatus to Measure Posture and Locomotion (SAMPL): a high-throughput solution to study unconstrained vertical behavior in small animals</a></h4>

              
                Balance and movement are impaired in a wide variety of neurological disorders. Recent advances in behavioral monitoring provide unprecedented access to posture and locomotor kinematics, but without the throughput and scalability necessary to screen candidate genes / potential therapeutics. We present a powerful solution: a Scalable Apparatus to Measure Posture and Locomotion (SAMPL). SAMPL includes extensible imaging hardware and low-cost open-source acquisition software with real-time processing. We first demonstrate that SAMPL's hardware and acquisition software can acquire data from three species (flies, worms, and zebrafish) as they move vertically. Next, we leverage SAMPL's throughput to rapidly (two weeks) gather a new zebrafish dataset. We use SAMPL's analysis and visualization tools to replicate and extend our current understanding of how zebrafish balance as they navigate through a vertical environment. Next, we discover (1) that key kinematic parameters vary systematically with genetic background, and (2) that such background variation is small relative to the changes that accompany early development. Finally, we simulate SAMPL's ability to resolve differences in posture or vertical navigation as a function of affect size and data gathered -- key data for screens. Taken together, our apparatus, data, and analysis provide a powerful solution for labs using small animals to investigate balance and locomotor disorders at scale. More broadly, SAMPL is both an adaptable resource for labs looking process videographic measures of behavior in real-time, and an exemplar of how to scale hardware to enable the throughput necessary for screening.

	<p>Nonspeech (or paraspeech) parameters are widely used in clinical assessment of speech impairment in persons with dysarthria (PWD). Virtually every standard clinical instrument used in dysarthria diagnostics includes nonspeech parameters, often in considerable numbers. While theoretical considerations have challenged the validity of these measures as markers of speech impairment, only a few studies have directly examined their relationship to speech parameters on a broader scale. This study was designed to investigate how nonspeech parameters commonly used in clinical dysarthria assessment relate to speech characteristics of dysarthria in individuals with movement disorders. Maximum syllable repetition rates, accuracies, and rates of isolated and repetitive nonspeech oral&amp;amp;ndash;facial movements and maximum phonation times were compared with auditory&amp;amp;ndash;perceptual and acoustic speech parameters. Overall, 23 diagnostic parameters were assessed in a sample of 130 patients with movement disorders of six etiologies. Each variable was standardized for its distribution and for age and sex effects in 130 neurotypical speakers. Exploratory Graph Analysis (EGA) and Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) were used to examine the factor structure underlying the diagnostic parameters. In the first analysis, we tested the hypothesis that nonspeech parameters combine with speech parameters within diagnostic dimensions representing domain&amp;amp;ndash;general motor control principles. In a second analysis, we tested the more specific hypotheses that diagnostic parameters split along effector (lip vs. tongue) or functional (speed vs. accuracy) rather than task boundaries. Our findings contradict the view that nonspeech parameters currently used in dysarthria diagnostics are congruent with diagnostic measures of speech characteristics in PWD.</p>

	<p>Schizophrenia is a mental disorder characterized by both abnormal time perception and atypical relationships with external factors. Here we compare the influence of external photic stimulation on time production between healthy subjects (n = 24) and patients with schizophrenia (n = 22). To delve into neuropsychological mechanisms of such a relationship, the EEG was recorded during variable conditions: during production of 10 s intervals; during photic stimulation of 4, 9, 16, and 25 Hz; and during combinations of these conditions. We found that the higher frequency of photic stimulation influenced the production of time intervals in healthy volunteers, which became significantly longer and were accompanied by corresponding EEG changes. The impact of photic stimulation was absent in patients with schizophrenia. In addition, the time production was characterized by less accuracy and the absence of EEG dynamics typical for healthy controls that included an increase in alpha2 power and envelope frequency. Our findings indicated that the time perception was not adjusted by external factors in patients with schizophrenia and might have involved cognitive and mental processes different from those of healthy volunteers.</p>

	<p>Conversation enables the sharing of our subjective experiences through verbalizing introspected thoughts and feelings. The mentalizing network represents introspection, and successful conversation is characterized by alignment through imitation mediated by the mirror neuron system (MNS). Therefore, we hypothesized that the interaction between the mentalizing network and MNS mediates the conversational exchange of introspection. To test this, we performed hyperscanning functional magnetic resonance imaging during structured real-time conversations between 19 pairs of healthy participants. The participants first evaluated their preference for and familiarity with a presented object and then disclosed it. The control was the object feature identification task. When contrasted with the control, the preference/familiarity evaluation phase activated the dorso-medial prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, precuneus, left hippocampus, right cerebellum, and orbital portion of the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), which represents introspection. The left IFG was activated when the two participants&amp;amp;rsquo; statements of introspection were mismatched during the disclosure. Disclosing introspection enhanced the functional connectivity of the left IFG with the bilateral superior temporal gyrus and primary motor cortex, representing the auditory MNS. Thus, the mentalizing system and MNS are hierarchically linked in the left IFG during a conversation, allowing for the sharing of introspection of the self and others.</p>

	<p>Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a disabling disease that affects not only the patient&amp;amp;rsquo;s health-related quality of life (HRQoL), but also causes a high caregiver burden (CGB). The aim of this study was to evaluate HRQoL, CGB, and their predictors in SMA. In two prospective, cross-sectional, and multi-center studies, SMA patients (n = 39) and SMA patient/caregiver couples (n = 49) filled in the EuroQoL Five Dimension Five Level Scale (EQ-5D-5L) and the Short Form Health Survey 36 (SF-36). Caregivers (CGs) additionally answered the Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI) and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Patients were clustered into two groups with either low or high HRQoL (EQ-5D-5L index value &amp;amp;lt;0.259 or &amp;amp;gt;0.679). The latter group was mostly composed of ambulatory type III patients with higher motor/functional scores. More severely affected patients reported low physical functioning but good mental health and vitality. The CGB (mean ZBI = 22/88) correlated negatively with patients&amp;amp;rsquo; motor/functional scores and age. Higher CGB was associated with a lower HRQoL, higher depression and anxiety, and more health impairments of the CGs. We conclude that patient and CG well-being levels interact closely, which highlights the need to consider the health of both parties while evaluating novel treatments.</p>

	<p>Even if usually needed to achieve the gross total resection (GTR) of spinal benign nerve sheath tumors (NSTs), nerve root sacrifice remains controversial regarding the risk of neurological deficit. For foraminal NSTs, we hypothesize that the involved root is poorly functional and thus can be safely sacrificed. All spinal benign NSTs with foraminal extension that underwent surgery from 2013 to 2021 were reviewed. The impacts of preoperative clinical status and patient and tumor characteristics on long-term outcomes were analyzed. Twenty-six patients were included, with a mean follow-up (FU) of 22.4 months. Functional motor roots (C5-T1, L3-S1) were involved in 14 cases. The involved nerve root was routinely sacrificed during surgery and GTR was obtained in 84.6% of cases. In the functional root subgroup, for patients with a pre-existing deficit (n = 5/14), neurological aggravation persisted in one case at last FU (n = 1/5), whereas for those with no preop deficit (n = 9/14), a postoperative deficit persisted in one patient only (n = 1/9). Preoperative radicular pain was the only characteristic significantly associated with an immediate postoperative motor deficit (p = 0.03). The sacrifice of an involved nerve root in foraminal NSTs seems to represent a reasonable and relevant option to resect these tumors, permitting one to achieve tumor resection in an oncologic fashion with a high rate of GTR.</p>

                <p>The tuning properties of neurons in the visual system can be contextually modulated by the statistics of the area surrounding their receptive field (RF), particularly when the surround contains natural features. However, stimuli presented in specific egocentric locations may have greater behavioral relevance, raising the possibility that the extent of contextual modulation may vary with position in visual space. To explore this possibility, we utilized the small size and optical transparency of the larval zebrafish to describe the form and spatial arrangement of contextually modulated cells throughout an entire tectal hemisphere. We found that the spatial tuning of tectal neurons to a prey-like stimulus sharpens when the stimulus is presented against a background with the statistics of complex natural scenes, relative to a featureless background. These neurons are confined to a spatially restricted region of the tectum and have receptive fields centered within a region of visual space in which the presence of prey preferentially triggers hunting behavior. Our results suggest that contextual modulation of tectal neurons by complex backgrounds may facilitate prey-localization in cluttered visual environments.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Sleep facilitates memory storage and even brief periods of sleep loss lead to impairments in memory, particularly memories that are hippocampus dependent. In previous studies, we have shown that the deficit in memory seen after sleep loss is accompanied by deficits in synaptic plasticity. Our previous work has also found that sleep deprivation (SD) is associated with reduced levels of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) in the hippocampus and that the reduction of cAMP mediates the diminished memory observed in sleep-deprived animals. Based on these findings, we hypothesized that cAMP acts as a mediator for not only the cognitive deficits caused by sleep deprivation, but also the observed deficits in synaptic plasticity. In this study, we expressed the heterologous <I>Drosophila melanogaster</I> G&alpha;s-protein-coupled octopamine receptor (DmOct&beta;1R) in mouse hippocampal neurons. This receptor is selectively activated by the systemically injected ligand (octopamine), thus allowing us to increase cAMP levels in hippocampal neurons during a 5-h sleep deprivation period. Our results show that chemogenetic enhancement of cAMP during the period of sleep deprivation prevents deficits in a persistent form of long-term potentiation (LTP) that is induced at the Schaffer collateral synapses in the hippocampal CA1 region. We also found that elevating cAMP levels in either the first or second half of sleep deprivation successfully prevented LTP deficits. These findings reveal that cAMP-dependent signaling pathways are key mediators of sleep deprivation at the synaptic level. Targeting these pathways could be useful in designing strategies to prevent the impact of sleep loss.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>The noradrenergic locus coeruleus (LC) is among the earliest sites of tau and &alpha;-synuclein pathology in Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease (AD) and Parkinson&rsquo;s disease (PD), respectively. The onset of these pathologies coincides with loss of noradrenergic fibers in LC target regions and the emergence of prodromal symptoms including sleep disturbances and anxiety. Paradoxically, these prodromal symptoms are indicative of a noradrenergic hyperactivity phenotype, rather than the predicted loss of norepinephrine (NE) transmission following LC damage, suggesting the engagement of complex compensatory mechanisms. Because current therapeutic efforts are targeting early disease, interest in the LC has grown, and it is critical to identify the links between pathology and dysfunction. We employed the LC-specific neurotoxin N-(2-chloroethyl)-N-ethyl-2-bromobenzylamine (DSP-4), which preferentially damages LC axons, to model early changes in the LC-NE system pertinent to AD and PD in male and female mice. DSP-4 (two doses of 50 mg/kg, one week apart) induced LC axon degeneration, triggered neuroinflammation and oxidative stress, and reduced tissue NE levels. There was no LC cell death or changes to LC firing, but transcriptomics revealed reduced expression of genes that define noradrenergic identity and other changes relevant to neurodegenerative disease. Despite the dramatic loss of LC fibers, NE turnover and signaling were elevated in terminal regions and were associated with anxiogenic phenotypes in multiple behavioral tests. These results represent a comprehensive analysis of how the LC-NE system responds to axon/terminal damage reminiscent of early AD and PD at the molecular, cellular, systems, and behavioral levels, and provides potential mechanisms underlying prodromal neuropsychiatric symptoms.</p>

                Background: Post-prostatectomy urinary incontinence (PPI) is a bothersome complication affecting patients undergoing prostate surgery that in up 10% of cases will require an invasive treatment with fixed slings or artificial urinary sphincters (AUS). Although fixed slings have several advantages over AUS, failure rates after slings range between 15% and 45% while current knowledge of predictors of sling efficacy remains limited. By systematically combining and summarizing all relevant literature, the present review and meta-analysis aim to address this research need assessing the association between preoperative risk factors and sling failure. Methods: Studies pertaining to fixed synthetic male perineal slings as treatment for adult male suffering from PPI, will be included. A systematic search will be conducted in PubMED, Scopus, Web of Science and Cochrane databases, and in the reference lists of retrieved articles. Independent reviewers will conduct study selection and data extraction. Outcomes will include failure to achieve the continence cure and overall success (cure plus improvement), measured as per included studies. Exposures will include any preoperative variables evaluated for association with sling failure. The QUIPS tool will be used for study quality assessment and a random-effects DerSimonian-Laird model, with Hartung-Knapp adjustment, will be used to pool adjusted and unadjusted odds ratios separately. Sensitivity analysis will be performed using the leave-one-out methodology and subgroup meta-analyses based on pre-specified studies’ characteristics will be conducted to explain the heterogeneity. Certainty of evidence will be assessed according to GRADE methodology and review reporting will comply with the PRISMA-P statement. Discussion: By summarising all relevant literature in the field, our results will help to incorporate available evidence into clinical practice assisting healthcare professionals managing PPI patients in treatment decision-making. The present review will also provide researchers with the necessary, evidence-based groundwork to perform future high-quality prognostic studies in the field. Registration: CRD42022307160.

                Background: Empathy in the context of healthcare is an immersion experience to comprehend patients' viewpoints, feelings, and emotions, without passing judgment, to ensure they receive the necessary treatment to feel comfortable. Empathy for others must be possessed by healthcare professionals and healthcare students as healthcare professionals’ candidates, including the pharmacy student. This study aimed to identify and assess the determinants related to pharmacy students' empathy. Methods: Three electronic databases were used for the first searches. We used peer-reviewed original papers, full text, must assess determinants that are associated with pharmacy students' empathy, and only be focused on pharmacy students (first to the fourth year) as healthcare professionals candidates. We utilized Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Checklists to observe the quality of published publications and reduce bias. Results: This review examined 14 papers that reported on determinants connected to pharmacy students' empathy. Nine studies evaluated the association between sex and the level of empathy, seven studies reported educational intervention, four studies discussed the year of study, two studies explained the type of school, four studies evaluated experience, and others determinants that discussed in the included studies were career preference, intercultural sensitivity, stigma, altruism, grit, self-awareness, marital status, and family income Conclusions: Educational intervention, experience, gender or sex, type of school, year of study, intercultural sensitivity, career preference, altruism, grit, self-awareness, marital status, and family income, can all have a positive impact on increased empathy among pharmacy students. We acknowledge that the included studies are heterogeneous, indicating that additional studies are necessary before reaching any firm conclusions. More research is needed to properly understand how empathy can be improved with the most effective pharmacy educational strategies. Higher levels of evidence are also required in studies to address the potential bias caused using self-report questionnaires, as well as other potential biases and inaccuracies.

                Background: The University of Rwanda is the only African residency to have implemented the pediatric International In-Training Examination (I-ITE) as a tool to monitor resident knowledge acquisition. The objective of this study was to better understand the acceptance and relevance of this exam to residents from this setting and their perceptions regarding this assessment tool. Methods: A retrospective, survey-study was undertaken to describe candidate feedback. Immediately on completing the I-ITE residents provided feedback by filling in an electronic questionnaire comprised of four closed Likert questions and an open text box for free-text feedback. Participants were pediatric residents from the University of Rwanda, the only university in Rwanda with a pediatric residency program. Quantitative analysis of the Likert questions was undertaken descriptively using SPSS. Free-text feedback was coded and analysed employing a phenomenological approach, with coding and analysis undertaken by two researchers. Results: Eighty-four residents completed a total of 213 I-ITE sittings during the five exam cycles undertaken during the study period. The survey was completed after 206 of the 213 exam sittings, giving a response rate of 97%.  Five themes emerged from the qualitative analysis; 1) undertaking the I-ITE was a positive experience; 2) exam content; 3) formative nature of the assessment; 4) challenges to completing the exam; 5) practicalities to undertaking the exam. Conclusion: Qualitative feedback demonstrates that the I-ITE, a standardized, and independent exam, produced by the American Board of Pediatrics, was valued and well accepted by Rwanda pediatric residents. Its formative nature and the breadth and quality of the questions were reported to positively contribute to the residents' formative development.

                Introduction and importance: This report details the clinical features and management in a case of Descemet stripping automated endothelial keratoplasty (DSAEK) which had primary graft failure (PGF) due to an inverted yet attached lenticule. Presentation of case: A 66-year-old gentleman had poor visual recovery in the right eye after undergoing cataract surgery 12 years prior to presentation. The visual acuity was counting fingers and examination revealed endothelial decompensation. The patient underwent a DSAEK and postoperatively had a well attached lenticule. However, the cornea was edematous three weeks after the surgery and optical coherence tomography (OCT) revealed a reversed lenticule. The patient underwent a repeat DSAEK and had an uneventful postoperative course. The visual acuity was 20/40 after 7 months with a clear cornea and a well attached graft. Discussion: PGF is a rare complication following DSAEK which occurs due to poor endothelial function of the donor graft. Insertion of a reversed lenticule may get overlooked as a cause of PGF unless the graft edge profile is examined on an OCT scan. The graft in the current case was well attached despite its inverted position suggesting that graft adherence is perhaps not a function of the corneal endothelial pumps in isolation and may be driven by factors such as the intraocular pressure. Conclusion: A reversed DSAEK lenticule may have normal adherence to the host stroma and must be considered in cases with PGF. OCT of the graft edge is required for diagnosis before performing a repeat keratoplasty.

Summary <p>The survival path mapping approach has been proposed for dynamic prognostication of cancer patients using time-series survival data. The SurvivalPath R package was developed to facilitate building personalized survival path models. The package contains functions to convert time-series data into time-slices data by fixed interval based on time information of input medical records. After the pre-processing of data, under a user-defined parameters on covariates, significance level, minimum bifurcation sample size and number of time slices for analysis, survival paths can be computed using the main function, which can be visualized as a tree diagram, with important parameters annotated. The package also includes function for analyzing the connections between exposure/treatment and node transitions, and function for screening patient subgroup with specific features, which can be used for further exploration analysis. In this study, we demonstrate the application of this package in a large dataset of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, which is embedded in the package. The SurvivalPath R package is freely available from CRAN, with source code and documentation hosted at https://github.com/zhangt369/SurvivalPath.</p>

                <p>by Gian Luca Lancia, Mattia Eluchans, Marco D’Alessandro, Hugo J. Spiers, Giovanni Pezzulo</p>

When faced with navigating back somewhere we have been before we might either retrace our steps or seek a shorter path. Both choices have costs. Here, we ask whether it is possible to characterize formally the choice of navigational plans as a <i>bounded rational</i> process that trades off the quality of the plan (e.g., its length) and the cognitive cost required to find and implement it. We analyze the navigation strategies of two groups of people that are firstly trained to follow a "default policy" taking a route in a virtual maze and then asked to navigate to various known goal destinations, either in the way they want ("Go To Goal") or by taking novel shortcuts ("Take Shortcut"). We address these wayfinding problems using InfoRL: an information-theoretic approach that formalizes the cognitive cost of devising a navigational plan, as the informational cost to deviate from a well-learned route (the "default policy"). In InfoRL, optimality refers to finding the best trade-off between route length and the amount of control information required to find it. We report five main findings. First, the navigational strategies automatically identified by InfoRL correspond closely to different routes (optimal or suboptimal) in the virtual reality map, which were annotated by hand in previous research. Second, people deliberate more in places where the value of investing cognitive resources (i.e., relevant goal information) is greater. Third, compared to the group of people who receive the "Go To Goal" instruction, those who receive the "Take Shortcut" instruction find shorter but less optimal solutions, reflecting the intrinsic difficulty of finding optimal shortcuts. Fourth, those who receive the "Go To Goal" instruction modulate flexibly their cognitive resources, depending on the benefits of finding the shortcut. Finally, we found a surprising amount of variability in the choice of navigational strategies and resource investment across participants. Taken together, these results illustrate the benefits of using InfoRL to address navigational planning problems from a bounded rational perspective.

<i>k</i>-mer-based distances are often used to describe the differences between communities in metagenome sequencing studies because of their computational convenience and history of effectiveness. Although <i>k</i>-mer-based distances do not use information about taxon abundances, we show that one class of <i>k</i>-mer distances between metagenomes (the Euclidean distance between <i>k</i>-mer spectra, or EKS distances) are very closely related to a class of phylogenetically-informed <i>β</i>-diversity measures that do explicitly use both the taxon abundances and information about the phylogenetic relationships among the taxa. Furthermore, we show that both of these distances can be interpreted as using certain features of the taxon abundances that are related to the phylogenetic tree. Our results allow practitioners to perform phylogenetically-informed analyses when they only have <i>k</i>-mer data available and provide a theoretical basis for using <i>k</i>-mer spectra with relatively small values of <i>k</i> (on the order of 4-5). They are also useful for analysts who wish to know more of the properties of any method based on <i>k</i>-mer spectra and provide insight into one class of phylogenetically-informed <i>β</i>-diversity measures.

In recent years, unsupervised analysis of microbiome data, such as microbial network analysis and clustering, has increased in popularity. Many new statistical and computational methods have been proposed for these tasks. This multiplicity of analysis strategies poses a challenge for researchers, who are often unsure which method(s) to use and might be tempted to try different methods on their dataset to look for the “best” ones. However, if only the best results are selectively reported, this may cause over-optimism: the “best” method is overly fitted to the specific dataset, and the results might be non-replicable on validation data. Such effects will ultimately hinder research progress. Yet so far, these topics have been given little attention in the context of unsupervised microbiome analysis. In our illustrative study, we aim to quantify over-optimism effects in this context. We model the approach of a hypothetical microbiome researcher who undertakes four unsupervised research tasks: clustering of bacterial genera, hub detection in microbial networks, differential microbial network analysis, and clustering of samples. While these tasks are unsupervised, the researcher might still have certain expectations as to what constitutes interesting results. We translate these expectations into concrete evaluation criteria that the hypothetical researcher might want to optimize. We then randomly split an exemplary dataset from the American Gut Project into discovery and validation sets multiple times. For each research task, multiple method combinations (e.g., methods for data normalization, network generation, and/or clustering) are tried on the discovery data, and the combination that yields the best result according to the evaluation criterion is chosen. While the hypothetical researcher might only report this result, we also apply the “best” method combination to the validation dataset. The results are then compared between discovery and validation data. In all four research tasks, there are notable over-optimism effects; the results on the validation data set are worse compared to the discovery data, averaged over multiple random splits into discovery/validation data. Our study thus highlights the importance of validation and replication in microbiome analysis to obtain reliable results and demonstrates that the issue of over-optimism goes beyond the context of statistical testing and fishing for significance.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1010818">A quantitative model for human neurovascular coupling with translated mechanisms from animals</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Sebastian Sten, Henrik Podéus, Nicolas Sundqvist, Fredrik Elinder, Maria Engström, Gunnar Cedersund</p>

Neurons regulate the activity of blood vessels through the neurovascular coupling (NVC). A detailed understanding of the NVC is critical for understanding data from functional imaging techniques of the brain. Many aspects of the NVC have been studied both experimentally and using mathematical models; various combinations of blood volume and flow, local field potential (LFP), hemoglobin level, blood oxygenation level-dependent response (BOLD), and optogenetics have been measured and modeled in rodents, primates, or humans. However, these data have not been brought together into a unified quantitative model. We now present a mathematical model that describes all such data types and that preserves mechanistic behaviors between experiments. For instance, from modeling of optogenetics and microscopy data in mice, we learn cell-specific contributions; the first rapid dilation in the vascular response is caused by NO-interneurons, the main part of the dilation during longer stimuli is caused by pyramidal neurons, and the post-peak undershoot is caused by NPY-interneurons. These insights are translated and preserved in all subsequent analyses, together with other insights regarding hemoglobin dynamics and the LFP/BOLD-interplay, obtained from other experiments on rodents and primates. The model can predict independent validation-data not used for training. By bringing together data with complementary information from different species, we both understand each dataset better, and have a basis for a new type of integrative analysis of human data.

                <p>by Nicola Catenacci Volpi, Martin Greaves, Dari Trendafilov, Christoph Salge, Giovanni Pezzulo, Daniel Polani</p>

The mastery of skills, such as balancing an inverted pendulum, implies a very accurate control of movements to achieve the task goals. Traditional accounts of skilled action control that focus on either routinization or perceptual control make opposite predictions about the ways we achieve mastery. The notion of routinization emphasizes the decrease of the variance of our actions, whereas the notion of perceptual control emphasizes the decrease of the variance of the states we visit, but not of the actions we execute. Here, we studied how participants managed control tasks of varying levels of difficulty, which consisted of controlling inverted pendulums of different lengths. We used information-theoretic measures to compare the predictions of alternative accounts that focus on routinization and perceptual control, respectively. Our results indicate that the successful performance of the control task strongly correlates with the decrease of state variability and the increase of action variability. As postulated by perceptual control theory, the mastery of skilled pendulum control consists in achieving stable control of goals by flexible means.

                <p>by Jason Asher, Annabelle Lemenuel-Diot, Matthew Clay, David P. Durham, Luis Mier-y-Teran-Romero, Carlos J. Arguello, Sebastien Jolivet, Diana Y. Wong, Klaus Kuhlbusch, Barry Clinch, Jean-Eric Charoin</p>

To aid understanding of the effect of antiviral treatment on population-level influenza transmission, we used a novel pharmacokinetic–viral kinetic transmission model to test the correlation between nasal viral load and infectiousness, and to evaluate the impact that timing of treatment with the antivirals oseltamivir or baloxavir has on influenza transmission. The model was run under three candidate profiles whereby infectiousness was assumed to be proportional to viral titer on a natural-scale, log-scale, or dose–response model. Viral kinetic profiles in the presence and absence of antiviral treatment were compared for each individual (N = 1000 simulated individuals); subsequently, viral transmission mitigation was calculated. The predicted transmission mitigation was greater with earlier administration of antiviral treatment, and with baloxavir versus oseltamivir. When treatment was initiated 12–24 hours post symptom onset, the predicted transmission mitigation was 39.9–56.4% for baloxavir and 26.6–38.3% for oseltamivir depending on the infectiousness profile. When treatment was initiated 36–48 hours post symptom onset, the predicted transmission mitigation decreased to 0.8–28.3% for baloxavir and 0.8–19.9% for oseltamivir. Model estimates were compared with clinical data from the BLOCKSTONE post-exposure prophylaxis study, which indicated the log-scale model for infectiousness best fit the observed data and that baloxavir affords greater reductions in secondary case rates compared with neuraminidase inhibitors. These findings suggest a role for baloxavir and oseltamivir in reducing influenza transmission when treatment is initiated within 48 hours of symptom onset in the index patient.

The relationship between neuronal activity and computations embodied by it remains an open question. We develop a novel methodology that condenses observed neuronal activity into a quantitatively accurate, simple, and interpretable model and validate it on diverse systems and scales from single neurons in <i>C. elegans</i> to fMRI in humans. The model treats neuronal activity as collections of interlocking 1-dimensional trajectories. Despite their simplicity, these models accurately predict future neuronal activity and future decisions made by human participants. Moreover, the structure formed by interconnected trajectories—a scaffold—is closely related to the computational strategy of the system. We use these scaffolds to compare the computational strategy of primates and artificial systems trained on the same task to identify specific conditions under which the artificial agent learns the same strategy as the primate. The computational strategy extracted using our methodology predicts specific errors on novel stimuli. These results show that our methodology is a powerful tool for studying the relationship between computation and neuronal activity across diverse systems.

                <p>by Junping Li, Lin Gao, Yusen Ye</p>

Structural variations (SVs) play an essential role in the evolution of human genomes and are associated with cancer genetics and rare disease. High-throughput chromosome capture (Hi-C) technology probed all genome-wide crosslinked chromatin to study the spatial architecture of chromosomes. Hi-C read pairs can span megabases, making the technology useful for detecting large-scale SVs. So far, the identification of SVs from Hi-C data is still in the early stages with only a few methods available. Especially, no algorithm has been developed that can detect SVs without control samples. Therefore, we developed HiSV (Hi-C for Structural Variation), a control-free method for identifying large-scale SVs from a Hi-C sample. Inspired by the single image saliency detection model, HiSV constructed a saliency map of interaction frequencies and extracted saliency segments as large-scale SVs. By evaluating both simulated and real data, HiSV not only detected all variant types, but also achieved a higher level of accuracy and sensitivity than existing methods. Moreover, our results on cancer cell lines showed that HiSV effectively detected eight complex SV events and identified two novel SVs of key factors associated with cancer development. Finally, we found that integrating the result of HiSV helped the WGS method to identify a total number of 94 novel SVs in two cancer cell lines.

Inferring gene co-expression networks is a useful process for understanding gene regulation and pathway activity. The networks are usually undirected graphs where genes are represented as nodes and an edge represents a significant co-expression relationship. When expression data of multiple (<i>p</i>) genes in multiple (<i>K</i>) conditions (e.g., treatments, tissues, strains) are available, joint estimation of networks harnessing shared information across them can significantly increase the power of analysis. In addition, examining condition-specific patterns of co-expression can provide insights into the underlying cellular processes activated in a particular condition. Condition adaptive fused graphical lasso (CFGL) is an existing method that incorporates condition specificity in a fused graphical lasso (FGL) model for estimating multiple co-expression networks. However, with computational complexity of <i>O</i>(<i>p</i><sup>2</sup><i>K</i> log <i>K</i>), the current implementation of CFGL is prohibitively slow even for a moderate number of genes and can only be used for a maximum of three conditions. In this paper, we propose a faster alternative of CFGL named rapid condition adaptive fused graphical lasso (RCFGL). In RCFGL, we incorporate the condition specificity into another popular model for joint network estimation, known as fused multiple graphical lasso (FMGL). We use a more efficient algorithm in the iterative steps compared to CFGL, enabling faster computation with complexity of <i>O</i>(<i>p</i><sup>2</sup><i>K</i>) and making it easily generalizable for more than three conditions. We also present a novel screening rule to determine if the full network estimation problem can be broken down into estimation of smaller disjoint sub-networks, thereby reducing the complexity further. We demonstrate the computational advantage and superior performance of our method compared to two non-condition adaptive methods, FGL and FMGL, and one condition adaptive method, CFGL in both simulation study and real data analysis. We used RCFGL to jointly estimate the gene co-expression networks in different brain regions (conditions) using a cohort of heterogeneous stock rats. We also provide an accommodating <i>C</i> and <i>Python</i> based package that implements RCFGL.

                Background: The number of Tuberculosis (TB) cases or deaths is declining, however, the rate of decline is not adequate to meet the World Health Organization's (WHO's) mitigation. TB remains a public health problem in Ghana with a significant economic and health burden on its citizens and health care system.  Consequently, there is a need for further studies about the disease aimed at accelerating the rate of decline in cases. Methods:  The spatio-temporal characteristics of TB in Ghana using Bayesian spatial and spatio-temporal regression models was analysed in this study. Data were obtained from Ghana National Tuberculosis Programme (NTP) for the 10 regions of Ghana, collected over a six-year period. The study also examines some baseline predictors of TB infections to ascertain their effects on the TB risk across the ten regions in Ghana. Results: Hot-spots of TB cases are observed in the Upper East, Upper West, Volta, Western, and Central regions and low risk in the Northern, Ashanti, Greater Accra, Brong Ahafo, Eastern and Western regions. The results indicated a clustering of risk between neighboring regions. TB cure rate, TB success rate, knowledge about TB, awareness that TB is airborne, HIV prevalence, percentage of literacy, and high income are important predictors of  detection for this disease across the ten regions of Ghana. Conclusion: Most regions in Ghana have similar TB risks. A substantial reduction in TB cases  requires measures that will increase  detection, success and cure rates, awareness, knowledge about how this disease spreads as well adequate health facilities with easy access.

<p>Identification of synaptic partners is an essential task for systems neuroscience. Here we present a tool for cell-type specific anterograde monosynaptic tracing utilizing the predominantly anterograde HSV strain H129. The knockout of the capsid portal protein UL6 from a previously derived cre-dependent version of HSV H129 prohibits genome packaging and production of infectious particles. Rescue of this knockout by expression of UL6 from a cre-dependent AAV allows for production of infectious HSV particles that travel to downstream synaptic partners, but no further. We detail the application of this system in five non-reciprocal neural circuits and caveats important for perspective users.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Identification of synaptic partners is a fundamental task for systems neuroscience. To date, few reliable techniques exist for whole brain labeling of downstream synaptic partners in a cell-type-dependent and monosynaptic manner. Herein, we describe a novel monosynaptic anterograde tracing system based on the deletion of the gene <i>UL6</i> from the genome of a cre-dependent version of the anterograde Herpes Simplex Virus 1 strain H129. Given that this knockout blocks viral genome packaging and thus viral spread, we reasoned that co-infection of a HSV H129 ΔUL6 virus with a recombinant adeno-associated virus expressing UL6 in a cre-dependent manner would result in monosynaptic spread from target cre-expressing neuronal populations. Application of this system to five nonreciprocal neural circuits resulted in labeling of neurons in expected projection areas. While some caveats may preclude certain applications, this system provides a reliable method to label postsynaptic partners in a brain-wide fashion.</p>

                Background: 3D-printing has shown potential in several medical advances because of its ability to create patient-specific surgical models and instruments. In fact, this technology makes it possible to acquire and study physical models that accurately reproduce patient-specific anatomy. The challenge is to apply 3D-printing to reproduce the porous structure of a bone tissue, consisting of compact bone, spongy bone and bone marrow. Methods: An interesting approach is presented here for reproducing the structure of a bone tissue of a femur by 3D-printing porous structure. Through the process of CT segmentation, the distribution of bone density was analysed. In 3D-printing, the bone density was compared with the density of infill. Results: The zone of compact bone, the zone of spongy bone and the zone of bone marrow can be recognized in the 3D printed model by a porous density additive manufacturing method. Conclusions: The application of 3D-printing to reproduce a porous structure, such as that of a bone, makes it possible to obtain physical anatomical models that likely represent the internal structure of a bone tissue. This process is low cost and easily reproduced.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/12-16/v1?src=rss">Study protocol for a systematic review of the social determinants of mental health and well-being of older migrants aged 50 years and above [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Migration is a milestone event in a person’s life, bringing with it the challenges of settling down in an unfamiliar environment. The age at which migration takes place and the way migrants negotiate their old and new world significantly impacts their mental health. Thus, this systematic review seeks to analyse and summarize existing research detailing the contexts in which people migrate later in life and the associations between these contexts and social determinants of their mental health and well-being. Methods: Seven databases including PsycINFO, Web of Science, PubMed, Applied Social Sciences Index, Abstracts: ASSIA, Ageline, CINAHL, and Informit will be searched systematically for original journal articles published in English. In the first screening stage, the first reviewer (PB) will screen all titles and abstracts and mark all potentially eligible texts for full-text screening. The second reviewer (HM) will review the decisions made. Any potential conflicts will be resolved with discussion. Afterward, full texts of potentially eligible studies will be assessed for eligibility by two reviewers (PB and HM). The methodological quality (or risk of bias) of individual studies will be appraised using the Mixed Method Appraisal Tool. The thematic synthesis of the data will be performed using a hybrid approach incorporating deductive (framed against the social determinants of health using intersectionality as a lens) and inductive data-driven processes. The review protocol was registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) (Reg: CRD42022359881).

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26598?af=R">Small dense LDL cholesterol and ischemic stroke</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>For decades it has been suggested that small dense low-density lipoprotein (sdLDL) may be particularly atherogenic. High levels of sdLDL are associated with an increased risk of ischemic heart disease; however, the association of sdLDL with ischemic stroke has not been explored in a large prospective study on the general population. We tested the hypothesis that high sdLDL cholesterol levels are associated with an increased risk of ischemic stroke.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This prospective study included 38,319 individuals from the Copenhagen General Population Study with fresh sample measurements of sdLDL cholesterol. Median follow-up time was 3.1 years. We observed 302 and 74 ischemic and haemorrhagic strokes from baseline in 2013-2017 to end of follow-up in 2018. For comparison, we included estimates for large buoyant LDL cholesterol and total LDL cholesterol.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Higher levels of sdLDL cholesterol were log-linearly associated with increased risk of ischemic stroke. Compared to individuals with sdLDL cholesterol in the lowest tertile (≤0.60 mmol/L; ≤23 mg/dL) the multivariable adjusted hazard ratio for ischemic stroke was 1.79 (95%confidence interval: 1.31-2.43) for the highest tertile (≥0.86 mmol/L; ≥33 mg/dL). Multivariable adjusted hazard ratios for ischemic stroke per 1 mmol/L (38.7 mg/dL) higher levels were 1.69 (1.28-2.22) for sdLDL cholesterol, 0.95 (0.78-1.16) for large buoyant LDL cholesterol, and 1.08 (0.93-1.25) for total LDL cholesterol. Hazard ratios were similar when further adjusting for BMI and diabetes mellitus in the biological pathway in combination with related lipids and lipoproteins.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Higher sdLDL cholesterol levels were robustly associated with increased risk of ischemic stroke.</p>

                Hearing in mammals is characterised by a greatly expanded hearing frequency range and enhanced frequency tuning. Comparative studies, both within mammals and alongside other vertebrate clades have greatly enhanced our knowledge about its evolutionary and developmental origins, morphological and functional features. The auditory system shares its evolutionary and developmental histories with the vestibular and lateral line systems, all of which rely on sensory hair cells for the detection of mechanical stimuli [1].

                Using cross-species screens, Kim et al. identified 11 genes that when knocked down decrease tau in the mouse brain. Furthermore, they showed that adult knockdown of USP7, RNF130, and RNF149 in a tauopathy mouse model rescued the disease phenotypes. Mechanistic studies revealed that these three genes regulate tau by counteracting the C terminus of Hsc70-interacting protein (CHIP)-mediated tau ubiquitination.

                Afferents of peripheral mechanoreceptors innervate the skin of vertebrates, where they detect physical touch via mechanically gated ion channels (mechanotransducers). While the afferent terminal is generally understood to be the primary site of mechanotransduction, the functional properties of mechanically activated (MA) ionic current generated by mechanotransducers at this location remain obscure. Until now, direct evidence of MA current and mechanically induced action potentials in the mechanoreceptor terminal has not been obtained. Here, we report patch-clamp recordings from the afferent terminal innervating Grandry (Meissner) corpuscles in the bill skin of a tactile specialist duck. We show that mechanical stimulation evokes MA current in the afferent with fast kinetics of activation and inactivation during the dynamic phases of the mechanical stimulus. These responses trigger rapidly adapting firing in the afferent detected at the terminal and in the afferent fiber outside of the corpuscle. Our findings elucidate the initial electrogenic events of touch detection in the mechanoreceptor nerve terminal.

                Spatial frequency (SF) is an important attribute in the visual scene and is a defining feature of visual processing channels. However, there remain many unsolved questions about how extrastriate areas in primate visual cortex codes this fundamental information. Here, using intrinsic signal optical imaging in visual areas of V2 and V4 of macaque monkeys, we quantify the relationship between SF maps and (1) visual topography and (2) color and orientation maps. We find that in orientation regions, low to high SF is mapped orthogonally to orientation; in color regions, which are reported to contain orthogonal axes of color and lightness, low spatial frequencies (SFs) tend to be represented more frequently than high SFs. This supports a population-based SF fluctuation related to the 'color/orientation' organizations. We propose a generalized hypercolumn model across cortical areas, comprised of two orthogonal parameters with additional parameters.

">The Cortical Representation of Language Timescales is Shared between Reading and Listening</a></h4>

              
                Natural language comprehension is thought to involve the integration of low-level sensory representations into a hierarchy of increasingly high-level representations. To investigate whether in the human brain the same pathways are used to integrate both written and spoken language, we tested whether brain representations of this hierarchy are shared between written and spoken language comprehension. Different levels of the language hierarchy were operationally defined as timescales, where each timescale refers to the spectral components of a language stimulus that vary over a certain number of words. Voxelwise encoding models were used to determine how different language timescales are represented across the cerebral cortex, for each modality separately. The encoding models were estimated with fMRI BOLD data that were recorded while participants read and listened to the same set of natural language narratives in each modality (Huth et al., 2016; Deniz et al., 2019). These models reveal that the topographic organization of language timescale representations across the cortical surface is highly similar between the two modalities. Our results suggest that brain representations of language timescales are largely independent of stimulus modality.

">D-type K+ current controls the function of electrically coupled neurons in a species-specific fashion</a></h4>

              
                Electrical synapses supported by gap junctions, are known to form networks of electrically coupled neurons in many regions of the mammalian brain, where they play relevant functional roles. Yet, how electrical coupling support sophisticated network operations, and the contribution of the intrinsic electrophysiological properties of neurons to these operations, remains incompletely understood. Here, comparative analysis of electrically coupled mesencephalic trigeminal (MesV) neurons, uncovered remarkable difference in the operation of these networks in highly related species. While spiking of MesV neurons might support the recruitment of coupled cells in rats, this rarely occurs in mice. Using whole-cell recordings, we determined that the higher efficacy in postsynaptic recruitment in rat's MesV neurons does not result from coupling strength of larger magnitude, but instead from the higher excitability of coupled neurons. Consistently, MesV neurons from rats present a lower threshold current for activation, more hyperpolarized firing level as well as a higher ability to generate repetitive discharges, in comparison to their counterparts from mice. This difference in neuronal excitability results from a significantly higher magnitude of the D-type K+ current (ID) in MesV neurons from mice, indicating that the expression level of this current gates the recruitment of postsynaptic coupled neurons. Since MesV neurons are primary afferents critically involved in the organization of orofacial behaviors, such mechanism might support lateral excitation, by which activation of single neurons at the periphery can spread to coupled partners. Thus, by amplifying sensory inputs, lateral excitation may significantly contribute to information processing and organization of motor outputs.

">Somatostatin-expressing neurons in the ventral tegmental area innervate specific forebrain regions and are involved in the stress response</a></h4>

              
                Expanding knowledge about the cellular composition of subcortical brain regions demonstrates large heterogeneity and differences from the cortical architecture. Recently, we described three subtypes of somatostatin-expressing (Sst) neurons in the mouse ventral tegmental area (VTA) and showed their local inhibitory action on the neighbouring dopaminergic neurons (Nagaeva et al., 2020). Here, we report that VTA Sst neurons also project far outside the VTA and innervate several forebrain regions that are mainly involved in the regulation of emotional behaviour. When we deleted these VTA Sst neurons several behaviours and drug effects were affected, such as home cage activity, sensitization of locomotor activity to morphine, fear conditioning responses, and reactions to inescapable stress of forced swimming, often in a sex-dependent manner. Interestingly, the majority of these Sst projecting neurons was found to express Vglut2 and Th, but not Dat. Together, these data demonstrate that VTA Sst neurons have their selective projection targets, which are distinct from the main targets of VTA dopamine neurons and involved in the regulation of a variety of behaviours mostly associated with the stress response. This, in turn, makes these VTA neurons a meaningful addition to the somatostatinergic system of the brain.

">Neural characterization of the "totonou" state associated with sauna use</a></h4>

              
                Saunas are becoming increasingly popular worldwide, being an activity that promotes relaxation and health. Intense feelings of happiness have been reported shortly after enjoying a hot sauna and cold water, what is known in Japan as the "totonou" state. However, no research has investigated what occurs in the brain during the "totonou" state. In the present study, participants underwent a sauna phase, consisting of three sets of alternating hot sauna, cold water, and rest. We elucidated changes in brain activity and mood in the "totonou" state by measuring and comparing brain activity and emotional scales before and after the sauna phase and during the rest phase in each set. We found significant increases in theta and alpha power during rest and after the sauna phase compared to before the sauna phase. Moreover, in an auditory oddball task, the p300 amplitude decreased significantly and MMN amplitude increased significantly after the sauna phase. The increase in MMN indicates higher activation of the pre-attentional auditory process, leading to a decrease in attention-related brain activity P300. Hence, the brain reaches in a more efficient state. Further, the response time in behavioral tasks decreased significantly. In addition, the participants' subjective responses to the questionnaire showed significant changes in physical relaxation and other indicators after being in the sauna. Finally, we developed an artificial intelligence classifier, obtaining an average accuracy of brain state classification of 88.34%. The results have potential for future application.

">Thermodynamic limitations on brain oxygen metabolism: physiological implications</a></h4>

              
                A recent hypothesis is that maintaining the brain tissue ratio of O2 to CO2 is critical for preserving the entropy increase available from oxidative metabolism of glucose, with a fall of that available entropy leading to a reduction of the phosphorylation potential and impairment of brain energy metabolism. The hypothesis suggests that physiological responses under different conditions can be understood as preserving tissue O2/CO2. To test this idea, a mathematical model of O2 and CO2 transport was used to calculate how well different physiological responses maintain tissue O2/CO2, showing good agreement with reported experimental measurements for increased neural activity, hypercapnia and hypoxia. The results highlight the importance of thinking about brain blood flow as a way to modulate tissue O2/CO2, rather than simply in terms of O2 delivery to the capillary bed. The hypoxia modeling focused on humans at high altitude, including acclimatized lowlanders and adapted populations, with a primary finding that decreasing CO2 by increasing ventilation rate is much more effective for preserving tissue O2/CO2 than increasing blood hemoglobin content. The modeling provides a new framework and perspective for understanding how blood flow and other physiological factors support energy metabolism in the brain under a wide range of conditions.

">Cortical projection to the pedunculopontine nucleus subpopulation for the Go/STOP signal modulation of muscle tone and locomotion</a></h4>

              
                The pedunculopontine nucleus is a central actor of motor control with functions at the level of the Basal Ganglia and the Spinal cord and can modulate ongoing behavior as well as movement execution. Physiologically, the PPN is a heterogeneous nucleus, and these disparities can explain the functional outcome of deep brain stimulation in Parkinson's patients. Here, we revealed two individually distributed populations of glutamatergic neurons acting as the only known subcortical bidirectional interface between the Basal Ganglia and the Spinal cord. These subpopulations are under the control of direct cortical inputs from the primary motor cortex, that participate in the PPN microcircuitry to modulate muscle tones, locomotion, and balance. Thus, our data, for the first time revealed a subdivision within the PPN anatomy that is anatomically, physiologically, and functionally separated and could provide the first evidence for a symptoms-based approach in deep brain stimulations.

">An entorhinal-like region in food-caching birds</a></h4>

              
                The mammalian entorhinal cortex routes inputs from diverse sources into the hippocampus. This information is mixed and expressed in the activity of many specialized entorhinal cell types, which are considered indispensable for hippocampal function. However, functionally similar hippocampi exist even in non-mammals that lack an obvious entorhinal cortex, or generally any layered cortex. To address this dilemma, we mapped extrinsic hippocampal connections in chickadees, whose hippocampi are used for remembering numerous food caches. We found a well-delineated structure in these birds that is topologically similar to the entorhinal cortex and interfaces between the hippocampus and other pallial regions. Recordings of this structure revealed entorhinal-like activity, including border and multi-field grid-like cells. These cells were localized to the subregion predicted by anatomical mapping to match the dorsomedial entorhinal cortex. Our findings uncover an anatomical and physiological equivalence of vastly different brains, suggesting a fundamental nature of entorhinal-like computations for hippocampal function.

	<p>Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a serious global risk factor leading to the onset of cognitive impairment and neurodegenerative diseases. Cognitive and memory impairment following a TBI is associated with the dysregulation of cholinergic neurotransmission in the brains of subjects. The extent of memory impairment following a TBI is linked with the sex of the subject. This study aimed to identify the sex-dimorphic role of muscarinic cholinergic modulation in neurological functioning and episodic memory retrieval in a mouse model of TBI. Balb/c mice were divided into four groups of males and four groups of females (i.e., Sham, TBI, TBI + Scopolamine 1 mg/kg, and TBI + Donepezil 1 mg/kg). After training with the Morris water maze test and fear conditioning, all groups were subjected to brain injury (7.84 &amp;amp;times; 10&amp;amp;minus;5 J impact force) except for the Sham mice. Following brain injury, scopolamine or donepezil was administered to the respective groups for 5 days. Acute scopolamine immediately after brain trauma showed a neuroprotective effect in the males only, while subchronic donepezil significantly impaired neurological functioning in both sexes. Subchronic scopolamine and donepezil treatment reversed the TBI-induced retrograde amnesia for spatial memory in male mice. Contextual fear memory retrieval was not affected by the TBI and treatments in both sexes. Thus, we concluded that the sex-dimorphic response of the muscarinic receptors in TBI-induced memory impairment depends on the type of memory. This study highlights the potential for therapeutic modalities in TBI subjects.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Understanding the neuronal composition of the brains of dinosaurs and other fossil amniotes would offer fundamental insight into their behavioral and cognitive capabilities, but brain tissue is only rarely fossilized. However, when the bony brain case is preserved, the volume and therefore mass of the brain can be estimated with computer tomography; and if the scaling relationship between brain mass and numbers of neurons for the clade is known, that relationship can be applied to estimate the neuronal composition of the brain. Using a recently published database of numbers of neurons in the telencephalon of extant sauropsids (birds, squamates, and testudines), here I show that the neuronal scaling rules that apply to these animals can be used to infer the numbers of neurons that composed the telencephalon of dinosaur, pterosaur, and other fossil sauropsid species. The key to inferring numbers of telencephalic neurons in these species is first using the relationship between their estimated brain and body mass to determine whether bird-like (endothermic) or squamate-like (ectothermic) rules apply to each fossil sauropsid species. This procedure shows that the notion of “mesothermy” in dinosaurs is an artifact due to the mixing of animals with bird-like and squamate-like scaling, and indicates that theropods such as <i>Tyrannosaurus</i> and <i>Allosaurus</i> were endotherms with baboon- and monkey-like numbers of telencephalic neurons, respectively, which would make these animals not only giant but also long-lived and endowed with flexible cognition, and thus even more magnificent predators than previously thought.</p>

                Background: We live in a time where traditional education has rapidly incorporated online modalities due to the recent SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) safety measures such as social distancing. Regardless of these challenges, health education constantly strives to implement the best technologies available for an effective student deep learning outcome. Virtual (VR) and augmented reality (AR) in the dental pre-clinical stage may help stimulate students to better understand the foundation material prescribed in the curriculum. Most visual material available for students is still mainly based on 2D graphics. Thus, this study will attempt to evaluate the students' perceptions about implementing VR/AR technologies in the learning setting. Methods: A single-group pretest-posttest design will be implemented where students will be exposed to VR/AR and fill out two questionnaires, one before and one after the exposure. Conclusions: This project is intended to start once the institutional ethical approval is obtained. It is expected that the analysis from the current project will provide recommendations to improve the students' academic curriculum pre-clinical experience. The recommendations will be provided in the form of at least three scientific publications, with one publication for each subject area intended to be evaluated (i.e., head and neck anatomy, dental anatomy, and removable prosthodontics).

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Injuries to peripheral nerves are frequent, yet no drug therapies are available for effective nerve repair. The slow growth rate of axons and inadequate access to growth factors challenge natural repair of nerves. A better understanding of the molecules that can promote the rate of axon growth may reveal therapeutic opportunities. Molecular profiling of injured neurons at early intervals of injury, when regeneration is at the maximum, has been the gold standard for exploring growth promoters. A complementary <I>in vitro</I> regenerative priming model was recently shown to induce enhanced outgrowth in adult sensory neurons. In this work, we exploited the <I>in vitro</I> priming model to reveal novel candidates for adult nerve regeneration. We performed a whole-tissue proteomics analysis of the <I>in vitro</I> primed dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) from adult SD rats and compared their molecular profile with that of the <I>in vivo</I> primed, and control DRGs. The proteomics data generated are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD031927. From the follow-up analysis, Bioinformatics interventions, and literature curation, we identified several molecules that were differentially expressed in the primed DRGs with a potential to modulate adult nerve regrowth. We then validated the growth promoting roles of mesencephalic astrocyte-derived neurotrophic factor (MANF), one of the hits we identified, in adult rat sensory neurons. Overall, in this study, we explored two growth priming paradigm and shortlisted several candidates, and validated MANF, as potential targets for adult nerve regeneration.

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Long-term memory formation requires anterograde transport of proteins from the soma of a neuron to its distal synaptic terminals. This allows new synaptic connections to be grown and existing ones remodeled. However, we do not yet know which proteins are transported to synapses in response to activity and temporal regulation. Here, using quantitative mass spectrometry, we have profiled anterograde protein cargos of a learning-regulated molecular motor protein kinesin [<I>Aplysia</I> kinesin heavy chain 1 (ApKHC1)] following short-term sensitization (STS) and long-term sensitization (LTS) in <I>Aplysia californica</I>. Our results reveal enrichment of specific proteins associated with ApKHC1 following both STS and LTS, as well as temporal changes within 1 and 3 h of LTS training. A significant number of proteins enriched in the ApKHC1 complex participate in synaptic function, and, while some are ubiquitously enriched across training conditions, a few are enriched in response to specific training. For instance, factors aiding new synapse formation, such as synaptotagmin-1, dynamin-1, and calmodulin, are differentially enriched in anterograde complexes 1 h after LTS but are depleted 3 h after LTS. Proteins including gelsolin-like protein 2 and sec23A/sec24A, which function in actin filament stabilization and vesicle transport, respectively, are enriched in cargos 3 h after LTS. These results establish that the composition of anterograde transport complexes undergo experience-dependent specific changes and illuminate dynamic changes in the communication between soma and synapse during learning.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>The ability to interrogate specific representations in the brain, determining how, and where, difference sources of information are instantiated can provide invaluable insight into neural functioning. Pattern component modeling (PCM) is a recent analytic technique for human neuroimaging that allows the decomposition of representational patterns in brain into contributing subcomponents. In the current study, we present a novel PCM variant that tracks the contribution of prespecified representational patterns to brain representation across areas, thus allowing hypothesis-guided employment of the technique. We apply this technique to investigate the contributions of hedonic and nonhedonic information to the neural representation of tactile experience. We applied aversive pressure (AP) and appetitive brush (AB) to stimulate distinct peripheral nerve pathways for tactile information (C-/CT-fibers, respectively) while patients underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanning. We performed representational similarity analyses (RSAs) with pattern component modeling to dissociate how discriminatory versus hedonic tactile information contributes to population code representations in the human brain. Results demonstrated that information about appetitive and aversive tactile sensation is represented separately from nonhedonic tactile information across cortical structures. This also demonstrates the potential of new hypothesis-guided PCM variants to help delineate how information is instantiated in the brain.</p>

                Background The evaluation of nutrient variability plays a crucial role in accessing soil potentials and practical intervention responses in rice production systems. Synthetic fertilizer applications and cultivation practices are considered key factors affecting nutrient dynamics and availability. Here, we assessed the nutrient dynamics in surface, subsurface water and soil under local water management and conventional rice cultivation practices in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta. Methods We implemented a field experiment (200 m  2) in the 2018 wet season and the 2019 dry season in a triple rice-cropping field. Surface water, subsurface water (30–45 cm), and topsoil (0–20 cm) were collected eight samples during the rice-growing seasons to clarify its nutrient dynamic. Results The results showed that N-NH  4 +, P-PO  4 3- and total P peaks were achieved after fertilizing. Irrespective of seasons, the nutrient content in surface water was always greater than that of subsurface water ( P<0.001), with the exception of N-NO  3 -, no significant difference was disclosed ( P>0.05). When comparing the wet and dry seasons, nutrient concentrations exhibited minor differences ( P>0.05). Under conventional rice cultivation, the effects of synthetic fertilizer topdressing on the total N, soil organic matter (SOM), and total P were negligible in the soil. Higher rates of N fertilizer application did not significantly increase soil N-NH  4 +, total N, yet larger P fertilizer amounts substantially enhanced soil total P ( P<0.001). Conclusions Under conventional rice cultivation, the low concentration of N-NH  4 +, P-PO  4 3- and total P in the subsurface water indicated that nutrient losses mainly occur through runoff rather than leaching. Notably, nutrient content in soil was fairly high, whilst SOM was varied from low to medium between seasons. Future work should consider the nutrient balance and nutrient dynamic simulation on surface and subsurface.

                Aims and objectives: Purpose of this study is to detect the presence of SAR-CoV-2 viral RNA in conjunctival secretions of COVID-19 patients and to compare the RT-PCR positivity rate for SARS-CoV-2 in conjunctival and nasopharyngeal swab. Materials and method: Eighty hospitalised COVID-19 patients whose nasopharyngeal swab tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR were included in the study. Conjunctival swab was collected from eyes of these patients and sent for detection of SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR method. Results: Among the eighty patients, 51 (63.7%) were males and 29 (36.3%) were females. The mean age of the patients was 55.93 ± 16.59. Six patients had ocular manifestations. Eleven (13.75%) patients tested positive on conjunctival swab for SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA and only one of them had ocular manifestations out of the eleven. Conclusion: In our study the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in conjunctival secretions of COVID-19 patients was detected and this was not dependent on presence of ocular manifestations or duration of disease. Though the conjunctival positivity is lower compared to the nasopharyngeal swab sampling, ocular surface and secretions can be a potential route of viral transmission.

                Background:  The annual incidence and mortality rates of pancreatic cancer has been rising. We analyzed pancreatic cancer trends by demographics and geographic location. Methods:  Data was obtained from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registry 17 were available to assess trends of pancreatic cancer incidence and mortality from 2000 to 2019. Results:  The pancreatic cancer incidence and mortality rates consistently increased over time from 2000 to 2019. Incidence of pancreatic cancer was highest in males (14; 95% Cl, 13.9,14.1) and blacks (15.4 95% Cl,15.2, 15.6). The incidence was highest in Alaska (16.2; 95% Cl, 14.1, 18.5), and lowest in Utah (10.7; 95% Cl, 10.4, 11.0). Incidence increased at 0.85% per year (95% Cl, 0.76, 0.92; P < .001). Overall incidence increased significantly for all sex, race, stage sub-groups except for Blacks (APC of 0.04%; 95% Cl, -0.14, 0.22; P = 0.649), and American Indian/Alaska natives (APC of -0.22 %; 95% Cl, -1.33, 0.89; P= 0.679). There was an overall significant increase in incidence across all states except for Alaska. Incidence-based mortality of pancreatic cancer was highest in males (12.6; 95% Cl, 12.5,12.7) and blacks (14.1; 95% Cl, 13.9, 14.3). Mortality was highest in Alaska (15.1; 95% Cl, 13.1,17.3), and lowest in Utah (9.6; 95% Cl, 9.3,9.9). Mortality increased at 0.91% per year (95% Cl, 0.32, 1.50; P = .005). The overall incidence-based mortality increased significantly only in the males APC, 0.95% (95% Cl, 0.36, 1.54; P = 0.003), females APC 1.18 (95% Cl, 0.47, 1.89; P = 0.002) and whites APC 1.05% (95% Cl, 0.45, 1.66; P = 0.002). Furthermore, there was an overall significant increase in incidence-based mortality across all states except for Alaska, Hawaii and Washington. Conclusion: Pancreatic cancer incidence and mortality rates increased overall but differed by demographics and geographic location.

                Background: Glaucoma and diabetic retinopathy are the leading causes of blindness due to an irreversible damage to the retina which results in vision loss. Early detection of these diseases through regular screening is especially important to prevent progression. The image of retinal fundus is the main evaluating strategy for the glaucoma and diabetic retinopathy detection. Then, automated eye disease detection is an important application of retinal image analysis. Compared with classical diagnostic techniques, image classification by convolutional neural networks (CNN) have the potential for better cost-effective performance. Methods: In this paper, we propose the use of MATLAB – retrained AlexNet CNN for computerized eye diseases identification, particularly glaucoma and diabetic retinopathy, by employing retinal fundus images. The acquisition of the database was carried out through free access databases and access upon request. A transfer learning technique is used for retraining the AlexNet CNN. Specifically, the model divides the fundus image dataset into training and testing data. Results: As datasets were added by network training, different values were reported for validation accuracy, false positives and false negatives, precision, and recall. Thus, having NetTransfer I with a validation accuracy value of 94.3% for two classes. NetTransfer II with a validation accuracy value of 91.8% for two classes. NetTransfer III with a validation accuracy value of 89.7% for three classes. Net transfer IV with a validation accuracy value of 93.1% for three classes. Finally, NetTransfer V with a validation accuracy value of 92.1% for three classes. Conclusions: Re-training of the AlexNet network proved to be a powerful tool to create disease detection systems having high accuracy values and being able to discern between more than two diseases.

                Background: Genetic mutations cause 50-75% of congenital deafness. Congenital deafness is a disease divided into syndromic and non-syndromic types. Type B special schools facilitate children with deafness in Surabaya. This study aimed to identify a mutation gene that causes non-syndromic hearing impairment in school students. Methods: This research was an analytic observational study using a cross-sectional method applying simple random sampling of non-syndromic deaf children. The applied tests were pure tone audiometry, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and hybridization tests. Subjects were evaluated on the pedigree route and then analyzed. Results: A total of 138 participants with non-syndromic hearing loss were enrolled in this study and 49 patients met the inclusion criteria. The subject’s average age was 16.16 years, with more male subjects than female.  The hybridization results obtained six genetic mutations, one subject with mtDNA 1555, one subject with GJB2-299, two subjects with SLC26A4-IVS(7)2, and 3 subjects with unknown mutations. In pedigree analysis, the same genetic mutation was found in two generations of subjects with mtDNA 1555 and GJB2-299 mutations, and mutations of more than one genetic type were found in two generations of subjects with the SLC26A4-IVS(7)2 mutation. Conclusions: This study obtained six genetic mutations in non-syndromic congenital deaf children. Non-syndromic congenital deafness in Indonesia was found to have genetic mutations as a health risk. The risk was heredity with diverse inheritance patterns.

                Background: As the most abundant coffee by-product, cascara pulp has been considered a good source of antioxidants which could be used to prevent photoaging. The aim of this study was to determine the phytometabolite profiles, antioxidant and photoaging properties of the ethanolic extract of Coffea arabica cascara pulp. Methods: Ethanolic maceration was performed on the fine powder of C. arabica cascara pulp collected from Gayo Highland, Aceh Province, Indonesia. The filtrate obtained was evaluated for its 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) scavenging activity, total phenolic content (TPC), and total flavonoid content (TFC). The phytometabolite profiling was conducted qualitatively using reagents and quantitatively using gas chromatography—mass spectroscopy (GC-MS). The potential of the cascara pulp phytometabolites in inhibiting activator protein-1 (AP-1) was evaluated through molecular docking. Results: The extract had TPC and TFC of 2.04 mg gallic acid equivalent/g extract and 91.81 mg quercetin equivalent/g extract, respectively. The half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) for the DPPH inhibition reached as low as 9.59 mg/L. Qualitative phytocompound screening revealed the presence of alkaloids, saponins, tannins, flavonoids, steroids, quinones, polyphenols, and triterpenoids. GC-MS revealed the extract containing 5-hydroxy-methylfurfural (22.31%); 2,5 dimethyl 4 hidroxy 3(2H) furanone (0.74%); and caffeine (21.07%), which could form interaction with AP-1 with binding energies of -172.8, -150.8, and -63.188 kJ/mol, respectively. Conclusion: Ethanolic extract from C. arabica cascara pulp potentially have anti-photoaging properties which is worthy for further investigations in the future.

                <p>by Davide Chicco, Rakesh Shiradkar</p>

Medical imaging is a great asset for modern medicine, since it allows physicians to spatially interrogate a disease site, resulting in precise intervention for diagnosis and treatment, and to observe particular aspect of patients’ conditions that otherwise would not be noticeable. Computational analysis of medical images, moreover, can allow the discovery of disease patterns and correlations among cohorts of patients with the same disease, thus suggesting common causes or providing useful information for better therapies and cures. Machine learning and deep learning applied to medical images, in particular, have produced new, unprecedented results that can pave the way to advanced frontiers of medical discoveries. While computational analysis of medical images has become easier, however, the possibility to make mistakes or generate inflated or misleading results has become easier, too, hindering reproducibility and deployment. In this article, we provide ten quick tips to perform computational analysis of medical images avoiding common mistakes and pitfalls that we noticed in multiple studies in the past. We believe our ten guidelines, if taken into practice, can help the computational–medical imaging community to perform better scientific research that eventually can have a positive impact on the lives of patients worldwide.

Open, reproducible, and replicable research practices are a fundamental part of science. Training is often organized on a grassroots level, offered by early career researchers, for early career researchers. Buffet style courses that cover many topics can inspire participants to try new things; however, they can also be overwhelming. Participants who want to implement new practices may not know where to start once they return to their research team. We describe ten simple rules to guide participants of relevant training courses in implementing robust research practices in their own projects, once they return to their research group. This includes (1) prioritizing and planning which practices to implement, which involves obtaining support and convincing others involved in the research project of the added value of implementing new practices; (2) managing problems that arise during implementation; and (3) making reproducible research and open science practices an integral part of a future research career. We also outline strategies that course organizers can use to prepare participants for implementation and support them during this process.

Knowledge of the cell-type-specific composition of the brain is useful in order to understand the role of each cell type as part of the network. Here, we estimated the composition of the whole cortex in terms of well characterized morphological and electrophysiological inhibitory neuron types (me-types). We derived probabilistic me-type densities from an existing atlas of molecularly defined cell-type densities in the mouse cortex. We used a well-established me-type classification from rat somatosensory cortex to populate the cortex. These me-types were well characterized morphologically and electrophysiologically but they lacked molecular marker identity labels. To extrapolate this missing information, we employed an additional dataset from the Allen Institute for Brain Science containing molecular identity as well as morphological and electrophysiological data for mouse cortical neurons. We first built a latent space based on a number of comparable morphological and electrical features common to both data sources. We then identified 19 morpho-electrical clusters that merged neurons from both datasets while being molecularly homogeneous. The resulting clusters best mirror the molecular identity classification solely using available morpho-electrical features. Finally, we stochastically assigned a molecular identity to a me-type neuron based on the latent space cluster it was assigned to. The resulting mapping was used to derive inhibitory me-types densities in the cortex.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3001961">Nutritional compensation of the circadian clock is a conserved process influenced by gene expression regulation and mRNA stability</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Christina M. Kelliher, Elizabeth-Lauren Stevenson, Jennifer J. Loros, Jay C. Dunlap</p>

Compensation is a defining principle of a true circadian clock, where its approximately 24-hour period length is relatively unchanged across environmental conditions. Known compensation effectors directly regulate core clock factors to buffer the oscillator’s period length from variables in the environment. Temperature Compensation mechanisms have been experimentally addressed across circadian model systems, but much less is known about the related process of Nutritional Compensation, where circadian period length is maintained across physiologically relevant nutrient levels. Using the filamentous fungus <i>Neurospora crassa</i>, we performed a genetic screen under glucose and amino acid starvation conditions to identify new regulators of Nutritional Compensation. Our screen uncovered 16 novel mutants, and together with 4 mutants characterized in prior work, a model emerges where Nutritional Compensation of the fungal clock is achieved at the levels of transcription, chromatin regulation, and mRNA stability. However, eukaryotic circadian Nutritional Compensation is completely unstudied outside of <i>Neurospora</i>. To test for conservation in cultured human cells, we selected top hits from our fungal genetic screen, performed siRNA knockdown experiments of the mammalian orthologs, and characterized the cell lines with respect to compensation. We find that the wild-type mammalian clock is also compensated across a large range of external glucose concentrations, as observed in <i>Neurospora</i>, and that knocking down the mammalian orthologs of the <i>Neurospora</i> compensation-associated genes <i>CPSF6</i> or <i>SETD2</i> in human cells also results in nutrient-dependent period length changes. We conclude that, like Temperature Compensation, Nutritional Compensation is a conserved circadian process in fungal and mammalian clocks and that it may share common molecular determinants.

                <p>by Han Hao, Rosmaliza Ramli, Caixue Wang, Chao Liu, Shihab Shah, Pierce Mullen, Varinder Lall, Frederick Jones, Jicheng Shao, Hailin Zhang, David B. Jaffe, Nikita Gamper, Xiaona Du</p>

Accumulating observations suggest that peripheral somatosensory ganglia may regulate nociceptive transmission, yet direct evidence is sparse. Here, in experiments on rats and mice, we show that the peripheral afferent nociceptive information in mice undergoes dynamic filtering within the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) and suggest that this filtering occurs at the axonal bifurcations (t-junctions). Using synchronous in vivo electrophysiological recordings from the peripheral and central processes of sensory neurons (in the spinal nerve and dorsal root), ganglionic transplantation of GABAergic progenitor cells, and optogenetics, we demonstrate existence of tonic and dynamic filtering of action potentials traveling through the DRG. Filtering induced by focal application of GABA or optogenetic GABA release from the DRG-transplanted GABAergic progenitor cells was specific to nociceptive fibers. Light-sheet imaging and computer modeling demonstrated that, compared to other somatosensory fiber types, nociceptors have shorter stem axons, making somatic control over t-junctional filtering more efficient. Optogenetically induced GABA release within DRG from the transplanted GABAergic cells enhanced filtering and alleviated hypersensitivity to noxious stimulation produced by chronic inflammation and neuropathic injury in vivo. These findings support “gating” of pain information by DRGs and suggest new therapeutic approaches for pain relief.

                <p>by Lydia Hadjeras, Marie Bouvier, Isabelle Canal, Leonora Poljak, Quentin Morin-Ogier, Carine Froment, Odile Burlet-Schlitz, Lina Hamouche, Laurence Girbal, Muriel Cocaign-Bousquet, Agamemnon J. Carpousis</p>

RNA processing and degradation shape the transcriptome by generating stable molecules that are necessary for translation (rRNA and tRNA) and by facilitating the turnover of mRNA, which is necessary for the posttranscriptional control of gene expression. In bacteria and the plant chloroplast, RNA degradosomes are multienzyme complexes that process and degrade RNA. In many bacterial species, the endoribonuclease RNase E is the central component of the RNA degradosome. RNase E-based RNA degradosomes are inner membrane proteins in a large family of gram-negative bacteria (β- and γ-Proteobacteria). Until now, the reason for membrane localization was not understood. Here, we show that a mutant strain of <i>Escherichia coli</i>, in which the RNA degradosome is localized to the interior of the cell, has high levels of 20S and 40S particles that are defective intermediates in ribosome assembly. These particles have aberrant protein composition and contain rRNA precursors that have been cleaved by RNase E. After RNase E cleavage, rRNA fragments are degraded to nucleotides by exoribonucleases. In vitro, rRNA in intact ribosomes is resistant to RNase E cleavage, whereas protein-free rRNA is readily degraded. We conclude that RNA degradosomes in the nucleoid of the mutant strain interfere with cotranscriptional ribosome assembly. We propose that membrane-attached RNA degradosomes in wild-type cells control the quality of ribosome assembly after intermediates are released from the nucleoid. That is, the compact structure of mature ribosomes protects rRNA against cleavage by RNase E. Turnover of a proportion of intermediates in ribosome assembly explains slow growth of the mutant strain. Competition between mRNA and rRNA degradation could be the cause of slower mRNA degradation in the mutant strain. We conclude that attachment of the RNA degradosome to the bacterial inner cytoplasmic membrane prevents wasteful degradation of rRNA precursors, thus explaining the reason for conservation of membrane-attached RNA degradosomes throughout the β- and γ-Proteobacteria.

                <p>by Mirko Singer, Kathrin Simon, Ignasi Forné, Markus Meissner</p>

Apicomplexa are obligate intracellular parasites. While most species are restricted to specific hosts and cell types, <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i> can invade every nucleated cell derived from warm-blooded animals. This broad host range suggests that this parasite can recognize multiple host cell ligands or structures, leading to the activation of a central protein complex, which should be conserved in all apicomplexans. During invasion, the unique secretory organelles (micronemes and rhoptries) are sequentially released and several micronemal proteins have been suggested to be required for host cell recognition and invasion. However, to date, only few micronemal proteins have been demonstrated to be essential for invasion, suggesting functional redundancy that might allow such a broad host range. Cysteine Repeat Modular Proteins (CRMPs) are a family of apicomplexan-specific proteins. In <i>T</i>. <i>gondii</i>, two CRMPs are present in the genome, CRMPA (TGGT1_261080) and CRMPB (TGGT1_292020). Here, we demonstrate that both proteins form a complex that contains the additional proteins MIC15 and the thrombospondin type 1 domain-containing protein (TSP1). Disruption of this complex results in a block of rhoptry secretion and parasites being unable to invade the host cell. In conclusion, this complex is a central invasion complex conserved in all apicomplexans.

                <p>by Tomoya Nakai, Cléa Girard, Léa Longo, Hanna Chesnokova, Jérôme Prado</p>

Number symbols, such as Arabic numerals, are cultural inventions that have transformed human mathematical skills. Although their acquisition is at the core of early elementary education in children, it remains unknown how the neural representations of numerals emerge during that period. It is also unclear whether these relate to an ontogenetically earlier sense of approximate quantity. Here, we used multivariate fMRI adaptation coupled with within- and between-format machine learning to probe the cortical representations of Arabic numerals and approximate nonsymbolic quantity in 89 children either at the beginning (age 5) or four years into formal education (age 8). Although the cortical representations of both numerals and nonsymbolic quantities expanded from age 5 to age 8, these representations also segregated with learning and development. Specifically, a format-independent neural representation of quantity was found in the right parietal cortex, but only for 5-year-olds. These results are consistent with the so-called symbolic estrangement hypothesis, which argues that the relation between symbolic and nonsymbolic quantity weakens with exposure to formal mathematics in children.

Use of rigorous study design methods and transparent reporting in publications are 2 key strategies proposed to improve the reproducibility of preclinical research. Despite promotion of these practices by funders and journals, assessments suggest uptake is low in preclinical research. Thirty preclinical scientists were interviewed to better understand barriers and enablers to rigorous design and reporting. The interview guide was informed by the Theoretical Domains Framework, which is a framework used to understand determinants of current and desired behavior. Four global themes were identified; 2 reflecting enablers and 2 reflecting barriers. We found that basic scientists are highly motivated to apply the methods of rigorous design and reporting and perceive a number of benefits to their adoption (e.g., improved quality and reliability). However, there was varied awareness of the guidelines and in implementation of these practices. Researchers also noted that these guidelines can result in disadvantages, such as increased sample sizes, expenses, time, and can require several personnel to operationalize. Most researchers expressed additional resources such as personnel and education/training would better enable the application of some methods. Using existing guidance (Behaviour Change Wheel (BCW); Expert Recommendations for Implementing Change (ERIC) project implementation strategies), we mapped and coded our interview findings to identify potential interventions, policies, and implementation strategies to improve routine use of the guidelines by preclinical scientists. These findings will help inform specific strategies that may guide the development of programs and resources to improve experimental design and transparent reporting in preclinical research.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>This study aimed to assess the possible association between cognitive impairment and two important biochemical biomarkers of oxidative stress, thiol-disulfide homeostasis (TDH), and ischemia-modified albumin (IMA) in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). This study included 85 patients with MS (38 treatment-naïve relapsing–remitting MS (RRMS), 31 RRMS on fingolimod therapy, and 16 secondary progressive MS (SPMS)) and 33 healthy controls. Cognitive evaluation was carried out by applying the Brief International Cognitive Assessment for Multiple Sclerosis (BICAMS) test battery and the scores were adjusted for age and years of education. Plasma TDH was assessed using an automated method and plasma IMA levels were determined using the cobalt-albumin binding assay. Plasma native thiol and total thiol levels were significantly decreased in patients with SPMS when compared with the naïve patients and healthy controls. Cognitive impairment was detected in 47.4% of naïve patients, 64.5% of patients on fingolimod therapy, and 80% of patients with SPMS. Naïve patients or patients on fingolimod therapy who were cognitively impaired had significantly decreased levels of native thiol and total thiol compared to the cognitively normal patients. Logistic regression analysis revealed total thiol and native thiol to be significantly associated with cognitive impairment in naïve patients and patients on fingolimod therapy. Significant correlations were determined between BICAMS scores, TDH, IMA, clinical indices of disease severity (EDSS and MSSS), and magnetic resonance imaging parameters. This study has shown for the first time that plasma TDH parameters are associated with cognitive impairment in MS.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Several non-verbal cognitive and behavioral tests have been developed to assess learning deficits in humans with Down syndrome (DS). Here we used rodent touchscreen paradigms in adult male mice to investigate visual discrimination (VD) learning and inhibitory control in the Dp(16)1/Yey (C57BL/6J genetic background), Ts65Dn (mixed B6 X C3H genetic background) and Ts1Cje (C57BL/6J genetic background) mouse models of DS. Dp(16)1/Yey and Ts1Cje models did not exhibit motivation or learning deficits during early pre-training, however, Ts1Cje mice showed a significant learning delay after the introduction of the incorrect stimulus (late pre-training), suggesting prefrontal cortex defects in this model. Dp(16)1/Yey and Ts1Cje mice display learning deficits in VD but these deficits were more pronounced in the Dp(16)1/Yey model. Both models also exhibited compulsive behavior and abnormal cortical inhibitory control during Extinction compared to WT littermates. Finally, Ts65Dn mice outperformed WT littermates in pre-training stages by initiating a significantly higher number of trials due to their hyperactive behavior. Both Ts65Dn and WT littermates showed poor performance during late pre-training and were not tested in VD. These studies demonstrate significant learning deficits and compulsive behavior in the Ts1Cje and Dp(16)1/Yey mouse models of DS. They also demonstrate that the mouse genetic background (C57BL/6J vs. mixed B6 X C3H) and the absence of hyperactive behavior are key determinants of successful learning in touchscreen behavioral testing. These data will be used to select the mouse model that best mimics cognitive deficits in humans with DS and evaluate the effects of future therapeutic interventions.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26597?af=R">Monkeypox‐associated central nervous system disease: a case series and review</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Monkeypox virus (MPXV) disease has been declared a public health emergency by the World Health Organization, creating an urgent need for neurologists to be able to recognize, diagnosis, and treat MPXV-associated neurologic disease.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Three cases of MPXV-associated central nervous system (CNS) disease occurring during the 2022 outbreak and their associated imaging findings are presented, with two cases previously published in a limited capacity in a public health bulletin.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Three previously healthy immunocompetent gay men in their 30s developed a febrile illness followed by progressive neurologic symptoms with presence of a vesiculopustular rash. MPXV nucleic acid was detected by PCR from skin lesions of two patients with the third patient having indeterminate testing but an epidemiologic link to a confirmed MPXV disease case. Cerebrospinal fluid demonstrated a lymphocytic pleocytosis, elevated protein, and negative MPXV specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR). In two patients, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and spine demonstrated partially enhancing, longitudinally extensive central spinal cord lesions with multifocal subcortical, basal ganglia, thalamic, cerebellar, and/or brainstem lesions. The third patient had thalamic and basal ganglia lesions. All patients received 14 days of tecovirimat, and two patients also received multiple forms of immunotherapy, including intravenous immunoglobulin, pulsed high dose steroids, plasmapheresis, and/or rituximab. Good neurologic recovery was observed in all cases.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>MPXV can be associated with CNS disease. It is unclear whether this is from a parainfectious immune-mediated injury or direct CNS viral invasion.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26585?af=R">Ultrastructural Axon–Myelin Unit Alterations in Multiple Sclerosis Correlate with Inflammation</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Changes in the normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) in multiple sclerosis (MS) may contribute to disease progression. Here, we systematically quantified ultrastructural and subcellular characteristics of the axon–myelin unit in MS NAWM and determined how this correlates with low-grade inflammation.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Human brain tissue obtained with short postmortem delay and fixation at autopsy enables systematic quantification of ultrastructural characteristics. In this study, we performed high-resolution immunohis tochemistry and quantitative transmission electron microscopy to study inflammation and ultrastructural characteristics of the axon–myelin unit in MS NAWM (n = 8) and control white matter (WM) in the optic nerve.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In the MS NAWM, there were more activated and phagocytic microglia cells (HLA<sup>+</sup>P2RY12<sup>−</sup> and Iba1<sup>+</sup>CD68<sup>+</sup>) and more T cells (CD3<sup>+</sup>) compared to control WM, mainly located in the perivascular space. In MS NAWM compared to control WM, there were, as expected, longer paranodes and juxtaparanodes and larger overlap between paranodes and juxtaparanodes. There was less compact myelin wrapping, a lower g-ratio, and a higher frequency of axonal mitochondria. Changes in myelin and axonal mitochondrial frequency correlated positively with the number of active and phagocytic microglia and lymphocytes in the optic nerve.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>These data suggest that in MS NAWM myelin detachment and uncompact myelin wrapping occurs, potassium channels are unmasked at the nodes of Ranvier, and axonal energy demand is increased, or mitochondrial transport is stagnated, accompanied by increased presence of activated and phagocytic microglia and T cells. These subclinical alterations to the axon–myelin unit in MS NAWM may contribute to disease progression. ANN NEUROL 2023</p>
