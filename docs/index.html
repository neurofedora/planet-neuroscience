	<p>Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a neuropsychiatric disorder, with 30&amp;amp;ndash;40% of OCD patients being unresponsive to adequate trials of anti-OCD drugs and cognitive behavior therapy. The aim of this paper is to investigate the efficacy of non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) on treating refractory OCD. With PubMed, Embase, PsycInfo, and Cochrane Library used on 15 February 2022, 24 randomized controlled trials involving 663 patients were included. According to this analysis, NIBS including repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), theta-burst stimulation (TBS), and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), had a moderate effect on the reduction of Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) scores (SMD = 0.54, 95% CI: 0.26&amp;amp;ndash;0.81; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01). In the subgroup analysis, rTMS seemed to produce a better therapeutic effect (SMD = 0.73, 95% CI: 0.38&amp;amp;ndash;1.08; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01). Moreover, excitatory (SMD = 1.13, 95% CI: 0.24&amp;amp;ndash;2.01; p = 0.01) and inhibitory (SMD = 0.81, 95% CI: 0.26&amp;amp;ndash;1.36; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01) stimulation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) both alleviated OCD symptoms. In the secondary outcome of clinical response rates, NIBS treatment led to an increase in response rates (RR = 2.26, 95% CI: 1.57&amp;amp;ndash;3.25; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01).</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Analysis and study of the potential increase in energy output generated by prototype solar tracking, roof mounted solar panels [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Roof mounted solar panels come in form of fixed panels, unable to adjust to sun’s position during day and throughout the year. As an effect, the efficiency of such solution is usually dependent on the roof slope and position of the building in relation to sun’s day arc during seasons. These problems can be bypassed in free standing solar installations by equipping solar panels with solar tracker installations. Thanks to solar tracking, solar panels can be dynamically positioned perpendicular to the sun position and gather energy more efficiently throughout the day. This article presents a possibility of creating a roof mounted solar tracking panel to increase irradiance efficiency. A prototype of solar tracking panel with two axes of movement was designed with an intention of an easy adaptation to being mounted on sloped surfaces of building roofs. A reference stationary panel was used to compare the efficiency of both solutions. A 5-day study was carried out to determine if the proposed solution could provide any benefits. Based on the study, the authors made an attempt to draw a conclusion whether the design could considerably increase the solar energy output to be worth the extra spending associated with solar tracker installation.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Genomic prediction in plants: opportunities for ensemble machine learning based approaches [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Many studies have demonstrated the utility of machine learning (ML) methods for genomic prediction (GP) of various plant traits, but a clear rationale for choosing ML over conventionally used, often simpler parametric methods, is still lacking. Predictive performance of GP models might depend on a plethora of factors including sample size, number of markers, population structure and genetic architecture. Methods: Here, we investigate which problem and dataset characteristics are related to good performance of ML methods for genomic prediction. We compare the predictive performance of two frequently used ensemble ML methods (Random Forest and Extreme Gradient Boosting) with parametric methods including genomic best linear unbiased prediction (GBLUP), reproducing kernel Hilbert space regression (RKHS), BayesA and BayesB. To explore problem characteristics, we use simulated and real plant traits under different genetic complexity levels determined by the number of Quantitative Trait Loci (QTLs), heritability (h2 and h2e), population structure and linkage disequilibrium between causal nucleotides and other SNPs. Results: Decision tree based ensemble ML methods are a better choice for nonlinear phenotypes and are comparable to Bayesian methods for linear phenotypes in the case of large effect Quantitative Trait Nucleotides (QTNs). Furthermore, we find that ML methods are susceptible to confounding due to population structure but less sensitive to low linkage disequilibrium than linear parametric methods. Conclusions: Overall, this provides insights into the role of ML in GP as well as guidelines for practitioners.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Network resonance can be generated independently at distinct levels of neuronal organization</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Eran Stark, Amir Levi, Horacio G. Rotstein</p>

Resonance is defined as maximal response of a system to periodic inputs in a limited frequency band. Resonance may serve to optimize inter-neuronal communication, and has been observed at multiple levels of neuronal organization. However, it is unknown how neuronal resonance observed at the network level is generated and how network resonance depends on the properties of the network building blocks. Here, we first develop a metric for quantifying spike timing resonance in the presence of background noise, extending the notion of spiking resonance for in vivo experiments. Using conductance-based models, we find that network resonance can be inherited from resonances at other levels of organization, or be intrinsically generated by combining mechanisms across distinct levels. Resonance of membrane potential fluctuations, postsynaptic potentials, and single neuron spiking can each be generated independently of resonance at any other level and be propagated to the network level. At all levels of organization, interactions between processes that give rise to low- and high-pass filters generate the observed resonance. Intrinsic network resonance can be generated by the combination of filters belonging to different levels of organization. Inhibition-induced network resonance can emerge by inheritance from resonance of membrane potential fluctuations, and be sharpened by presynaptic high-pass filtering. Our results demonstrate a multiplicity of qualitatively different mechanisms that can generate resonance in neuronal systems, and provide analysis tools and a conceptual framework for the mechanistic investigation of network resonance in terms of circuit components, across levels of neuronal organization.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Drug repurposing based on a quantum-inspired method versus classical fingerprinting uncovers potential antivirals against SARS-CoV-2</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jose M. Jimenez-Guardeño, Ana Maria Ortega-Prieto, Borja Menendez Moreno, Thomas J. A. Maguire, Adam Richardson, Juan Ignacio Diaz-Hernandez, Javier Diez Perez, Mark Zuckerman, Albert Mercadal Playa, Carlos Cordero Deline, Michael H. Malim, Rocio Teresa Martinez-Nunez</p>

The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the need to identify new antiviral therapeutics at pace, including through drug repurposing. We employed a Quadratic Unbounded Binary Optimization (QUBO) model, to search for compounds similar to Remdesivir, the first antiviral against SARS-CoV-2 approved for human use, using a quantum-inspired device. We modelled Remdesivir and compounds present in the DrugBank database as graphs, established the optimal parameters in our algorithm and resolved the Maximum Weighted Independent Set problem within the conflict graph generated. We also employed a traditional Tanimoto fingerprint model. The two methods yielded different lists of lead compounds, with some overlap. While GS-6620 was the top compound predicted by both models, the QUBO model predicted BMS-986094 as second best. The Tanimoto model predicted different forms of cobalamin, also known as vitamin B12. We then determined the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) values in cell culture models of SARS-CoV-2 infection and assessed cytotoxicity. We also demonstrated efficacy against several variants including SARS-CoV-2 Strain England 2 (England 02/2020/407073), B.1.1.7 (Alpha), B.1.351 (Beta) and B.1.617.2 (Delta). Lastly, we employed an <i>in vitro</i> polymerization assay to demonstrate that these compounds directly inhibit the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) of SARS-CoV-2. Together, our data reveal that our QUBO model performs accurate comparisons (BMS-986094) that differed from those predicted by Tanimoto (different forms of vitamin B12); all compounds inhibited replication of SARS-CoV-2 via direct action on RdRP, with both models being useful. While Tanimoto may be employed when performing relatively small comparisons, QUBO is also accurate and may be well suited for very complex problems where computational resources may limit the number and/or complexity of possible combinations to evaluate. Our quantum-inspired screening method can therefore be employed in future searches for novel pharmacologic inhibitors, thus providing an approach for accelerating drug deployment.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Sample-efficient identification of high-dimensional antibiotic synergy with a normalized diagonal sampling design</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jennifer Brennan, Lalit Jain, Sofia Garman, Ann E. Donnelly, Erik Scott Wright, Kevin Jamieson</p>

Antibiotic resistance is an important public health problem. One potential solution is the development of synergistic antibiotic combinations, in which the combination is more effective than the component drugs. However, experimental progress in this direction is severely limited by the number of samples required to exhaustively test for synergy, which grows exponentially with the number of drugs combined. We introduce a new metric for antibiotic synergy, motivated by the popular Fractional Inhibitory Concentration Index and the Highest Single Agent model. We also propose a new experimental design that samples along all appropriately normalized diagonals in concentration space, and prove that this design identifies all synergies among a set of drugs while only sampling a small fraction of the possible combinations. We applied our method to screen two- through eight-way combinations of eight antibiotics at 10 concentrations each, which requires sampling only 2,560 unique combinations of antibiotic concentrations.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Single-cell network biology characterizes cell type gene regulation for drug repurposing and phenotype prediction in Alzheimer’s disease</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Chirag Gupta, Jielin Xu, Ting Jin, Saniya Khullar, Xiaoyu Liu, Sayali Alatkar, Feixiong Cheng, Daifeng Wang</p>

Dysregulation of gene expression in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) remains elusive, especially at the cell type level. Gene regulatory network, a key molecular mechanism linking transcription factors (TFs) and regulatory elements to govern gene expression, can change across cell types in the human brain and thus serve as a model for studying gene dysregulation in AD. However, AD-induced regulatory changes across brain cell types remains uncharted. To address this, we integrated single-cell multi-omics datasets to predict the gene regulatory networks of four major cell types, excitatory and inhibitory neurons, microglia and oligodendrocytes, in control and AD brains. Importantly, we analyzed and compared the structural and topological features of networks across cell types and examined changes in AD. Our analysis shows that hub TFs are largely common across cell types and AD-related changes are relatively more prominent in some cell types (e.g., microglia). The regulatory logics of enriched network motifs (e.g., feed-forward loops) further uncover cell type-specific TF-TF cooperativities in gene regulation. The cell type networks are also highly modular and several network modules with cell-type-specific expression changes in AD pathology are enriched with AD-risk genes. The further disease-module-drug association analysis suggests cell-type candidate drugs and their potential target genes. Finally, our network-based machine learning analysis systematically prioritized cell type risk genes likely involved in AD. Our strategy is validated using an independent dataset which showed that top ranked genes can predict clinical phenotypes (e.g., cognitive impairment) of AD with reasonable accuracy. Overall, this single-cell network biology analysis provides a comprehensive map linking genes, regulatory networks, cell types and drug targets and reveals cell-type gene dysregulation in AD.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">The ciliopathy protein CCDC66 controls mitotic progression and cytokinesis by promoting microtubule nucleation and organization</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Umut Batman, Jovana Deretic, Elif Nur Firat-Karalar</p>

Precise spatiotemporal control of microtubule nucleation and organization is critical for faithful segregation of cytoplasmic and genetic material during cell division and signaling via the primary cilium in quiescent cells. Microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) govern assembly, maintenance, and remodeling of diverse microtubule arrays. While a set of conserved MAPs are only active during cell division, an emerging group of MAPs acts as dual regulators in dividing and nondividing cells. Here, we elucidated the nonciliary functions and molecular mechanism of action of the ciliopathy-linked protein CCDC66, which we previously characterized as a regulator of ciliogenesis in quiescent cells. We showed that CCDC66 dynamically localizes to the centrosomes, the bipolar spindle, the spindle midzone, the central spindle, and the midbody in dividing cells and interacts with the core machinery of centrosome maturation and MAPs involved in cell division. Loss-of-function experiments revealed its functions during mitotic progression and cytokinesis. Specifically, CCDC66 depletion resulted in defective spindle assembly and orientation, kinetochore fiber stability, chromosome alignment in metaphase as well as central spindle and midbody assembly and organization in anaphase and cytokinesis. Notably, CCDC66 regulates mitotic microtubule nucleation via noncentrosomal and centrosomal pathways via recruitment of gamma-tubulin to the centrosomes and the spindle. Additionally, CCDC66 bundles microtubules in vitro and in cells by its C-terminal microtubule-binding domain. Phenotypic rescue experiments showed that the microtubule and centrosome-associated pools of CCDC66 individually or cooperatively mediate its mitotic and cytokinetic functions. Collectively, our findings identify CCDC66 as a multifaceted regulator of the nucleation and organization of the diverse mitotic and cytokinetic microtubule arrays and provide new insight into nonciliary defects that underlie ciliopathies.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Case Report: Smoking as the risk factor of persistent STEMI after primary percutaneous coronary intervention: how it could be happen? [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is a common disease. Smoking may increase the risk of ACS. The most advantageous therapy is percutaneous coronary intervention. This therapy may fail which is no-reflow phenomenon as the result. Total occlusion may increase the risk of no-reflow phenomenon which it could be worse with smoking as the habits. ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) may show in electrocardiogram (ECG). Case description A 37-year-old male came to the hospital with chest pain as the main complaint. ECG examination showed that there was wide anterior STEMI. Coronary angiography was then done and confirmed that there was total occlusion in left anterior descending artery. After two days hospitalization, the patient developed to cardiogenic shock and lead to acute decompensated heart failure. An ECG showed there was STEMI anterior after primary PCI. Discussion Many chemicals agent contain in cigarette smoking and it may induce the lipid oxidation which leads to plaque deposits. Plaque that deposits in coronary artery may rupture and make thrombus occlusion. This occlusion may partial or total, when there is total occlusion, STEMI was the result. Then, releasing the occlusion is needed for this situation ant PCI may be chosen as the therapy. Patient with wide ischemia may result the no-reflow phenomenon which may lead to heart failure and shock cardiogenic as the complication. Conclusion Smoking may induce ACS which leads to STEMI and may increase the failure of PCI therapy. No-reflow phenomenon is the evidence of miscarriage in therapy which it may increase because of smoking.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Protocol for a proof-of-concept study evaluating systematic quality improvement with Realtime event support (SQUIRES) [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: Quality improvement (QI) in healthcare results in better patient outcomes, healthcare system performance, and professional development. One target of QI initiatives in the perioperative period is surgical site infections (SSI), for which several risk factors have been identified. Reliable administration of indicated surgical antibiotic prophylaxis is a modifiable factor of particular relevance. We hypothesize that a novel telemedicine-augmented quality improvement program will improve administration of surgical antibiotic prophylaxis. Objectives: The objective of this QI study is to evaluate the utility of a telemedicine-augmented QI initiative on administration of timely surgical antibiotic prophylaxis. The incidence of SSI will also be reported for multiple surgical services. Methods: This will be a multi-center prospective before-and-after proof-of-concept study. Patients undergoing a surgical procedure across seven operating room facilities at four hospitals in the BJC Healthcare System will be included. Approximately 40,000 patients over an eight-month period will be enrolled. This eight-month period will include a baseline observational phase, an education intervention phase, an intervention phase employing real-time event detection with associated guidance from a remote telemedicine center, and a subsequent observational phase. The primary outcome will be administration of on-time surgical antibiotic prophylaxis throughout the trial. Other outcomes will include incidence of SSIs. Registration Information: This trial is registered on clinicaltrials.gov, NCT04983329 (30th July 2021).

                Dimensionality reduction of spatial omic data can reveal shared, spatially structured patterns of expression across a collection of genomic features. We studied strategies for discovering and interactively visualizing low-dimensional structure in spatial omic data based on the construction of neighborhood features. We designed quantile and network-based spatial features that result in spatially consistent embeddings. A simulation compares embeddings made with and without neighborhood-based featurization, and a re-analysis of Keren et al., 2019 illustrates the overall workflow. We provide an R package, NBFvis, to support computation and interactive visualization for the proposed dimensionality reduction approach. Code and data for reproducing experiments and analysis are available on GitHub.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Micro-shear bond strength of different surface treatments on a polymer infiltrated ceramic network [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Polymer infiltrated ceramic networks, or hybrid ceramics, are a combination of infiltrating polymerizable organic monomers into a pre-sintered porous ceramic matrix. In addition to having good mechanical properties, the polymer infiltrated ceramic network must comply with the possibility of adequate bonding to the resinous cement. The surface conditioning of this hybrid material must be carefully considered due to its organic composition and ceramic network. The purpose of this research is to evaluate the effect of hydrofluoric acid and a self-etching ceramic primer, under two different application times, on the bond strength of a polymer infiltrated ceramic network. Methods: Blocks of a polymer infiltrated ceramic network were cut to obtain sheets, and these were randomized into five groups. For the group termed AAS, airborne-particle abrasion with Al2O3 (aluminum oxide) of 50µm was used. For groups HF2 and HF6, hydrofluoric acid was used for 20 and 60 seconds respectively, and for the groups MB2 and MB6, a self-etch ceramic primer was applied for 20 and 60 seconds respectively. A silane was applied to the groups AAS, HF2, and HF6 after the treatment. After 24-hour storage in distilled water, a micro-shear bond strength test was performed using a universal mechanical testing machine. All samples were evaluated in a stereomicroscope at 40x and 50x to determine the type of failure. Results: The highest and lowest values of bond strength were reported by groups MB6 and AAS, respectively. Groups HF2, HF6, MB6, and MB2 did not report statistically significant differences. The predominant failure pattern was a mixed failure. Conclusions: With the limitations of the present investigation, the treatments of self-etching ceramic primer and hydrofluoric acid followed by silane were reported to be statistically equal at 20 and 60 seconds.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Multiparty democracy, social cohesion, and human development in Sub-Saharan Africa: A panel data analysis [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The reintroduction of multiparty democracy in Sub-Saharan Africa during the early 90s and the persistent poor human development performance of the region, have sparked several controversies regarding the need for such a political system in Africa. In the extant literature, these controversies have been characterized by fierce theoretical debates as to whether multiparty democracy influences human development and the scholarly contention that social cohesion, rather than this form of democracy, ameliorates human development. The present study examines these controversies along with the perception of Sub-Saharan African populations concerning the democratic transition and its impact on their well-being. Methods: A panel data analysis of 35 countries was conducted between 1995 to 2019 in order to determine the effect of multiparty democracy, social cohesion, and their interaction on human development. Fixed-effects and system generalized methods of moments estimations were used to control for specific characteristics. Results: The study found that, multiparty democracy, social cohesion, and the interaction between these two variables have a positive long-term effect on human development. More importantly, the study revealed that social cohesion decreases the negative influence of multiparty democracy on human development. Conclusions: Overall, the findings of this study suggest that multiparty democracy is likely to improve the well-being of the populations of Sub-Saharan Africa if the degree of social cohesion is sufficiently high. That also means that social cohesion is susceptible to dampening the negative effect of multiparty democracy on human development in the context of this study. As such, social cohesion is critical in terms of the extent to which multiparty democracy wields influence on human development outcomes in Sub-Saharan Africa. Based on these conclusions, a number of policy recommendations are discussed in the present study towards the achievement of sustained human development in the Sub-Saharan African region.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Protocol for a randomized study of the efficacy of ibandronic acid plus eldecalcitol in patients with gastric cancer after gastrectomy: A comparative study of different routes of administration of ibandronic acid [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer rev</a></h4>

              
                Background: Patients who undergo gastrectomy for gastric cancer are susceptible to osteoporosis. To prevent a decrease in bone mineral density, an appropriate prophylaxis is considered important to adjust the post-gastrectomy condition. In this study, we will compare two different routes of administration of ibandronic acid (oral or intravenous) plus eldecalcitol as a potentially more suitable treatment for patients at a high risk of fragile fracture. Protocol: This study protocol describes a randomized, active-controlled, non-blind, single-center, phase II trial. For patients in the investigational arm (Group A), sodium ibandronate hydrate will be administered intravenously once a month with daily oral intake of eldecalcitol; for those in the control arm (Group B), sodium ibandronate hydrate will be administered orally once a month with daily oral intake of eldecalcitol. We will recruit patients aged 20–85 years who have undergone gastrectomy for gastric cancer and are at a risk of fragility fractures. The study will include patients with existing vertebral fractures and/or femoral proximal fractures, or with lumbar and/or proximal femur bone mineral density of less than 80% of the young adult mean. The primary outcome of this study will be the change in lumbar bone mineral density. We will also evaluate the changes in femur bone mineral density, bone metabolism markers, health-related quality of life as evaluated using the EuroQol 5 Dimension (EQ-5D), and digestive symptoms as evaluated using the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale after 52 weeks of treatment. Conclusions: We believe that appropriate treatments that are adjusted to the condition of patients after gastrectomy are important for the prevention of bone mineral loss. Registration: This study was accepted by the Japan Registry of Clinical Trials (jRCT1041200059, November 6, 2021).

                Background: Acute swelling or cellulitis may develop within a few days after placing a definitive prosthesis or reconnecting a loose healing abutment/prosthesis, though its cause remains unclear. In this study, we propose a mechanism for the underlying pathogenesis. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the symptoms and signs, onset of symptoms, recovery duration, and laboratory data of seven women and two men (55–84 years) who exhibited acute swelling and pain around dental implants within a month of connecting definitive prosthesis or reconnecting a loose healing abutment/prosthesis between 2013 and 2021. Results: The extent of the swelling varied from the gingiva and vestibule around the implant to the face and neck regions. The swelling persisted despite removal of the connected superstructure. All patients recovered within three weeks of symptom onset. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the rapid onset of symptoms and signs, progress, duration, and etiology were consistent with the pathogenesis of deep tissue injury, which is characterized by acute inflammatory swelling that initiates from the interface between bone and subcutaneous tissue and progresses outward. Clinicians should be aware of the pathogenesis of pressure-induced injury and provide adequate treatment based on the underlying physiological process.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The olfactory placode (OP) of vertebrates generates several classes of migrating cells, including hypothalamic gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH)-producing neurons, which play essential roles in the reproduction system. Previous studies using OP cell labeling have demonstrated that OP-derived non-GnRH cells enter the developing forebrain; however, their final fates and phenotypes are less well understood. In chick embryos, a subpopulation of migratory cells from the OP that is distinct from GnRH neurons transiently expresses somatostatin (SS). We postulated that these cells are destined to develop into brain neurons. In this study, we examined the expression pattern of SS mRNA in the olfactory-forebrain region during development, as well as the destination of OP-derived migratory cells, including SS mRNA-expressing cells. Utilizing the Tol2 genomic integration system to induce long-term fluorescent protein expression in OP cells, we found that OP-derived migratory cells labeled at embryonic day (E) 3 resided in the olfactory nerve and medial forebrain at E17–19. A subpopulation of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-labeled GnRH neurons that remained in the olfactory nerve was considered to comprise terminal nerve neurons. In the forebrain, GFP-labeled cells showed a distribution pattern similar to that of GnRH neurons. A large proportion of GFP-labeled cells expressed the mature neuronal marker NeuN. Among the GFP-labeled cells, the percentage of GnRH neurons was low, while the remaining GnRH-negative neurons either expressed SS mRNA, neuropeptide Y, or calbindin D-28k or did not express any of them. These results indicate that a diverse population of OP-derived neuronal cells, other than GnRH neurons, integrates into the chick medial forebrain.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Mathematical relationships between spinal motoneuron properties</a></h4>

              
                Our understanding of the behaviour of spinal alpha-motoneurons (MNs) in mammals partly relies on our knowledge of the relationships between MN membrane properties, such as MN size, resistance, rheobase, capacitance, time constant, axonal conduction velocity and afterhyperpolarization period. We reprocessed the data from 40 experimental studies in adult cat, rat and mouse MN preparations, to empirically derive a set of quantitative mathematical relationships between these MN electrophysiological and anatomical properties. This validated mathematical framework, which supports past findings that the MN membrane properties are all related to each other and clarifies the nature of their associations, is besides consistent with the Henneman's size principle and Rall's cable theory. The derived mathematical relationships provide a convenient tool for neuroscientists and experimenters to complete experimental datasets, to explore relationships between pairs of MN properties never concurrently observed in previous experiments, or to investigate inter-mammalian-species variations in MN membrane properties. Using this mathematical framework, modelers can build profiles of inter-consistent MN-specific properties to scale pools of MN models, with consequences on the accuracy and the interpretability of the simulations.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Stress diminishes outcome but enhances response representations during instrumental learning</a></h4>

              
                Stress may shift behavioural control from a goal-directed system that encodes action-outcome relationships, to a habitual system that learns stimulus-response associations. Although this shift to habits is highly relevant for stress-related psychopathologies, limitations of existing behavioural paradigms hinders research from answering the fundamental question of whether the stress-induced bias to habits is due to reduced outcome processing, or enhanced response processing at the time of stimulus presentation - or both. Here, we used EEG-based multivariate pattern analysis to decode neural outcome representations crucial for goal-directed control, as well as response representations during instrumental learning. We show that stress reduced outcome representations but enhanced response representations. Both were directly associated with a behavioural index of habitual responding. Furthermore, changes in outcome and response representations were uncorrelated, suggesting that these may reflect distinct processes. Our findings indicate that habitual behaviour under stress may be the result of both enhanced stimulus-response processing and diminished outcome processing.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">AR-V7 exhibits non-canonical mechanisms of nuclear import and chromatin engagement in castrate-resistant prostate cancer</a></h4>

              
                Expression of the AR splice variant, AR-V7, in prostate cancer is correlated with poor patient survival and resistance to AR targeted therapies and taxanes. Currently, there is no specific inhibitor of AR-V7, while the molecular mechanisms regulating its biological function are not well elucidated. Here we report that AR-V7 has unique biological features that functionally differentiate it from canonical AR-fl or from the second most prevalent variant, AR-v567. First, AR-V7 exhibits fast nuclear import kinetics via a pathway distinct from the nuclear localization signal dependent importin-a/b pathway used by AR-fl and AR-v567. We also show that the dimerization box domain, known to mediate AR dimerization and transactivation, is required for AR-V7 nuclear import but not for AR-fl. Once in the nucleus, AR-V7 is transcriptionally active, yet exhibits unusually high intranuclear mobility and transient chromatin interactions, unlike the stable chromatin association of liganded AR-fl. The high intranuclear mobility of AR-V7 together with its high transcriptional output, suggest a Hit-and-Run mode of transcription. Our findings reveal unique mechanisms regulating AR-V7 activity, offering the opportunity to develop selective therapeutic interventions.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Deconstructing cold-induced brown adipocyte neogenesis in mice</a></h4>

              
                Cold exposure triggers neogenesis in classic interscapular brown adipose tissue (iBAT) that involves activation of b1-adrenergic receptors, proliferation of PDGFRA+ adipose tissue stromal cells (ASCs), and recruitment of immune cells whose phenotypes are presently unknown. Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) in mice identified three ASC subpopulations that occupied distinct tissue locations. Of these, interstitial ASC1 were found to be direct precursors of new brown adipocytes (BAs). Surprisingly, knockout of b1-adrenergic receptors in ASCs did not prevent cold-induced neogenesis, whereas pharmacological activation of the b3-adrenergic receptor on BAs was sufficient, suggesting that signals derived from mature BAs indirectly trigger ASC proliferation and differentiation. In this regard, cold exposure induced the delayed appearance of multiple macrophage and dendritic cell populations whose recruitment strongly correlated with the onset and magnitude of neogenesis across diverse experimental conditions. High resolution immunofluorescence and single molecule fluorescence <i>in situ</i> hybridization demonstrated that cold-induced neogenesis involves dynamic interactions between ASC1 and recruited immune cells that occur on the micrometer scale in distinct tissue regions. Our results indicate that neogenesis is not a reflexive response of progenitors to b-adrenergic signaling, but rather is a complex adaptive response to elevated metabolic demand within brown adipocytes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Automated and manual segmentation of the hippocampus in human infants</a></h4>

              
                The hippocampus, critical for learning and memory, undergoes substantial changes early in life. Investigating the developmental trajectory of hippocampal structure and function requires an accurate method for segmenting this region from anatomical MRI scans. Although manual segmentation is regarded as the "gold standard" approach, it is laborious and subjective. This has fueled the pursuit of automated segmentation methods in adults. However, little is known about the reliability of these protocols in human infants, particularly when anatomical scan quality is low from increased head motion or shorter sequences that minimize head motion. During a task-based fMRI protocol, we collected quiet T1-weighted anatomical scans from 42 sessions with awake infants aged 4-23 months. We first had two expert tracers manually segment the hippocampus bilaterally and assess inter-rater reliability. We then attempted to predict these manual segmentations using four protocols: average adult template, average infant template, FreeSurfer software, and Automated Segmentation of Hippocampal Subfields (ASHS) software. ASHS generated the most reliable hippocampal segmentations in infants, exceeding manual inter-rater reliability of the experts. Automated methods can thus provide robust hippocampal segmentations of noisy T1-weighted infant scans, opening new possibilities for interrogating early hippocampal development.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Eye movement based information system indicates human behavior in virtual driving</a></h4>

              
                Humans modulate the behavior flexibly after timely receiving and processing information from the environment. To better understand and measure human behavior in the driving process, we integrate humans and the environment as a system. The eye-movement methodologies are used to provide a bridge between humans and environment. Thus, we conduct a goal-directed task in virtual driving to investigate the law of eye-movement that could characterize the humans (internal) and environmental (external) state measured by fixation distribution and optical flows distribution. The analysis of eye-movement data combined with the information-theoretic tool, transfer entropy, active information storage, quantify the humans' cognitive effort and receiving information, and in fact, there is a balance (optimal) range between two, because of the mutual synergy and inhibition, whose quantified value is named balance of information processing. Subsequently, we update a system-level model, finding that those information measurements, transfer entropy, active information storage, and balance of information processing, all are included. This information set is information flow, which is quantified by the square root of Jensen-Shannon divergence (SRJSD), named information flow gain. What's more, results also demonstrate that the influence of system-level information flow correlated with behavioral performance stronger than the separate measurements. In conclusion, we research humans' eye-movement based on information theory to analyze behavioral performance. Besides driving, these measurements may be a predictor for other behaviors such as walking, running, etc. Still, the limitation is that the information flow may be a proxy of determinants of behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Acoustic Correlates of the Syllabic Rhythm of Speech: Modulation Spectrum or Local Features of the Temporal Envelope</a></h4>

              
                The speech envelope is considered as a major acoustic correlate of the syllable rhythm since the peak frequency in the speech modulation spectrum matches the mean syllable rate. Nevertheless, it has not been quantified whether the peak modulation frequency can track the syllable rate of individual utterances and how much variance of the speech envelope can be explained by the syllable rhythm. Here, we address these problems by analyzing large speech corpora (>1000 hours of recording of multiple languages) using advanced sequence-to-sequence modeling. It is found that, only when averaged over minutes of speech recordings, the peak modulation frequency of speech reliably correlates with the syllable rate of a speaker. In contrast, the phase-locking between speech envelope and syllable onsets is robustly observed within a few seconds of recordings. Based on speaker-independent linear and nonlinear models, the timing of syllable onsets explains about 13% and 46% variance of the speech envelope, respectively. These results demonstrate that local temporal features in the speech envelope precisely encode the syllable onsets but the modulation spectrum is not always dominated by the syllable rhythm.

                Cells throughout the human body detect mechanical forces. While it is known that the rapid (millisecond) detection of mechanical forces is mediated by force-gated ion channels, a detailed quantitative understanding of cells as sensors of mechanical energy is still lacking. Here, we combine atomic force microscopy with patch-clamp electrophysiology to determine the physical limits of cells expressing the force-gated ion channels Piezo1, Piezo2, TREK1, and TRAAK. We find that, depending on the ion channel expressed, cells can function either as proportional or nonlinear transducers of mechanical energy, detect mechanical energies as little as ~100 fJ, and with a resolution of up to ~1 fJ. These specific energetic values depend on cell size, channel density, and cytoskeletal architecture. We also make the surprising discovery that cells can transduce forces either nearly instantaneously (< 1ms), or with substantial time delay (~10 ms). Using a chimeric experimental approach and simulations we show how such delays can emerge from channel-intrinsic properties and the slow diffusion of tension in the membrane. Overall, our experiments reveal the capabilities and limits of cellular mechanosensing and provide insights into molecular mechanisms that different cell types may employ to specialize for their distinct physiological roles.

                Sleep disturbances are known to be aggravated with normal aging. Additionally, sleep disruptions have a potentially bidirectional causal relationship with dementia due to neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease. Predictive techniques that can automatically detect cognitive impairment from an individual's sleep data have broad clinical and biological significance. Here, we present a deep learning approach based on a transformer architecture to predict cognitive status from sleep electroencephalography (EEG) data. This work uses data from $N=1,502$ subjects from the Multi-Ethnic Study of 27 Atherosclerosis (MESA) cohort. Our transformer model achieves 70.22% accuracy at the binary classification task for distinguishing cognitively normal and impaired subjects based on their sleep EEG. Our method outperforms traditional feature handcrafting, which has an overall accuracy of 57.61% for the same task. We use a sparse regression model to understand and interpret the information captured by each learned feature from our transformer model. To our knowledge, this is the first effort to use deep learning to predict cognitive impairment from sleep metrics.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Proximal dendritic localization of NALCN channels underlies tonic and burst firing in nigral dopaminergic neurons</a></h4>

              
                In multipolar nigral dopamine (DA) neurons, the highly excitable proximal dendritic compartments (PDCs) and two Na+-permeable leak channels, TRPC3 and NALCN, play a key role in pacemaking. However, the causal link between them is unknown. Here we report that the proximal dendritic localization of NALCN underlies pacemaking and burst firing in DA neurons. Our morphological analysis of nigral DA neurons reveals that TRPC3 is ubiquitously expressed in the whole somatodendritic compartment, but NALCN is localized within the PDCs. Blocking either TRPC3 or NALCN channels abolished pacemaking. However, only blocking NALCN, not TRPC3, degraded burst discharges. Furthermore, local glutamate uncaging readily induced burst discharges within the PDCs, compared with other parts of the neuron, and NALCN channel inhibition dissipated burst generation, indicating the importance of NALCN to the high excitability of PDCs. Therefore, we conclude that PDCs serve as a common base for tonic and burst firing in nigral DA neurons.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Early myelination involves the dynamic and repetitive ensheathment of axons which resolves through a low and consistent stabilization rate</a></h4>

              
                Oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system exhibit significant variability in the number of myelin sheaths that are supported by each cell, ranging from just a few to about 50 (1-4). This begs the question, why does sheath number vary so widely across individual oligodendrocytes? Myelin production during development is dynamic and involves both sheath formation and loss (5-9). However, how these parameters are balanced to determine overall sheath number has not been thoroughly investigated. To explore this question, we combined extensive time-lapse and longitudinal imaging of oligodendrocytes in the developing zebrafish spinal cord to quantify sheath initiation and loss. Oligodendrocytes repetitively ensheathed the same axons multiple times before stable sheaths were formed. Interestingly, while there was a variable number of ensheathments produced by each oligodendrocyte, ~80-90% of these structures were always lost, which was an unexpectedly high, but consistent rate of sheath destabilization. The dynamics of this process indicated rapid membrane turn-over as ensheathments were formed and lost repetitively on each axon. To test whether membrane recycling impacts this sheath stabilization rate the endocytic pathway was disrupted by expressing a dominant-negative mutant form of Rab5. Oligodendrocytes over-expressing this mutant lost an even higher percentage of sheaths. Overall, oligodendrocytes initiate a highly variable number of axonal ensheathments, but these cells all exhibit a similar sheath stabilization rate, which is dependent on the endocytic recycling pathway.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A theory of orientation selectivity emerging from randomly sampling the visual field</a></h4>

              
                Selectivity for the orientation (OS) of moving gratings is also observed in the primary visual cortex (V1) of species which lack an orientation map, like mice and rats. However, the mechanism underlying the emergence of orientation selectivity in these cases is still mysterious. In the visual pathway, signals from the retina are conveyed to V1 via relay cells in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN). Here, we explore a computational model of orientation processing in dLGN and V1, where orientation selectivity emerges from random thalamocortical projections and investigate the underlying neuronal mechanism. First we demonstrate that the temporal mean (F0) of the thalamic input to cortical neurons does not depend on orientation, while the amplitude of the temporal modulations (F1) induced by the stimulus grating is indeed tuned to stimulus orientation. Second we show that the orientation tuning in the amplitudes of thalamic input can be transformed into orientation selectivity of V1 neurons by a random network, exploiting the nonlinear input-output transfer function of individual neurons. The untuned excitatory component is largely cancelled by the inhibitory component, such that the operating point is stabilized in the nonlinear regime of the transfer function. In our model, the orientation preference of V1 neurons is sensitive to the spatial frequency of the visual stimulus, very similar to what is found in neuronal recordings. Finally, we describe a non-linear firing rate model that accounts, among other things, for the F1-to-F0 transfer of oscillatory input to neurons.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">α-synucleinopathy associated calcium overload and autophagy failure is regulated by gain-of-function of Tousled-like kinase</a></h4>

              
                As a pathological hallmark in Parkinson's disease (PD), -synucleinopathy causes multiple cellular damages, including calcium overload, mitochondrial and autophagic dysfunction, and eventually dopamine neuron death. However, the hierarchy of these detrimental events is unclear. In Drosophila, we confirmed that overexpression of -synuclein could induce all these cytotoxic events. To determine the specific cytotoxic events induced by calcium overload, we established a calcium overload model in Drosophila and performed genetic screens. We found that calcium overload caused mitochondrial damage and autophagy failure and cell death, and these cytotoxic processes could be strongly rescued by loss of Tousled-like kinase (TLK). Interestingly, loss of TLK also rescued defects induced by -synuclein overexpression in Drosophila. This suggests that calcium overload acts as the crucial event upstream of mitochondrial and autophagy dysfunction. For TLK regulation of autophagy, our data indicated that a transcriptional factor REPTOR, which regulated the expression of several lysosomal genes, functioned downstream of TLK. In mammalian cells and mice, TLK2 (the homolog of Drosophila TLK) was phosphorylated under calcium overload. Upon phosphorylation, TLK2 increased its kinase activity. In addition, TLK2 could phosphorylate CREBRF (the human homolog of REPTOR) to cause its loss of transcription on the lysosomal genes. Moreover, TLK2 knockout mice rescued multi-aspect cytotoxicity induced by calcium overload and -synuclein overexpression. Our research demonstrates that TLK2 acts as a key regulator to mediate cell death and dysfunctions of mitochondria and autophagy downstream of calcium overload.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">NRN-EZ: an application to streamline biophysical modeling of synaptic integration using NEURON</a></h4>

              
                One of the fundamental goals in neuroscience is to determine how the brain processes information and ultimately controls the execution of complex behaviors. Over the past four decades, there has been a steady growth in our knowledge of the morphological and functional diversity of neurons, the building blocks of the brain. These cells clearly differ not only for their anatomy and ion channel distribution, but also for the type, strength, location and temporal pattern of activity of the many synaptic inputs they receive. Compartmental modeling programs like NEURON have become widely used in the neuroscience community to address a broad range of research questions, including how neurons integrate synaptic inputs and propagate information through complex neural networks. One of the main strengths of NEURON is its ability to incorporate user-defined information about the realistic morphology and biophysical properties of different cell types. Although the graphical user interface of the program can be used to run initial exploratory simulations, introducing a stochastic representation of synaptic weights, locations and activation times typically requires users to develop their own codes, a task that can be overwhelming for some beginner users. Here we describe NRN-EZ, an interactive application that allows users to specify complex patterns of synaptic input activity that can be integrated as part of NEURON simulations. Through its graphical user interface, NRN-EZ leverages the learning curve to run computational models in NEURON, for users that do not necessarily have a computer science background.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Local minimization of prediction errors drives learning of invariant object representations in a generative network model of visual perception</a></h4>

              
                The ventral visual processing hierarchy of the cortex needs to fulfill at least two key functions: Perceived objects must be mapped to high-level representations invariantly of the precise viewing conditions, and a generative model must be learned that allows, for instance, to fill in occluded information guided by visual experience. Here, we show how a multilayered predictive coding network can learn to recognize objects from the bottom up and to generate specific representations via a top-down pathway through a single learning rule: the local minimization of prediction errors. Trained on sequences of continuously transformed objects, neurons in the highest network area become tuned to object identity invariant of precise position, comparable to inferotemporal neurons in macaques. Drawing on this, the dynamic properties of invariant object representations reproduce experimentally observed hierarchies of timescales from low to high levels of the ventral processing stream. The predicted faster decorrelation of error-neuron activity compared to representation neurons is of relevance for the experimental search for neural correlates of prediction errors. Lastly, the generative capacity of the network is confirmed by reconstructing specific object images, robust to partial occlusion of the inputs. By learning invariance from temporal continuity within a generative model, the network goes beyond purely input-reconstructing models of predictive coding and generalizes the framework to moving inputs in a more biologically plausible way than self-supervised networks with non-local error-backpropagation.

                The Drift-Diffusion Model (DDM) is widely accepted for two-alternative forced-choice decision paradigms thanks to its simple formalism, straightforward interpretation, and close fit to behavioral and neurophysiological data. However, this formalism presents strong limitations to capture inter-trial dependency and dynamics at the single-trial level. We propose a novel model, the non-linear Drift-Diffusion Model (nl-DDM), that addresses these issues by allowing the existence of several trajectories to the decision boundary. We show that the fitting accuracy of our model is comparable to the accuracy of the DDM, with the non-linear model performing better than the drift-diffusion model for an equivalent complexity. To give better intuition on the meaning of nl-DDM parameters, we compare the DDM and the nl-DDM through correlation analysis. This paper provides evidence of the functioning of our model as an extension of the DDM. Our model paves the way toward more accurately analyzing single-trial dynamics for perceptual decisions and accounts for pre- and post-stimulus influences.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Engineered Serum Markers for Noninvasive Monitoring of Gene Expression in the Brain</a></h4>

              
                Noninvasive efforts to map brain gene expression have been hampered by low sensitivity and limited access to the brain. Here, we introduce a new platform that enables multiplexed, noninvasive, and site-specific monitoring of brain gene expression through a novel class of engineered reporters called Released Markers of Activity (RMAs). Instead of detecting gene expression in the less accessible brain, RMA reporters exit from a known brain region into the blood, where they can be easily measured with biochemical techniques. Expressing RMAs at a single brain site, typically covering ~1% of the brain volume, provides up to a 39,000-fold signal increase over the baseline in vivo. Further, expression of RMAs in as few as several hundred neurons was sufficient for their reliable detection. When placed under a promoter upregulated by neuronal activity, RMAs could be used to measure neuronal activity in specific brain regions with a simple blood draw. We found that chemogenetic activation of cells expressing Fos-responsive RMA increased serum levels of RMA over 4-fold compared to non-activated controls. By contrast, a control RMA expressed under a constitutive neuronal promoter did not show such upregulation, demonstrating multiplexed ratiometric measurement with RMAs and proving specificity of neuronal activity discrimination. Together, our study pioneers a new noninvasive paradigm for repeatable and multiplexed monitoring of gene expression in an intact brain with sensitivity that is currently unavailable through other noninvasive gene expression reporter systems.

                This report summarizes experiments on exploring non-linear functional connectivity. Using resting-state functional MRI data from the HCP1200 dataset, we define nodes as 17 functional networks and edges as the joint distribution between times series pairs. Linear dependence is removed before taking the joint distribution. We then employ a test for normality on the joint distribution to find non-normal distribution patterns. However, the result from an experimental run of 10 subjects shows that: only less than 1% of edges is non-normal distributed, and the location of such edges is not consistent across subjects. From this point of view, the non-linear part seems to be governed by random noise.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Dynamic cortical and tractography atlases of proactive and reactive alpha and high-gamma activities</a></h4>

              
                Alpha waves - posterior-dominant rhythms at 8-12 Hz reactive to eye opening and closure - are among the most fundamental EEG findings in clinical practice and research since Hans Berger first documented them in the early 20th century. Yet, the exact network dynamics of alpha waves in regard to eye movements remains unknown. High-gamma activity at 70-110 Hz is also reactive to eye movements and a summary measure of local cortical activation supporting sensorimotor or cognitive function. We aimed to build the first-ever brain atlases directly visualizing the network dynamics of eye movement-related alpha and high-gamma modulations, at cortical and white matter levels. We studied 28 patients (age: 5-20 years) who underwent intracranial EEG and electrooculography recordings. We measured alpha and high-gamma modulations at 2,170 electrode sites outside the seizure onset zone, interictal spike-generating areas, and MRI-visible structural lesions. Dynamic tractography animated white matter streamlines modulated significantly and simultaneously beyond chance, on a millisecond scale. Before eye closure onset, significant alpha augmentation occurred at the occipital and frontal cortices. After eye closure onset, alpha-based functional connectivity was strengthened, while high gamma-based connectivity was weakened extensively in both intrahemispheric and interhemispheric pathways involving the central visual areas. The inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus supported the strengthened alpha coaugmentation-based functional connectivity between occipital and frontal lobe regions, whereas the posterior corpus callosum supported the interhemispheric functional connectivity between the occipital lobes. After eye opening offset, significant high gamma augmentation and alpha attenuation occurred at occipital, fusiform, and inferior parietal cortices. High gamma coaugmentation-based functional connectivity was strengthened, whereas alpha-based connectivity was weakened in the posterior interhemispheric and intrahemispheric white matter pathways involving central and peripheral visual areas. Proactive and reactive alpha waves involve extensive, distinct white matter networks that include the frontal lobe cortices, along with low- and high-order visual areas. High-gamma co-attenuation coupled to alpha co-augmentation in shared brain circuitry after eye closure supports the notion of an idling role for alpha waves during eye closure. These dynamic tractography atlases may improve understanding of the significance of EEG alpha waves in assessing the functional integrity of brain networks in clinical practice; they also may help elucidate the effects of eye movements on task-related brain network measures observed in cognitive neuroscience research.

                Accurate mapping of cortical engagement during mental imagery or cognitive tasks remains a challenging brain-imaging problem with immediate relevance to the development of brain - computer interfaces (BCI). We analyzed data from fourteen individuals who performed cued motor imagery, mental arithmetic, or silent word generation tasks during MEG recordings. During the motor imagery task, participants imagined the movement of either both hands (HANDS) or both feet (FEET) after the appearance of a static visual cue. During the cognitive task, participants either mentally subtracted two numbers that were displayed on the screen (SUB) or generated words starting with a letter cue that was presented (WORD). The MEG recordings were denoised using a combination of spatiotemporal filtering, the elimination of noisy epochs, and ICA decomposition. Cortical source power in the beta-band (17 - 25 Hz) was estimated from the selected temporal windows using a frequency-resolved beamforming method applied to the sensor-level MEG signals. The task-related cortical engagement was inferred from beta power decrements within non-overlapping 400 ms temporal windows between 400 and 2800 ms after cue presentation relative to a baseline 400 ms temporal window before cue onset. We estimated the significance of these power changes within each parcel of the Desikan-Killiany atlas using a non-parametric permutation test at the group level. During the HANDS and FEET movement-imagery conditions, beta-power decreased in premotor and motor areas, consistent with a robust engagement of these cortical regions during motor imagery. During WORD and SUB tasks, beta-power decrements signaling cortical engagement were lateralized to left hemispheric brain areas that are expected to engage in language and arithmetic processing within the temporal (superior temporal gyrus), parietal (supramarginal gyrus), and (inferior) frontal regions. A leave-one-subject-out cross-validation using a support vector machine (SVM) applied to beta power decrements across brain parcels yielded accuracy rates of 74% and 68% respectively, for classifying motor-imagery (HANDS-vs-FEET) and cognitive (WORD-vs-SUB) tasks. From the motor-versus-nonmotor contrasts, accuracy rates of 85% and 80% respectively, were observed for HAND-vs-WORD and HAND-vs-SUB. A multivariate Gaussian process classifier (GPC) provided an accuracy rate of {approx}60% for a four-way (HANDS-FEET-WORD-SUB) classification problem. The regions identified by both SVM and GPC classification weight maps were largely consistent with the source modeling findings. Within-subject correlations of beta-decrements during the two task sessions provided insights into the level of engagement by individual subjects and showed moderately high correlations for most subjects. Our results show that it is possible to map the dynamics of cortical engagement during mental processes in the absence of dynamic sensory stimuli or overt behavioral outputs using task-related beta-power decrements. The ability to do so with the high spatiotemporal resolution afforded by MEG could potentially help better characterize the physiological basis of motor or cognitive impairments in neurological disorders and guide strategies for neurorehabilitation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Mixed selectivity coding of content-temporal detail by dorsomedial posterior parietal neurons</a></h4>

              
                The dorsomedial posterior parietal cortex is part of a higher-cognition network implicated in elaborate processes underpinning memory formation, recollection, episodes reconstruction, and temporal processing. Neural coding for complex episodic processing is however largely undocumented. Here we revealed a set of neural codes of 'neuroethogram' in the primate parietal cortex. Analyzing neural responses in macaque dmPPC to naturalistic videos, we discovered several groups of neurons that are sensitive to categories of ethogram-items and to low-level sensory features. The amount of information coded within these multiplex representations in turn increases our trained classifier decodability for different video-types. We further discovered that the processing of category and feature information by these neurons is sustained by accumulation of temporal information over a long timescale, corroborating its role at the apex of the cortical hierarchy of temporal receptive windows. Taken altogether, these neural findings explain how dorsomedial PPC weaves fabrics of ongoing experiences together in real-time and realize a multiplex representation of an organism's past. The high dimensionality of neural representations should motivate us to shift the focus of attention from pure selectivity neurons to mixed selectivity neurons, especially in increasingly complex naturalistic task designs.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Isolated correlates of somatosensory perception in the mouse posterior cortex</a></h4>

              
                To uncover the neural correlates of stimulus perception, experimenters commonly use tasks in which subjects are repeatedly presented with a weak stimulus and instructed to report, via movement, if they perceived the stimulus. The difference in neural activity between reported stimulus (hit) and unreported stimulus (miss) trials is then seen as potentially perception-related. However, recent studies found that activity related to the report spreads throughout the brain, calling into question to what extent such tasks conflate perception-related activity with report-related activity. To isolate perception-related activity, we developed a paradigm in which the same mice were trained on both a regular go/no-go whisker stimulus detection task and a reversed contingencies version, in which they reported the absence of a whisker stimulus. By comparing no report trials across the two tasks, we located perception-related activity within a posterior network of cortical regions contralateral to the stimulus. In addition, we found it was on average an order of magnitude lower report-related activity and began after the low-level stimulus response. In summary, our study revealed for the first time in mice the cortical areas associated with the perception of a sensory stimulus independently of a perceptual report.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">High-Resolution Spatiotemporal Analysis of Single Serotonergic Axons in an In Vitro System</a></h4>

              
                Vertebrate brains have a dual structure in that they are composed of (i) axons that can be well captured with graph-theoretical methods and (ii) axons that form a dense matrix in which neurons with precise connections operate. A core part of this matrix is formed by axons (fibers) that store and release 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT, serotonin), an ancient neurotransmitter that supports neuroplasticity and has profound implications for mental health. The self-organization of the serotonergic matrix is not well understood, despite recent advances in experimental and theoretical approaches. In particular, individual serotonergic axons produce highly stochastic trajectories, fundamental to the construction of regional fiber densities, but further advances in predictive computer simulations require more accurate experimental information. This study examined single serotonergic axons in culture systems (co-cultures and monolayers), by using a complementary set of high-resolution methods: confocal microscopy, holotomography (refractive index-based live imaging), and super-resolution (STED) microscopy. It shows that serotonergic axon walks in neural tissue may strongly reflect the stochastic geometry of this tissue and it also provides new insights into the morphology and branching properties of serotonergic axons. The proposed experimental platform can support next-generation analyses of the serotonergic matrix, including seamless integration with supercomputing approaches.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Choice-Induced Preference Change under a Sequential Sampling Model Framework</a></h4>

              
                Sequential sampling models of choice, such as the drift-diffusion model (DDM), are frequently fit to empirical data to account for a variety of effects related to choice accuracy/consistency and response time (RT). Sometimes, these models include extensions that can also account for choice confidence. However, no model in this class is able to account for the phenomenon of choice-induced preference change. Studies have reported choice-induced preference change for many decades, and the principle findings are robust: decision-makers tend to rate options higher after they choose them and lower after they reject them. This spreading of alternatives (SoA) in terms of their rated values is fundamentally incompatible with traditional sequential sampling models, which consider the rated values of the options to be stationary throughout choice deliberation. Here, we propose a simple modification of the basic DDM that allows the drift rate to vary across deliberation time depending on which attributes are attended to at which points in time. Critically, the model assumes that initial ratings are based only on the more salient attributes of the individual options, and that more attributes will be considered when decision-makers must choose between options with different salient attributes. We show that this model can account for SoA (in addition to choice consistency and RT), as well as all previously reported relationships between SoA and choice difficulty, attribute disparity, and RT.

                During navigation, the hippocampus represents physical places like coordinates on a map; similar location-like signals have been seen in sensory and concept spaces. It is unclear just how general this hippocampal place code is, however: does it map places in wholly non-perceivable spaces, without locations being instructed or reinforced and during navigation-like behavior? To search for such a signal, we imaged participants' brains while they played a naturalistic, narrative-based social interaction game, and modeled their relationships as a kind of navigation through social space. Two independent samples showed hippocampal place-like signals in both region-based and whole-brain representational similarity analyses, as well as decoding and average pattern similarity analyses; the effects were not explained by other measures of the behavior or task information. We also replicated and extended previous findings of hippocampal tracking of the egocentric angle in social space. These results are the first demonstration of complete domain generality in hippocampal place representation.

                Brain folding patterns vary within the human species, but some folding properties are common across individuals, including the Sylvian fissure's inter-hemispheric asymmetry. Contrarily to the other brain folds (sulci), the Sylvian fissure develops through the process of opercularization, with the frontal, parietal and temporal lobes growing over the insular lobe. Its asymmetry may be related to the leftward functional lateralization for language processing, but the time-course of these asymmetries' development is still poorly understood. In this study, we investigated refined shape features of the Sylvian fissure and their longitudinal development in 71 infants born extremely preterm (mean gestational age at birth: 26.5 weeks) and imaged once before and once at term-equivalent age (TEA). We additionally assessed asymmetrical sulcal patterns at TEA in the perisylvian and inferior frontal regions, neighbor to the Sylvian fissure. While reproducing renown strong asymmetries in the Sylvian fissure, we captured an early encoding of its main asymmetrical shape features, and we observed global asymmetrical shape features representative of a more pronounced opercularization in the left-hemisphere, contrasting with the previously reported right-hemisphere advance in sulcation around birth. This added novel insights about the processes governing early-life brain folding mechanisms, potentially linked to the development of language-related capacities.

                Background: Clearance of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is important for the removal of toxins from the brain, with implication for neurodegenerative diseases. Imaging evaluation of CSF outflow in humans has been limited, relying on injections of contrast agents. Objective of this study was to introduce a novel spin-labeling magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique to detect and quantify the movement of endogenously tagged CSF without administration of tracer or contrast media, and use the technique to evaluate CSF outflow in normal human subjects with varying ages. Methods: This study was performed on a clinical 3-Tesla MRI scanner in healthy subjects (10 males and 6 females; mean age, 47.6 {+/-} 18.9 years; range, 19-71 years) with informed consent. Our non-contrast spin-labeling MRI technique applies a tag pulse on the brain hemisphere, including subarachnoid space, dura mater, brain parenchyma, and images the outflow of the tagged CSF into the superior sagittal sinus. We obtained 3-dimensional images in real time, which was analyzed to determine tagged-signal changes in different regions of the brain involved in CSF outflow or clearance. Additionally, the signal changes over time were fit to a signal curve to determine quantitative flow metrics such as relative CSF flow and volume. These were correlated against subject age to determine aging effects. Results: We observed the signal of the tagged CSF moving from the subarachnoid space to the dura mater and parasagittal dura, and finally draining into the superior sagittal sinus. In addition, there was strong evidence of a direct pathway by which tagged CSF flows directly from the subarachnoid space to the superior sagittal sinus, via the lateral wall of superior sagittal sinus. Furthermore, quantitative CSF outflow metrics were shown to decrease significantly with age. Conclusions: We demonstrated a novel non-invasive MRI technique to evaluate CSF clearance in humans. In this study, we identified possible two CSF clearance pathways, and determined normative values and decline of CSF flow metrics in normal ages. Our work provides a new opportunity to better understand the relationships of these CSF clearance pathways in ages, which may be a significant factor in the age-related prevalence of neurodegenerative diseases. Funding: This study was supported by the National Institutes of Health grants: RF1AG076692 (MM) and R01HL154092 (MM); and made possible by a grant from Canon Medical Systems.

	<p>Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping (QSM) can measure iron concentration increase in the primary motor cortex (M1) of patients with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). However, such alteration is confined to only specific regions interested by upper motor neuron pathology; therefore, mean QSM values in the entire M1 have limited diagnostic accuracy in discriminating between ALS patients and control subjects. This study investigates the diagnostic accuracy of a broader set of M1 QSM distribution indices in classifying ALS patients and controls. Mean, standard deviation, skewness and kurtosis of M1 QSM values were used either individually or as combined predictors in support vector machines. The classification performance was compared to that obtained by the radiological assessment of T2* signal hypo-intensity of M1 in susceptibility-weighted MRI. The least informative index for the classification of ALS patients and controls was the subject&amp;amp;rsquo;s mean QSM value in M1. The highest diagnostic performance was obtained when all the distribution indices of positive QSM values in M1 were considered, which yielded a diagnostic accuracy of 0.90, with sensitivity = 0.89 and specificity = 1. The radiological assessment of M1 yielded a diagnostic accuracy of 0.79, with sensitivity = 0.76 and specificity = 0.90. The joint evaluation of QSM distribution indices could support the clinical examination in ALS diagnosis and patient monitoring.</p>

	<p>Migraine is a common neurological disease with a still-unclear etiology and pathogenesis. Patent foramen ovale (PFO) is a kind of congenital heart disease that leads to a right-to-left shunt (RLS). Although previous studies have shown that PFO has an effect on migraine, a clear conclusion about the link between PFO and migraine is lacking. We first summarized the PFO potential mechanisms associated with migraine, including microembolus-triggered cortical spreading depression (CSD), the vasoactive substance hypothesis, impaired cerebral autoregulation (CA), and a common genetic basis. Further, we analyzed the changes in brain structure and function in migraine patients and migraine patients with PFO. We found that in migraine patients with PFO, the presence of PFO may affect the structure of the cerebral cortex and the integrity of white matter, which is mainly locked in subcortical, deep white matter, and posterior circulation, and may lead to changes in brain function, such as cerebellum and colliculus, which are involved in the processing and transmission of pain. In summary, this paper provides neuroimaging evidence and new insights into the correlation between PFO and migraine, which will help to clarify the etiology and pathogenesis of migraine, and aid in the diagnosis and treatment of migraine in the future.</p>

	<p>Major depressive disorder is a leading cause of disability worldwide and a major contributor to the overall global burden of disease. While there are several options for antidepressant treatment, only about 40&amp;amp;ndash;60% of patients respond to initial monotherapy, while 30&amp;amp;ndash;40% of patients may even show resistance to treatment. This article offers a narrative review of those studies evaluating the predictive properties of various blood-based baseline biomarkers regarding treatment responses to the pharmacological, stimulation, or behavioral treatment of patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Our results show that overall, there is only a very limited number of studies assessing baseline peripheral biomarkers regarding treatment response in TRD. Although there is some evidence for the predictive significance of particular biomarkers (e.g., IL-6, CRP, BDNF), the majority of the results are either single-study reports or studies with conflicting results. This may contribute to the wide variety of treatment protocols and different TRD definition criteria, the small number of patients included, and the existence of different biological phenotypes of the disorder used within the various studies. Taken together, there does not yet appear to be any specific baseline peripheral biomarker with sufficient discriminative predictive validity that can be used in the routine clinical practice of TRD. The discovery of new biomarkers and the better clinical characterization of known biomarkers could support the better classification and staging of TRD, the development of personalized treatment algorithms with higher rates of remission and fewer side effects, and the development of new precision drugs for specific subgroups of patients.</p>

	<p>According to previous studies, mental status in 1-year COVID-19 survivors might range from 6&amp;amp;ndash;43%. Longer-term psychological consequences in recovered COVID-19 subjects are unknown, so we analyzed longer-term quality of life and mental status in recovered COVID-19 subjects at 2 years after infection. Among 144 recovered COVID-19 subjects in the Taizhou region, 73 and 45 completed face-to-face follow-ups at the first year and second year after infection, respectively, with a 61.7% follow-up rate. The questionnaire, which was administered at both follow-ups, included questions about quality of life, psychological health, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The Mann&amp;amp;ndash;Whitney U test was used to the differences of each scale between the first and second year. Among the 45 people who completed both follow-up visits, the incidence of psychological problems was 4.4% (2/45) in the first year, and no new psychological abnormalities were observed in the second year. Quality of life improved, while the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) and Impact of Event Scale&amp;amp;mdash;Revised (IES-R) scores did not improve over time. The incidence of mental disorders was lower than those in previous studies. Multidisciplinary management for COVID-19 in this study hospital may have reduced the frequency to a certain extent. However, among those with mental health problems, such problems may exist for a long time, and long-term attention should be given to the psychological status of recovered COVID-19 subjects.</p>

	<p>The unfavorable outcome of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) with large vessel occlusion (LVO) is related to clinical factors at multiple time points. However, predictive models used for dynamically predicting unfavorable outcomes using clinically relevant preoperative and postoperative time point variables have not been developed. Our goal was to develop a machine learning (ML) model for the dynamic prediction of unfavorable outcomes. We retrospectively reviewed patients with AIS who underwent a consecutive mechanical thrombectomy (MT) from three centers in China between January 2014 and December 2018. Based on the eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) algorithm, we used clinical characteristics on admission (&amp;amp;ldquo;Admission&amp;amp;rdquo; Model) and additional variables regarding intraoperative management and the postoperative National Institute of Health stroke scale (NIHSS) score (&amp;amp;ldquo;24-Hour&amp;amp;rdquo; Model, &amp;amp;ldquo;3-Day&amp;amp;rdquo; Model and &amp;amp;ldquo;Discharge&amp;amp;rdquo; Model). The outcome was an unfavorable outcome at the three-month mark (modified Rankin scale, mRS 3&amp;amp;ndash;6: unfavorable). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and Brier scores were the main evaluating indexes. The unfavorable outcome at the three-month mark was observed in 156 (62.0%) of 238 patients. These four models had a high accuracy in the range of 75.0% to 87.5% and had a good discrimination with AUC in the range of 0.824 to 0.945 on the testing set. The Brier scores of the four models ranged from 0.122 to 0.083 and showed a good predictive ability on the testing set. This is the first dynamic, preoperative and postoperative predictive model constructed for AIS patients who underwent MT, which is more accurate than the previous prediction model. The preoperative model could be used to predict the clinical outcome before MT and support the decision to perform MT, and the postoperative models would further improve the predictive accuracy of the clinical outcome after MT and timely adjust therapeutic strategies.</p>

	<p>Stereoscopic displays can induce visual discomfort despite their wide application. Electroencephalography (EEG) technology has been applied to assess 3D visual discomfort, because it can capture brain activities with high temporal resolution. Previous studies explored the frequency and temporal features relevant to visual discomfort in EEG data. Recently, it was demonstrated that functional connectivity between brain regions fluctuates with time. However, the relationship between 3D visual discomfort and dynamic functional connectivity (DFC) remains unknown. Although HMM showed advantages over the sliding window method in capturing the temporal fluctuations of DFC at a single time point in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data, it is unclear whether HMM works well in revealing the time-varying functional connectivity of EEG data. In this study, the hidden Markov model (HMM) was introduced to DFC analysis of EEG data for the first time and was used to investigate the DFC features that can be used to assess 3D visual discomfort. The results indicated that state 2, with strong connections between electrodes, occurred more frequently in the early period, whereas state 4, with overall weak connections between electrodes, occurred more frequently in the late period for both visual comfort and discomfort stimuli. Moreover, the 3D visual discomfort stimuli caused subjects to stay in state 4 more frequently, especially in the later period, in contrast to the 3D visual comfort stimuli. The results suggest that the increasing occurrence of state 4 was possibly related to visual discomfort and that the occurrence frequency of state 4 may be used to assess visual discomfort.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cryptochrome Stabilization Ameliorates Chronic Pain</a></h4>

              
                Physiological and pathological pain exhibits striking diurnal variation but the underlying mechanisms are largely unknown. We now describe an independent molecular clock in peripheral sensory neurons and satellite glial cells of sensory ganglia. We show that it is the sensory neuron transcription-translation feedback loops (TTFLs) that are responsible for diurnal pain behaviours. This clock regulates diurnal neurophysiological responses to a range of ligands, as well as synaptic activities of primary nociceptors. Furthermore we find that loss of Cry1 and Cry2, the repressive arm of the core TTFLs intensifies pain responses, associated with increased voltage gated sodium channel currents. Conversely stabilisation of CRY1 and CRY2 using the small molecule KL001 reduces pain sensitivity. Our results highlight novel opportunities to address chronic pain by directly harnessing circadian mechanisms.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Translational regulation by RACK1 in astrocytes represses KIR4.1 expression and regulates neuronal activity</a></h4>

              
                The regulation of translation in astrocytes, the main glial cells in the brain, remains poorly characterized. We developed a high-throughput proteomic screen for polysome-associated proteins in astrocytes and focused on the ribosomal protein receptor of activated protein C kinase 1 (RACK1), a critical factor in translational regulation. In astrocyte somata and perisynaptic astrocytic processes (PAPs), RACK1 preferentially bound to a number of mRNAs, including Kcnj10, encoding the inward rectifying potassium (K+) channel KIR4.1, a critical astrocytic regulator of neurotransmission. By developing an astrocyte-specific, conditional RACK1 knock-out mouse model, we showed that RACK1 repressed the production of KIR4.1 in hippocampal astrocytes and PAPs. Reporter-based assays revealed that RACK1 controlled Kcnj10 translation through the transcript s 5 untranslated region. Upregulation of KIR4.1 in the absence of RACK1 modified the astrocyte territory volume and neuronal activity attenuatin burst frequency and duration in the hippocampus. Hence, astrocytic RACK1 represses KIR4.1 translation and influences neuronal activity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Atypical hypnotic compound ML297 restores sleep architecture following emotionally-valenced learning, to promote memory consolidation and hippocampal network activation during recall</a></h4>

              
                Sleep plays a critical role in consolidating many forms of hippocampus-dependent memory. While various classes of hypnotic drugs have been developed in recent years, it remains unknown whether, or how, some of them affect sleep-dependent memory consolidation mechanisms. We find that ML297, a recently-developed candidate hypnotic agent targeting a new mechanism (activating GIRK1-subunit containing G-protein coupled inwardly rectifying potassium [GIRK] channels), alters sleep architecture in mice over the first 6 h following a single-trial learning event. Following contextual fear conditioning (CFC), ML297 reversed post-CFC reductions in NREM sleep spindle power and REM sleep amounts and architecture, renormalizing sleep features to what was observed at baseline, prior to CFC. Renormalization of post-CFC REM sleep latency, REM sleep amounts, and NREM spindle power were all associated with improved contextual fear memory (CFM) consolidation. We find that improvements in CFM consolidation due to ML297 are sleep-dependent, and are associated with increased numbers of highly activated dentate gyrus (DG), CA1, and CA3 neurons during CFM recall. Together our findings suggest that GIRK1 channel activation restores normal sleep architecture - including REM sleep, which is normally suppressed following CFC - and increases the number of hippocampal neurons incorporated into the CFM engram during memory consolidation.

	<p>Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a chronic and debilitating mental disorder. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a promising approach for refractory OCD patients. Research aiming at treatment outcome prediction is vital to provide optimized treatments for different patients. The primary purpose of this systematic review was to collect and synthesize studies on outcome prediction of OCD patients with DBS implantations in recent years. This systematic review (PROSPERO registration number: CRD42022335585) followed the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis) guidelines. The search was conducted using three different databases with the following search terms related to OCD and DBS. We identified a total of 3814 articles, and 17 studies were included in our review. A specific tract confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was predictable for DBS outcome regardless of implant targets, but inconsistencies still exist. Current studies showed various ways of successful treatment prediction. However, considering the heterogeneous results, we hope that future studies will use larger cohorts and more precise approaches for predictors and establish more personalized ways of DBS surgeries.</p>

	<p>Alcohol use confers risk for suicidal thoughts and behaviors (ideation, attempt) in early adolescents. The Research Domain Criteria provides a framework for examination of multidimensional and modifiable risk factors. We examined distinct latent profiles based on patterns of positive valence (reward responsivity) and cognitive systems (neurocognition) from the ABCD Study (age 9&amp;amp;ndash;10, N = 10,414) at baseline enrollment. Longitudinal associations were determined between baseline positive valence and cognitive profiles and group classification (alcohol use, suicidal thoughts and behaviors, or their co-occurrence) two-years after initial assessment (ages 11&amp;amp;ndash;12). Three unique profiles of positive valence, cognition, alcohol use, and suicidal thoughts and behaviors were identified. Two baseline profiles predicted alcohol use and suicidal thoughts and behaviors, two-years after initial assessment. Low positive valence with high cognition (but low impulsivity) predicted alcohol use (OR = 1.414, p&amp;amp;lt; 0.001), while high positive valence with low cognition (but high impulsivity) predicted suicidal thoughts and behaviors (OR = 1.25, p = 0.038), compared to average positive valence and cognition. Unique profiles of positive valence and cognitive systems among 9&amp;amp;ndash;12-year-olds may be predictive of alcohol use and suicidal thoughts and behaviors over a two-year period. Findings underscore the potential for trajectory research on positive valence and cognitive profiles to enhance prevention for early-adolescents.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/inpress.rss">Neural basis of prosocial behavior</a></h4>

              
                The ability to behave in ways that benefit other individuals’ well-being is among the most celebrated human characteristics crucial for social cohesiveness. Across mammalian species, animals display various forms of prosocial behaviors – comforting, helping, and resource sharing – to support others’ emotions, goals, and/or material needs. In this review, we provide a cross-species view of the behavioral manifestations, proximate and ultimate drives, and neural mechanisms of prosocial behaviors. We summarize key findings from recent studies in humans and rodents that have shed light on the neural mechanisms underlying different processes essential for prosocial interactions, from perception and empathic sharing of others’ states to prosocial decisions and actions.

                BackgroundCharles Bonnet syndrome (CBS) is a prototype phenomenon for investigating complex visual hallucination. Our research focuses on resting state neural networks features of CBS patients with a comparison of patients with equally matched visual loss and healthy subjects in order to investigate the mechanism behind complex visual hallucinations.

Material and MethodsFour CBS patients CBS(+), three patients with visual loss but no visual hallucinations CBS(-) and 15 healthy individuals (HS) undergo resting state fMRI recordings and their resting state data is analyzed for Default Mode Network (DMN) changes through dual regression analysis. Cognitive functions of the participants were also evaluated through Mini Mental State Examination and University of Miami - Parkinsons Disease Hallucination Questionnaire (um-PDHQ)

ResultsAlthough we found no difference in Default Mode Networks between CBS(-) and CBS(+), and between the CBS(-) and HC groups, we detected decreased connectivity in CBS(+) compared to the HC group especially in visual heteromodal association centers (bilateral lateral occipital gyrus, bilateral lingual gyrus, occipital pole, right medial temporal cortex, right temporo-occipital cortex) when left angular gyrus was selected as ROI.

Similarly, we detected decreased connectivity in CBS(+) compared to HC in right medial frontal gyrus, right posterior cingulate gyrus, left inferior temporal gyrus, right supramarginal gyrus, and right angular gyrus when selected right superior frontal gyrus as ROI. In contrast, increased connectivity was detected in CBS +compared to HC, in bilateral occipital poles, bilateral occipital fusiform gyrus, bilateral intracalcarine cortex, right lingual gyrus and precuneus regions when left medial temporal gyrus was selected as ROI.

ConclusionOur findings suggest a combined mechanism in CBS related to increased internal created images caused by decreased visual external input causing visual hallucinations as well as impaired frontotemporal resource tracking system that together impair cognitive processing.

                An animals nervous system recognizes visual features regardless of where the visual feature is located. However, the underlying mechanisms that enable location invariant feature detection are not fully understood, particularly when visual feature information contributed by each eye needs to be resolved. Here we investigate directional invariance of looming responses in descending neurons (DN) of Drosophila melanogaster. We find multiple looming responsive DN integrate looming information across both eyes, even though their dendrites are unilateral. One DN in particular, the giant fibers (GF), generates invariant looming responses across approach directions. We confirm visual information propagates to the GF from the contralateral eye through an as of yet unidentified pathway and demonstrate the absence of this pathway alters GF responses to looming stimuli from the ipsilateral eye. Our data highlight a role for bilateral visual integration in generating consistent escape responses that are robust across a wide range of stimulus locations and parameters.

While there is growing evidence that cellular and molecular pathologies, such as the accumulation of amyloid beta plaques may contribute to AD, it remains unclear how this histopathology can give rise to such disparate behavioral deficits. One hypothesis for these diverse behavioral presentations is that amyloid beta plaques; accumulation has differential effects on neuronal circuits across brain regions, depending on the diverse neurophysiological properties and connections within and between the neurons in these different areas. To test this, we recorded from large neuronal populations in the dorsal and ventral CA1 regions of the hippocampus, areas that are known to be structurally and functionally diverse, in both APP/PS1 animals, a mouse model of Amyloid pathology, and age-matched C57BL/6 controls. Although we found similar levels of Amyloid pathology in the two subregions, populations of neurons in dorsal and ventral CA1 in APP/PS1 mice showed distinct signatures of disrupted neuronal activity as animals navigated a virtual reality environment. In dorsal CA1, pairwise correlations and entropy, a measure of the diversity of activity patterns, were decreased in the APP/PS1 mice. However, in ventral CA1, the opposite findings were observed; pair-wise correlations and entropy was increased in APP/PS1 mice relative to C57BL/6 controls. When we attempted to connect the microscopic features of population activity (the correlations) with the macroscopic features of the population code (the entropy) using a pairwise Ising model, we found that the models' performance decreased in predicting dorsal CA1 activity but increased in predicting vCA1 activity in APP/PS1 mice, as compared to the C57BL/6 animals. Taken together, these findings suggest that amyloid beta pathology exerts distinct effects across different hippocampal regions. Our results suggest that the diverse behavioral deficits associated with AD and the cellular pathology that arises from amyloid accumulation may be mechanistically linked by studying the dynamics of neural activity within these diverse hippocampal circuits.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Switches to rhythmic brain activity lead to a plasticity-induced reset in synaptic weights</a></h4>

              
                Brain function relies on the ability to quickly process incoming information while being capable of forming memories of past relevant events through the formation of novel synaptic connections. Synaptic connections are functionally strengthened or weakened to form new memories through synaptic plasticity rules that strongly rely on neuronal rhythmic activities. Brain information processing, on the other hand, is shaped by fluctuations in these neuronal rhythmic activities, each defining distinctive brain states, which poses the question of how such fluctuations in brain states affect the outcome of memory formation. This question is particularly relevant in the context of sleep-dependent memory consolidation, wakefulness to sleep transitions being characterized by large modifications in global neuronal activity. By combining computational models of neuronal activity switches and plasticity rules, we show that switches to rhythmic brain activity reminiscent of sleep lead to a reset in synaptic weights towards a basal value. This reset is shown to occur both in phenomenological and biophysical models of synaptic plasticity, and to be robust to neuronal and synaptic variability and network heterogeneity. Analytical analyses further show that the mechanisms of the synaptic reset are rooted in the endogenous nature of the sleep-like rhythmic activity. This sleep-dependent reset in synaptic weights permits regularizing synaptic connections during sleep, which could be a key component of sleep homeostasis and has the potential to play a central role in sleep-dependent memory consolidation.

                Early deafness leads to the reorganization of large-scale brain networks, involving and extending beyond the auditory system. Body-centered visuomotor transformation is impaired after early auditory deprivation, associated with a hyper-crosstalk between the task-critical frontoparietal network (FPN) and the default-mode network (DMN). It remains to be elucidated, how the reorganized functional connectivity between the auditory system, the FPN, and the DMN contributes to the impaired visuomotor transformation after early deafness. In this fMRI study, we asked early deaf participants and hearing controls to judge the spatial location of a visual target, either about the middle-sagittal line of their own body (the egocentric task) or another background object (the allocentric task). The bilateral superior temporal gyrus (STG) in the deaf group exhibited cross-modal reorganization, with generally enhanced neural activity during the visual tasks, compared to hearing controls. Moreover, the STG showed significantly increased functional connectivity with both the FPN and the DMN in the deaf group compared to hearing controls, specifically during the egocentric task. The increased STG-FPN and STG-DMN coupling, however, showed antagonistic effects on the egocentric performance of the deaf participants. The increased STG-FPN connectivity was associated with improved (i.e., a beneficial role) while the increased STG-DMN with deteriorated (i.e., a detrimental role) egocentric performance in the deaf participants. No such effect was observed in hearing controls. Therefore, the auditory cortex is reorganized to functionally resemble the FPN in the deaf brain, representing compensatory neuroplasticity to mitigate the impaired visuomotor transformation after early deafness.

                Perivascular spaces (PVS) are important highways for fluid and solute transport in the brain enabling efficient waste clearance during sleep. Using two-photon imaging of naturally sleeping mice we demonstrate sleep cycle-dependent PVS dynamics - slow, large-amplitude oscillations in NREM, a reduction in REM and an enlargement upon awakening at the end of a sleep cycle. By biomechanical modeling we demonstrate that these sleep cycle-dependent PVS dynamics drive fluid flow and solute transport.

                Early-life stress (ELS) leads to increased vulnerability to psychiatric disorders including depression later in life. Neuroinflammatory processes have been implicated in ELS-induced negative health outcomes, but how ELS impacts microglia, the main tissue-resident macrophages of the central nervous system, is unknown. Here, we determined the effects of ELS induced by limited bedding and nesting material during the first week of life (postnatal days [P]2 - 9) on microglial i) morphology; ii) hippocampal gene expression; and iii) synaptosome phagocytic capacity in male pups (P9) and adult (P200) mice. The hippocampus of ELS-exposed adult mice displayed altered proportions of morphological subtypes of microglia, as well as microglial transcriptomic changes related to the tumor necrosis factor response and protein ubiquitination. ELS exposure leads to distinct gene expression profiles during microglial development from P9 to P200 and in response to an LPS challenge at P200. Functionally, synaptosomes from ELS-exposed mice were phagocytosed less by age-matched microglia. At P200, but not P9, ELS microglia showed reduced synaptosome phagocytic capacity when compared to CTRL microglia. Lastly, we confirmed the ELS-induced increased expression of the phagocytosis-related gene GAS6 that we observed in mice, in the dentate gyrus of individuals with a history of child abuse using in situ hybridization. These findings reveal persistent effects of ELS on microglial function and suggest that altered microglial phagocytic capacity is a key contributor to ELS-induced phenotypes.

                The large heterogeneity in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a major drawback for the development of therapies. Here, we apply consensus-subtyping strategies based on functional connectivity patterns to a population of N=657 quality-assured autistic subjects. We found two major subtypes (each divided hierarchically into several minor subtypes): Subtype 1 exhibited hypoconnectivity (less average connectivity than typically developing controls) and subtype 2, hyperconnectivity. The two subtypes did not differ in structural imaging metrics in any of the regions analyzed (64 cortical and 14 subcortical), nor in any of the behavioral scores (including Intelligence Quotient, ADI and ADOS). Finally, we used the Allen Human Brain Atlas of gene transcription to show that subtype 2, corresponding with about 42% of all patients, had significant enrichment (after multiple comparisons correction) to excitation-inhibition (E/I) imbalance, a leading reported mechanism in the developmental pathophysiology of ASD. Altogether, our results support a link between E/I imbalance and brain hyperconnectivity in ASD, an association that does not exist in hypoconnected autistic subjects.

                Systemic responses to immune challenge are immature at birth. However exposure to experimental inflammogens are able to produce an immunologic response which is characterised by swelling and oedema but, unlike in adults, does not result in sensory hypersensitivity. We sought to investigate whether the lack of nociceptive hypersensitivity was as a result of altered hemapoietic immune cell recruitment to the site of inflammation and/or differences in the cytokine and chemokine profile released by tissue invading cells. Postnatal (day of birth) and young adult (40-days old) Sprague- Dawley rats were used. Inflammation was induced by s.c. injection of Complete Freunds Adjuvant (CFA) unilaterally into the one hind paw. Mechanical withdrawal thresholds were measured before and after injection (2-168hrs). In adults a significant hyperalgesia was evoked which was absent in neonates. Immunohistochemical analysis of invading immune cells present in the perfusion fixed skin showed that although total cell numbers in the paw were the same in both age groups, neonates recruited more cells positive for both cell surface markers CD68 and Mannose-receptor (MR) whereas adults recruited significantly more cells positive for MR alone. There were no differences in neutrophil recruitment (as measured with H&E staining). TaqMan qPCR demonstrated that the temporal profile of cytokine production in the skin differed between ages with neonates responding faster than adults and that neonates produced significantly more IL-1b and IL-27 then adults who expressed significantly more IL-6 and IL-10. This study illustrates that in neonates the cell recruitment and cytokine profiles are markedly different to those seen in adults; this may in part explain why behavioural responses to inflammation are suppressed relative to adults.

                Nociceptors play an essential role in both acute pain and chronic pain conditions. and have recently been classified into distinct subsets using single-cell transcriptional profiling. In this study, we examined protein levels in dorsal root ganglia using DIA Mass-spectrometry technologies with NaV1.8Cre+/-; ROSA26-flox-stop-flox-DTA (Diphtheria toxin fragment A) mutant mice (NaV1.8Cre-DTA), in which NaV1.8-expressing neurons (mainly nociceptors) in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) were ablated. The results show that 353 transcripts and 78 proteins, including nociceptor-specific sodium channels NaV1.8 (Scn10a) and NaV1.9 (Scn11a), were specifically expressed in nociceptors of DRG. A comparative analysis revealed that about 40% of nociceptor-specific proteins are shared within the nociceptor-specific transcript dataset. Scatter plots show that the proteome and transcriptome datasets in nociceptors have a moderate correlation (r = 0.4825), indicating the existence of post-transcriptional and post-translational gene regulation in nociceptors. This combined profiling study provides a unique resource for sensory studies, especially for pain research.

                To better understand fundamental constraints on the global structural organization of the brain, we apply percolation theory as a quantitative measure of global communication across a network. The largest present sub-network across which all sets of regions are able to communicate defines a giant cluster. By novel analytic solution, we prove that if constructed tracts are constrained to emanate from those regions already in the giant cluster, a giant cluster grows smoothly without requiring a critical point. The predicted structure is highly consistent with brain data, among human diffusion MRI across adults (UK Biobank, N=19,380), adolescents (Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study, N=15,593) and neonates (Developing Human Connectome Project, N=758), as well as mouse viral tracing (Allen Institute). This suggests a fundamental mechanism for neurodevelopment in which the earliest tracts also become the longest and densest.

                To explain the social difficulties in autism, a large amount of research has been conducted on the neural correlates of social perception. However, this research has mostly used basic social stimuli (e.g. eyes, faces, hands, single agent), not resembling the complexity of what we encounter in our daily social lives, and as such, the situations people with autism experience difficulties in. A more complex stimulus that we do come across often and is also highly relevant for social functioning is that of third-party social interactions. Here, we investigated if individuals with and without autism process third-party social interactions differently. More specifically, we measured neural responses to social scenes depicting either social interaction or not with an electroencephalogram (EEG) frequency tagging task and compared these responses between adults with and without autism (N = 61). The results revealed an enhanced response to social scenes with interaction, replicating previous findings in a neurotypical sample (Oomen et al., 2022). Crucially, this effect was found in both groups with no difference between them. This suggest that social interaction recognition is not anomalous in adults with autism and cannot explain the social difficulties adults with autism experience.

                Acupuncture plays a vital anti-inflammatory action on sepsis through activating autonomic nerve anti-inflammatory pathways, such as sympathoadrenal medullary pathway, but the mechanism remains unclear. This study aims to explore the optimum parameter of electroacupuncture (EA) stimulation in regulating sympathoadrenal medullary pathway and evaluate EA anti-inflammatory effect on sepsis. To explore the optimum parameter of EA at homosegmental acupoint on adrenal sympathetic activity, the left adrenal sympathetic nerve firing rate evoked by different intensities of single shock electrical stimulation (ES) at ST25 in healthy male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were evaluated by in vivo electrophysiological recording, and the levels of norepinephrine (NE) and its metabolites were also examined using mass spectrometry. To verify the role of EA at ST25 in sepsis, the rat was given intraperitoneal injection lipopolysaccharide to induce sepsis model, and survival rate, clinical score, and the level of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1{beta}, and IL-10 were evaluated after EA application. We observed that 3 mA is the optimal intensity on activating adrenal sympathetic nerve, which significantly elevated the level of NE in the peripheral blood. For LPS-treated rats, EA at the ST25 apparently increased the survival rate and improved the clinical score compared to the control group. Furthermore, 3 mA EA at ST25 significantly decreased pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-1{beta} and upregulated anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 compared to the Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated group. Overall, these data suggest that 3 mA is the optimal EA intensity at ST25 to activate the sympathoadrenal medullary pathway and exert an anti-inflammatory effect on sepsis.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The activity of deep cortical layers characterizes thecomplexity of brain responses during wakefulnessfollowing electrical stimulation</a></h4>

              
                It has been suggested that the complexity of the brain is closely related to its state of consciousness. The perturbational complexity index (PCI) has been used in humans and rodents to distinguish conscious from unconscious states based on the global cortical responses (recorded by electroencephalography; EEG) to local cortical stimulation (CS). However, it has been unclear how different cortical layers respond to CS and contribute to the resulting intra- and inter-areal cortical communication and PCI. A detailed investigation of these local dynamics is needed to understand the basis for PCI. We hypothesized that the complexity level of global cortical responses (PCI) corresponds to variations in layer-specific activity and connectivity patterns. We investigated global cortical dynamics and layer specific activity in mice, combining cortical electrical stimulation, global EEG, and local multi-electrode, laminar recordings from layers 1-6 in somatosensory cortex, during wakefulness and general anesthesia (sevoflurane). We found that transition from wake to sevoflurane anesthesia correlated with a drop in global and local PCI values (complexity). This was accompanied by a local decrease in neural firing rate, spike-field coherence, and long-range functional connectivity specific to deep layers (L5, L6). Our results suggest that deep cortical layers are mechanistically important for changes in PCI, and thereby for variations in the states of consciousness.

                Cortical neurons exhibit temporally irregular spiking patterns and heterogeneous firing rates. These features arise in model circuits operating in a 'fluctuation-driven regime', in which fluctuations in membrane potentials emerge from the network dynamics. However, it is still unclear whether the cortex operates in this regime. We evaluated the fluctuation-driven hypothesis by analyzing spiking and sub-threshold membrane potentials of neurons in the sensory and frontal cortex recorded during a decision-making task. Standard fluctuation-driven models account for spiking statistics but fail to capture the heterogeneity in sub-threshold activity. We address this issue by effectively incorporating dendritic conductances into the standard models. Our model suggests that the frontal cortex operates in a fluctuation-driven regime. In contrast, excitatory neurons in layer 4 of the barrel cortex are not fluctuation-driven; they spike in response to occasional synchronous inputs. Our work reveals fundamental differences between cortical areas, suggesting that they operate in different dynamical regimes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">ComBat Harmonization: Empirical Bayes versus Fully Bayes Approaches</a></h4>

              
                Studying small effects or subtle neuroanatomical variation requires large-scale sample size data. As a result, combining neuroimaging data from multiple datasets is necessary. Variation in acquisition protocols, magnetic field strength, scanner build, and many other non-biologically related factors can introduce undesirable bias into studies. Hence, harmonization is required to remove the bias-inducing factors from the data. ComBat, introduced by (Johnson et al., 2007), is one of the most common methods applied to features from structural images. ComBat models the data using a hierarchical Bayesian model and uses the empirical Bayes approach to infer the distribution of the unknown factors. The empirical Bayes harmonization method is computationally efficient and provides valid point estimates. However, it tends to underestimate uncertainty. This paper investigates a new approach, fully Bayesian ComBat, where Monte Carlo Sampling is used for statistical inference. Our experiments show that our new fully Bayesian approach offers more accurate harmonization, unconstrained posterior distributions, and representative uncertainty quantification at the expense of higher computation costs for the inference. This fully Bayesian approach generates a rich posterior distribution, which is also useful for generating simulated imaging features for improving classifier performance in a limited data setting. We show the generative capacity of our model for augmenting and improving the detection of patients with Alzheimer's disease. Posterior distributions for harmonized imaging measures can also be used for brain-wide uncertainty comparison and more principled downstream statistical analysis. Code for our new fully Bayesian ComBat extension is available at https://github.com/batmanlab/BayesComBat.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Information theoretic evidence for layer- and frequency-specific changes in cortical information processing under anesthesia</a></h4>

              
                Nature relies on highly distributed computation for the processing of information in nervous systems across the entire animal kingdom. Such distributed computation can be more easily understood if decomposed into the three elementary components of information processing, i.e. storage, transfer and modification, and rigorous information theoretic measures for these components exist. However, the distributed computation is often also linked to neural dynamics exhibiting distinct rhythms. Thus, it would be beneficial to associate the above components of information processing with distinct rhythmic processes where possible. Here we focus on the storage of information in neural dynamics and introduce a novel spectrally-resolved measure of active information storage (AIS). Drawing on intracortical recordings of neural activity under anesthesia before and after loss of consciousness (LOC) we show that anesthesia-related modulation of AIS is highly specific to different frequency bands and that these frequency-specific effects differ across cortical layers and brain regions. We found that in the high/low gamma band the effects of anesthesia result in AIS modulation only in the supergranular layers, while in the alpha/beta band the strongest decrease in AIS can be seen at infragranular layers. Finally, we show that the increase of spectral power at multiple frequencies, in particular at alpha and delta bands in frontal areas, that is often observed during LOC ('anteriorization') also impacts local information processing - but in a frequency specific way: Increases in isoflurane concentration induced a decrease in AIS in the alpha frequencies, while they increased AIS in the delta frequency range < 2Hz. Thus, the analysis of spectrally-resolved AIS provides valuable additional insights into changes in cortical information processing under anaesthesia.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Individual-level Functional ConnectivityPredicts Cognitive Control Efficiency</a></h4>

              
                Cognitive control (CC) is a vital component of cognition associated with problem-solving in everyday life. Many neurological and neuropsychiatric conditions have deficits associated with CC. CC is composed of multiple behaviors including switching, inhibiting, and updating. The fronto-parietal control network B (FPCN-B), the dorsal attention network (DAN), the cingulo-opercular network (CON) and the dorsal default-mode network (dorsal-DMN) have been associated with switching and inhibiting behaviors. However, our understanding of how these brain regions interact to bring about CC behaviors is still unclear. In the current study, participants performed two in-scanner tasks that required switching and inhibiting. We then used a series of support vector regression (SVR) models containing individually-estimated functional connectivity between the networks of interest derived during tasks and at rest to predict inhibition and switching behaviors in individual subjects. We observed that the combination of between-network connectivity from these individually estimated functional networks predicted accurate and timely inhibition and switching behaviors in individuals. We also observed that the relationships between canonical task-positive and task-negative networks predicted inhibiting and switching behaviors. Finally, we observed a functional dissociation between the FPCN-A and FPCN-B during rest, and task performance predicted inhibiting and switching behaviors. These results suggest that individually estimated networks can predict individual CC behaviors, that between-network functional connectivity estimated within individuals is vital to understanding how CC arises, and that the fractionation of the FPCN and the DMN may be associated with different behaviors than their canonically accepted behaviors.

                Bodily rhythms such as respiration are increasingly acknowledged to modulate neural oscillations underlying human action, perception, and cognition. Conversely, the link between respiration and aperiodic brain activity - a non-oscillatory reflection of excitation-inhibition (E:I) balance - has remained unstudied. Aiming to disentangle potential respiration-related dynamics of periodic and aperiodic activity, we applied novel algorithms of time-resolved parameter estimation to resting-state M/EEG data from two recording sites (N = 78). Our findings highlight the role of respiration as a physiological influence on brain signalling. We provide first evidence that fluctuations of aperiodic brain activity (1/f slope) are phase-locked to the respiratory cycle which strongly suggests that spontaneous state shifts of excitation-inhibition balance are at least partly influenced by peripheral bodily signals. Moreover, differential temporal dynamics in their coupling to non-oscillatory and oscillatory activity point towards a functional distinction in the way each component is related to respiration.

                Neuropeptide release from dense-core vesicles in Caenorhabditis elegans is promoted by UNC-31, ortholog of the calcium-dependent activator protein for secretion (CAPS). Loss of UNC-31 causes multiple phenotypes in C. elegans including reduced motility, retention of late-stage eggs and reduction in evoked synaptic release. However, the ability to analyze UNC-31 function over discrete timescales and in specific neurons is lacking. Here, we generated and validated a tool to enable UNC-31 expression and spatiotemporal functional analysis. We show that endogenously tagged UNC-31 is expressed in major ganglia and nerve cords from late-embryonic stages through to adult. Using the auxin-inducible degradation system, we depleted UNC-31 post-embryonically from the nervous system and revealed defects in egg-laying, locomotion and vesicle release that were comparable to unc-31 null mutant animals. In addition, we found that depleting UNC-31 specifically from the BAG sensory neurons causes increased intestinal fat storage, highlighting the spatial sensitivity of this system. Together, this protein degradation tool may be used to facilitate studies of neuropeptide function at precise cellular and temporal scales.

                Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is characterized by the progressive degeneration of corticospinal tract motor neurons. Previous studies showed that adenosine-mediated neuromodulation is disturbed in ALS and that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has a neuroprotective function in ALS mouse models. We evaluated how adenosine (A1R and A2AR) and VEGF (VEGFA, VEGFB, VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2) system markers are altered in the cortex and spinal cord of pre-symptomatic and symptomatic SOD1G93A mice. We then assessed if/how chronic treatment of SOD1G93A mice with a widely consumed adenosine receptor antagonist, caffeine, modulates VEGF system and/or the levels of Brain-derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF), known to be under control of A2AR. We found out decreases in A1R and increases in A2AR levels even before disease onset. Concerning the VEGF system, we detected increases of VEGFB and VEGFR-2 levels in the spinal cord at pre-symptomatic stage, which reverses at the symptomatic stage, and decreases of VEGFA levels in the cortex, in very late disease states. Chronic treatment with caffeine rescued cortical A1R levels in SOD1G93A mice, bringing them to control levels, while rendering VEGF signaling nearly unaffected. In contrast, BDNF levels were significantly affected in SOD1G93A mice treated with caffeine, being decreased in the cortex and increased in spinal the cord. Altogether, these findings suggest an early dysfunction of the adenosinergic system in ALS and highlights the possibility that the negative influence of caffeine previously reported in ALS animal models results from interference with BDNF rather than with the VEGF signaling molecules.

                The ability to associate reward-predicting stimuli with adaptive behavior is frequently attributed to the prefrontal cortex, but the stimulus-specificity, spatial distribution, and stability of neural cue-reward associations are unresolved. We trained headfixed mice on an olfactory Pavlovian conditioning task and measured the coding properties of individual neurons across space (prefrontal, olfactory, and motor cortices) and time (multiple days). Neurons encoding cues and licks were most common in olfactory and motor cortex, respectively. By classifying cue-encoding neurons according to their responses to the six odor cues, we unexpectedly found value coding, including coding of trial-by-trial reward history, in all regions we sampled. We further found that prefrontal cue and lick codes were preserved across days. Our results demonstrate that individual prefrontal neurons stably encode components of cue-reward learning within a larger spatial gradient of coding properties.

                Background: Neurons demonstrate very distinct nonlinear activation dynamics, influenced by the neuron type, morphology, ion channel expression, and various other factors. The measurement of the activation dynamics can identify the neural target of stimulation and detect deviations, e.g., for diagnosis. This paper describes a tool for closed-loop sequential parameter estimation (SPE) of the activation dynamics through transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). The proposed SPE method operates in real time, selects ideal stimulus parameters, detects and processes the response, and concurrently estimates the input-output (IO) curve and the first-order approximation of the activated neural target. Objective: To develop a SPE method to concurrently estimate the first-order activation dynamics and IO curve in closed-loop electromyography-guided (EMG-guided) TMS. Method: First, identifiability of the integrated model of the first-order neural activation dynamics and IO curve is assessed, demonstrating that at least two IO curves need to be acquired with different pulse widths. Then, a two-stage SPE method is proposed. It estimates the IO curve by using Fisher information matrix optimization in the first stage and subsequently estimates the membrane time constant as well as the coupling gain in the second stage. The procedure continues in a sequential manner until a stopping rule is satisfied. Results: The results of 73 simulation cases confirm the satisfactory estimation of the membrane time constant and coupling gain with average absolute relative errors (AREs) of 6.2% and 5.3%, respectively, with an average of 344 pulses (172 pulses for each IO curve or pulse width). The method estimates the IO curves' lower and upper plateaus, mid-point, and slope with average AREs of 0.2%, 0.7%, 0.9%, and 14.5%, respectively. Conclusions: SPE of the activation dynamics requires acquiring at least two IO curves with different pulse widths, which needs a TMS device with adjustable pulse duration. Significance: The proposed SPE method enhances the cTMS functionality, which can contribute novel insights in TMS studies.

                Previous studies have suggested that pupil size increases with covert shifts of attention to the peripheral as compared to the (para)foveal visual field, i.e., with increasing attentional breadth. This finding is crucial because it matches the theoretical prediction that (para)foveal vision benefits more from the visual acuity provided by small pupils than peripheral vision does. However, no study has investigated this question while controlling for all possible confounds (e.g., task difficulty). Throughout three experiments (N=100) we tested whether pupil size increases with increasing attentional breadth, and if this effect depends on the shape of attention, that is, whether attention is broadly (Annulus Attention) or narrowly (Spotlight Attention) distributed. We found that pupil size increases with covert shifts of attention to the peripheral visual field, i.e., increasing attentional breadth, with no clear difference between the two shapes of attention. We further found a correlation with performance, suggesting a functional benefit of the link between attentional breadth and pupil size. Finally, we propose that cognitively driven pupil dilation is not merely a convenient marker of activity in brain areas such as the Locus Coeruleus, but rather is an adaptive response that reflects an emphasis on peripheral vision over foveal vision.

	<p>Background: Despite significant research progress surrounding precision medicine in psychiatry, there has been little tangible impact upon real-world clinical care. Objective: To identify barriers and facilitators affecting the real-world implementation of precision psychiatry. Method: A PRISMA-compliant systematic literature search of primary research studies, conducted in the Web of Science, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PsycINFO and OpenGrey databases. We included a qualitative data synthesis structured according to the &amp;amp;lsquo;Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research&amp;amp;rsquo; (CFIR) key constructs. Results: Of 93,886 records screened, 28 studies were suitable for inclusion. The included studies reported 38 barriers and facilitators attributed to the CFIR constructs. Commonly reported barriers included: potential psychological harm to the service user (n = 11), cost and time investments (n = 9), potential economic and occupational harm to the service user (n = 8), poor accuracy and utility of the model (n = 8), and poor perceived competence in precision medicine amongst staff (n = 7). The most highly reported facilitator was the availability of adequate competence and skills training for staff (n = 7). Conclusions: Psychiatry faces widespread challenges in the implementation of precision medicine methods. Innovative solutions are required at the level of the individual and the wider system to fulfil the translational gap and impact real-world care.</p>

	<p>Backgrounds: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an emerging and promising therapeutic approach for treatment-refractory obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). The most common DBS targets include the anterior limb of internal capsule (ALIC) and nucleus accumbens (NAcc). This protocol aims to explore the efficacy and safety of the combined ALIC- and NAcc-DBS for treatment-refractory OCD. Methods: We will recruit 64 patients with refractory OCD from six centers, randomly allocate them to active and sham-stimulation groups through a three-month double-blind phase, then enter a three-month open-label phase. In the open-label stage, both groups experience real stimulation. Outcome measures: The primary outcome will be the efficacy and safety of combined ALIC- and NAcc-DBS, determined by treatment response rate between the active and sham-stimulation groups at the double-blind stage and spontaneously reported adverse events. The secondary outcomes are comparisons of change in Y&amp;amp;ndash;BOCS, CGI, HAMD, and HAMA scores at the third and sixth months compared to baseline between the active and sham-control groups, as well as the scores of the third month minus the sixth month between the two groups.</p>

	<p>Repetitive neuromuscular magnetic stimulation (rNMS) for pediatric headache disorders is feasible, safe, and alleviates headache symptoms. This study assesses muscular effects and factors affecting response to rNMS. A retrospective chart review included children with headaches receiving six rNMS sessions targeting the upper trapezius muscles. Pressure pain thresholds (PPT) were measured before and after rNMS, and at 3-month follow-up (FU). Mean headache frequency, duration, and intensity within the last 3 months were documented. In 20 patients (14.1 &amp;amp;plusmn; 2.7 years), PPT significantly increased from pre- to post-treatment (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) sustaining until FU. PPT changes significantly differed between primary headache and post-traumatic headache (PTH) (p = 0.019&amp;amp;ndash;0.026). Change in headache frequency was significantly higher in patients with than without neck pain (p = 0.032). A total of 60% of patients with neck pain responded to rNMS (&amp;amp;ge;25%), while 20% of patients without neck pain responded (p = 0.048). 60% of patients receiving rNMS twice a week were responders, while 33% of patients receiving rNMS less or more frequently responded to treatment, respectively. Alleviation of muscular hyperalgesia was demonstrated sustaining for 3 months, which was emphasized in PTH. The rNMS sessions may positively modulate headache symptoms regardless of headache diagnosis. Patients with neck pain profit explicitly well. Two rNMS sessions per week led to the highest reduction in headache frequency.</p>

	<p>Eye movement abnormalities in association with cognitive and emotional deficits have been described in neurological, neurodevelopmental, and psychiatric disorders. Eye-Tracking (ET) techniques could therefore enhance cognitive interventions by contingently providing feedback to patients. Since no consensus has been reached thus far on this approach, this study aimed at systematically reviewing the current evidence. This review was performed and reported according to PRISMA guidelines. Records were searched for in PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus (1990&amp;amp;ndash;2021) through the following string: (&amp;amp;lsquo;Eye Tracking&amp;amp;rsquo; OR &amp;amp;lsquo;Eye-Tracking&amp;amp;rsquo; OR &amp;amp;lsquo;Oculomotor&amp;amp;rsquo;) AND (&amp;amp;lsquo;Neuropsychol*&amp;amp;rsquo; OR &amp;amp;lsquo;Cognitive&amp;amp;rsquo;) AND (&amp;amp;lsquo;Rehabilitation&amp;amp;rsquo; OR &amp;amp;lsquo;Training&amp;amp;rsquo; OR &amp;amp;lsquo;Stimulation&amp;amp;rsquo;). Study outcomes were thematically classified and qualitatively synthesized. A structured quality assessment was performed. A total of 24 articles were included, addressing neurodevelopmental (preterm infants and children with autism spectrum disorder, Rett syndrome, or ADHD; N = 14), psychiatric (mood and anxiety disorders or alcohol dependence; N = 7), and neurological conditions (stroke; N = 3). Overall, ET gaze-contingent training proved to be effective in improving cognitive and emotional alterations. However, population heterogeneity limits the generalizability of results. ET gaze-contingent protocols allow researchers to directly and dynamically train attentional functions; together with the recruitment of implicit, &amp;amp;ldquo;bottom-up&amp;amp;rdquo; strategies, these protocols are promising and possibly integrable with traditional cognitive approaches.</p>

     alt="Enhanced nociceptive behavior and expansion of associated primary afferents in a rabbit model of cerebral palsy"/>
<p>Most individuals with cerebral palsy (CP) experience pain, yet it is understudied. We demonstrate altered distribution of nociceptive afferents in the dorsal horn of neonatal rabbits that experienced hypoxic–ischemic injury in utero; these anatomical changes were associated with nocifensive behavior indicative of pain. Our findings suggest that CP-causative injuries alter spinal sensory pathways (not only descending motor circuits), contributing to increased pain in CP.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Spastic cerebral palsy (CP) is a movement disorder marked by hypertonia and hyperreflexia; the most prevalent comorbidity is pain. Since spinal nociceptive afferents contribute to both the sensation of painful stimuli as well as reflex circuits involved in movement, we investigated the relationship between prenatal hypoxia–ischemia (HI) injury which can cause CP, and possible changes in spinal nociceptive circuitry. To do this, we examined nociceptive afferents and mechanical and thermal sensitivity of New Zealand White rabbit kits after prenatal HI or a sham surgical procedure. As described previously, a range of motor deficits similar to spastic CP was observed in kits born naturally after HI (40 min at ~70%–80% gestation). We found that HI caused an expansion of peptidergic afferents (marked by expression of calcitonin gene-related peptide) in both the superficial and deep dorsal horn at postnatal day (P)5. Non-peptidergic nociceptive afferent arborization (labeled by isolectin B4) was unaltered in HI kits, but overlap of the two populations (peptidergic and non-peptidergic nociceptors) was increased by HI. Density of glial fibrillary acidic protein was unchanged within spinal cord white matter regions important in nociceptive transmission at P5. We found that mechanical and thermal nociception was enhanced in HI kits even in the absence of motor deficits. These findings suggest that prenatal HI injury impacts spinal sensory pathways in addition to the more well-established disruptions to descending motor circuits. In conclusion, changes to spinal nociceptive circuitry could disrupt spinal reflexes and contribute to pain experienced by individuals with CP.</p>

<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>At the mouse neuromuscular junction, adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is co-released with the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh), and its metabolite adenosine, modulate neurotransmitter release by activating presynaptic inhibitory P2Y<sub>13</sub> receptors (a subtype of ATP/adenosine diphosphate [ADP] receptor), inhibitory A<sub>1</sub> and A<sub>3</sub> adenosine receptors, and excitatory A<sub>2A</sub> adenosine receptors. To study the effect of endogenous purines, when phrenic-diaphragm preparations are depolarized by different nerve stimulation patterns, we analyzed the effect of the antagonists for P2Y<sub>13</sub>, A<sub>1</sub>, A<sub>3</sub>, and A<sub>2A</sub> receptors (AR-C69931MX, 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine, MRS-1191, and SCH-58261, respectively) on the amplitude of the end-plate potentials of the trains, and contrasted these results with those obtained with the selective agonists of these receptors (2-methylthioadenosine 5′-diphosphate trisodium salt hydrate, 2-chloro-N<sup>6</sup>-cyclopentyl-adenosine, inosine, and PSB-0777, respectively). During continuous 0.5-Hz stimulation, the amount of endogenous purines was not enough to activate purinergic receptors, while at continuous 5-Hz stimulation, an incipient action of endogenous purines on P2Y<sub>13</sub>, A<sub>1</sub> and A3 receptors might be evident just at the end of the trains. During continuous 50-Hz stimulation, the concentration of endogenous ATP/ADP and adenosine exerted an inhibitory action on ACh release after of the initial phase of the train, but when the nerve was stimulated at intermittent 50 Hz (5 bursts), this behavior was not observed. Excitatory A<sub>2A</sub> receptors were only activated when continuous 100-Hz stimulation was applied. In conclusion, when motor nerve terminals are depolarized by repetitive stimulation of the phrenic nerve, endogenous ATP/ADP and adenosine are able to fine-tune neurosecretion depending on the frequency and pattern of stimulation.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Ultrasensitive Quantification of Multiple Estrogens in Songbird Blood and Microdissected Brain by LC-MS/MS</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Neuroestrogens are synthesized within the brain and regulate social behavior, learning and memory, and cognition. In song sparrows, <I>Melospiza melodia</I>, 17&beta;-estradiol (17&beta;-E<SUB>2</SUB>) promotes aggressive behavior, including during the nonbreeding season when circulating steroid levels are low. Estrogens are challenging to measure because they are present at very low levels, and current techniques often lack the sensitivity required. Furthermore, current methods often focus on 17&beta;-E<SUB>2</SUB> and disregard other estrogens. Here, we developed and validated a method to measure four estrogens [estrone (E<SUB>1</SUB>), 17&beta;-E<SUB>2</SUB>, 17&alpha;-estradiol (17&alpha;-E<SUB>2</SUB>), estriol (E<SUB>3</SUB>)] simultaneously in microdissected songbird brain, with high specificity, sensitivity, accuracy, and precision. We used liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), and to improve sensitivity, we derivatized estrogens using 1,2-dimethylimidazole-5-sulfonyl-chloride (DMIS). The straightforward protocol improved sensitivity by 10-fold for some analytes. There is substantial regional variation in neuroestrogen levels in brain areas that regulate social behavior in male song sparrows. For example, the auditory area NCM, which has high aromatase levels, has the highest E<SUB>1</SUB> and 17&beta;-E<SUB>2</SUB> levels. In contrast, estrogen levels in blood are very low. Estrogen levels in both brain and circulation are lower in the nonbreeding season than in the breeding season. This technique will be useful for estrogen measurement in songbirds and potentially other animal models.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Differential Effects of the G-Protein-Coupled Estrogen Receptor (GPER) on Rat Embryonic (E18) Hippocampal and Cortical Neurons</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Estrogen plays fundamental roles in nervous system development and function. Traditional studies examining the effect of estrogen in the brain have focused on the nuclear estrogen receptors (ERs), ER&alpha; and ER&beta;. Studies related to the extranuclear, membrane-bound G-protein-coupled ER (GPER/GPR30) have revealed a neuroprotective role for GPER in mature neurons. In this study, we investigated the differential effects of GPER activation in primary rat embryonic day 18 (E18) hippocampal and cortical neurons. Microscopy imaging, multielectrode array (MEA), and Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging experiments revealed that GPER activation with selective agonist, G-1, and nonselective agonist, 17&beta;-estradiol (E2), increased neural growth, neural firing activity, and intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> more profoundly in hippocampal neurons than in cortical neurons. The GPER-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> rise in hippocampal neurons involves internal Ca<sup>2+</sup> store release via activation of phospholipase C (PLC) and extracellular entry via Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels. Immunocytochemistry results revealed no observable difference in GPER expression/localization in neurons, yet real-time qPCR (RT-qPCR) and Western blotting showed a higher GPER expression in the cortex than hippocampus, implying that GPER expression level may not fully account for its robust physiological effects in hippocampal neurons. We used RNA sequencing data to identify distinctly enriched pathways and significantly expressed genes in response to G-1 or E2 in cultured rat E18 hippocampal and cortical neurons. In summary, the identification of differential effects of GPER activation on hippocampal and cortical neurons in the brain and the determination of key genes and molecular pathways are instrumental toward an understanding of estrogen&rsquo;s action in early neuronal development.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Explainable deep transfer learning model for disease risk prediction using high-dimensional genomic data</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Long Liu, Qingyu Meng, Cherry Weng, Qing Lu, Tong Wang, Yalu Wen</p>

Building an accurate disease risk prediction model is an essential step in the modern quest for precision medicine. While high-dimensional genomic data provides valuable data resources for the investigations of disease risk, their huge amount of noise and complex relationships between predictors and outcomes have brought tremendous analytical challenges. Deep learning model is the state-of-the-art methods for many prediction tasks, and it is a promising framework for the analysis of genomic data. However, deep learning models generally suffer from the curse of dimensionality and the lack of biological interpretability, both of which have greatly limited their applications. In this work, we have developed a deep neural network (DNN) based prediction modeling framework. We first proposed a group-wise feature importance score for feature selection, where genes harboring genetic variants with both linear and non-linear effects are efficiently detected. We then designed an explainable transfer-learning based DNN method, which can directly incorporate information from feature selection and accurately capture complex predictive effects. The proposed DNN-framework is biologically interpretable, as it is built based on the selected predictive genes. It is also computationally efficient and can be applied to genome-wide data. Through extensive simulations and real data analyses, we have demonstrated that our proposed method can not only efficiently detect predictive features, but also accurately predict disease risk, as compared to many existing methods.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Dimensionality reduction of longitudinal ’omics data using modern tensor factorizations</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Uria Mor, Yotam Cohen, Rafael Valdés-Mas, Denise Kviatcovsky, Eran Elinav, Haim Avron</p>

Longitudinal ’omics analytical methods are extensively used in the field of evolving precision medicine, by enabling ‘big data’ recording and high-resolution interpretation of complex datasets, driven by individual variations in response to perturbations such as disease pathogenesis, medical treatment or changes in lifestyle. However, inherent technical limitations in biomedical studies often result in the generation of feature-rich and sample-limited datasets. Analyzing such data using conventional modalities often proves to be challenging since the repeated, high-dimensional measurements overload the outlook with inconsequential variations that must be filtered from the data in order to find the true, biologically relevant signal. Tensor methods for the analysis and meaningful representation of multi-way data may prove useful to the biological research community by their advertised ability to tackle this challenge. In this study, we present tcam—a new unsupervised tensor factorization method for the analysis of multi-way data. Building on top of cutting-edge developments in the field of tensor-tensor algebra, we characterize the unique mathematical properties of our method, namely, 1) preservation of geometric and statistical traits of the data, which enables uncovering information beyond the inter-individual variation that often takes-over the focus, especially in human studies. 2) Natural and straightforward out-of-sample extension, making tcam amenable for integration in machine learning workflows. A series of re-analyses of real-world, human experimental datasets showcase these theoretical properties, while providing empirical confirmation of tcam’s utility in the analysis of longitudinal ’omics data.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Leveraging a physiologically-based quantitative translational modeling platform for designing B cell maturation antigen-targeting bispecific T cell engagers for treatment of multiple myeloma</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Tomoki Yoneyama, Mi-Sook Kim, Konstantin Piatkov, Haiqing Wang, Andy Z. X. Zhu</p>

Bispecific T cell engagers (TCEs) are an emerging anti-cancer modality that redirects cytotoxic T cells to tumor cells expressing tumor-associated antigens (TAAs), thereby forming immune synapses to exert anti-tumor effects. Designing pharmacokinetically acceptable TCEs and optimizing their size presents a considerable protein engineering challenge, particularly given the complexity of intercellular bridging between T cells and tumor cells. Therefore, a physiologically-relevant and clinically-verified computational modeling framework is of crucial importance to understand the protein engineering trade-offs. In this study, we developed a quantitative, physiologically-based computational framework to predict immune synapse formation for a variety of molecular formats of TCEs in tumor tissues. Our model incorporates a molecular size-dependent biodistribution using the two-pore theory, extravasation of T cells and hematologic cancer cells, mechanistic bispecific intercellular binding of TCEs, and competitive inhibitory interactions by shed targets. The biodistribution of TCEs was verified by positron emission tomography imaging of [<sup>89</sup>Zr]AMG211 (a carcinoembryonic antigen-targeting TCE) in patients. Parameter sensitivity analyses indicated that immune synapse formation was highly sensitive to TAA expression, degree of target shedding, and binding selectivity to tumor cell surface TAAs over shed targets. Notably, the model suggested a “sweet spot” for TCEs’ CD3 binding affinity, which balanced the trapping of TCEs in T-cell-rich organs. The final model simulations indicated that the number of immune synapses is similar (~55/tumor cell) between two distinct clinical stage B cell maturation antigen (BCMA)-targeting TCEs, PF-06863135 in an IgG format and AMG420 in a BiTE format, at their respective efficacious doses in multiple myeloma patients. This result demonstrates the applicability of the developed computational modeling framework to molecular design optimization and clinical benchmarking for TCEs, thus suggesting that this framework can be applied to other targets to provide a quantitative means to facilitate model-informed best-in-class TCE discovery and development.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">A Krüppel-like factor is required for development and regeneration of germline and yolk cells from somatic stem cells in planarians</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Melanie Issigonis, Akshada B. Redkar, Tania Rozario, Umair W. Khan, Rosa Mejia-Sanchez, Sylvain W. Lapan, Peter W. Reddien, Phillip A. Newmark</p>

Sexually reproducing animals segregate their germline from their soma. In addition to gamete-producing gonads, planarian and parasitic flatworm reproduction relies on yolk cell–generating accessory reproductive organs (vitellaria) supporting development of yolkless oocytes. Despite the importance of vitellaria for flatworm reproduction (and parasite transmission), little is known about this unique evolutionary innovation. Here, we examine reproductive system development in the planarian <i>Schmidtea mediterranea</i>, in which pluripotent stem cells generate both somatic and germ cell lineages. We show that a homolog of the pluripotency factor Klf4 is expressed in primordial germ cells (PGCs), presumptive germline stem cells (GSCs), and yolk cell progenitors. Knockdown of this <i>klf4-like</i> (<i>klf4l</i>) gene results in animals that fail to specify or maintain germ cells; surprisingly, they also fail to maintain yolk cells. We find that yolk cells display germ cell–like attributes and that vitellaria are structurally analogous to gonads. In addition to identifying a new proliferative cell population in planarians (yolk cell progenitors) and defining its niche, our work provides evidence supporting the hypothesis that flatworm germ cells and yolk cells share a common evolutionary origin.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Medial temporal lobe (MTL) atrophy is a core feature of age-related cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease (AD). While regional volumes and thickness are often used as a proxy for neurodegeneration, they lack the sensitivity to serve as an accurate diagnostic test and indicate advanced neurodegeneration. Here, we used a submillimeter resolution diffusion weighted MRI sequence (ZOOMit) to quantify microstructural properties of hippocampal subfields in older adults (63–98 years old) using tensor derived measures: fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD). We demonstrate that the high-resolution sequence, and not a standard resolution sequence, identifies dissociable profiles for CA1, dentate gyrus (DG), and the collateral sulcus. Using ZOOMit, we show that advanced age is associated with increased MD of the CA1 and DG as well as decreased FA of the DG. Increased MD of the DG, reflecting decreased cellular density, mediated the relationship between age and word list recall. Further, increased MD in the DG, but not DG volume, was linked to worse spatial pattern separation. Our results demonstrate that ultrahigh-resolution diffusion imaging enables the detection of microstructural differences in hippocampal subfield integrity and will lead to novel insights into the mechanisms of age-related memory loss.</p>

                Understanding how genetic variation shapes a complex trait relies on accurately quantifying both the additive genetic and genotype–environment interaction effects in an age-dependent manner. We used a linear mixed model to quantify diet-dependent genetic contributions to body weight measured through adulthood in diversity outbred female mice under five diets. We observed that heritability of body weight declined with age under all diets, except the 40% calorie restriction diet. We identified 14 loci with age-dependent associations and 19 loci with age- and diet-dependent associations, with many diet-dependent loci previously linked to neurological function and behavior in mice or humans. We found their allelic effects to be dynamic with respect to genomic background, age, and diet, identifying several loci where distinct alleles affect body weight at different ages. These results enable us to more fully understand and predict the effectiveness of dietary intervention on overall health throughout age in distinct genetic backgrounds.

                The supraspinal connectome is essential for normal behavior and homeostasis and consists of numerous sensory, motor, and autonomic projections from brain to spinal cord. Study of supraspinal control and its restoration after damage has focused mostly on a handful of major populations that carry motor commands, with only limited consideration of dozens more that provide autonomic or crucial motor modulation. Here we assemble an experimental workflow to rapidly profile the entire supraspinal mesoconnectome in adult mice and disseminate the output in a web-based resource. Optimized viral labeling, 3D imaging, and registration to a mouse digital neuroanatomical atlas assigned tens of thousands of supraspinal neurons to 69 identified regions. We demonstrate the ability of this approach to clarify essential points of topographic mapping between spinal levels, to measure population-specific sensitivity to spinal injury, and to test relationships between region-specific neuronal sparing and variability in functional recovery. This work will spur progress by broadening understanding of essential but understudied supraspinal populations.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Brain-wide screen of prelimbic cortex inputs reveals a functional shift during early fear memory consolidation</a></h4>

              
                Memory formation and storage rely on multiple interconnected brain areas, the contribution of which varies during memory consolidation. The medial prefrontal cortex, in particular the prelimbic cortex (PL), was traditionally found to be involved in remote memory storage, but recent evidence points toward its implication in early consolidation as well. Nevertheless, the inputs to the PL governing these dynamics remain unknown. Here, we first performed a brain-wide, rabies-based retrograde tracing screen of PL engram cells activated during contextual fear memory formation in male mice to identify relevant PL input regions. Next, we assessed the specific activity pattern of these inputs across different phases of memory consolidation, from fear memory encoding to recent and remote memory recall. Using projection-specific chemogenetic inhibition, we then tested their functional role in memory consolidation, which revealed a hitherto unknown contribution of claustrum to PL inputs at encoding, and of insular cortex to PL inputs at recent memory recall. Both of these inputs further impacted how PL engram cells were reactivated at memory recall, testifying to their relevance for establishing a memory trace in the PL. Collectively, these data identify a spatiotemporal shift in PL inputs important for early memory consolidation, and thereby help to refine the working model of memory formation.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Analysis of allelic cross-reactivity of monoclonal IgG antibodies by a multiplexed reverse FluoroSpot assay</a></h4>

              
                The issue of antibody cross-reactivity is of central importance in immunology, and not least in protective immunity to <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> malaria, where key antigens show substantial allelic variation (polymorphism). However, serological analysis often does not allow the distinction between true cross-reactivity (one antibody recognizing multiple antigen variants) and apparent cross-reactivity (presence of multiple variant-specific antibodies), as it requires analysis at the single B-cell/monoclonal antibody level. ELISpot is an assay that enables that, and a recently developed multiplexed variant of ELISpot (FluoroSpot) facilitates simultaneous assessment of B-cell/antibody reactivity to several different antigens. In this study, we present a further enhancement of this assay that makes direct analysis of monoclonal antibody-level cross-reactivity with allelic variants feasible. Using VAR2CSA-type PfEMP1—a notoriously polymorphic antigen involved in the pathogenesis of placental malaria—as a model, we demonstrate the robustness of the assay and its applicability to analysis of true cross-reactivity of monoclonal VAR2CSA-specific antibodies in naturally exposed individuals. The assay is adaptable to the analysis of other polymorphic antigens, rendering it a powerful tool in studies of immunity to malaria and many other diseases.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Phosphoregulation accommodates Type III secretion and assembly of a tether of ER-Chlamydia inclusion membrane contact sites</a></h4>

              
                Membrane contact sites (MCS) are crucial for nonvesicular trafficking-based interorganelle communication. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER)–organelle tethering occurs in part through the interaction of the ER resident protein VAP with FFAT motif-containing proteins. FFAT motifs are characterized by a seven amino acidic core surrounded by acid tracks. We have previously shown that the human intracellular bacterial pathogen <i>Chlamydia trachomatis</i> establishes MCS between its vacuole (the inclusion) and the ER through expression of a bacterial tether, IncV, displaying molecular mimicry of eukaryotic FFAT motif cores. Here, we show that multiple layers of host cell kinase-mediated phosphorylation events govern the assembly of the IncV–VAP tethering complex and the formation of ER-Inclusion MCS. Via a C-terminal region containing three CK2 phosphorylation motifs, IncV recruits CK2 to the inclusion leading to IncV hyperphosphorylation of the noncanonical FFAT motif core and serine-rich tracts immediately upstream of IncV FFAT motif cores. Phosphorylatable serine tracts, rather than genetically encoded acidic tracts, accommodate Type III-mediated translocation of IncV to the inclusion membrane, while achieving full mimicry of FFAT motifs. Thus, regulatory components and post-translational modifications are integral to MCS biology, and intracellular pathogens such as <i>C. trachomatis</i> have evolved complex molecular mimicry of these eukaryotic features.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A non-transcriptional function of Yap regulates the DNA replication program</a></h4>

              
                In multicellular eukaryotic organisms, the initiation of DNA replication occurs asynchronously throughout S-phase according to a regulated replication timing program. Here, using <i>Xenopus</i> egg extracts, we showed that Yap (Yes-associated protein 1), a downstream effector of the Hippo signalling pathway, is required for the control of DNA replication dynamics. We found that Yap is recruited to chromatin at the start of DNA replication and identified Rif1, a major regulator of the DNA replication timing program, as a novel Yap binding protein. Furthermore, we show that either Yap or Rif1 depletion accelerates DNA replication dynamics by increasing the number of activated replication origins. In <i>Xenopus</i> embryos, using a Trim-Away approach during cleavage stages devoid of transcription, we found that either Yap or Rif1 depletion triggers an acceleration of cell divisions, suggesting a shorter S-phase by alterations of the replication program. Finally, our data show that Rif1 knockdown leads to defects in the partitioning of early versus late replication foci in retinal stem cells, as we previously showed for Yap. Altogether, our findings unveil a non-transcriptional role for Yap in regulating replication dynamics. We propose that Yap and Rif1 function as breaks to control the DNA replication program in early embryos and post-embryonic stem cells.

                Circular RNAs (circRNAs) comprise a novel class of regulatory RNAs that are abundant in the brain, particularly within synapses. They are highly stable, dynamically regulated, and display a range of functional roles, including as decoys for miRNAs and proteins and, in some cases, translation. Early work in animal models revealed an association between circRNAs and neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders; however, relatively few studies have shown a causal link between circRNA function and memory. To address this knowledge gap, we sequenced circRNAs in the synaptosome compartment of the medial prefrontal cortex of fear extinction trained male C57BL/6J mice and found 12837 circRNAs enriched at the synapse, including Cdr1as. Targeted knockdown of Cdr1as in the neural processes of the infralimbic prefrontal cortex of male C57BL/6J mice led to impaired fear extinction memory. Altogether, our findings highlight the importance of localised circRNA activity at the synapse for memory formation and suggest that circRNAs may have a more widespread effect on brain function than previously thought.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Multisite gating in tonic sensory circuits integrates multimodal context to control persistent behavioral states</a></h4>

              
                Maintaining or shifting between behavioral states according to context is essential for animals to implement fitness-promoting strategies. How integration of internal state, past experience and sensory inputs orchestrate persistent multidimensional behavior changes remains poorly understood. Here, we show that C. elegans integrates food availability and environment temperature over different timescales to engage in persistent dwelling, scanning, global or glocal search strategies matching thermoregulatory and feeding needs. Transition between states, in each case, requires lifting multiple regulatory gates including AFD or FLP tonic sensory neurons activity, neuropeptide expression and downstream circuit responsiveness. State-specific FLP-6 or FLP-5 neuropeptide signaling acts on a distributed set of inhibitory receptors to promote scanning or glocal search, respectively, bypassing dopamine and glutamate-dependent behavioral state control. Multisite gating-dependent behavioral switch by GPCRs in tonic sensory circuits might represent a conserved regulatory logic for persistent behavioral state transitions enabling a flexible prioritization on the valance of multiple inputs.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Beta bursts over frontal cortex track the surprise of unexpected events in auditory, visual, and tactile modalities</a></h4>

              
                One of the fundamental ways in which the brain regulates and monitors behavior is by making predictions about the sensory environment and adjusting behavior when those expectations are violated. As such, surprise is one of the fundamental computations performed by the human brain. In recent years, it has been well-established that one key aspect by which behavior is adjusted during surprise is inhibitory control of the motor system. Moreover, since surprise automatically triggers inhibitory control without much proactive influence, it can provide unique insights into largely reactive control processes. Recent years have seen tremendous interest in burst-like beta frequency events in the human (and non-human) local field potential--especially over (pre)frontal cortex--as a potential signature of inhibitory control. To date, beta-bursts have only been studied in paradigms involving a substantial amount of proactive control (such as the stop-signal task). Here, we used two cross-modal oddball tasks to investigate whether surprise processing is accompanied by increases in scalp-recorded beta-bursts. Indeed, we found that unexpected events in all tested sensory domains (haptic, auditory, visual) were followed by low-latency increases in beta-bursting over frontal cortex. Moreover, across experiments, beta-burst rates were positively correlated with estimates of surprise derived from Shannon's information theory. As such, the current work clearly implicates frontal beta-bursts as a signature of surprise processing. We discuss these findings in the context of common frameworks of inhibitory and cognitive control after unexpected events.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Mechanisms underlying reshuffling of visual responses by optogenetic stimulation in mice and monkeys</a></h4>

              
                The ability to observe the response of neural circuits to controlled optogenetic perturbations opens an unprecedented window into the mechanisms governing network dynamics and computations. We combined an analysis of neuronal responses to visual and optogenetic inputs in mice and monkey V1 with theoretical modelling. In both species, we found that optogenetic stimulation of excitatory neurons strongly modulated the activity of single neurons, but had only a weak effect on the distribution of firing rates across the population. Key statistics of responses of mice and monkeys lay on a continuum, with mice/monkeys occupying the low/high rate regions, respectively. At high contrast of the visual stimulus, optogenetic inputs did not significantly affect the distribution of firing rates, i.e. they reshuffled firing rates across the network. We show that neuronal reshuffling emerges generically in randomly connected networks of excitatory and inhibitory neurons, as long as the combination of recurrent coupling and feedforward input is sufficiently strong so that a powerful inhibitory feedback cancels the mean increase in firing rate due to optogenetic input.

                Predictions are constantly generated from diverse sources to optimize cognitive functions in the ever-changing environment. However, the neural origin and generation process of top-down induced prediction remain elusive. We hypothesized that motor-based and memory-based predictions are mediated by distinct feedback networks from motor and memory systems to the sensory cortices. Using fMRI and a dual imagery paradigm, we showed that motor and memory upstream systems excited the auditory cortex in a content-specific manner. Moreover, the inferior and posterior parts of the parietal lobe differentially relayed predictive signals in motor-to-sensory and memory-to-sensory networks. Our results reveal the functionally distinct neural networks that mediate top-down sensory prediction and ground the neurocomputational basis of predictive processing.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Transcriptional Profiling of the Hippocampus in an F2 Cross of a Genetic Rat Model of Internalizing vs. Externalizing Behavior and Addiction Liability</a></h4>

              
                In humans, differences in temperament are highly predictive of classes of psychopathology classified as externalizing versus internalizing disorders. To better understand the genetic and neural causes of temperamental differences, we have selectively bred two lines of rats based on their exploration of a novel environment. The bred High Responder (bHR) and bred Low Responder (bLR) rats show contrasting heritable behaviors that map onto human temperamental differences and are associated with two paths to drug abuse--sensation seeking and reactivity to psychosocial stress. To elucidate the genes that underlie the divergent behavior of bHR/bLR rats, we created a bHRxbLR F0-F1-F2 cross and performed behavioral testing, transcriptional profiling, and genetic sequencing. We used RNA-Seq to characterize hippocampal tissue in F0s (n=24, n=6 per phenotype /sex) and F2s (n=250, n=125 per sex) to identify differentially expressed genes related to bHR/bLR lineage and phenotypical behaviors: locomotor response to novelty, anxiety, and Pavlovian Conditioned Approach (PavCA).

We found that bHR/bLR phenotypical behaviors remained correlated in the F2s, implying a shared genetic basis. We also found robust differences in hippocampal transcriptional profiles associated with bHR/bLR lineage in the F0s which surpassed the differences associated with sex. These distinct expression profiles were predictive of gene expression patterns associated with F2 bHR/bLR behavior. We then prioritized bHR/bLR differentially expressed genes identified in our current and previous studies as candidates for mediating bHR/bLR phenotypical behaviors in F2s. Seventeen genes were differentially expressed in association with locomotor response to novelty, many of which also had nominal relationships with PavCA behavior. Seven of these genes were located near (+/-1MB) quantitative trait loci for bHR/bLR phenotypical behavior identified in our previous exome sequencing or genome wide association studies: AABR07071904, Ucp2, Ttc30a1, Fzd6, Spg7, Vps9d1, and Afg3l1. We also identified convergence between our model and other genetic rat models targeting internalizing behaviors, with 26 hippocampal genes showing shared patterns of differential expression, including Tmem144 and Mfge8. Our findings provide strong candidates for elucidating genetic and neurobiological factors that may shape differences in temperament and modulate vulnerability to psychiatric and addictive disorders.

	<p>In conversational speech, phones and entire syllables are often missing. This can make &amp;amp;ldquo;he&amp;amp;rsquo;s&amp;amp;rdquo; and &amp;amp;ldquo;he was&amp;amp;rdquo; homophonous, realized for example as [&amp;amp;#616;z]. Similarly, &amp;amp;ldquo;you&amp;amp;rsquo;re&amp;amp;rdquo; and &amp;amp;ldquo;you were&amp;amp;rdquo; can both be realized as [j&amp;amp;#602;], [&amp;amp;#616;], etc. We investigated what types of information native listeners use to perceive such verb tenses. Possible types included acoustic cues in the phrase (e.g., in &amp;amp;ldquo;he was&amp;amp;rdquo;), the rate of the surrounding speech, and syntactic and semantic information in the utterance, such as the presence of time adverbs such as &amp;amp;ldquo;yesterday&amp;amp;rdquo; or other tensed verbs. We extracted utterances such as &amp;amp;ldquo;So they&amp;amp;rsquo;re gonna have like a random roommate&amp;amp;rdquo; and &amp;amp;ldquo;And he was like, &amp;amp;lsquo;What&amp;amp;rsquo;s wrong?!&amp;amp;rsquo;&amp;amp;rdquo; from recordings of spontaneous conversations. We presented parts of these utterances to listeners, in either a written or auditory modality, to determine which types of information facilitated listeners&amp;amp;rsquo; comprehension. Listeners rely primarily on acoustic cues in or near the target words rather than meaning and syntactic information in the context. While that information also improves comprehension in some conditions, the acoustic cues in the target itself are strong enough to reverse the percept that listeners gain from all other information together. Acoustic cues override other information in comprehending reduced productions in conversational speech.</p>

	<p>Predicting neurological outcomes after cardiac arrest remains a major issue. This study aimed to identify novel biomarkers capable of predicting neurological prognosis after cardiac arrest. Expression profiles of GSE29540 and GSE92696 were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database to obtain differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between high and low brain performance category (CPC) scoring subgroups. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was used to screen key gene modules and crossover genes in these datasets. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of crossover genes was constructed from the STRING database. Based on the PPI network, the most important hub genes were identified by the cytoHubba plugin of Cytoscape software. Eight hub genes (RPL27, EEF1B2, PFDN5, RBX1, PSMD14, HINT1, SNRPD2, and RPL26) were finally screened and validated, which were downregulated in the group with poor neurological prognosis. In addition, GSEA identified critical pathways associated with these genes. Finally, a Pearson correlation analysis showed that the mRNA expression of hub genes EEF1B2, PSMD14, RPFDN5, RBX1, and SNRPD2 were significantly and positively correlated with NDS scores in rats. Our work could provide comprehensive insights into understanding pathogenesis and potential new biomarkers for predicting neurological outcomes after cardiac arrest.</p>

	<p>Electric and magnetic stimulation of the human brain can be used to excite or inhibit neurons. Numerous methods have been designed over the years for this purpose with various advantages and disadvantages that are the topic of this review. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is the most direct and focal application of electric impulses to brain tissue. Electrodes are placed in the brain in order to modulate neural activity and to correct parameters of pathological oscillation in brain circuits such as their amplitude or frequency. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a non-invasive alternative with the stimulator generating a magnetic field in a coil over the scalp that induces an electric field in the brain which, in turn, interacts with ongoing brain activity. Depending upon stimulation parameters, excitation and inhibition can be achieved. Transcranial electric stimulation (tES) applies electric fields to the scalp that spread along the skull in order to reach the brain, thus, limiting current strength to avoid skin sensations and cranial muscle pain. Therefore, tES can only modulate brain activity and is considered subthreshold, i.e., it does not directly elicit neuronal action potentials. In this review, we collect hints for neuroplastic changes such as modulation of behavior, the electric activity of the brain, or the evolution of clinical signs and symptoms in response to stimulation. Possible mechanisms are discussed, and future paradigms are suggested.</p>

	<p>The evaluation of nanomechanical properties of tissues in health and disease is of increasing interest to scientists. It has been confirmed that these properties, determined in part by the composition of the extracellular matrix, significantly affect tissue physiology and the biological behavior of cells, mainly in terms of their adhesion, mobility, or ability to mutate. Importantly, pathophysiological changes that determine disease development within the tissue usually result in significant changes in tissue mechanics that might potentially affect the drug efficacy, which is important from the perspective of development of new therapeutics, since most of the currently used in vitro experimental models for drug testing do not account for these properties. Here, we provide a summary of the current understanding of how the mechanical properties of brain tissue change in pathological conditions, and how the activity of the therapeutic agents is linked to this mechanical state.</p>

	<p>There are many applications controlled by the brain signals to bridge the gap in the digital divide between the disabled and the non-disabled people. The deployment of novel assistive technologies using brain-computer interface (BCI) will go a long way toward achieving this lofty goal, especially after the successes demonstrated by these technologies in the daily life of people with severe disabilities. This paper contributes in this direction by proposing an integrated framework to control the operating system functionalities using Electroencephalography signals. Different signal processing algorithms were applied to remove artifacts, extract features, and classify trials. The proposed approach includes different classification algorithms dedicated to detecting the P300 responses efficiently. The predicted commands passed through a socket to the API system, permitting the control of the operating system functionalities. The proposed system outperformed those obtained by the winners of the BCI competition and reached an accuracy average of 94.5% according to the offline approach. The framework was evaluated according to the online process and achieved an excellent accuracy attaining 97% for some users but not less than 90% for others. The suggested framework enhances the information accessibility for people with severe disabilities and helps them perform their daily tasks efficiently. It permits the interaction between the user and personal computers through the brain signals without any muscular efforts.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Navigating the Statistical Minefield of Model Selection and Clustering in Neuroscience</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Model selection is often implicit: when performing an ANOVA, one assumes that the normal distribution is a good model of the data; fitting a tuning curve implies that an additive and a multiplicative scaler describes the behavior of the neuron; even calculating an average implicitly assumes that the data were sampled from a distribution that has a finite first statistical moment: the mean. Model selection may be explicit, when the aim is to test whether one model provides a better description of the data than a competing one. As a special case, clustering algorithms identify groups with similar properties within the data. They are widely used from spike sorting to cell type identification to gene expression analysis. We discuss model selection and clustering techniques from a statistician&rsquo;s point of view, revealing the assumptions behind, and the logic that governs the various approaches. We also showcase important neuroscience applications and provide suggestions how neuroscientists could put model selection algorithms to best use as well as what mistakes should be avoided.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">If you don’t let it in, you don’t have to get it out: Thought preemption as a method to control unwanted thoughts</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Isaac Fradkin, Eran Eldar</p>

To attain goals, people must proactively prevent interferences and react to interferences once they occur. Whereas most research focuses on how people deal with external interferences, here we investigate the use of proactive and reactive control in dealing with unwanted thoughts. To examine this question, we asked people to generate an association to each of several repeating cue words, while forbidding the repetition of associations. Reactively rejecting and replacing unwanted repeated associations after they occur entails slower response times. Conversely, proactive control entails constricting the search space and thus faster response times. To gain further insight into different potential proactive thought control mechanisms, we augmented the analysis of raw response times with a novel, hypothesis-based, tractable computational model describing how people serially sample associations. Our results indicate that people primarily react to unwanted thoughts after they occur. Yet, we found evidence for two latent proactive control mechanisms: one that allows people to mitigate the episodic strengthening of repeated thoughts, and another that helps avoid looping in a repetitive thought. Exploratory analysis showed a relationship between model parameters and self-reported individual differences in the control over unwanted thoughts in daily life. The findings indicate the novel task and model can advance our understanding of how people can and cannot control their thoughts and memories, and benefit future research on the mechanisms responsible for unwanted thought in different psychiatric conditions. Finally, we discuss implications concerning the involvement of associative thinking and various control processes in semantic fluency, decision-making and creativity.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">NucleoMap: A computational tool for identifying nucleosomes in ultra-high resolution contact maps</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Yuanhao Huang, Bingjiang Wang, Jie Liu</p>

Although poorly positioned nucleosomes are ubiquitous in the eukaryotic genome, they are difficult to identify with existing nucleosome identification methods. Recently available enhanced high-throughput chromatin conformation capture techniques such as Micro-C, DNase Hi-C, and Hi-CO characterize nucleosome-level chromatin proximity, probing the positions of mono-nucleosomes and the spacing between nucleosome pairs at the same time, enabling nucleosome profiling in poorly positioned regions. Here we develop a novel computational approach, NucleoMap, to identify nucleosome positioning from ultra-high resolution chromatin contact maps. By integrating nucleosome read density, contact distances, and binding preferences, NucleoMap precisely locates nucleosomes in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes and outperforms existing nucleosome identification methods in both precision and recall. We rigorously characterize genome-wide association in eukaryotes between the spatial organization of mono-nucleosomes and their corresponding histone modifications, protein binding activities, and higher-order chromatin functions. We also find evidence of two tetra-nucleosome folding structures in human embryonic stem cells and analyze their association with multiple structural and functional regions. Based on the identified nucleosomes, nucleosome contact maps are constructed, reflecting the inter-nucleosome distances and preserving the contact distance profiles in original contact maps.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Modelling livestock infectious disease control policy under differing social perspectives on vaccination behaviour</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Edward M. Hill, Naomi S. Prosser, Eamonn Ferguson, Jasmeet Kaler, Martin J. Green, Matt J. Keeling, Michael J. Tildesley</p>

The spread of infection amongst livestock depends not only on the traits of the pathogen and the livestock themselves, but also on the veterinary health behaviours of farmers and how this impacts their implementation of disease control measures. Controls that are costly may make it beneficial for individuals to rely on the protection offered by others, though that may be sub-optimal for the population. Failing to account for socio-behavioural properties may produce a substantial layer of bias in infectious disease models. We investigated the role of heterogeneity in vaccine response across a population of farmers on epidemic outbreaks amongst livestock, caused by pathogens with differential speed of spread over spatial landscapes of farms for two counties in England (Cumbria and Devon). Under different compositions of three vaccine behaviour groups (precautionary, reactionary, non-vaccination), we evaluated from population- and individual-level perspectives the optimum threshold distance to premises with notified infection that would trigger responsive vaccination by the reactionary vaccination group. We demonstrate a divergence between population and individual perspectives in the optimal scale of reactive voluntary vaccination response. In general, minimising the population-level perspective cost requires a broader reactive uptake of the intervention, whilst optimising the outcome for the average individual increased the likelihood of larger scale disease outbreaks. When the relative cost of vaccination was low and the majority of premises had undergone precautionary vaccination, then adopting a perspective that optimised the outcome for an individual gave a broader spatial extent of reactive response compared to a perspective wanting to optimise outcomes for everyone in the population. Under our assumed epidemiological context, the findings identify livestock disease intervention receptiveness and cost combinations where one would expect strong disagreement between the intervention stringency that is best from the perspective of a stakeholder responsible for supporting the livestock industry compared to a sole livestock owner. Were such discord anticipated and achieving a consensus view across perspectives desired, the findings may also inform those managing veterinary health policy the requisite reduction in intervention cost and/or the required extent of nurturing beneficial community attitudes towards interventions.

Science students increasingly need programming and data science skills to be competitive in the modern workforce. However, at our university (San Francisco State University), until recently, almost no biology, biochemistry, and chemistry students (from here bio/chem students) completed a minor in computer science. To change this, a new minor in computing applications, which is informally known as the Promoting Inclusivity in Computing (PINC) minor, was established in 2016. Here, we present the lessons we learned from our experience in a set of 10 rules. The first 3 rules focus on setting up the program so that it interests students in biology, chemistry, and biochemistry. Rules 4 through 8 focus on how the classes of the program are taught to make them interesting for our students and to provide the students with the support they need. The last 2 rules are about what happens “behind the scenes” of running a program with many people from several departments involved.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Neural dynamics differentially encode phrases and sentences during spoken language comprehension</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Fan Bai, Antje S. Meyer, Andrea E. Martin</p>

Human language stands out in the natural world as a biological signal that uses a structured system to combine the meanings of small linguistic units (e.g., words) into larger constituents (e.g., phrases and sentences). However, the physical dynamics of speech (or sign) do not stand in a one-to-one relationship with the meanings listeners perceive. Instead, listeners infer meaning based on their knowledge of the language. The neural readouts of the perceptual and cognitive processes underlying these inferences are still poorly understood. In the present study, we used scalp electroencephalography (EEG) to compare the neural response to phrases (e.g., the red vase) and sentences (e.g., the vase is red), which were close in semantic meaning and had been synthesized to be physically indistinguishable. Differences in structure were well captured in the reorganization of neural phase responses in delta (approximately <2 Hz) and theta bands (approximately 2 to 7 Hz),and in power and power connectivity changes in the alpha band (approximately 7.5 to 13.5 Hz). Consistent with predictions from a computational model, sentences showed more power, more power connectivity, and more phase synchronization than phrases did. Theta–gamma phase–amplitude coupling occurred, but did not differ between the syntactic structures. Spectral–temporal response function (STRF) modeling revealed different encoding states for phrases and sentences, over and above the acoustically driven neural response. Our findings provide a comprehensive description of how the brain encodes and separates linguistic structures in the dynamics of neural responses. They imply that phase synchronization and strength of connectivity are readouts for the constituent structure of language. The results provide a novel basis for future neurophysiological research on linguistic structure representation in the brain, and, together with our simulations, support time-based binding as a mechanism of structure encoding in neural dynamics.

<p>We examined the developing brain of the beetle <i>Tribolium castaneum</i>. We determined tracts, fascicles, and compartments (a) by combining tubulin and synapsin stainings (b) in three developing stages (b’). The result is a comprehensive anatomical atlas (c) that was compared with the fruitfly and is provided for user-friendly interaction (d).

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Insect brains are formed by conserved sets of neural lineages whose fibers form cohesive bundles with characteristic projection patterns. Within the brain neuropil, these bundles establish a system of fascicles constituting the macrocircuitry of the brain. The overall architecture of the neuropils and the macrocircuitry appear to be conserved. However, variation is observed, for example, in size, shape, and timing of development. Unfortunately, the developmental and genetic basis of this variation is poorly understood, although the rise of new genetically tractable model organisms such as the red flour beetle <i>Tribolium castaneum</i> allows the possibility to gain mechanistic insights. To facilitate such work, we present an atlas of the developing brain of <i>T. castaneum</i>, covering the first larval instar, the prepupal stage, and the adult, by combining wholemount immunohistochemical labeling of fiber bundles (acetylated tubulin) and neuropils (synapsin) with digital 3D reconstruction using the TrakEM2 software package. Upon comparing this anatomical dataset with the published work in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>, we confirm an overall high degree of conservation. Fiber tracts and neuropil fascicles, which can be visualized by global neuronal antibodies like antiacetylated tubulin in all invertebrate brains, create a rich anatomical framework to which individual neurons or other regions of interest can be referred to. The framework of a largely conserved pattern allowed us to describe differences between the two species with respect to parameters such as timing of neuron proliferation and maturation. These features likely reflect adaptive changes in developmental timing that govern the change from larval to adult brain.</p>

     alt="Neuronal density and expression of calcium-binding proteins across the layers of the superior colliculus in the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus)"/>
<p>Using stereological sampling, we demonstrate that neuronal density decreases across layers of the superior colliculus in marmoset monkeys. Neuronal density in this structure tends to be lower at rostral levels, compared to caudal levels. Neurons expressing different calcium-binding proteins (calbindin, calretinin, and parvalbumin) display variable gradients of density across layers in the superior colliculus. Calbindin- and calretinin-expressing neurons show markedly higher densities in the upper layers, while the distribution of parvalbumin-expressing neurons is more uniform.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The superior colliculus (SC) is a layered midbrain structure with functions that include polysensory and sensorimotor integration. Here, we describe the distribution of different immunohistochemically identified classes of neurons in the SC of adult marmoset monkeys (<i>Callithrix jacchus</i>). Neuronal nuclei (NeuN) staining was used to determine the overall neuronal density in the different SC layers. In addition, we studied the distribution of neurons expressing different calcium-binding proteins (calbindin [CB], parvalbumin [PV] and calretinin [CR]). Our results indicate that neuronal density in the SC decreases from superficial to deep layers. Although the neuronal density within the same layer varies little across the mediolateral axis, it tends to be lower at rostral levels, compared to caudal levels. Cells expressing different calcium-binding proteins display differential gradients of density according to depth. Both CB- and CR-expressing neurons show markedly higher densities in the stratum griseum superficiale (SGS), compared to the stratum opticum and intermediate and deep layers. However, CR-expressing neurons are twice as common as CB-expressing neurons outside the SGS. The distribution of PV-expressing cells follows a shallow density gradient from superficial to deep layers. When normalized relative to total neuronal density, the proportion of CR-expressing neurons increases between the superficial and intermediate layers, whereas that of CB-expressing neurons declines toward the deep layers. The proportion of PV-expressing neurons remains constant across layers. Our data provide layer-specific and accurate estimates of neuronal density, which may be important for the generation of biophysical models of how the primate SC transforms sensory inputs into motor signals.</p>
