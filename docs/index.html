In 2011, an intronic (G4C2)•(G2C4) expansion was shown to cause the most common forms of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). This discovery linked ALS with a clinically distinct form of dementia and a larger group of microsatellite repeat diseases, and catalyzed basic and translational research.

The parabrachial nucleus (PBN), which is located in the pons and is dissected by one of the major cerebellar output tracks, is known to relay sensory information (visceral malaise, taste, temperature, pain, itch) to forebrain structures including the thalamus, hypothalamus, and extended amygdala. The availability of mouse lines expressing Cre recombinase selectively in subsets of PBN neurons and viruses for Cre-dependent gene expression is beginning to reveal the connectivity and functions of PBN component neurons.

Efforts to parcellate the cortex into areas based on fine-scale anatomical signatures (e.g., cytoarchitectonics) date back to the early years of the last century. In the ensuing decades, rapidly growing knowledge of cortical connections encouraged neurobiologists to search for connectivity-based principles underlying the organization of the cerebral cortex. Using such an approach, Felleman and Van Essen presented, in their 1991 paper, a connectivity-based hierarchical principle dictating the relationship between cortical areas.

In 2001 Raichle and colleagues showed that, at rest, brain activity fluctuates near a metabolically active equilibrium: a ‘default mode’ of brain function. This finding broke ranks with the prevailing ‘task–rest’ dichotomy to position the brain as continuously active, balancing the deployment of resources according to current and anticipated needs.

Spinal cord repair research appeared to have run out of new ideas in the 1970s. In a 1981 paper, the Aguayo Laboratory revisited an experiment by Tello and Cajal that suggested that central nervous system (CNS) axons could regenerate into peripheral nerve grafts. Using modern axon tracing methods, David and Aguayo showed that axons from neurons in the spinal cord could regenerate for long distances within peripheral nervous system (PNS) grafts, but not back into the CNS. This proved that damaged CNS tissue is inhibitory to axon regeneration while PNS tissue is permissive.

Publication date: August 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 51<br />     Author(s): Ngang Heok   Tang, Yishi   Jin<br /> Development of a neuron critically depends on the organization of its cytoskeleton. Cytoskeletal components, such as tubulins and actins, have the remarkable ability to organize themselves into filaments and networks to support specialized and compartmentalized functions. Alterations in cytoskeletal proteins have long been associated with a variety of neurodevelopmental disorders. This review focuses on recent findings, primarily from forward genetic screens in Caenorhabditis elegans that illustrate how different tubulin protein isotypes can play distinct roles in neuronal development and function. Additionally, we discuss studies revealing new regulators of the actin cytoskeleton, and highlight recent technological advances in in vivo imaging and functional dissection of the neuronal cytoskeleton. <br /><br />

Publication date: October 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 52<br />     Author(s): Yutaka   Yoshida, Tadashi   Isa<br /> An ability to control dexterous hand movements is considered to parallel the evolutionary development of the corticospinal tract and the appearance of direct connections between corticospinal neurons and motoneurons (the corticomotoneuronal (CM) pathway), which developed uniquely in higher primates. However, recent studies have revealed that some non-primate animal species have higher levels of dexterity than previously supposed, and in higher primates, various indirect non-CM descending pathways have been shown to participate in the control of dexterous movements. More recently, the CM pathway was shown to exist in rodents during early development, suggesting that rodents and primates diverged in their reliance on the CM pathway at some point in evolution, thus challenging the traditional view of the sequential development of hand control from rodents to primates. <br /><br />

Publication date: June 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 50<br />     Author(s): Guosong   Hong, Xiao   Yang, Tao   Zhou, Charles M   Lieber<br /> Existing implantable neurotechnologies for understanding the brain and treating neurological diseases have intrinsic properties that have limited their capability to achieve chronically-stable brain interfaces with single-neuron spatiotemporal resolution. These limitations reflect what has been dichotomy between the structure and mechanical properties of living brain tissue and non-living neural probes. To bridge the gap between neural and electronic networks, we have introduced the new concept of mesh electronics probes designed with structural and mechanical properties such that the implant begins to ‘look and behave’ like neural tissue. Syringe-implanted mesh electronics have led to the realization of probes that are neuro-attractive and free of the chronic immune response, as well as capable of stable long-term mapping and modulation of brain activity at the single-neuron level. This review provides a historical overview of a 10-year development of mesh electronics by highlighting the tissue-like design, syringe-assisted delivery, seamless neural tissue integration, and single-neuron level chronic recording stability of mesh electronics. We also offer insights on unique near-term opportunities and future directions for neuroscience and neurology that now are available or expected for mesh electronics neurotechnologies. <br /><br />

Publication date: August 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 51<br />     Author(s): Anne   Bertolotti<br /> Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's, Huntington's, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and prion disorders are devastating neurodegenerative diseases of increasing prevalence in aging populations. Although clinically different, they share similar molecular features: the accumulation of one or two proteins in abnormal conformations inside or outside neurons. Enhancing protein quality control systems could be a useful strategy to neutralize the abnormal proteins causing neurodegenerative diseases. This review emphasizes the subcellular location of protein deposits in neurodegenerative diseases and the need to tailor strategies aimed at boosting protein quality control systems to the affected subcellular compartment. Inhibition of a protein phosphatase terminating the unfolded protein response will be discussed as a strategy to protect from diseases associated with misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum. <br /><br />

Publication date: December 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 53<br />     Author(s): Emilia   Favuzzi, Beatriz   Rico<br /> The complexity and precision of cortical circuitries is achieved during development due to the exquisite diversity of synapse types that is generated in a highly regulated manner. Here, we review the recent increase in our understanding of how synapse type-specific molecules differentially regulate the development of excitatory and inhibitory synapses. Moreover, several synapse subtype-specific molecules have been shown to control the targeting, formation or maturation of particular subtypes of excitatory synapses. Because inhibitory neurons are extremely diverse, a similar molecular diversity is likely to underlie the development of different inhibitory synapses making it a promising topic for future investigation in the field of the synapse development. <br /><br />

Since the earliest days of embryology, lineage questions have been addressed with methods of increasing specificity, capacity, and resolution. Yet, a full realization of individual cell lineages remains challenging for complex systems. A recent explosion of technical advances in genome-editing and single-cell sequencing has enabled lineage analysis in an unprecedented scale, speed, and depth across different species. In this review, we discuss the application of available as well as future genetic labeling techniques for tracking neural lineages in vivo in the mammalian nervous system. <br /><br />

Publication date: December 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 53<br />     Author(s): Clinton   Cave, Shanthini   Sockanathan<br /> The embryonic generation of motor neurons is a complex process involving progenitor patterning, fate specification, differentiation, and maturation. Throughout this progression, the differential expression of transcription factors has served as our road map for the eventual cell fate of nascent motor neurons. Recent findings from in vivo and in vitro models of motor neuron development have expanded our understanding of how transcription factors govern motor neuron identity and their individual regulatory mechanisms. With the advent of next generation sequencing approaches, researchers now have unprecedented access to the gene regulatory dynamics involved in motor neuron development and are uncovering new connections linking neurodevelopment and neurodegenerative disease. <br /><br />

Publication date: August 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 51<br />     Author(s): Sylvain   Rama, Mickaël   Zbili, Dominique   Debanne<br /> Axons link distant brain regions and are usually considered as simple transmission cables in which reliable propagation occurs once an action potential has been generated. Safe propagation of action potentials relies on specific ion channel expression at strategic points of the axon such as nodes of Ranvier or axonal branch points. However, while action potentials are generally considered as the quantum of neuronal information, their signaling is not entirely digital. In fact, both their shape and their conduction speed have been shown to be modulated by activity, leading to regulations of synaptic latency and synaptic strength. We report here newly identified mechanisms of (1) safe spike propagation along the axon, (2) compartmentalization of action potential shape in the axon, (3) analog modulation of spike-evoked synaptic transmission and (4) alteration in conduction time after persistent regulation of axon morphology in central neurons. We discuss the contribution of these regulations in information processing. <br /><br />

Publication date: October 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 52<br />     Author(s): Kanika   Bansal, Johan   Nakuci, Sarah Feldt   Muldoon<br /> Many recent efforts in computational modeling of macro-scale brain dynamics have begun to take a data-driven approach by incorporating structural and/or functional information derived from subject data. Here, we discuss recent work using personalized brain network models to study structure–function relationships in human brains. We describe the steps necessary to build such models and show how this computational approach can provide previously unobtainable information through the ability to perform virtual experiments. Finally, we present examples of how personalized brain network models can be used to gain insight into the effects of local stimulation and improve surgical outcomes in epilepsy. <br /> <h3 class="h3">Graphical abstract</h3> <img alt="image" height="93" src="http://origin-ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0959438818300059-fx1.jpg" width="301" /><br />

Publication date: June 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 50<br />     Author(s): Andy   Zhou, Benjamin C   Johnson, Rikky   Muller<br /> Closed-loop and responsive neuromodulation systems improve open-loop neurostimulation by responding directly to measured neural activity and providing adaptive, on-demand therapy. To be effective, these systems must be able to simultaneously record and stimulate neural activity, a task made difficult by persistent stimulation artifacts that distort and obscure underlying biomarkers. To enable simultaneous stimulation and recording, several techniques have been proposed. These techniques involve artifact-preventing system configurations, resilient recording front-ends, and back-end signal processing for removing recorded artifacts. Co-designing and integrating these artifact cancellation techniques will be key to enabling neuromodulation systems to stimulate and record at the same time. Here, we review the state-of-the-art for these techniques and their role in achieving artifact-free neuromodulation. <br /><br />

Publication date: June 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 50<br />     Author(s): Gilles C   .Vanwalleghem, Misha B   Ahrens, Ethan K   Scott<br /> Due to their small size and transparency, zebrafish larvae are amenable to a range of fluorescence microscopy techniques. With the development of sensitive genetically encoded calcium indicators, this has extended to the whole-brain imaging of neural activity with cellular resolution. This technique has been used to study brain-wide population dynamics accompanying sensory processing and sensorimotor transformations, and has spurred the development of innovative closed-loop behavioral paradigms in which stimulus–response relationships can be studied. More recently, microscopes have been developed that allow whole-brain calcium imaging in freely swimming and behaving larvae. In this review, we highlight the technologies underlying whole-brain functional imaging in zebrafish, provide examples of the sensory and motor processes that have been studied with this technique, and discuss the need to merge data from whole-brain functional imaging studies with neurochemical and anatomical information to develop holistic models of functional neural circuits. <br /><br />

However, bulk of evidence demonstrates the requirement of the reciprocal interactions between cortical and thalamic neurons as key for the correct development of functional thalamocortical circuits. This reciprocal loop of connections is essential for sensory processing as well as for the execution of complex sensory-motor tasks. Here, we review recent advances in our understanding of how mutual collaborations between both brain regions define area patterning and cell differentiation in the thalamus and cortex. <br /><br />

Publication date: June 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 50<br />     Author(s): Huan   Wang, Miao   Jing, Yulong   Li<br /> Measuring the precise dynamics of specific neurotransmitters and neuromodulators in the brain is essential for understanding how information is transmitted and processed. Thanks to the development and optimization of various genetically encoded sensors, we are approaching the stage in which a few key neurotransmitters/neuromodulators can be imaged with high cell specificity and good signal-to-noise ratio. Here, we summarize recent progress regarding these sensors, focusing on their design principles, properties, potential applications, and current limitations. We also highlight the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) scaffold as a promising platform that may enable the scalable development of the next generation of sensors, enabling the rapid, sensitive, and specific detection of a large repertoire of neurotransmitters/neuromodulators in vivo at cellular or even subcellular resolution. <br /> <h3 class="h3">Graphical abstract</h3> <img alt="image" height="165" src="http://origin-ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0959438817301915-fx1.jpg" width="301" /><br />

Microelectrode arrays based on complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology, such as Neuropixels probes, look set to transform these methods. Neuropixels probes provide ∼1000 recording sites on an extremely narrow shank, with on-board amplification, digitization, and multiplexing. They deliver low-noise recordings from hundreds of neurons, providing a step change in the type of data available to neuroscientists. Here we discuss the opportunities afforded by these probes for large-scale electrophysiology, the challenges associated with data processing and anatomical localization, and avenues for further improvements of the technology. <br /><br />

Publication date: June 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 50<br />     Author(s): Miao   He, Z Josh   Huang<br /> Understanding brain circuit organization and function requires systematic dissection of its cellular components. With vast cell number and diversity, mammalian nervous systems present a daunting challenge for achieving specific and comprehensive cell type access—prerequisite to circuit analysis. Genetic approaches in the mouse have relied on germline engineering to access marker-defined cell populations. Combinatorial strategies that engage marker intersection, anatomy and projection pattern (e.g. antero-grade and retro-grade viral vectors), and developmental lineage substantially increase the specificity of cell type targeting. While increasing number of mouse cell types are becoming experimentally accessible, comprehensive coverage requires larger coordinated efforts with strategic infrastructural and fiscal planning. CRISPR-based genome editing may enable cell type access in other species, but issues of time, cost and ethics remain, especially for primates. Novel approaches that bypass the germline, such as somatic cell engineering and cell surface-based gene delivery, may reduce the barrier of genetic access to mammalian cell types. <br /><br />

Publication date: June 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 50<br />     Author(s): I-Wen   Chen, Eirini   Papagiakoumou, Valentina   Emiliani<br /> Optogenetics neuronal targeting combined with single-photon wide-field illumination has already proved its enormous potential in neuroscience, enabling the optical control of entire neuronal networks and disentangling their role in the control of specific behaviors. However, establishing how a single or a sub-set of neurons controls a specific behavior, or how functionally identical neurons are connected in a particular task, or yet how behaviors can be modified in real-time by the complex wiring diagram of neuronal connections requires more sophisticated approaches enabling to drive neuronal circuits activity with single-cell precision and millisecond temporal resolution. This has motivated on one side the development of flexible optical methods for two-photon (2P) optogenetic activation using either, or a hybrid of two approaches: scanning and parallel illumination. On the other side, it has stimulated the engineering of new opsins with modified spectral characteristics, channel kinetics and spatial distribution of expression, offering the necessary flexibility of choosing the appropriate opsin for each application. The need for optical manipulation of multiple targets with millisecond temporal resolution has imposed three-dimension (3D) parallel holographic illumination as the technique of choice for optical control of neuronal circuits organized in 3D. Today 3D parallel illumination exists in several complementary variants, each with a different degree of simplicity, light uniformity, temporal precision and axial resolution. In parallel, the possibility to reach hundreds of targets in 3D volumes has prompted the development of low-repetition rate amplified laser sources enabling high peak power, while keeping low average power for stimulating each cell. All together those progresses open the way for a precise optical manipulation of neuronal circuits with unprecedented precision and flexibility. <br /> <h3 class="h3">Graphical abstract</h3> <img alt="image" height="245" src="http://origin-ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0959438817302477-fx1.jpg" width="249" /><br />

Publication date: August 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 51<br />     Author(s): Kelsey A   Herrmann, Heather T   Broihier<br /> Although retrograde neurotrophin signaling has provided an immensely influential paradigm for understanding growth factor signaling in the nervous system, recent studies indicate that growth factors also signal via cell-autonomous, or autocrine, mechanisms. Autocrine signals have been discovered in many neuronal contexts, providing insights into their regulation and function. The growing realization of the importance of cell-autonomous signaling stems from advances in both conditional genetic approaches and in sophisticated analyses of growth factor dynamics, which combine to enable rigorous in vivo dissection of signaling pathways. Here we review recent studies defining autocrine roles for growth factors such as BDNF, and classical morphogens, including Wnts and BMPs, in regulating neuronal development and plasticity. Collectively, these studies highlight an intimate relationship between activity-dependent autocrine signaling and synaptic plasticity, and further suggest a common principle for coordinating paracrine and autocrine signaling in the nervous system. <br /><br />

Publication date: June 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 50<br />     Author(s): Philipp   Gutruf, John A   Rogers<br /> Recently developed classes of ultraminiaturized wireless devices provide powerful capabilities in neuroscience research, as implantable light sources for simulation/inhibition via optogenetics, as integrated microfluidic systems for programmed pharmacological delivery and as multimodal sensors for physiological measurements. These platforms leverage basic advances in biocompatible materials, semiconductor device designs and systems engineering concepts to afford modes of operation that are qualitatively distinct from those of conventional approaches that tether animals to external hardware by means of optical fibers, electrical cables and/or fluidic tubing. Neuroscience studies that exploit the unique features of these technologies enable insights into neural function through targeted stimulation, inhibition and recording, with spatially and genetically precise manipulation of neural circuit activity. Experimental possibilities include studies in naturalistic, three dimensional environments, investigations of pair-wise or group related social interactions and many other scenarios of interest that cannot be addressed using traditional hardware. <br /><br />

Publication date: August 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 51<br />     Author(s): Patrick   Lüningschrör, Michael   Sendtner<br /> Regulated release of neurotransmitter depends on the orchestrated function of a large number of proteins in the presynaptic compartment. When synaptic vesicles fuse with the plasma membrane, these membranes and the attached proteins are endocytosed and either recycled or degraded. This turnover needs to be tightly regulated in a timely and spatially confined manner. Increasing evidence suggests that these mechanisms do not only serve for the removal of defective synaptic vesicles or structural proteins of the active zone but also contribute to pathways regulating synaptic strength. The corresponding presynaptic autophagy system thus appears also important for synaptic maintenance and plasticity. Exciting new studies provide evidence how the autophagy machinery recognizes and degrades synaptic components and lay the ground to understand how autophagy in the presynaptic compartment contributes to modulation and maintenance of synaptic function. <br /><br />

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/310334v1?rss=1">Exploring sex differences in the prevention of ethanol drinking by naltrexone in dependent rats during abstinence</a></h4>

Background: Despite considerable efforts, few drugs are available for the treatment of alcohol (ethanol [EtOH]) use disorders (AUDs). Ethanol directly or indirectly modulates several aspects of the central nervous system, including neurotransmitter/neuromodulator systems. Relapse vulnerability is a challenge for the treatment of EtOH addiction. Ethanol withdrawal symptoms create motivational states that lead to compulsive EtOH drinking and relapse even after long periods of abstinence. Among the therapeutics to treat AUDs, naltrexone (NTX) is a pharmacological treatment for relapse. The goal of the present study was to evaluate the effect of NTX on EtOH drinking in EtOH-dependent male and female rats during abstinence. Methods: Wistar rats (males and females) were first trained to orally self-administer 10% EtOH. Half of them were then made dependent by chronic intermittent EtOH (CIE) vapor exposure, and the other half were exposed to air. Using this model, rats exhibit somatic and motivational signs of withdrawal. At the end of EtOH vapor (or air) exposure, the rats were tested for the effects of NTX (10 mg/kg, p.o.) on EtOH self-administration at three abstinence time points: acute abstinence (8 h, A-Abst), late abstinence (2 weeks, L-Abst), and protracted abstinence (6 weeks, P-Abst). Results: NTX decreased EtOH intake in nondependent rats, regardless of sex and abstinence time point. In post-dependent rats, the effects of NTX improved with a longer abstinence time (i.e., L-Abst and P-Abst) in males, whereas it similarly reduced EtOH drinking in females at all abstinence points. Conclusions: The data suggest that the therapeutic efficacy of NTX depends on the time of intervention during abstinence and sex. The data further suggest that EtOH dependence induces different neuroadaptations in male and female rats, reflected by differential effects of NTX. The results underscore the significance of considering the duration of EtOH abstinence and sex for the development of pharmacotherapeutic treatments for AUD.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/310250v1?rss=1">Identification of midbrain neurons essential for vocal communication</a></h4>

Vocalizations are an essential medium for communication and courtship in numerous mammalian species ranging from mice to humans. In mammals, the midbrain PAG serves as an obligatory node in a vocalization-related network that spans the forebrain and brainstem, as bilateral lesions of the PAG result in mutism. Despite the importance of the PAG for vocal production, the identity, function, and connectivity of PAG neurons involved in vocalization has remained elusive, in part because the PAG is a functionally and anatomically heterogeneous structure that serves myriad roles including nociception, defensive behaviors, and autonomic regulation. Here we used a viral genetic tagging method to identify a distinct subset of PAG neurons in the male mouse that are selectively activated during the production of ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) elicited by female cues. Silencing these PAG-USV neurons rendered males mute without affecting their other courtship behaviors and also impaired their ability to attract female mice in a social choice assay. Activating these neurons using chemogenetic or optogenetic methods strongly elevated USV production, even in the absence of female cues. Notably, the timing of individual USVs was entrained to the expiratory phase of breathing but not to the pattern of optogenetic stimulation, suggesting that PAG-USV neural activity initiates and sets the duration of vocal bouts and recruits downstream premotor circuits that precisely pattern vocal output. Consistent with this idea, we found that PAG-USV neurons extend axons into pontine and medullary regions that are speculated to contain premotor central pattern generators important for vocalization. These experiments establish the identity of the PAG neurons selectively required for USV production in mice, map their efferent connections, and demonstrate the communicative salience of male USVs in promoting female social affiliation.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/310193v1?rss=1">A CRISPR/Cas9 based strategy to manipulate the Alzheimer\'s amyloid pathway</a></h4>

The gradual accumulation of amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}) is a neuropathologic hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD); playing a key role in disease progression. A{beta} is generated by the sequential cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by {beta}- and {gamma}-secretases, with BACE-1 ({beta}-site APP cleaving enzyme-1) cleavage as the rate limiting step. CRISPR/Cas9 guided gene-editing is emerging as a promising tool to edit pathogenic mutations and hinder disease progression. However, few studies have applied this technology to neurologic diseases. Besides technical caveats such as low editing efficiency in brains and limited in vivo validation, the canonical approach of 'mutation-correction' would only be applicable to the small fraction of neurodegenerative cases that are inherited (i.e. &lt; 10% of AD, Parkinson's, ALS); with a new strategy needed for every gene. Moreover, feasibility of CRISPR/Cas9 as a therapeutic possibility in sporadic AD has not been explored. Here we introduce a strategy to edit endogenous APP at the extreme C-terminus and reciprocally manipulate the amyloid pathway -- attenuating {beta}-cleavage and A{beta}, while up-regulating neuroprotective -cleavage. APP N-terminus, as well as compensatory APP homologues remain intact, and key physiologic parameters remain unaffected. Robust APP-editing is seen in cell lines, cultured neurons, human embryonic stem cells/iPSC-neurons, and mouse brains. Our strategy works by limiting the physical association of APP and BACE-1, and we also delineate the mechanism that abrogates APP/BACE-1 interaction in this setting. Our work offers an innovative 'cut and silence' gene-editing strategy that could be a new therapeutic paradigm for AD.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/309526v1?rss=1">Regulation of evidence accumulation by pupil-linked arousal processes</a></h4>

Integrating evidence over time is crucial for effective decision making. For simple perceptual decisions, a large body of work suggests that humans and animals are capable of integrating evidence over time fairly well, but that their performance is far from optimal. This suboptimality is thought to arise from a number of different sources including (1) noise in sensory and motor systems, (2) unequal weighting of evidence over time, (3) order effects from previous trials and (4) irrational side biases for one choice over another. In this work we investigated whether and how these different sources of suboptimality are related to pupil dilation, a putative correlate of norepinephrine tone. In particular, we measured pupil response in humans making a series of decisions based on rapidly-presented auditory information in an evidence accumulation task. We found that people exhibited all four types of suboptimality, but that only noise and the uneven weighting of evidence over time, the 'integration kernel', were related to the change in pupil response during the stimulus. Moreover, these two different suboptimalities were related to different aspects of the pupil signal, with the individual differences in pupil response associated with individual differences in integration kernel, while trial-by-trial fluctuations in pupil response were associated with trial-by-trial fluctuations in noise. These results suggest that different sources of suboptimality in human perceptual decision making are related to distinct pupil-linked processes possibly related to tonic and phasic norepinephrine activity.

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a markedly heterogeneous condition with a varied phenotypic presentation. Its high concordance among siblings, as well as its clear association with specific genetic disorders, both point to a strong genetic etiology. However, the molecular basis of ASD is still poorly understood, although recent studies point to the existence of sex-specific ASD pathophysiologies and biomarkers. Despite this, little is known about how exactly sex influences the gene expression signatures of ASD probands. In an effort to identify sex-dependent biomarkers (and characterise their function), we present an analysis of a single paired-end post-mortem brain RNA-Seq data set and a meta-analysis of six blood-based microarray data sets. Here, we identify several genes with sex-dependent dysregulation, and many more with sex-independent dysregulation. Moreover, through pathway analysis, we find that these sex-independent biomarkers have substantially different biological roles than the sex-dependent biomarkers, and that some of these pathways are ubiquitously dysregulated in both post-mortem brain and blood. We conclude by synthesizing the discovered biomarker profiles with the extant literature, by highlighting the advantage of studying sex-specific dysregulation directly, and by making a call for new transcriptomic data that comprise large female cohorts.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/308643v1?rss=1">FMRI processing with AFNI: Some comments and corrections on \"Exploring the Impact of Analysis Software on Task fMRI Results\"</a></h4>

A recent study posted on bioRxiv by Bowring, Maumet and Nichols aimed to compare results of FMRI data that had been processed with three commonly used software packages (AFNI, FSL and SPM). Their stated purpose was to use "default" settings of each software's pipeline for task based FMRI, and then to quantify overlaps in final clustering results and to measure similarity/dissimilarity in the final outcomes of packages. While in theory the setup sounds simple (implement each package's defaults and compare results), practical realities make this difficult. For example, different softwares would recommend different spatial resolutions of the final data, but for the sake of comparisons, the same value must be used across all. Moreover, we would say that AFNI does not have an explicit default pipeline available: a wide diversity of datasets and study designs are acquired across the neuroimaging community, often requiring bespoke tailoring of basic processing rather than a "one-size-fits-all" pipeline. However, we do have strong recommendations for certain steps, and we are also aware that the choice of a given step might place requirements on other processing steps. Given the very clear reporting of the AFNI pipeline used in Bowring et al. paper, we take this opportunity to comment on some of these aspects of processing with AFNI here, clarifying a few mistakes therein and also offering recommendations. We provide point-by-point considerations of using AFNI's processing pipeline design tool at the individual level, afni_proc.py, along with supplementary programs; while specifically discussed in the context of the present usage, many of these choices may serve as useful starting points for broader processing. It is our intention/hope that the user should examine data quality at every step, and we demonstrate how this is facilitated in AFNI, as well.

This article, which includes novel unpublished data along with commentary and analysis, focuses on approaches to link transcriptomic, proteomic, and peptidomic datasets mined from brain tissue to the original locations within the brain that they are derived from using digital atlas mapping techniques. We use, as an example, the transcriptomic, proteomic and peptidomic analyses conducted in the mammalian hypothalamus. Following a brief historical overview, we highlight studies that have mined biochemical and molecular information from the hypothalamus and then lay out a strategy for how these data can be linked spatially to the mapped locations in a canonical brain atlas where the data come from, thereby allowing researchers to integrate these data with other datasets across multiple scales. A key methodology that enables atlas-based mapping of extracted datasets, laser capture microdissection, is discussed in detail; with a view of how this technology is a bridge between systems biology and systems neuroscience.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/306514v1?rss=1">Not so proportional after all?</a></h4>

Background: The proportional recovery rule asserts that most stroke survivors recover a fixed proportion of lost function. Reports claiming that the rule can be used to predict recovery, extraordinarily accurately, are rapidly accumulating. Here, we show that the proportional recovery rule may not be as powerful as it seems. Methods: We provide a formal analysis of the relationship between baseline scores and subsequent change, to highlight the shortcomings of the proportional recovery rule. These problems are illustrated using simulations in which outcomes are generated by different types of recovery processes. Findings: The correlation between baseline scores and subsequent change is a function of: (a) the correlation between baseline scores and outcomes; and (b) the ratio of the standard deviations of outcomes to baseline scores. In this sense, the two correlations are always coupled. When outcomes are less variable than baselines, the correlation between baselines and change can be extreme regardless of the correlation between baselines and outcomes. This creates a misleadingly optimistic impression of how predictable outcomes really are. This scenario appears to be common in empirical studies of the proportional recovery rule, so we argue that future studies should at least report both correlations. Yet even when both are reported, our simulations suggest that they cannot distinguish proportional recovery from recovery which is not proportional at all. Interpretation: Analyses relating baselines to change are a minefield: our formal analysis, which identifies when these relationships may be spurious, applies just as consistently outside the area of stroke as it does within it. As applied to recovery from stroke, these analyses do not reliably distinguish proportional recovery from other types of recovery, and will often yield inflated effect sizes even if recovery really is proportional. The implication is that proportional recovery rule is not as predictive, of real recovery, as recent empirical studies suggest.

<p>by Kevin J. Flynn, David O. F. Skibinski, Christian Lindemann</p>

Nutrient acquisition is a critical determinant for the competitive advantage for auto- and osmohetero- trophs alike. Nutrient limited growth is commonly described on a whole cell basis through reference to a maximum growth rate (<i>G</i><sub>max</sub>) and a half-saturation constant (<i>K</i><sub>G</sub>). This empirical application of a Michaelis-Menten like description ignores the multiple underlying feedbacks between physiology contributing to growth, cell size, elemental stoichiometry and cell motion. Here we explore these relationships with reference to the kinetics of the nutrient transporter protein, the transporter rate density at the cell surface (<i>TRD</i>; potential transport rate per unit plasma-membrane area), and diffusion gradients. While the half saturation value for the limiting nutrient increases rapidly with cell size, significant mitigation is afforded by cell motion (swimming or sedimentation), and by decreasing the cellular carbon density. There is thus potential for high vacuolation and high sedimentation rates in diatoms to significantly decrease <i>K</i><sub>G</sub> and increase species competitive advantage. Our results also suggest that <i>G</i><sub>max</sub> for larger non-diatom protists may be constrained by rates of nutrient transport. For a given carbon density, cell size and <i>TRD</i>, the value of <i>G</i><sub>max</sub><i>/K</i><sub>G</sub> remains constant. This implies that species or strains with a lower <i>G</i><sub>max</sub> might coincidentally have a competitive advantage under nutrient limited conditions as they also express lower values of <i>K</i><sub>G</sub>. The ability of cells to modulate the <i>TRD</i> according to their nutritional status, and hence change the instantaneous maximum transport rate, has a very marked effect upon transport and growth kinetics. Analyses and dynamic models that do not consider such modulation will inevitably fail to properly reflect competitive advantage in nutrient acquisition. This has important implications for the accurate representation and predictive capabilities of model applications, in particular in a changing environment.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/CoNucHdd8IM" width="1" />

A structural-bioinformatics-based computational methodology and framework have been developed for the design of antibodies to targets of interest. RosettaAntibodyDesign (RAbD) samples the diverse sequence, structure, and binding space of an antibody to an antigen in highly customizable protocols for the design of antibodies in a broad range of applications. The program samples antibody sequences and structures by grafting structures from a widely accepted set of the canonical clusters of CDRs (North et al., <i>J</i>. <i>Mol</i>. <i>Biol</i>., 406:228–256, 2011). It then performs sequence design according to amino acid sequence profiles of each cluster, and samples CDR backbones using a flexible-backbone design protocol incorporating cluster-based CDR constraints. Starting from an existing experimental or computationally modeled antigen-antibody structure, RAbD can be used to redesign a single CDR or multiple CDRs with loops of different length, conformation, and sequence. We rigorously benchmarked RAbD on a set of 60 diverse antibody–antigen complexes, using two design strategies—optimizing total Rosetta energy and optimizing interface energy alone. We utilized two novel metrics for measuring success in computational protein design. The design risk ratio (DRR) is equal to the frequency of recovery of native CDR lengths and clusters divided by the frequency of sampling of those features during the Monte Carlo design procedure. Ratios greater than 1.0 indicate that the design process is picking out the native more frequently than expected from their sampled rate. We achieved DRRs for the non-H3 CDRs of between 2.4 and 4.0. The antigen risk ratio (ARR) is the ratio of frequencies of the native amino acid types, CDR lengths, and clusters in the output decoys for simulations performed in the presence and absence of the antigen. For CDRs, we achieved cluster ARRs as high as 2.5 for L1 and 1.5 for H2. For sequence design simulations without CDR grafting, the overall recovery for the native amino acid types for residues that contact the antigen in the native structures was 72% in simulations performed in the presence of the antigen and 48% in simulations performed without the antigen, for an ARR of 1.5. For the non-contacting residues, the ARR was 1.08. This shows that the sequence profiles are able to maintain the amino acid types of these conserved, buried sites, while recovery of the exposed, contacting residues requires the presence of the antigen-antibody interface. We tested RAbD experimentally on both a lambda and kappa antibody–antigen complex, successfully improving their affinities 10 to 50 fold by replacing individual CDRs of the native antibody with new CDR lengths and clusters.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/PVAny09_uEE" width="1" />

<p>by Masataka Sawayama, Shin'ya Nishida</p>

Visual estimation of the material and shape of an object from a single image includes a hard ill-posed computational problem. However, in our daily life we feel we can estimate both reasonably well. The neural computation underlying this ability remains poorly understood. Here we propose that the human visual system uses different aspects of object images to separately estimate the contributions of the material and shape. Specifically, material perception relies mainly on the intensity gradient magnitude information, while shape perception relies mainly on the intensity gradient order information. A clue to this hypothesis was provided by the observation that luminance-histogram manipulation, which changes luminance gradient magnitudes but not the luminance-order map, effectively alters the material appearance but not the shape of an object. In agreement with this observation, we found that the simulated physical material changes do not significantly affect the intensity order information. A series of psychophysical experiments further indicate that human surface shape perception is robust against intensity manipulations provided they do not disturb the intensity order information. In addition, we show that the two types of gradient information can be utilized for the discrimination of albedo changes from highlights. These findings suggest that the visual system relies on these diagnostic image features to estimate physical properties in a distal world.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/hiqJxpkZuOw" width="1" />

Abstract<p>Network hyperexcitability is a feature of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) as well as numerous transgenic mouse models of AD. While hyperexcitability in AD patients and AD animal models share certain features, the mechanistic overlap remains to be established. We aimed to identify features of network hyperexcitability in AD models that can be related to epileptiform activity signatures in AD patients. We studied network hyperexcitability in mice expressing amyloid precursor protein (APP) with mutations that cause familial AD, and compared a transgenic model that overexpresses human APP (J20), to a knock-in model expressing APP at physiological levels (APP<sup>NL/F</sup>). We recorded continuous long-term electrocorticogram activity from mice, and studied modulation by circadian cycle, behavioural, and brain state. We report that while J20s exhibit frequent inter-ictal spikes (IIS), APP<sup>NL/F</sup> mice do not. In J20 mice, IIS were most prevalent during daylight hours and the circadian modulation was associated with sleep. Further analysis of brain state revealed that IIS in J20s are associated with features of rapid-eye movement (REM) sleep. We found no evidence of cholinergic changes that may contribute to IIS-circadian coupling in J20s. In contrast to J20s, intracranial recordings capturing IIS in AD patients demonstrated frequent IIS in non-REM sleep. The salient differences in sleep-stage coupling of IIS in APP overexpressing mice and AD patients suggests that different mechanisms may underlie network hyperexcitability in mice and humans. We posit that sleep-stage coupling of IIS should be an important consideration in identifying mouse AD models that most closely recapitulate network hyperexcitability in human AD.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> It is increasingly recognized that Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is associated with hyperexcitability in brain networks. Brain network hyperexcitability is also reported in several rodent models of AD. We studied the signatures of this hyperexcitability in two rodent models of AD as well as AD patients. Network hyperexcitability was prevalent in a transgenic model of AD, but was absent in a rodent model that is considered to be more physiologic. Moreover, while network hyperexcitability was coupled to rapid-eye movement (REM) sleep in transgenic mice, hyperexcitability occurred in non-REM sleep in AD patients. We suggest that brain state coupling of hyperexcitability can be used as a method for screening animal models of AD.</p>

Abstract
<p>The cerebral cortex is subdivided into distinct areas that have particular functions. The rostrocaudal (R-C) gradient of fibroblast growth factor 8 (FGF8) signaling defines this areal identity during neural development. In this study, we recapitulated cortical R-C patterning in human pluripotent stem cell (PSC) cultures. Modulation of FGF8 signaling appropriately regulated the R-C markers, and the patterns of global gene expression resembled those of the corresponding areas of human fetal brains. Furthermore, we demonstrated the utility of this culture system in modeling the area-specific forebrain phenotypes [presumptive upper motor neuron (UMN) phenotypes] of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We anticipate that our culture system will contribute to studies of human neurodevelopment and neurological disease modeling.</p>

<p>Synaptic connections between neurons in the brain are dynamic because of continuously ongoing spine dynamics, axonal sprouting, and other processes. In fact, it was recently shown that the spontaneous synapse-autonomous component of spine dynamics is at least as large as the component that depends on the history of pre- and postsynaptic neural activity. These data are inconsistent with common models for network plasticity and raise the following questions: how can neural circuits maintain a stable computational function in spite of these continuously ongoing processes, and what could be functional uses of these ongoing processes? Here, we present a rigorous theoretical framework for these seemingly stochastic spine dynamics and rewiring processes in the context of reward-based learning tasks. We show that spontaneous synapse-autonomous processes, in combination with reward signals such as dopamine, can explain the capability of networks of neurons in the brain to configure themselves for specific computational tasks, and to compensate automatically for later changes in the network or task. Furthermore, we show theoretically and through computer simulations that stable computational performance is compatible with continuously ongoing synapse-autonomous changes. After reaching good computational performance it causes primarily a slow drift of network architecture and dynamics in task-irrelevant dimensions, as observed for neural activity in motor cortex and other areas. On the more abstract level of reinforcement learning the resulting model gives rise to an understanding of reward-driven network plasticity as continuous sampling of network configurations.</p>

Abstract
<p>Retinal degenerations are a major cause of vision impairment and blindness. Neuroprotective therapy is a promising therapeutic strategy for retinal degenerative diseases. We investigated a novel neurotrophic factor mesencephalic astrocyte-derived neurotrophic factor (MANF) in the retina. MANF is expressed at a high level during postnatal development and the expression declines to a lower level as the retina matures. Müller cells are the major cells expressing MANF. It is also found in the retinal ganglion cells, in the inner nuclear layer (INL) neurons, and in retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells. Intravitreal injection of recombinant human (rh)MANF significantly protected rod and cone photoreceptors in rats carrying the rhodopsin S334ter mutation, and preserved electroretinograms (ERGs) in the <i>rd10</i> (<i>Pde6b<sup>rd10/rd10</sup></i>) mice. These results indicate that MANF is a native protein in the retina and is a potent neurotrophic factor for photoreceptor protection.</p>

Abstract
<p>Specialized brain structures encode spatial locations and movements, yet there is growing evidence that this information is also represented in the rodent medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Disambiguating such information from the encoding of other types of task-relevant information has proven challenging. To determine the extent to which movement and location information is relevant to mPFC neurons, tetrodes were used to record neuronal activity while limb positions, poses (i.e., recurring constellations of limb positions), velocity, and spatial locations were simultaneously recorded with two cameras every 200 ms as rats freely roamed in an experimental enclosure. Regression analyses using generalized linear models revealed that more than half of the individual mPFC neurons were significantly responsive to at least one of the factors, and many were responsive to more than one. On the other hand, each factor accounted for only a very small portion of the total spike count variance of any given neuron (&lt;20% and typically &lt;1%). Machine learning methods were used to analyze ensemble activity and revealed that ensembles were usually superior to the sum of the best neurons in encoding movements and spatial locations. Because movement and location encoding by individual neurons was so weak, it may not be such a concern for single-neuron analyses. Yet because these weak signals were so widely distributed across the population, this information was strongly represented at the ensemble level and should be considered in population analyses.</p>

Abstract
<p>Response inhibition, the ability to refrain from unwanted actions, is an essential component of complex behavior and is often impaired across numerous neuropsychiatric disorders such as addiction, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), schizophrenia, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Accordingly, much research has been devoted to characterizing brain regions responsible for the regulation of response inhibition. The stop-signal task, a task in which animals are required to inhibit a prepotent response in the presence of a STOP cue, is one of the most well-studied tasks of response inhibition. While pharmacological evidence suggests that dopamine (DA) contributes to the regulation of response inhibition, what is exactly encoded by DA neurons during performance of response inhibition tasks is unknown. To address this issue, we recorded from single units in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), while rats performed a stop-change task. We found that putative DA neurons fired less and higher to cues and reward on STOP trials relative to GO trials, respectively, and that firing was reduced during errors. These results suggest that DA neurons in VTA encode the uncertainty associated with the probability of obtaining reward on difficult trials instead of the saliency associated with STOP cues or the need to resolve conflict between competing responses during response inhibition.</p>

<p>Correctly identifying neuronal subsets is critical to multiple downstream
methods in several areas of neuroscience research. The hippocampal interneuron
characterization technology has achieved rapid development in recent years.
However, capturing true neuronal features for accurate interneuron
characterization and segmentation has remained elusive. In the current study, a
novel global preserving estimate algorithm is used to capture the non-linearity
in the features of hippocampal interneurons after factor Algorithm. Our results
provide evidence for the effective integration of the original linear and
nonlinear neuronal features and achieves better characterization performance on
multiple hippocampal interneuron databases through array matching.

<p>The role of synchronous firing in sensory coding and cognition remains
controversial. While studies, focusing on its mechanistic consequences in
attentional tasks, suggest that synchronization dynamically boosts sensory
processing, others failed to find significant synchronization in such tasks. We
attempt to understand both lines of evidence within a coherent theoretical
framework. We conceptualize synchronization as an independent control parameter
to study how the postsynaptic neuron transmits the average firing activity of a
presynaptic population, in the presence of synchronization. We apply the
Berger-Levy theory of energy efficient information transmission to interpret
simulations of a Hodgkin-Huxley-type postsynaptic neuron model, where we varied
independently the firing rate and synchronization level in the presynaptic
population. We find that for a fixed presynaptic firing rate the simulated
postsynaptic interspike interval distribution depends on the synchronization
level and is well-described by a generalized extreme value distribution. For
synchronization levels of 15% to 50%, we find that the optimal distribution of
presynaptic firing rate, maximizing the mutual information per unit cost, is
maximized at ~30% synchronization level. These results suggest that the
statistics and energy efficiency of neuronal communication channels, through
which the input rate is communicated, can be dynamically adapted by the
synchronization level.

<p>Versatile, sterically accessible imaging systems capable of in vivo rapid
volumetric functional and structural imaging deep in the brain continue to be a
limiting factor in neuroscience research. Towards overcoming this obstacle, we
present integrated one- and two-photon scanned oblique plane illumination
(SOPi) microscopy which uses a single front-facing microscope objective to
provide light-sheet scanning based rapid volumetric imaging capability at
subcellular resolution. Our planar scan-mirror based optimized light-sheet
architecture allows for non-distorted scanning of volume samples, simplifying
accurate reconstruction of the imaged volume. Integration of both one-photon
(1P) and two-photon (2P) light-sheet microscopy in the same system allows for
easy selection between rapid volumetric imaging and higher resolution imaging
in scattering media. Using SOPi, we demonstrate deep, large volume imaging
capability inside scattering mouse brain sections and rapid imaging speeds up
to 10 volumes per second in zebrafish larvae expressing genetically encoded
fluorescent proteins GFP or GCaMP6s. SOPi flexibility and steric access makes
it adaptable for numerous imaging applications and broadly compatible with
orthogonal techniques for actuating or interrogating neuronal structure and
activity.

<p>The number of neurons that can be simultaneously recorded doubles every seven
years. This ever increasing number of recorded neurons opens up the possibility
to address new questions and extract higher dimensional stimuli from the
recordings. Modeling neural spike trains as point processes, this task of
extracting dynamical signals from spike trains is commonly set in the context
of nonlinear filtering theory. Particle filter methods relying on importance
weights are generic algorithms that solve the filtering task numerically, but
exhibit a serious drawback when the problem dimensionality is high: they are
known to suffer from the 'curse of dimensionality' (COD), i.e. the number of
particles required for a certain performance scales exponentially with the
observable dimensions. Here, we first briefly review the theory on filtering
with point process observations in continuous time. Based on this theory, we
investigate both analytically and numerically the reason for the COD of
weighted particle filtering approaches: Similarly to particle filtering with
continuous-time observations, the COD with point-process observations is due to
the decay of effective number of particles, an effect that is stronger when the
number of observable dimensions increases. Given the success of unweighted
particle filtering approaches in overcoming the COD for continuous- time
observations, we introduce an unweighted particle filter for point-process
observations, the spike-based Neural Particle Filter (sNPF), and show that it
exhibits a similar favorable scaling as the number of dimensions grows.
Further, we derive rules for the parameters of the sNPF from a maximum
likelihood approach learning. We finally employ a simple decoding task to
illustrate the capabilities of the sNPF and to highlight one possible future
application of our inference and learning algorithm.

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Ongoing internal cortical activity plays a major role in perception and behavior both in animals and humans. Previously we have shown that spontaneous patterns resembling orientation-maps appear over large cortical areas in the primary visual-cortex of anesthetized cats. However, it remains unknown 1) whether spontaneous-activity in the primate also displays similar patterns and 2) whether a significant difference exists between cortical ongoing-activity in the anesthetized and awake primate. We explored these questions by combining voltage-sensitive-dye imaging with multiunit and local-field-potential recordings. Spontaneously emerging orientation and ocular-dominance maps, spanning up to 6 × 6 mm<sup>2</sup>, were readily observed in anesthetized but not in awake monkeys. Nevertheless, spontaneous correlated-activity involving orientation-domains was observed in awake monkeys. Under both anesthetized and awake conditions, spontaneous correlated-activity coincided with traveling waves. We found that spontaneous activity resembling orientation-maps in awake animals spans smaller cortical areas in each instance, but over time it appears across all of V1. Furthermore, in the awake monkey, our results suggest that the synaptic strength had been completely reorganized including connections between dissimilar elements of the functional architecture. These findings lend support to the notion that ongoing-activity has many more fast switching representations playing an important role in cortical function and behavior.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>While it is well known that netrin-1 and its receptors UNC5 and UNC40 family members are involved in the normal establishment of the motor cortex and its corticospinal tract, less is known about its other receptor Down syndrome cell adherence molecule (DSCAM). DSCAM is expressed in the developing motor cortex, regulates axonal outgrowth of cortical neurons, and its mutation impairs the dendritic arborization of cortical neurons, thus suggesting that it might be involved in the normal development and functioning of the motor cortex. In comparison to WT littermates, DSCAM<sup>2J</sup> mutant mice slipped and misplaced their paw while walking on the rungs of a horizontal ladder, and exhibited more difficulties in stepping over an obstacle while walking at slow speed. Anterograde tracing showed a normal pyramidal decussation and corticospinal projection, but a more dorsal distribution of their axonal terminals in the spinal gray matter. Intracortical microstimulations showed a reduced corticospinal and intracortical efficacy, whereas stimulations of the pyramidal tract revealed a normal spinal efficacy and excitability of corticospinal tract axons, thus arguing for a dysfunctional cortical development. Our study reveals impairment of the network dynamics within the motor cortex, reducing corticospinal drive and impairing voluntary locomotor functions upon DSCAM<sup>2J</sup> mutation.</span>

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/309427v1?rss=1">The trade-off between neural computation and oscillatory coordination.</a></h4>

Oscillations can improve neural coding by grouping action potentials into synchronous windows, but this same effect harms coding when action potentials become over-synchronized. Diseases ranging from Parkinson's to epilepsy suggest that over-synchronization can lead to pathology, but the precise boundary separating healthy from pathological synchrony remains an open theoretical problem. We address this in series of numerical experiments. We study a simple model that shows how error in individual cells' computations is traded for population-level synchronization. In this model we conceive of a ''voltage budget'' where instantaneous moments of membrane voltage can be partitioned into oscillatory and computational terms. In comparing these budget terms we suggest a new set of biologically measurable inequalities that separate healthy from pathological synchrony. Finally, we derive an optimal non-biological algorithm for exchanging computational error with population synchrony.

Resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) has indicated disruptions in functional connectivity in older (OA) relative to young adults (YA). While age differences in cortical networks are well studied, differences in subcortical networks are poorly understood. Both the cerebellum and the basal ganglia are of particular interest given their role in cognitive and motor functions, and work in non-human primates has demonstrated direct reciprocal connections between these regions. Here, our goal was twofold. First, we were interested in delineating connectivity patterns between distinct regions of the cerebellum and basal ganglia, known to have topologically distinct connectivity patterns with cortex. Our second goal was to quantify age-differences in these cerebellar-striatal circuits. We performed a targeted rs-fMRI analysis of the cerebellum and basal ganglia in 30 YA and 30 OA individuals. In the YA, we found significant connectivity both within and between the cerebellum and basal ganglia, in patterns supporting semi-discrete circuits that may differentially subserve motor and cognitive performance. We found a shift in connectivity, from one of synchrony in YA, to asynchrony in OA, resulting in substantial age differences. Connectivity was also associated with behavior. These findings significantly advance our understanding of cerebellar-basal ganglia interactions in the human brain.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/309146v1?rss=1">On the problem of spike-wave discharge detection by humans and machines.</a></h4>

The detection of events from EEG records has traditionally been done manually even though manual detection is time intensive, costly and subject to inconsistencies and biases. The need for automated methods for seizure-related event detection is widely recognized and indeed development of these methods has been abundant. However, clinicians and researchers continue to rely on manual event detection because current automated algorithms either fail to produce accurate results, to meet users' expectations or are difficult to employ. Thus, there is a need for new solutions to the problems inherent in EEG event detection. Here we develop a support vector machine (SVM)-based algorithm for the automated detection of spike-wave discharges (SWDs) in a mouse model of absence epilepsy. The algorithm first identifies putative SWD events using frequency- and amplitude-based peak detection. Then, using predictors calculated from the Morlet wavelet transform of each event, it discretely classifies (SWD/nonSWD) and assigns a confidence score to each event. The result of this algorithm is scoring of SWDs along a 'confidence' continuum that is highly correlated with human confidence and that allows us to more effectively characterize ambiguous events in order to gain a better understanding of 'ground truth' in SWD detection. Finally, we validate the algorithm by showing that the detected events are temporally correlated, on the scale of seconds, with abrupt changes in spectral power bands relevant to normal behavioral states including sleep. Our results demonstrate the value of viewing detection of SWDs as a continuous, rather than discrete, classification problem.

Adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated gene replacement is emerging as a safe and effective means of correcting single-gene mutations, and use of AAV vectors for treatment of diseases of the CNS is increasing. AAV-mediated progranulin gene (GRN) delivery has been proposed as a treatment for GRN-deficient frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL), and two recent studies using focal intraparenchymal AAV-Grn delivery to brain have shown moderate success in histopathologic and behavioral rescue in mouse FTD models. Here, we used AAV9 to deliver GRN to the lateral ventricle to achieve widespread expression in the Grn null mouse brain. We found that despite a global increase in progranulin throughout many brain regions, overexpression of GRN resulted in dramatic and selective hippocampal toxicity and degeneration affecting both neurons and glia. Histologically, hippocampal degeneration was preceded by T cell infiltration and perivascular cuffing, suggesting an inflammatory component to the ensuing neuronal loss. GRN delivery with an ependymal-targeting AAV for selective secretion of progranulin into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) similarly resulted in T cell infiltration as well as ependymal hypertrophy. Interestingly, overexpression of GRN in wild-type animals also provoked T cell infiltration. These results call into question the safety of GRN overexpression in the CNS, with evidence for both a region-selective immune response and cellular proliferative response following GRN gene delivery. Our results highlight the importance of careful consideration of target gene biology and cellular response to overexpression in relevant animal models prior to progressing to the clinic.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/308510v1?rss=1">Relative sensitivity of explicit re-aiming and implicit motor adaptation</a></h4>

It has become increasingly clear that learning in visuomotor rotation tasks, which induce an angular mismatch between movements of the hand and visual feedback, largely results from the combined effort of two distinct processes: implicit motor adaptation and explicit re-aiming. However, it remains unclear how these two processes work together to produce trial-by-trial learning. Previous work has found that implicit motor adaptation operates automatically, regardless of task relevancy, and saturates for large errors. In contrast, little is known about the automaticity of explicit re-aiming and its sensitivity to error magnitude. Here we sought to characterize the automaticity and sensitivity function of these two processes to determine how they work together to facilitate performance in a visuomotor rotation task. We found that implicit adaptation scales relative to the visual error, but only for small perturbations -- replicating prior work. In contrast, explicit re-aiming scales linearly for all tested perturbation sizes. Furthermore, the consistency of the perturbation appears to diminish both implicit adaptation and explicit re-aiming, but to different degrees. Whereas implicit adaptation always displayed a response to the error, explicit re-aiming was only engaged when errors displayed a minimal degree of consistency. This comports with the idea that implicit adaptation is obligatory and less flexible, while explicit re-aiming is volitional and flexible.

The circuit organization within the mammalian brainstem respiratory network, specifically within and between the pre-Bötzinger (pre-BötC) and Bötzinger (BötC) complexes, and the roles of these circuits in respiratory pattern generation are continuously debated. We address these issues with a combination of optogenetic experiments and modeling studies. We used transgenic mice expressing channelrhodopsin-2 under the VGAT-promoter to investigate perturbations of respiratory circuit activity by site-specific photostimulation of inhibitory neurons within the pre-BötC or BötC. The stimulation effects were dependent on the intensity and phase of the photostimulation. Specifically: (1) Low intensity (≤ 1.0 mW) pulses delivered to the pre-BötC during inspiration did not terminate activity, whereas stronger stimulations (≥ 2.0 mW) terminated inspiration. (2) When the pre-BötC stimulation ended in or was applied during expiration, rebound activation of inspiration occurred after a fixed latency. (3) Relatively weak sustained stimulation (20 Hz, 0.5–2.0 mW) of pre-BötC inhibitory neurons increased respiratory frequency, while a further increase of stimulus intensity (&gt; 3.0 mW) reduced frequency and finally (≥ 5.0 mW) terminated respiratory oscillations. (4) Single pulses (0.2–5.0 s) applied to the BötC inhibited rhythmic activity for the duration of the stimulation. (5) Sustained stimulation (20 Hz, 0.5–3.0 mW) of the BötC reduced respiratory frequency and finally led to apnea. We have revised our computational model of pre-BötC and BötC microcircuits by incorporating an additional population of post-inspiratory inhibitory neurons in the pre-BötC that interacts with other neurons in the network. This model was able to reproduce the above experimental findings as well as previously published results of optogenetic activation of pre-BötC or BötC neurons obtained by other laboratories. The proposed organization of pre-BötC and BötC circuits leads to testable predictions about their specific roles in respiratory pattern generation and provides important insights into key circuit interactions operating within brainstem respiratory networks.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/2-EXg_xghbA" width="1" />

<p>by Catherine M. Byrne, Soren Gantt, Daniel Coombs</p>

Patients with Herpes Simplex Virus-2 (HSV-2) infection face a significantly higher risk of contracting HIV-1. This is thought to be due to herpetic lesions serving as entry points for HIV-1 and tissue-resident CD4+ T cell counts increasing during HSV-2 lesional events. We have created a stochastic and spatial mathematical model describing the dynamics of HSV-2 infection and immune response in the genital mucosa. Using our model, we first study the dynamics of a developing HSV-2 lesion. We then use our model to quantify the risk of infection with HIV-1 following sexual exposure in HSV-2 positive women. Untreated, we find that HSV-2 infected women are up to 8.6 times more likely to acquire HIV-1 than healthy patients. However, when including the effects of the HSV-2 antival drug, pritelivir, the risk of HIV-1 infection is predicted to decrease by up to 35%, depending on drug dosage. We estimate the relative importance of decreased tissue damage versus decreased CD4+ cell presence in determining the effectiveness of pritelivir in reducing HIV-1 infection. Our results suggest that clinical trials should be performed to evaluate the effectiveness of pritelivir or similar agents in preventing HIV-1 infection in HSV-2 positive women.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/gAxRWv6Wb-g" width="1" />

Mechanical stability is a key feature in the regulation of structural scaffolding proteins and their functions. Despite the abundance of α-helical structures among the human proteome and their undisputed importance in health and disease, the fundamental principles of their behavior under mechanical load are poorly understood. Talin and α-catenin are two key molecules in focal adhesions and adherens junctions, respectively. In this study, we used a combination of atomistic steered molecular dynamics (SMD) simulations, polyprotein engineering, and single-molecule atomic force microscopy (smAFM) to investigate unfolding of these proteins. SMD simulations revealed that talin rod α-helix bundles as well as α-catenin α-helix domains unfold through stable 3-helix intermediates. While the 5-helix bundles were found to be mechanically stable, a second stable conformation corresponding to the 3-helix state was revealed. Mechanically weaker 4-helix bundles easily unfolded into a stable 3-helix conformation. The results of smAFM experiments were in agreement with the findings of the computational simulations. The disulfide clamp mutants, (resistant to mechanical unfolding) designed to protect the stable state, support the 3-helix intermediate model in both experimental and computational setups. As a result, multiple discrete unfolding intermediate states in the talin and α-catenin unfolding pathway were discovered. Better understanding of the mechanical unfolding mechanism of α-helix proteins is a key step towards comprehensive models describing the mechanoregulation of proteins.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/z2y475sR2a8" width="1" />

<p>by Ji-Sung Kim, Xin Gao, Andrey Rzhetsky</p>

Anonymized electronic medical records are an increasingly popular source of research data. However, these datasets often lack race and ethnicity information. This creates problems for researchers modeling human disease, as race and ethnicity are powerful confounders for many health exposures and treatment outcomes; race and ethnicity are closely linked to population-specific genetic variation. We showed that deep neural networks generate more accurate estimates for missing racial and ethnic information than competing methods (e.g., logistic regression, random forest, support vector machines, and gradient-boosted decision trees). RIDDLE yielded significantly better classification performance across all metrics that were considered: accuracy, cross-entropy loss (error), precision, recall, and area under the curve for receiver operating characteristic plots (all <i>p</i> &lt; 10<sup>−9</sup>). We made specific efforts to interpret the trained neural network models to identify, quantify, and visualize medical features which are predictive of race and ethnicity. We used these characterizations of informative features to perform a systematic comparison of differential disease patterns by race and ethnicity. The fact that clinical histories are informative for imputing race and ethnicity could reflect (1) a skewed distribution of blue- and white-collar professions across racial and ethnic groups, (2) uneven accessibility and subjective importance of prophylactic health, (3) possible variation in lifestyle, such as dietary habits, and (4) differences in background genetic variation which predispose to diseases.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/4S7ZYbUulAk" width="1" />

The beneficial effects of physical activity for the prevention and management of several chronic diseases are widely recognized. Mathematical modeling of the effects of physical exercise in body metabolism and in particular its influence on the control of glucose homeostasis is of primary importance in the development of eHealth monitoring devices for a personalized medicine. Nonetheless, to date only a few mathematical models have been aiming at this specific purpose. We have developed a whole-body computational model of the effects on metabolic homeostasis of a bout of physical exercise. Built upon an existing model, it allows to detail better both subjects’ characteristics and physical exercise, thus determining to a greater extent the dynamics of the hormones and the metabolites considered.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/L9MBzxj-2FY" width="1" />

<p>The acoustic startle reflex (ASR) that can be induced by a loud sound
stimulus can be used as a versatile tool to, e.g., estimate hearing thresholds
or identify subjective tinnitus percepts in rodents. These techniques are based
on the fact that the ASR amplitude can be suppressed by a pre-stimulus of
lower, non-startling intensity, an effect named pre-pulse inhibition (PPI). For
hearing threshold estimation, pure tone pre-stimuli of varying amplitudes are
presented before an intense noise burst serving as startle stimulus. The amount
of suppression of the ASR amplitude as a function of the pre-stimulus intensity
can be used as a behavioral correlate to determine the hearing ability. For
tinnitus assessment, the pure-tone pre-stimulus is replaced by a gap of silence
in a narrowband noise background, a paradigm termed GPIAS (gap-pre-pulse
inhibition of the acoustic startle response). A proper application of these
paradigms depend on a reliable measurement of the ASR amplitudes, an exact
stimulus presentation in terms of frequency and intensity. Here we introduce a
novel open source solution for the construction of a low-cost ASR setup for the
above mentioned purpose. The complete software for data acquisition and
stimulus presentation is written in Python 3.6 and is provided as an anaconda
package. Furthermore, we provide a construction plan for the sensory system
based on low-cost hardware components. Exemplary data show that the ratios
(1-PPI) of the pre and post trauma ASR amplitudes can be well described by a
lognormal distribution being in good accordance to previous studies with
already established setups. Hence, the open access solution described here will
help to further establish the ASR method in many laboratories and thus
facilitate and standardize research in animal models of tinnitus or hearing
loss.

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Progress in neurodevelopmental brain research has been achieved through the use of animal models. Such models not only help understanding biological changes that govern brain development, maturation and aging, but are also essential for identifying possible mechanisms of neurodevelopmental and age-related chronic disorders, and to evaluate possible interventions with potential relevance to human disease. Genetic relationship of rhesus monkeys to humans makes those animals a great candidate for such models. With the typical lifespan of 25 years, they undergo cognitive maturation and aging that is similar to this observed in humans. Quantitative structural neuroimaging has been proposed as one of the candidate in vivo biomarkers for tracking white matter brain maturation and aging. While lifespan trajectories of white matter changes have been mapped in humans, such knowledge is not available for nonhuman primates. Here, we analyze and model lifespan trajectories of white matter microstructure using in vivo diffusion imaging in a sample of 44 rhesus monkeys. We report quantitative parameters (including slopes and peaks) of lifespan trajectories for 8 individual white matter tracts. We show different trajectories for cellular and extracellular microstructural imaging components that are associated with white matter maturation and aging, and discuss similarities and differences between those in humans and rhesus monkeys, the importance of our findings, and future directions for the field.Significance Statement: Quantitative structural neuroimaging has been proposed as one of the candidate in vivo biomarkers for tracking brain maturation and aging. While lifespan trajectories of structural white matter changes have been mapped in humans, such knowledge is not available for rhesus monkeys. We present here results of the analysis and modeling of the lifespan trajectories of white matter microstructure using in vivo diffusion imaging in a sample of 44 rhesus monkeys (age 4–27). We report and anatomically map lifespan changes related to cellular and extracellular microstructural components that are associated with white matter maturation and aging.</span>

Appropriately classifying neuronal subgroups is critical to numerous downstream procedures in several disciplines of biomedical research. The cortical pyramidal neuron characterization technology has achieved rapid development in recent years. However, capturing true neuronal features for accurate pyramidal neuron characterization and segmentation has remained elusive. In the current study, a novel global preserving estimate algorithm is used to capture the non-linearity in the features of cortical pyramidal neuron after Factor Algorithm. Our results provide evidence for the effective integration of the original linear and nonlinear neuronal features and achieves better characterization performance on multiple cortical pyramidal neuron databases through array matching.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/308999v1?rss=1">Cascaded Processing of Amplitude Modulation for Natural Sound Recognition</a></h4>

Temporal variation of sound envelope, or amplitude modulation (AM), is essential for auditory perception of natural sounds. Neural representation of stimulus AM is successively transformed while processed by a cascade of brain regions in the auditory system. Here we sought the functional significance of such cascaded transformation of AM representation. We modelled the function of the auditory system with a deep neural network (DNN) optimized for natural sound recognition. Neurophysiological analysis of the DNN revealed that AM representation similar to the auditory system emerged during the optimization. The better-recognizing DNNs exhibited larger similarity to the auditory system. The control experiments suggest that the cascading architecture, the data structure, and the optimization objective may be essential factors for the lower, middle and higher regions, respectively. The results were consistently observed across independent datasets. These results suggest the emergence of AM representation in the auditory system during optimization for natural sound recognition.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/308981v1?rss=1">TMS orientation and pulse waveform manipulation activates different neural populations: direct evidence from TMS-EEG</a></h4>

Monophasic and biphasic TMS pulses and coil orientations produce different responses in terms of motor output and sensory perception. Those differences have been attributed to the activation of specific neural populations. However, up to date, direct evidence supporting this hypothesis is still missing since studies were mostly based on indirect measures of cortical activation, i.e., motor evoked potentials or phosphenes. Here, we investigated for the first time the impact of different coil orientations and waveforms on a non-primary cortical area, namely the premotor cortex, by measuring TMS evoked EEG potentials (TEPs). We aimed at determining whether TEPs produced by differently oriented biphasic and monophasic TMS pulses diverge and whether these differences are underpinned by the activation of specific neural populations. To do so, we applied TMS over the right premotor cortex with monophasic or biphasic waveforms oriented perpendicularly (in the anterior-posterior direction and vice-versa) or parallel (latero-medial or medio-laterally) to the target gyrus. EEG was concurrently recorded from 60 electrodes. We analyzed TEPs at the level of EEG sensors and cortical sources both in time and time-frequency domain. Biphasic pulses evoked larger early TEP components, which reflect cortical excitability properties of the underlying cortex, in both parallel directions when compared to the perpendicular conditions. Conversely, monophasic pulses, when oriented perpendicularly to the stimulated gyrus, elicited a greater N100, which is a reliable TEP component linked to GABAb-mediated inhibitory processes, than when parallel to the gyrus. Our results provide direct evidence supporting the hypothesis that TMS pulse waveform and TMS coil orientations affect which neural population is engaged.

Information is encoded within neural networks through synaptic weight changes. Synaptic learning rules involve a combination of rapid Hebbian plasticity with slower homeostatic synaptic plasticity (HSP) that regulates neuronal activity through global synaptic scaling. While Hebbian plasticity has been extensively investigated, much less is known about HSP. Here we investigate the structural and functional consequences of HSP at dendritic spines of mouse hippocampal neurons. We find that prolonged activity blockade induces spine growth, paralleling synaptic strength increases. Following activity blockade, glutamate uncaging-mediated long-term potentiation at single spines leads to size-dependent structural plasticity: smaller spines undergo robust growth, while larger spines remain unchanged. Moreover, we find that neighboring spines in the vicinity of the stimulated spine exhibit volume changes following HSP, indicating that plasticity has spread across a group of synapses. Overall, these findings demonstrate that Hebbian and homeostatic plasticity shape neural connectivity through coordinated structural plasticity of clustered inputs.

Growing recognition of the pivotal role microglia play in neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory disorders has accentuated the need to better characterize their function in health and disease. Studies in mouse, have applied transcriptome-wide profiling of microglia to reveal key features of microglial ontogeny, functional profile and phenotypic diversity. Whilst similar in many ways, human microglia exhibit clear differences to their mouse counterparts, underlining the need to develop a better understanding of the human microglial profile. On examining published microglia gene signatures, little consistency was observed between studies. Hence, we set out to define a conserved microglia signature of the human central nervous system (CNS), through a comprehensive meta-analysis of existing transcriptomic resources. Nine datasets derived from cells and tissue, isolated from different regions of the CNS across numerous donors, were subjected independently to an unbiased correlation network analysis. From each dataset, a list of coexpressing genes corresponding to microglia was identified. Comparison of individual microglia clusters showed 249 genes highly conserved between them. This core gene signature included all known markers and improves upon published microglial signatures. The utility of this signature was demonstrated by its use in detecting qualitative and quantitative region-specific alterations in aging and Alzheimer's disease. These analyses highlighted the reactive response of microglia in vulnerable brain regions such as the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus, additionally implicating pathways associated with disease progression. We believe this resource and the analyses described here, will support further investigations in the contribution of human microglia towards the CNS in health and disease.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/308759v1?rss=1">Edge orientation perception during active touch</a></h4>

Previous studies investigating the perceptual attributes of tactile edge-orientation processing have applied their stimuli to an immobilized fingertip. Here we tested the perceptual attributes of edge orientation processing when participants actively touched the stimulus. Our participants moved their finger over two pairs of edges - one pair parallel and the other non-parallel to varying degrees - and were asked to identify which of the two pairs was non-parallel. In addition to the psychophysical estimates of edge orientation acuity, we measured the speed at which participants moved their finger and the forces they exerted when moving their finger over the stimulus. We report four main findings. First, edge orientation acuity during active touch averaged 12.4{degrees}, similar to that previously reported during passive touch. Second, on average, participants moved their finger over the stimuli at 23.9 mm/s and exerted contact forces of 0.47 N. Third, across participants, there was no clear relationship between how people moved their finger or how they pressed on the stimulus and their edge orientation acuity. However, within participants, there appeared to be a weak effect of speed on performance whereby error trials included slightly faster finger movements; no equivalent effect was found for contact force. Fourth, consistent with previous work testing spatial acuity, we found significant correlation between fingertip size and orientation acuity such that people with smaller fingertips tended to have better orientation acuity.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/308585v1?rss=1">Transcranial photoacoustic imaging of NMDA-evoked focal circuit dynamics in rat forebrain</a></h4>

Transcranial photoacoustic (PA) voltage-sensitive dye (VSD) imaging promises to overcome current temporal and spatial limitations of functional neuroimaging. The technique previously distinguished global seizure activity from control neural activity in groups of rats. To validate the focal specificity of transcranial PA with VSD (IR780) imaging in vivo, we now present proofs-of-concept that the results differentiate between N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) evoked neural activities in two distinct circuits with differential response profiles, i.e., sensorimotor cortex and hippocampus. Concurrent quantitative EEG (qEEG) recorded real time circuit dynamics. We hypothesized that NMDA evoked focal glutamate release in both circuits would correlate with increases of location-specific PA signals and time-specific EEG signals. To test the hypothesis in hippocampus 0.3, 1 and 3 mM NMDA was infused at a rate of 2 l/min over 60 min via an implanted microdialysis probe. The dialysate samples collected every 20 minutes during the infusion were analyzed for focal changes in extracellular glutamate release and quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Microdialysis at 0.3, 1 and 3 mM showed dose-dependent increases of glutamate (39%, 200% and 670 %, respectively) in hippocampus. We recorded dose-dependent increases of the PA signal with 0.3 and 3 mM NMDA infusion as predicted. Recorded qEEG at 3 mM NMDA infusion confirmed induction of focal seizure activity. Transcranial PA VSD imaging provided up to 301.45 {+/-} 42.48 % of fractional neural activity index change measured at contralateral side of microdialysis probe with 3 mM NMDA infusion, while -24.48 {+/-} 34.16 % of fractional decrease with 0.3 mM NMDA infusion. This clearly suggests function of dentate gyrus (DG) gatekeeping in hippocampus. When we tested the hypothesis in sensorimotor cortex, intracerebral infusion of NMDA at 0.3 mM elicited the predicted increase of glutamate release, with an unexpected decrease of qEEG spectral power; suggesting surround inhibition due to preferential activation of inhibitory interneurons. Transcranial PA VSD imaging had -13.22 {+/-} 37.08 % of fractional neural activity index change during 20 min of 0.3 mM NMDA infusion, consistent with surround suppression of depolarization as shown by qEEG of motor cortex. Therefore, transcranial PA VSD imaging distinguished cortical surround inhibition and hippocampal focal seizure activity that correlated with activities reported by qEEG signals with similar protocols. The results show this emerging technology to be an innovative and significant advance of functional neuroimaging.

<p>by Falk Lieder, Amitai Shenhav, Sebastian Musslick, Thomas L. Griffiths</p>

The human brain has the impressive capacity to adapt how it processes information to high-level goals. While it is known that these cognitive control skills are malleable and can be improved through training, the underlying plasticity mechanisms are not well understood. Here, we develop and evaluate a model of how people learn when to exert cognitive control, which controlled process to use, and how much effort to exert. We derive this model from a general theory according to which the function of cognitive control is to select and configure neural pathways so as to make optimal use of finite time and limited computational resources. The central idea of our Learned Value of Control model is that people use reinforcement learning to predict the value of candidate control signals of different types and intensities based on stimulus features. This model correctly predicts the learning and transfer effects underlying the adaptive control-demanding behavior observed in an experiment on visual attention and four experiments on interference control in Stroop and Flanker paradigms. Moreover, our model explained these findings significantly better than an associative learning model and a Win-Stay Lose-Shift model. Our findings elucidate how learning and experience might shape people’s ability and propensity to adaptively control their minds and behavior. We conclude by predicting under which circumstances these learning mechanisms might lead to self-control failure.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Aj4DbuvGLfQ" width="1" />

<p>Collagen XIII occurs as both a transmembrane-bound and a shed extracellular protein and is able to regulate the formation and function of neuromuscular synapses. Its absence results in myasthenia: presynaptic and postsynaptic defects at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ), leading to destabilization of the motor nerves, muscle regeneration and atrophy. Mutations in <i>COL13A1</i> have recently been found to cause congenital myasthenic syndrome, characterized by fatigue and chronic muscle weakness, which may be lethal. We show here that muscle defects in collagen XIII-deficient mice stabilize in adulthood, so that the disease is not progressive until very late. Sciatic nerve crush was performed to examine how the lack of collagen XIII or forced expression of its transmembrane form affects the neuromuscular synapse regeneration and functional recovery following injury. We show that collagen XIII-deficient male mice are unable to achieve complete NMJ regeneration and functional recovery. This is mainly attributable to presynaptic defects that already existed in the absence of collagen XIII before injury. Shedding of the ectodomain is not required, as the transmembrane form of collagen XIII alone fully rescues the phenotype. Thus, collagen XIII could serve as a therapeutic agent in cases of injury-induced PNS regeneration and functional recovery. We conclude that intrinsic alterations at the NMJ in <i>Col13a1</i><sup>–/–</sup> mice contribute to impaired and incomplete NMJ regeneration and functional recovery after peripheral nerve injury. However, such alterations do not progress once they have stabilized in early adulthood, emphasizing the role of collagen XIII in NMJ maturation.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Collagen XIII is required for gaining and maintaining the normal size, complexity, and functional capacity of neuromuscular synapses. Loss-of-function mutations in <i>COL13A1</i> cause congenital myasthenic syndrome 19, characterized by postnatally progressive muscle fatigue, which compromises patients' functional capacity. We show here in collagen XIII-deficient mice that the disease stabilizes in adulthood once the NMJs have matured. This study also describes a relevant contribution of the altered NMJ morphology and function to neuromuscular synapses, and PNS regeneration and functional recovery in collagen XIII-deficient mice after peripheral nerve injury. Correlating the animal model data on collagen XIII-associated congenital myasthenic syndrome, it can be speculated that neuromuscular connections in congenital myasthenic syndrome patients are not able to fully regenerate and restore normal functionality if exposed to peripheral nerve injury.</p>

<p>Evidence for intrinsic functional connectivity (FC) within the human brain is largely from neuroimaging studies of hemodynamic activity. Data are lacking from anatomically precise electrophysiological recordings in the most widely studied nodes of human brain networks. Here we used a combination of fMRI and electrocorticography (ECoG) in five human neurosurgical patients with electrodes in the canonical "default" (medial prefrontal and posteromedial cortex), "dorsal attention" (frontal eye fields and superior parietal lobule), and "frontoparietal control" (inferior parietal lobule and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) networks. In this unique cohort, simultaneous intracranial recordings within these networks were anatomically matched across different individuals. Within each network and for each individual, we found a positive, and reproducible, spatial correlation for FC measures obtained from resting-state fMRI and separately recorded ECoG in the same brains. This relationship was reliably identified for electrophysiological FC based on slow (&lt;1 Hz) fluctuations of high-frequency broadband (70–170 Hz) power, both during wakeful rest and sleep. A similar FC organization was often recovered when using lower-frequency (1–70 Hz) power, but anatomical specificity and consistency were greatest for the high-frequency broadband range. An interfrequency comparison of fluctuations in FC revealed that high and low-frequency ranges often temporally diverged from one another, suggesting that multiple neurophysiological sources may underlie variations in FC. Together, our work offers a generalizable electrophysiological basis for intrinsic FC and its dynamics across individuals, brain networks, and behavioral states.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The study of human brain networks during wakeful "rest", largely with fMRI, is now a major focus in both cognitive and clinical neuroscience. However, little is known about the neurophysiology of these networks and their dynamics. We studied neural activity during wakeful rest and sleep within neurosurgical patients with directly implanted electrodes. We found that network activity patterns showed striking similarities between fMRI and direct recordings in the same brains. With improved resolution of direct recordings, we also found that networks were best characterized with specific activity frequencies and that different frequencies show different profiles of within-network activity over time. Our work clarifies how networks spontaneously organize themselves across individuals, brain networks, and behavioral states.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/17/4212?rss=1">Restoration of Kv7 Channel-Mediated Inhibition Reduces Cued-Reinstatement of Cocaine Seeking</a></h4>

<p>Cocaine addicts display increased sensitivity to drug-associated cues, due in part to changes in the prelimbic prefrontal cortex (PL-PFC). The cellular mechanisms underlying cue-induced reinstatement of cocaine seeking remain unknown. Reinforcement learning for addictive drugs may produce persistent maladaptations in intrinsic excitability within sparse subsets of PFC pyramidal neurons. Using a model of relapse in male rats, we sampled &gt;600 neurons to examine spike frequency adaptation (SFA) and afterhyperpolarizations (AHPs), two systems that attenuate low-frequency inputs to regulate neuronal synchronization. We observed that training to self-administer cocaine or nondrug (sucrose) reinforcers decreased SFA and AHPs in a subpopulation of PL-PFC neurons. Only with cocaine did the resulting hyperexcitability persist through extinction training and increase during reinstatement. In neurons with intact SFA, dopamine enhanced excitability by inhibiting Kv7 potassium channels that mediate SFA. However, dopamine effects were occluded in neurons from cocaine-experienced rats, where SFA and AHPs were reduced. Pharmacological stabilization of Kv7 channels with retigabine restored SFA and Kv7 channel function in neuroadapted cells. When microinjected bilaterally into the PL-PFC 10 min before reinstatement testing, retigabine reduced cue-induced reinstatement of cocaine seeking. Last, using cFos-GFP transgenic rats, we found that the loss of SFA correlated with the expression of cFos-GFP following both extinction and re-exposure to drug-associated cues. Together, these data suggest that cocaine self-administration desensitizes inhibitory Kv7 channels in a subpopulation of PL-PFC neurons. This subpopulation of neurons may represent a persistent neural ensemble responsible for driving drug seeking in response to cues.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Long after the cessation of drug use, cues associated with cocaine still elicit drug-seeking behavior, in part by activation of the prelimbic prefrontal cortex (PL-PFC). The underlying cellular mechanisms governing these activated neurons remain unclear. Using a rat model of relapse to cocaine seeking, we identified a population of PL-PFC neurons that become hyperexcitable following chronic cocaine self-administration. These neurons show persistent loss of spike frequency adaptation, reduced afterhyperpolarizations, decreased sensitivity to dopamine, and reduced Kv7 channel-mediated inhibition. Stabilization of Kv7 channel function with retigabine normalized neuronal excitability, restored Kv7 channel currents, and reduced drug-seeking behavior when administered into the PL-PFC before reinstatement. These data highlight a persistent adaptation in a subset of PL-PFC neurons that may contribute to relapse vulnerability.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/17/4200?rss=1">Human Episodic Memory Retrieval Is Accompanied by a Neural Contiguity Effect</a></h4>

<p>Cognitive psychologists have long hypothesized that experiences are encoded in a temporal context that changes gradually over time. When an episodic memory is retrieved, the state of context is recovered—a jump back in time. We recorded from single units in the medial temporal lobe of epilepsy patients performing an item recognition task. The population vector changed gradually over minutes during presentation of the list. When a probe from the list was remembered with high confidence, the population vector reinstated the temporal context of the original presentation of that probe during study, a neural contiguity effect that provides a possible mechanism for behavioral contiguity effects. This pattern was only observed for well remembered probes; old probes that were not well remembered showed an anti-contiguity effect. These results constitute the first direct evidence that recovery of an episodic memory in humans is associated with retrieval of a gradually changing state of temporal context, a neural "jump back in time" that parallels the act of remembering.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Episodic memory is the ability to relive a specific experience from one's life. For decades, researchers have hypothesized that, unlike other forms of memory that can be described as simple associations between stimuli, episodic memory depends on the recovery of a neural representation of spatiotemporal context. During study of a sequence of stimuli, the brain state of epilepsy patients changed slowly over at least a minute. When the participant remembered a particular event from the list, this gradually changing state was recovered. This provides direct confirmation of the prediction from computational models of episodic memory. The resolution of this point means that the study of episodic memory can focus on the mechanisms by which this representation of spatiotemporal context is maintained and sometimes recovered.</p>

<p>Extensive research has described two key features of interval timing. The bias property is associated with accuracy and implies that time is overestimated for short intervals and underestimated for long intervals. The scalar property is linked to precision and states that the variability of interval estimates increases as a function of interval duration. The neural mechanisms behind these properties are not well understood. Here we implemented a recurrent neural network that mimics a cortical ensemble and includes cells that show paired-pulse facilitation and slow inhibitory synaptic currents. The network produces interval selective responses and reproduces both bias and scalar properties when a Bayesian decoder reads its activity. Notably, the interval-selectivity, timing accuracy, and precision of the network showed complex changes as a function of the decay time constants of the modeled synaptic properties and the level of background activity of the cells. These findings suggest that physiological values of the time constants for paired-pulse facilitation and GABAb, as well as the internal state of the network, determine the bias and scalar properties of interval timing.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Timing is a fundamental element of complex behavior, including music and language. Temporal processing in a wide variety of contexts shows two primary features: time estimates exhibit a shift toward the mean (the bias property) and are more variable for longer intervals (the scalar property). We implemented a recurrent neural network that includes long-lasting synaptic currents, which cannot only produce interval-selective responses but also follow the bias and scalar properties. Interestingly, only physiological values of the time constants for paired-pulse facilitation and GABAb, as well as intermediate background activity within the network can reproduce the two key features of interval timing.</p>

<p>Neurons in multiple brain regions fire trains of action potentials anticipating specific movements, but this "preparatory activity" has not been systematically compared across behavioral tasks. We compared preparatory activity in auditory and tactile delayed-response tasks in male mice. Skilled, directional licking was the motor output. The anterior lateral motor cortex (ALM) is necessary for motor planning in both tasks. Multiple features of ALM preparatory activity during the delay epoch were similar across tasks. First, most neurons showed direction-selective activity and spatially intermingled neurons were selective for either movement direction. Second, many cells showed mixed coding of sensory stimulus and licking direction, with a bias toward licking direction. Third, delay activity was monotonic and low-dimensional. Fourth, pairs of neurons with similar direction selectivity showed high spike-count correlations. Our study forms the foundation to analyze the neural circuit mechanisms underlying preparatory activity in a genetically tractable model organism.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Short-term memories link events separated in time. Neurons in the frontal cortex fire trains of action potentials anticipating specific movements, often seconds before the movement. This "preparatory activity" has been observed in multiple brain regions, but has rarely been compared systematically across behavioral tasks in the same brain region. To identify common features of preparatory activity, we developed and compared preparatory activity in auditory and tactile delayed-response tasks in mice. The same cortical area is necessary for both tasks. Multiple features of preparatory activity, measured with high-density silicon probes, were similar across tasks. We find that preparatory activity is low-dimensional and monotonic. Our study forms a foundation for analyzing the circuit mechanisms underlying preparatory activity in a genetically tractable model organism.</p>

<p>Cardiovascular disease and susceptibility to infection are leading causes of morbidity and mortality for individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI). A major contributor to these is autonomic dysreflexia (AD), an amplified reaction of the autonomic nervous system (hallmarked by severe hypertension) in response to sensory stimuli below the injury. Maladaptive plasticity of the spinal sympathetic reflex circuit below the SCI results in AD intensification over time. Mechanisms underlying this maladaptive plasticity are poorly understood, restricting the identification of treatments. Thus, no preventative treatments are currently available. Neuroinflammation has been implicated in other pathologies associated with hyperexcitable neural circuits. Specifically, the soluble form of TNFα (sTNFα) is known to play a role in neuroplasticity. We hypothesize that persistent expression of sTNFα in spinal cord underlies AD exacerbation. To test this, we intrathecally administered XPro1595, a biologic that renders sTNFα nonfunctional, after complete, high-level SCI in female rats. This dramatically attenuated the intensification of colorectal distension-induced and naturally occurring AD events. This improvement is mediated via decreased sprouting of nociceptive primary afferents and activation of the spinal sympathetic reflex circuit. We also examined peripheral vascular function using <i>ex vivo</i> pressurized arterial preparations and immune function via flow cytometric analysis of splenocytes. Diminishing AD via pharmacological inhibition of sTNFα mitigated ensuing vascular hypersensitivity and immune dysfunction. This is the first demonstration that neuroinflammation-induced sTNFα is critical for altering the spinal sympathetic reflex circuit, elucidating a novel mechanism for AD. Importantly, we identify the first potential pharmacological, prophylactic treatment for this life-threatening syndrome.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Autonomic dysreflexia (AD), a disorder that develops after spinal cord injury (SCI) and is hallmarked by sudden, extreme hypertension, contributes to cardiovascular disease and susceptibility to infection, respectively, two leading causes of mortality and morbidity in SCI patients. We demonstrate that neuroinflammation-induced expression of soluble TNFα plays a critical role in AD, elucidating a novel underlying mechanism. We found that intrathecal administration after SCI of a biologic that inhibits soluble TNFα signaling dramatically attenuates AD and significantly reduces AD-associated peripheral vascular and immune dysfunction. We identified mechanisms behind diminished plasticity of neuronal populations within the spinal sympathetic reflex circuit. This study is the first to pinpoint a potential pharmacological, prophylactic strategy to attenuate AD and ensuing cardiovascular and immune dysfunction.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/17/4138?rss=1">Adaptation to Noise in Human Speech Recognition Unrelated to the Medial Olivocochlear Reflex</a></h4>

<p>Sensory systems constantly adapt their responses to the current environment. In hearing, adaptation may facilitate communication in noisy settings, a benefit frequently (but controversially) attributed to the medial olivocochlear reflex (MOCR) enhancing the neural representation of speech. Here, we show that human listeners (<i>N</i> = 14; five male) recognize more words presented monaurally in ipsilateral, contralateral, and bilateral noise when they are given some time to adapt to the noise. This finding challenges models and theories that claim that speech intelligibility in noise is invariant over time. In addition, we show that this adaptation to the noise occurs also for words processed to maintain the slow-amplitude modulations in speech (the envelope) disregarding the faster fluctuations (the temporal fine structure). This demonstrates that noise adaptation reflects an enhancement of amplitude modulation speech cues and is unaffected by temporal fine structure cues. Last, we show that cochlear implant users (<i>N</i> = 7; four male) show normal monaural adaptation to ipsilateral noise. Because the electrical stimulation delivered by cochlear implants is independent from the MOCR, this demonstrates that noise adaptation does not require the MOCR. We argue that noise adaptation probably reflects adaptation of the dynamic range of auditory neurons to the noise level statistics.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> People find it easier to understand speech in noisy environments when they are given some time to adapt to the noise. This benefit is frequently but controversially attributed to the medial olivocochlear efferent reflex enhancing the representation of speech cues in the auditory nerve. Here, we show that the adaptation to noise reflects an enhancement of the slow fluctuations in amplitude over time that are present in speech. In addition, we show that adaptation to noise for cochlear implant users is not statistically different from that for listeners with normal hearing. Because the electrical stimulation delivered by cochlear implants is independent from the medial olivocochlear efferent reflex, this demonstrates that adaptation to noise does not require this reflex.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/17/4123?rss=1">Dual Coding of Frequency Modulation in the Ventral Cochlear Nucleus</a></h4>

<p>Frequency modulation (FM) is a common acoustic feature of natural sounds and is known to play a role in robust sound source recognition. Auditory neurons show precise stimulus-synchronized discharge patterns that may be used for the representation of low-rate FM. However, it remains unclear whether this representation is based on synchronization to slow temporal envelope (ENV) cues resulting from cochlear filtering or phase locking to faster temporal fine structure (TFS) cues. To investigate the plausibility of those encoding schemes, single units of the ventral cochlear nucleus of guinea pigs of either sex were recorded in response to sine FM tones centered at the unit's best frequency (BF). The results show that, in contrast to high-BF units, for modulation depths within the receptive field, low-BF units (&lt;4 kHz) demonstrate good phase locking to TFS. For modulation depths extending beyond the receptive field, the discharge patterns follow the ENV and fluctuate at the modulation rate. The receptive field proved to be a good predictor of the ENV responses for most primary-like and chopper units. The current <i>in vivo</i> data also reveal a high level of diversity in responses across unit types. TFS cues are mainly conveyed by low-frequency and primary-like units and ENV cues by chopper and onset units. The diversity of responses exhibited by cochlear nucleus neurons provides a neural basis for a dual-coding scheme of FM in the brainstem based on both ENV and TFS cues.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Natural sounds, including speech, convey informative temporal modulations in frequency. Understanding how the auditory system represents those frequency modulations (FM) has important implications as robust sound source recognition depends crucially on the reception of low-rate FM cues. Here, we recorded 115 single-unit responses from the ventral cochlear nucleus in response to FM and provide the first physiological evidence of a dual-coding mechanism of FM via synchronization to temporal envelope cues and phase locking to temporal fine structure cues. We also demonstrate a diversity of neural responses with different coding specializations. These results support the dual-coding scheme proposed by psychophysicists to account for FM sensitivity in humans and provide new insights on how this might be implemented in the early stages of the auditory pathway.</p>

<p>When the foot contacts an obstacle during locomotion, cutaneous inputs activate spinal circuits to ensure dynamic balance and forward progression. In quadrupeds, this requires coordinated reflex responses between the four limbs. Here, we investigated the patterns and phasic modulation of cutaneous reflexes in forelimb and hindlimb muscles evoked by inputs from all four limbs. Five female cats were implanted to record muscle activity and to stimulate the superficial peroneal and superficial radial nerves during locomotion. Stimulating these nerves evoked short-, mid-, and longer-latency excitatory and/or inhibitory responses in all four limbs that were phase-dependent. The largest responses were generally observed during the peak activity of the muscle. Cutaneous reflexes during mid-swing were consistent with flexion of the homonymous limb and accompanied by modification of the stance phases of the other three limbs, by coactivating flexors and extensors and/or by delaying push-off. Cutaneous reflexes during mid-stance were consistent with stabilizing the homonymous limb by delaying and then facilitating its push-off and modifying the support phases of the homolateral and diagonal limbs, characterized by coactivating flexors and extensors, reinforcing extensor activity and/or delaying push-off. The shortest latencies of homolateral and diagonal responses were consistent with fast-conducting disynaptic or trisynaptic pathways. Descending homolateral and diagonal pathways from the forelimbs to the hindlimbs had a higher probability of eliciting responses compared with ascending pathways from the hindlimbs to the forelimbs. Thus, in quadrupeds, intralimb and interlimb reflexes activated by cutaneous inputs ensure dynamic coordination of the four limbs, producing a whole-body response.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The skin contains receptors that, when activated, send inputs to spinal circuits, signaling a perturbation. Rapid responses, or reflexes, in muscles of the contacted limb and opposite homologous limb help maintain balance and forward progression. Here, we investigated reflexes during quadrupedal locomotion in the cat by electrically stimulating cutaneous nerves in each of the four limbs. Functionally, responses appear to modify the trajectory or stabilize the movement of the stimulated limb while modifying the support phase of the other limbs. Reflexes between limbs are mediated by fast-conducting pathways that involve excitatory and inhibitory circuits controlling each limb. The comparatively stronger descending pathways from cervical to lumbar circuits controlling the forelimbs and hindlimbs, respectively, could serve a protective function.</p>

<p>Long-term forms of brain plasticity share a requirement for changes in gene expression induced by neuronal activity. Mechanisms that determine how the distinct and overlapping functions of multiple activity-responsive transcription factors, including nuclear factor B (NF-B), give rise to stimulus-appropriate neuronal responses remain unclear. We report that the p65/RelA subunit of NF-B confers subcellular enrichment at neuronal dendritic spines and engineer a p65 mutant that lacks spine enrichment (p65SE) but retains inherent transcriptional activity equivalent to wild-type p65. Wild-type p65 or p65SE both rescue NF-B-dependent gene expression in p65-deficient murine hippocampal neurons responding to diffuse (PMA/ionomycin) stimulation. In contrast, neurons lacking spine-enriched NF-B are selectively impaired in NF-B-dependent gene expression induced by elevated excitatory synaptic stimulation (bicuculline or glycine). We used the setting of excitatory synaptic activity during development that produces NF-B-dependent growth of dendritic spines to test physiological function of spine-enriched NF-B in an activity-dependent response. Expression of wild-type p65, but not p65SE, is capable of rescuing spine density to normal levels in p65-deficient pyramidal neurons. Collectively, these data reveal that spatial localization in dendritic spines contributes unique capacities to the NF-B transcription factor in synaptic activity-dependent responses.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Extensive research has established a model in which the regulation of neuronal gene expression enables enduring forms of plasticity and learning. However, mechanisms imparting stimulus specificity to gene regulation, ensuring biologically appropriate responses, remain incompletely understood. NF-B is a potent transcription factor with evolutionarily conserved functions in learning and the growth of excitatory synaptic contacts. Neuronal NF-B is localized in both synapse and somatic compartments, but whether the synaptic pool of NF-B has discrete functions is unknown. This study reveals that NF-B enriched in dendritic spines (the postsynaptic sites of excitatory contacts) is selectively required for NF-B activation by synaptic stimulation and normal dendritic spine development. These results support spatial localization at synapses as a key variable mediating selective stimulus–response coupling.</p>

<p>Shank2 is an excitatory postsynaptic scaffolding protein implicated in synaptic regulation and psychiatric disorders including autism spectrum disorders. Conventional <i>Shank2</i>-mutant (<i>Shank2</i><sup>–/–</sup>) mice display several autistic-like behaviors, including social deficits, repetitive behaviors, hyperactivity, and anxiety-like behaviors. However, cell-type-specific contributions to these behaviors have remained largely unclear. Here, we deleted <i>Shank2</i> in specific cell types and found that male mice lacking Shank2 in excitatory neurons (<i>CaMKII-Cre;Shank2</i><sup>fl/fl</sup>) show social interaction deficits and mild social communication deficits, hyperactivity, and anxiety-like behaviors. In particular, male mice lacking Shank2 in GABAergic inhibitory neurons (<i>Viaat-Cre;Shank2</i><sup>fl/fl</sup>) display social communication deficits, repetitive self-grooming, and mild hyperactivity. These behavioral changes were associated with distinct changes in hippocampal and striatal synaptic transmission in the two mouse lines. These results indicate that cell-type-specific deletions of <i>Shank2</i> in mice lead to differential synaptic and behavioral abnormalities.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Shank2 is an abundant excitatory postsynaptic scaffolding protein implicated in the regulation of excitatory synapses and diverse psychiatric disorders including autism spectrum disorders. Previous studies have reported <i>in vivo</i> functions of Shank2 mainly using global <i>Shank2</i>-null mice, but it remains largely unclear how individual cell types contribute to Shank2-dependent regulation of neuronal synapses and behaviors. Here, we have characterized conditional <i>Shank2</i>-mutant mice carrying the <i>Shank2</i> deletion in excitatory and inhibitory neurons. These mouse lines display distinct alterations of synaptic transmission in the hippocampus and striatum that are associated with differential behavioral abnormalities in social, repetitive, locomotor, and anxiety-like domains.</p>

<p>An important question in behavioral neurobiology is how particular neuron populations and pathways mediate the overall roles of brain structures. Here we investigated this issue by studying the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), an established locus of inhibitory control of aggression. We established in male rats that dominantly distinct mPFC neuron populations project to and produce dense fiber networks with glutamate release sites in the mediobasal hypothalamus (MBH) and lateral hypothalamus (LH; i.e., two executory centers of species-specific and violent bites, respectively). Optogenetic stimulation of mPFC terminals in MBH distinctively increased bite counts in resident/intruder conflicts, whereas the stimulation of similar terminals in LH specifically resulted in violent bites. No other behaviors were affected by stimulations. These findings show that the mPFC controls aggressiveness by behaviorally dedicated neuron populations and pathways, the roles of which may be opposite to those observed in experiments where the role of the whole mPFC (or of its major parts) has been investigated. Overall, our findings suggest that the mPFC organizes into working units that fulfill specific aspects of its wide-ranging roles.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Aggression control is associated with many cognitive and emotional aspects processed by the prefrontal cortex (PFC). However, how the prefrontal cortex influences quantitative and qualitative aspects of aggressive behavior remains unclear. We demonstrated that dominantly distinct PFC neuron populations project to the mediobasal hypothalamus (MBH) and the lateral hypothalamus (LH; i.e., two executory centers of species-specific and violent bites, respectively). Stimulation of mPFC fibers in MBH distinctively increased bite counts during fighting, whereas stimulation of similar terminals in LH specifically resulted in violent bites. Overall, our results suggest a direct prefrontal control over the hypothalamus, which is involved in the modulation of quantitative and qualitative aspects of aggressive behavior through distinct prefrontohypothalamic projections.</p>

Abstract<p>The mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1 (mTORC1) is known to regulate cellular growth pathways, and its genetic activation is sufficient to enhance regenerative axon growth following injury to the central or peripheral nervous systems. However, excess mTORC1 activation may promote innervation defects, and mTORC1 activity mediates injury-induced hypersensitivity, reducing enthusiasm for the pathway as a therapeutic target. While mTORC1 activity is required for full expression of some pain modalities, the effects of pathway activation on nociceptor phenotypes and sensory behaviors are currently unknown. To address this, we genetically activated mTORC1 in mouse peripheral sensory neurons by conditional deletion of its negative regulator Tuberous sclerosis 2 (Tsc2). Consistent with the well-known role of mTORC1 in regulating cell size, soma size and axon diameter of C-nociceptors were increased in Tsc2-deleted mice. Glabrous skin and spinal cord innervation by C-fiber neurons were also disrupted. Transcriptional profiling of nociceptors enriched by fluorescence-associated cell sorting (FACS) revealed downregulation of multiple classes of ion channels as well as reduced expression of markers for peptidergic nociceptors in Tsc2-deleted mice. In addition to these changes in innervation and gene expression, Tsc2-deleted mice exhibited reduced noxious heat sensitivity and decreased injury-induced cold hypersensitivity, but normal baseline sensitivity to cold and mechanical stimuli. Together, these data show that excess mTORC1 activity in sensory neurons produces changes in gene expression, neuron morphology and sensory behavior.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> mTORC1 activation promotes regeneration of injured peripheral axons, however it may have a negative effect on target innervation as well as alter normal sensory function and injury-induced pain. Acute and chronic mTORC1 inhibition may have different effects on sensory behavior. For the mTORC1 pathway to be considered as a therapeutic target to promote nerve regeneration, it is necessary to gain an understanding of the effects of chronic pathway activation on nociceptors and sensory behavior. We show that constitutive mTORC1 activation in nociceptors via conditional deletion of its negative regulator Tsc2 results in anomalies in cell morphology and gene expression that may underlie the decrease in noxious heat sensitivity and the attenuated nerve injury-induced cold hypersensitivity observed in Tsc2-deleted mice.</p>

Abstract<p>Natural sound is composed of various frequencies. Although the core region of the primate auditory cortex has functionally defined sound frequency preference maps, how the map is organized in the auditory areas of the belt and parabelt regions is not well known. In this study, we investigated the functional organizations of the core, belt, and parabelt regions encompassed by the lateral sulcus and the superior temporal sulcus in the common marmoset (<i>Callithrix jacchus</i>). Using optical imaging of intrinsic signals, we obtained evoked responses to band-pass noise stimuli in a range of sound frequencies (0.5-16 kHz) in anesthetized adult animals and visualized the preferred sound frequency map on the cortical surface. We characterized the functionally defined organization using histologically defined brain areas in the same animals. We found tonotopic representation of a set of sound frequencies (low to high) within the primary (A1), rostral, and rostrotemporal areas of the core region. In the belt region, the tonotopic representation existed only in the mediolateral (ML) area. This representation was symmetric with that found in A1 along the border between areas A1 and ML. The functional structure was not very clear in the anterolateral area. Low frequencies were mainly preferred in the rostrotemplatal area, while high frequencies were preferred in the caudolateral area. There was a portion of the parabelt region that strongly responded to higher sound frequencies (&gt;5.8 kHz) along the border between the rostral and caudal parabelt regions.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> In this study, we examined functional organizations for sound frequency representation in the core, belt, and parabelt regions in the marmoset using optical intrinsic signal imaging. In addition to the auditory areas in the core region, the ML in the belt region continuously represented a range of frequencies from low to high, with tonotopic organization, which was symmetric to that in the A1 in the core region about the border between the A1 and ML. The posterior and anterior belt regions represented mainly low and high frequencies, respectively. The parabelt region contained a distinct region with preference for high frequencies. These results suggest that the functional organization unique to each auditory region would process sound information specific to this species.</p>

Abstract<p>Some rats are especially prone to attribute incentive salience to a cue (conditioned stimulus, CS) paired with food reward (sign-trackers, STs), but the extent they do so varies as a function of the form of the CS. Other rats respond primarily to the predictive value of a cue (goal-trackers, GTs), regardless of its form. Sign-tracking is associated with greater cue-induced activation of mesolimbic structures than goal-tracking; however, it is unclear how the form of the CS itself influences activity in neural systems involved in incentive salience attribution. Thus, our goal was to determine how different cue modalities affect neural activity in the ventral pallidum (VP), which is known to encode incentive salience attribution, as rats performed a two-CS Pavlovian conditioned approach task in which both a lever-CS and a tone-CS predicted identical food reward. The lever-CS elicited sign-tracking in some rats (STs) and goal-tracking in others (GTs); whereas the tone-CS elicited only goal-tracking in all rats. The lever-CS elicited robust changes in neural activity (sustained tonic increases or decreases in firing) throughout the VP in STs, relative to GTs. These changes were not seen when STs were exposed to the tone-CS, and in GTs there were no differences in firing between the lever-CS and tone-CS. We conclude that neural activity throughout the VP encodes incentive signals, and is especially responsive when a cue is of a form that promotes the attribution of incentive salience to it, especially in predisposed individuals.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> The incentive-motivational value of reward-paired cues varies as a function of the individual and the form of the cue itself. Here we examined whether neural activity in a brain region important for processing reward cues, the ventral pallidum (VP), reflected variation in the incentive-motivational value of a food cue, both between individuals and between different cue types (a tone versus a manipulable lever). Neural responses were greatest in individuals that attached incentive salience to a cue, and within individuals the VP dynamically tracked changes in the motivation evoked by the different cue types. This suggests that the VP plays an important role in the encoding of the emotional/motivational states that enable cues to gain control over motivated behavior.</p>

<p>While it is relatively easy to imitate and evolve natural swarm behavior in
simulations, less is known about the social characteristics of simulated,
evolved swarms, such as the optimal (evolutionary) group size, why individuals
in a swarm perform certain actions, and how behavior would change in swarms of
different sizes. To address these questions, we used a genetic algorithm to
evolve animats equipped with Markov Brains in a spatial navigation task that
facilitates swarm behavior. The animats' goal was to frequently cross between
two rooms without colliding with other animats. Animats were evolved in swarms
of various sizes. We then evaluated the task performance and social behavior of
the final generation from each evolution when placed with swarms of different
sizes in order to evaluate their generalizability across conditions. According
to our experiments, we find that swarm size during evolution matters: animats

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.08713">A Theoretical Limit to Physicalism: A Non-Technical Explanation of the Gemini Theorem. (arXiv:1804.08713v1 [q-bio.NC])</a></h4>

<p>The Gemini theorem asserts that, given certain reasonable assumptions, no
physical system can be certainly aware of its own existence. The theorem can be
proved algorithmically, but the proof of this theorem is somewhat obscure, and
there exists very little literature on it. The purpose of this article is to
provide a brief non-technical summary of the theorem and its proof, with a view
to stimulating critical discussion of the proof and its implications. Since the
theorem implies that a violation of the conservation of energy will take place
within the brains of conscious human beings, it has obvious implications for
any physical theory.

Abstract<p>Human observers automatically extract temporal contingencies from the environment and predict the onset of future events. Temporal predictions are modelled by the hazard function, which describes the instantaneous probability for an event to occur given it has not occurred yet. Here, we tackle the question of whether and how the human brain tracks continuous temporal hazard on a moment-to-moment basis, and how flexibly it adjusts to strictly implicit variations in the hazard function. We applied an encoding-model approach to human electroencephalographic (EEG) data recorded during a pitch-discrimination task, in which we implicitly manipulated temporal predictability of the target tones by varying the interval between cue and target tone (the foreperiod). Critically, temporal predictability was either solely driven by the passage of time (resulting in a monotonic hazard function), or was modulated to increase at intermediate foreperiods (resulting in a modulated hazard function with a peak at the intermediate foreperiod). Forward encoding models trained to predict the recorded EEG signal from different temporal hazard functions were able to distinguish between experimental conditions, showing that implicit variations of temporal hazard bear tractable signatures in the human electroencephalogram. Notably, this tracking signal was reconstructed best from the supplementary motor area (SMA), underlining this area’s link to cognitive processing of time. Our results underline the relevance of temporal hazard to cognitive processing, and show that the predictive accuracy of the encoding-model approach can be utilised to track abstract time-resolved stimuli.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Extracting temporal predictions from sensory input allows to process future input more efficiently and to prepare responses in time. In mathematical terms, temporal predictions can be described by the hazard function, modeling the probability of an event to occur over time. Here, we show that the human EEG tracks temporal hazard in an implicit foreperiod paradigm. Forward encoding models trained to predict the recorded EEG signal from different temporal-hazard functions were able to distinguish between experimental conditions that differed in their build-up of hazard over time. These neural signatures of tracking temporal hazard converge with the extant literature on temporal processing and provide new evidence that the supplementary motor area tracks hazard under strictly implicit timing conditions.</p>

<p>In response priming tasks, speeded responses are performed toward target
stimuli preceded by prime stimuli. Responses are slower and error rates are
higher when prime and target are assigned to different responses, compared to
assignment to the same response, and those priming effects increase with
prime-target SOA. Here, we generalize Vorberg et al.'s (2003) accumulator model
of response priming, where response activation is first controlled exclusively
by the prime and then taken over by the actual target. Priming thus occurs by
motor conflict because a response-inconsistent prime can temporarily drive the
process towards the incorrect response. While the original model assumed prime
and target signals to be identical in strength, we allow different rates of
response activation (cf. Mattler &amp; Palmer, 2012; Schubert et al., 2012). Our
model predicts that stronger primes mainly increase priming effects in response
times and error rates, whereas stronger targets mainly diminish response times
and priming effects.

<p>The paper titled `Intentional Observer Effects on Quantum Randomness: A
Bayesian Analysis Reveals Evidence Against Micro-Psychokinesis', published in
Frontiers of Psychology in March 2018, reports on a mind-matter experiment with
the main result of strong evidence against Micro-Psychokinesis. Despite this
conclusion, the authors interpret the observed pattern in their data as
possible evidence for Micro-Psychokinesis, albeit of a different kind.
Suggesting a connection to some existing models, the authors put forward the
hypothesis that a higher frequency of slow data variations can be observed in
their experiment data than in a set of control data. This commentary analyses
this claim and concludes that the variation in the data motivating this
hypothesis would show up just by chance with a probability of p=0.328 under a
null hypothesis. Therefore, there is no evidence for the hypothesis of faster
data variations, and thus for this kind of suggested Micro-Psychokinesis in
this experiment.

<p>Large bundles of myelinated axons, called white matter, anatomically connect
disparate brain regions together and compose the structural core of the human
connectome. We recently proposed a method of measuring the local integrity
along the length of each white matter fascicle, termed the local connectome. If
communication efficiency is fundamentally constrained by the integrity along
the entire length of a white matter bundle, then variability in the functional
dynamics of brain networks should be associated with variability in the local
connectome. We test this prediction using two statistical approaches that are
capable of handling the high dimensionality of data. First, by performing
statistical inference on distance-based correlations, we show that similarity
in the local connectome between individuals is significantly correlated with
similarity in their patterns of functional connectivity. Second, by employing
variable selection using sparse canonical correlation analysis and
cross-validation, we show that segments of the local connectome are predictive
of certain patterns of functional brain dynamics. These results are consistent
with the hypothesis that structural variability along axon bundles constrains
communication between disparate brain regions.

<p>Electrophysiological recordings of spiking activity are limited to a small
number of neurons. This spatial subsampling has hindered characterizing even
most basic properties of collective spiking in cortical networks. In
particular, two contradictory hypotheses prevailed for over a decade: the first
proposed an asynchronous irregular state, the second a critical state. While
distinguishing them is straightforward in models, we show that in experiments
classical approaches fail to correctly infer network dynamics because of
subsampling. Deploying a novel, subsampling-invariant estimator, we find that
in vivo dynamics do not comply with either hypothesis, but instead occupy a
narrow "reverberating" state consistently across multiple mammalian species and
cortical areas. A generic model tuned to this reverberating state predicts
single neuron, pairwise, and population properties. With these predictions we
first validate the model and then deduce network properties that are
challenging to obtain experimentally, like the network timescale and strength
of cortical input.

<p>Currently existing neural network models lack an important computational
capability of networks of neurons in the brain: the capability to reason on an
abstract level, and to structure information according to abstract categories.
While hardly anything is known about the processes underlying these
capabilities in the human brain, experimental evidence for the organization of
an important prerequisite for abstract reasoning has recently been found: for
assigning words to thematic roles, such as subject or object. Such data from
fMRI recordings indicate that assemblies in subregions of temporal cortex which
encode thematic roles are shaped by concepts that are assigned to that role. We
propose a model for the assignment of thematic content to variables that is
consistent with these data and provides new functions to neural network
computations. We provide a proof of principle that this model can be
implemented even in networks of spiking neurons. It enables structured
information retrieval and copying of information without routing, and provides
a basis for the emulation of more demanding cognitive computations in networks
of spiking neurons.

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Deficits in sensory processing in Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) implicate dysfunction in the somatosensory cortex. However, the effects of prenatal ethanol exposure on the development of this region await elucidation. Here, we used an established mouse model of FASD with binge-type ethanol exposure from embryonic day 13.5–16.5 to investigate the effects of prenatal ethanol exposure on pyramidal neurons in the somatosensory cortex. Specifically, we focused on the radial migration of primordial pyramidal neurons during embryonic corticogenesis and their morphology and function during active synaptogenesis in early postnatal development. We found that prenatal ethanol exposure resulted in aberrant radial migration, particularly affecting the populations of postmitotic pyramidal neurons. In addition, there was an enduring effect of prenatal ethanol exposure on glutamate-mediated synaptic transmission in layer V/VI pyramidal neurons. This persisted beyond a transient decrease in pyramidal neuron dendritic complexity that was evident only during early postnatal development. Adolescent mice exposed prenatally to ethanol also displayed decreased tactile sensitivity, as revealed by a modified adhesive tape removal assay.

<p>by Guillaume Drion, Julie Dethier, Alessio Franci, Rodolphe Sepulchre</p>

Neuronal information processing is regulated by fast and localized fluctuations of brain states. Brain states reliably switch between distinct spatiotemporal signatures at a network scale even though they are composed of heterogeneous and variable rhythms at a cellular scale. We investigated the mechanisms of this network control in a conductance-based population model that reliably switches between active and oscillatory mean-fields. Robust control of the mean-field properties relies critically on a switchable negative intrinsic conductance at the cellular level. This conductance endows circuits with a shared cellular positive feedback that can switch population rhythms on and off at a cellular resolution. The switch is largely independent from other intrinsic neuronal properties, network size and synaptic connectivity. It is therefore compatible with the temporal variability and spatial heterogeneity induced by slower regulatory functions such as neuromodulation, synaptic plasticity and homeostasis. Strikingly, the required cellular mechanism is available in all cell types that possess T-type calcium channels but unavailable in computational models that neglect the slow kinetics of their activation.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/12Pj_Yzaong" width="1" />

We present a new modeling and computational tool that computes rigorous summaries of network dynamics over large sets of parameter values. These summaries, organized in a database, can be searched for observed dynamics, e.g., bistability and hysteresis, to discover parameter regimes over which they are supported. We illustrate our approach on several networks underlying the restriction point of the cell cycle in humans and yeast. We rank networks by how robustly they support hysteresis, which is the observed phenotype. We find that the best 6-node human network and the yeast network share similar topology and robustness of hysteresis, in spite of having no homology between the corresponding nodes of the network. Our approach provides a new tool linking network structure and dynamics.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/StTE5SEaAR8" width="1" />

<p>by William Marshall, Larissa Albantakis, Giulio Tononi</p>

Reductionism assumes that causation in the physical world occurs at the micro level, excluding the emergence of macro-level causation. We challenge this reductionist assumption by employing a principled, well-defined measure of intrinsic cause-effect power–integrated information (Φ), and showing that, according to this measure, it is possible for a macro level to “beat” the micro level. Simple systems were evaluated for Φ across different spatial and temporal scales by systematically considering all possible <i>black boxes</i>. These are macro elements that consist of one or more micro elements over one or more micro updates. Cause-effect power was evaluated based on the inputs and outputs of the black boxes, ignoring the internal micro elements that support their input-output function. We show how black-box elements can have more common inputs and outputs than the corresponding micro elements, revealing the emergence of high-order mechanisms and joint constraints that are not apparent at the micro level. As a consequence, a macro, black-box system can have higher Φ than its micro constituents by having more mechanisms (higher composition) that are more interconnected (higher integration). We also show that, for a given micro system, one can identify local maxima of Φ across several spatiotemporal scales. The framework is demonstrated on a simple biological system, the Boolean network model of the fission-yeast cell-cycle, for which we identify stable local maxima during the course of its simulated biological function. These local maxima correspond to macro levels of organization at which emergent cause-effect properties of physical systems come into focus, and provide a natural vantage point for scientific inquiries.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/nmwWC-o9ix4" width="1" />

<p>by Michael F. Bonner, Russell A. Epstein</p>

Biologically inspired deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs), trained for computer vision tasks, have been found to predict cortical responses with remarkable accuracy. However, the internal operations of these models remain poorly understood, and the factors that account for their success are unknown. Here we develop a set of techniques for using CNNs to gain insights into the computational mechanisms underlying cortical responses. We focused on responses in the occipital place area (OPA), a scene-selective region of dorsal occipitoparietal cortex. In a previous study, we showed that fMRI activation patterns in the OPA contain information about the navigational affordances of scenes; that is, information about where one can and cannot move within the immediate environment. We hypothesized that this affordance information could be extracted using a set of purely feedforward computations. To test this idea, we examined a deep CNN with a feedforward architecture that had been previously trained for scene classification. We found that responses in the CNN to scene images were highly predictive of fMRI responses in the OPA. Moreover the CNN accounted for the portion of OPA variance relating to the navigational affordances of scenes. The CNN could thus serve as an image-computable candidate model of affordance-related responses in the OPA. We then ran a series of <i>in silico</i> experiments on this model to gain insights into its internal operations. These analyses showed that the computation of affordance-related features relied heavily on visual information at high-spatial frequencies and cardinal orientations, both of which have previously been identified as low-level stimulus preferences of scene-selective visual cortex. These computations also exhibited a strong preference for information in the lower visual field, which is consistent with known retinotopic biases in the OPA. Visualizations of feature selectivity within the CNN suggested that affordance-based responses encoded features that define the layout of the spatial environment, such as boundary-defining junctions and large extended surfaces. Together, these results map the sensory functions of the OPA onto a fully quantitative model that provides insights into its visual computations. More broadly, they advance integrative techniques for understanding visual cortex across multiple level of analysis: from the identification of cortical sensory functions to the modeling of their underlying algorithms.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/XJmM-iMvR90" width="1" />

<p>by Sean M. Gibbons, Claire Duvallet, Eric J. Alm</p>

High-throughput data generation platforms, like mass-spectrometry, microarrays, and second-generation sequencing are susceptible to batch effects due to run-to-run variation in reagents, equipment, protocols, or personnel. Currently, batch correction methods are not commonly applied to microbiome sequencing datasets. In this paper, we compare different batch-correction methods applied to microbiome case-control studies. We introduce a model-free normalization procedure where features (i.e. bacterial taxa) in case samples are converted to percentiles of the equivalent features in control samples within a study prior to pooling data across studies. We look at how this percentile-normalization method compares to traditional meta-analysis methods for combining independent p-values and to limma and ComBat, widely used batch-correction models developed for RNA microarray data. Overall, we show that percentile-normalization is a simple, non-parametric approach for correcting batch effects and improving sensitivity in case-control meta-analyses.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Wj8NDMeglcg" width="1" />

Transposable elements (TEs) are repetitive nucleotide sequences that make up a large portion of eukaryotic genomes. They can move and duplicate within a genome, increasing genome size and contributing to genetic diversity within and across species. Accurate identification and classification of TEs present in a genome is an important step towards understanding their effects on genes and their role in genome evolution. We introduce TE-Learner, a framework based on machine learning that automatically identifies TEs in a given genome and assigns a classification to them. We present an implementation of our framework towards LTR retrotransposons, a particular type of TEs characterized by having long terminal repeats (LTRs) at their boundaries. We evaluate the predictive performance of our framework on the well-annotated genomes of <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> and <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> and we compare our results for three LTR retrotransposon superfamilies with the results of three widely used methods for TE identification or classification: RepeatMasker, Censor and LtrDigest. In contrast to these methods, TE-Learner is the first to incorporate machine learning techniques, outperforming these methods in terms of predictive performance, while able to learn models and make predictions efficiently. Moreover, we show that our method was able to identify TEs that none of the above method could find, and we investigated TE-Learner’s predictions which did not correspond to an official annotation. It turns out that many of these predictions are in fact strongly homologous to a known TE.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/WmOp0oT-h9c" width="1" />

<p>by Sneha Mitra, Anushua Biswas, Leelavati Narlikar</p>

Genome-wide in vivo protein-DNA interactions are routinely mapped using high-throughput chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP). ChIP-reported regions are typically investigated for enriched sequence-motifs, which are likely to model the DNA-binding specificity of the profiled protein and/or of co-occurring proteins. However, simple enrichment analyses can miss insights into the binding-activity of the protein. Note that ChIP reports regions making direct contact with the protein as well as those binding through intermediaries. For example, consider a ChIP experiment targeting protein X, which binds DNA at its cognate sites, but simultaneously interacts with four other proteins. Each of these proteins also binds to its own specific cognate sites along distant parts of the genome, a scenario consistent with the current view of transcriptional hubs and chromatin loops. Since ChIP will pull down all X-associated regions, the final reported data will be a union of five distinct sets of regions, each containing binding sites of one of the five proteins, respectively. Characterizing all five different motifs <i>and</i> the corresponding sets is important to interpret the ChIP experiment and ultimately, the role of X in regulation. We present diversity which attempts exactly this: it partitions the data so that each partition can be characterized with its own de novo motif. Diversity uses a Bayesian approach to identify the optimal number of motifs and the associated partitions, which <i>together</i> explain the entire dataset. This is in contrast to standard motif finders, which report motifs <i>individually</i> enriched in the data, but do not necessarily explain all reported regions. We show that the different motifs and associated regions identified by diversity give insights into the various complexes that may be forming along the chromatin, something that has so far not been attempted from ChIP data.

Abstract<p>Salt intake is an essential dietary requirement, but excessive consumption is implicated in hypertension and associated conditions. Little is known about the neural circuit mechanisms that control motivation to consume salt, although the midbrain dopamine system, which plays a key role in other reward-related behaviours, has been implicated. We, therefore, examined the effects on salt consumption of either optogenetic excitation or chemogenetic inhibition of ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine neurons in male mice. Strikingly, optogenetic excitation of dopamine neurons decreased salt intake in a rapid and reversible manner, despite a strong salt appetite. Importantly, optogenetic excitation was not aversive, did not induce hyperactivity, and did not alter salt concentration preferences in a need-free state. In addition, we found that chemogenetic inhibition of dopamine neurons had no effect on salt intake. Lastly, optogenetic excitation of dopamine neurons reduced consumption of sucrose following an overnight fast, suggesting a more general role of VTA dopamine neuron excitation in organising motivated behaviors.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Although it is well-established that midbrain dopamine neurons are involved in many types of reward-related behaviours, little is known about their role in salt intake under conditions where salt is appetitive (i.e. during salt depletion). Here, we show that optogenetic excitation of midbrain dopamine neurons can decrease salt intake. Importantly, this stimulation protocol did not affect salt concentration preferences. Furthermore, we find that this stimulation protocol can also reduce sucrose intake following an overnight fast, suggesting a broader role for dopamine neuron activity in regulating nutrient intake, which compliments findings from previous lesion- and pharmacological-based studies.</p>

Abstract<p>Specialized brain structures encode spatial locations and movements, yet there is growing evidence that this information is also represented in the rodent medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Disambiguating such information from the encoding of other types of task-relevant information has proven challenging. In order to determine the extent to which movement and location information is relevant to mPFC neurons, tetrodes were used to record neuronal activity while limb positions, poses (i.e. recurring constellations of limb positions), velocity and spatial locations were simultaneously recorded with two cameras every 200ms as rats freely roamed in an experimental enclosure. Regression analyses using Generalized Linear Models revealed that over half of the individual mPFC neurons were significantly responsive to at least one of the factors and many were responsive to more than one. On the other hand, each factor accounted for only a very small portion of the total spike count variance of any given neuron (&lt;20% and typically &lt;1%). Machine learning methods were used to analyze ensemble activity and revealed that ensembles were usually superior to the sum of the best neurons in encoding movements and spatial locations. Since movement and location encoding by individual neurons was so weak, it may not be such a concern for single neuron analyses. Yet because these weak signals were so widely distributed across the population, this information was strongly represented at the ensemble level and should be considered in population analyses.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> It is often difficult to determine exactly what is driving changes in the activity of single mPFC neurons. Basic things such as movements or spatial locations can activate these neurons and interfere with the ability to extract high-order task-related correlates. Here we applied a series of powerful techniques to carefully quantify the relationship between a rat’s movements and the activity of mPFC neurons. Overall the firing related to limb movements, poses and spatial locations had little impact on individual neurons, yet this widely distributed information became prominent at the ensemble level. A framework where neurons participate to varying degrees in encoding all events has certain advantages that could prove useful for higher-order cognitive processing and in guiding artificial intelligence approaches.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.07609">The Effect of Signaling Latencies and Node Refractory States on the Dynamics of Networks. (arXiv:1804.07609v1 [q-bio.NC])</a></h4>

<p>We describe the construction and theoretical analysis of a framework derived
from canonical neurophysiological principles that model the competing dynamics
of incident signals into nodes along directed edges in a network. The framework
describes the dynamics between the offset in the latencies of propagating
signals, which reflect the geometry of the edges and conduction velocities, and
the internal refractory dynamics and processing times of the downstream node
receiving the signals. This framework naturally extends to the construction of
a perceptron model that takes into account such dynamic geometric
considerations. We first describe the model in detail, culminating with the
model of a geometric dynamic perceptron. We then derive upper and lower bounds
for a notion of optimal efficient signaling between vertex pairs based on the
structure of the framework.

Advances in gene discovery for neurodevelopmental disorders have identified SCN2A dysfunction as a leading cause of infantile seizures, autism spectrum disorder, and intellectual disability. SCN2A encodes the neuronal sodium channel NaV1.2. Functional assays demonstrate strong correlation between genotype and phenotype. This insight can help guide therapeutic decisions and raises the possibility that ligands that selectively enhance or diminish channel function may improve symptoms. The well-defined function of sodium channels makes SCN2A an important test case for investigating the neurobiology of neurodevelopmental disorders more generally.

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>A single transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) session applied over the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLFPC) can be associated with procognitive effects. Furthermore, repeated DLPFC tDCS sessions are under investigation as a new therapeutic tool for a range of neuropsychiatric conditions. A possible mechanism explaining such beneficial effects is a modulation of meso-cortico-limbic dopamine transmission. We explored the spatial and temporal neurobiological effects of bifrontal tDCS on subcortical dopamine transmission during and immediately after the stimulation. In a double blind sham-controlled study, 32 healthy subjects randomly received a single session of either active (20 min, 2 mA; <span style="font-style: italic;">n</span> = 14) or sham (<span style="font-style: italic;">n</span> = 18) tDCS during a dynamic positron emission tomography scan using [<sup>11</sup>C]raclopride binding. During the stimulation period, no significant effect of tDCS was observed. After the stimulation period, compared with sham tDCS, active tDCS induced a significant decrease in [<sup>11</sup>C]raclopride binding potential ratio in the striatum, suggesting an increase in extracellular dopamine in a part of the striatum involved in the reward–motivation network. The present study provides the first evidence that bifrontal tDCS induces neurotransmitter release in polysynaptic connected subcortical areas. Therefore, levels of dopamine activity and reactivity should be a new element to consider for a general hypothesis of brain modulation by bifrontal tDCS.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Prematurity is associated with diverse developmental abnormalities, yet few studies relate cognitive and neurostructural deficits to a dimensional measure of prematurity. Leveraging a large sample of children, adolescents, and young adults (age 8–22 years) studied as part of the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort, we examined how variation in gestational age impacted cognition and brain structure later in development. Participants included 72 preterm youth born before 37 weeks’ gestation and 206 youth who were born at term (37 weeks or later). Using a previously-validated factor analysis, cognitive performance was assessed in three domains: (1) executive function and complex reasoning, (2) social cognition, and (3) episodic memory. All participants completed T1-weighted neuroimaging at 3 T to measure brain volume. Structural covariance networks were delineated using non-negative matrix factorization, an advanced multivariate analysis technique. Lower gestational age was associated with both deficits in executive function and reduced volume within 11 of 26 structural covariance networks, which included orbitofrontal, temporal, and parietal cortices as well as subcortical regions including the hippocampus. Notably, the relationship between lower gestational age and executive dysfunction was accounted for in part by structural network deficits. Together, these findings emphasize the durable impact of prematurity on cognition and brain structure, which persists across development.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Neurogenesis in the healthy adult murine brain is based on proliferation and integration of stem/progenitor cells and is thought to be restricted to 2 neurogenic niches: the subventricular zone and the dentate gyrus. Intriguingly, cells expressing the immature neuronal marker doublecortin (DCX) and the polysialylated-neural cell adhesion molecule reside in layer II of the piriform cortex. Apparently, these cells progressively disappear along the course of ageing, while their fate and function remain unclear. Using DCX-CreER<sup>T2</sup>/Flox-EGFP transgenic mice, we demonstrate that these immature neurons located in the murine piriform cortex do not vanish in the course of aging, but progressively resume their maturation into glutamatergic (TBR1<sup>+</sup>, CaMKII<sup>+</sup>) neurons. We provide evidence for a putative functional integration of these newly differentiated neurons as indicated by the increase in perisomatic puncta expressing synaptic markers, the development of complex apical dendrites decorated with numerous spines and the appearance of an axonal initial segment. Since immature neurons found in layer II of the piriform cortex are generated prenatally and devoid of proliferative capacity in the postnatal cortex, the gradual maturation and integration of these cells outside of the canonical neurogenic niches implies that they represent a valuable, but nonrenewable reservoir for cortical plasticity.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The default mode network (DMN) is considered a unified core brain function for generating subjective mental experiences, such as mind wandering. We propose a novel cognitive framework for understanding the unity of the DMN from the perspective of hemispheric asymmetry. Using transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), effective connectivity estimation, and machine learning, we show that the bilateral angular gyri (AG), which are core regions of the DMN, exhibit heterogeneity in both inherent network organization and mind wandering regulation. Inherent heterogeneities are present between the right and left AG regarding not only effective connectivity, but also mind wandering regulation; the right AG is related to mind-wandering reduction, whereas the left AG is related to mind-wandering generation. Further supporting this observation, we found that only anodal tDCS of the right AG induced machine learning-detectable changes in effective connectivity and regional amplitude, which could possibly be linked to reduced mind wandering. Our findings highlight the importance of hemispheric asymmetry to further understand the function of the DMN and contribute to the emerging neural model of mind wandering, which is necessary to understand the nature of the human mind.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Cracking brain's neural code is of general interest. In contrast to the traditional view that enormous spike variability in resting states and stimulus-triggered responses reflects noise, here, we examine the “Neural Self-Information Theory” that the interspike-interval (ISI), or the silence-duration between 2 adjoining spikes, carries self-information that is inversely proportional to its variability-probability. Specifically, higher-probability ISIs convey minimal information because they reflect the ground state, whereas lower-probability ISIs carry more information, in the form of “positive” or “negative surprisals,” signifying the excitatory or inhibitory shifts from the ground state, respectively. These surprisals serve as the quanta of information to construct temporally coordinated cell-assembly ternary codes representing real-time cognitions. Accordingly, we devised a general decoding method and unbiasedly uncovered 15 cell assemblies underlying different sleep cycles, fear-memory experiences, spatial navigation, and 5-choice serial-reaction time (5CSRT) visual-discrimination behaviors. We further revealed that robust cell-assembly codes were generated by ISI surprisals constituted of ~20% of the skewed ISI gamma-distribution tails, conforming to the “Pareto Principle” that specifies, for many events—including communication—roughly 80% of the output or consequences come from 20% of the input or causes. These results demonstrate that real-time neural coding arises from the temporal assembly of neural-clique members via silence variability-based self-information codes.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The mammalian cerebral neocortex has a unique structure, composed of layers of different neuron types, interconnected in a stereotyped fashion. While the overall developmental program seems to be conserved, there are divergent developmental factors generating cortical diversity amongst species. In terms of cortical neuronal numbers, some of the determining factors are the size of the founder population, the duration of cortical neurogenesis, the proportion of different progenitor types, and the fine-tuned balance between self-renewing and differentiative divisions. We develop a mathematical model of neurogenesis that, accounting for these factors, aims at explaining the high diversity in neuronal numbers found across species. By framing our hypotheses in rigorous mathematical terms, we are able to identify paths of neurogenesis that match experimentally observed patterns in mouse, macaque and human. Additionally, we use our model to identify key parameters that would particularly benefit from accurate experimental investigation. We find that the timing of a switch in favor of symmetric neurogenic divisions produces the highest variation in cortical neuronal numbers. Surprisingly, assuming similar cell cycle lengths in primate progenitors, the increase in cortical neuronal numbers does not reflect a larger size of founder population, a prediction that has identified a specific need for experimental quantifications.</span>

In this study, diffusion tractography was used to demonstrate an interaction between hand preference and the asymmetry of frontoparietal tracts, specifically the dorsal branch of the superior longitudinal fasciculus, responsible for visuospatial integration and motor planning. This is in contrast to the corticospinal tract and the superior cerebellar peduncle, for which asymmetry was not related to hand preference. Asymmetry of the dorsal frontoparietal tract was also highly correlated with the degree of lateralization in tasks requiring visuospatial integration and fine motor control. These results suggest a common anatomical substrate for hand preference and lateralized manual specialization in frontoparietal tracts important for visuomotor processing.</span>

Mounting evidence suggests that glycans, rather than merely serving as a “shield”, contribute critically to antigenicity of the HIV envelope (Env) glycoprotein, representing critical antigenic determinants for many broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs). While many studies have focused on defining the role of individual glycans or groups of proximal glycans in bNAb binding, little is known about the effects of changes in the overall glycan landscape in modulating antibody access and Env antigenicity. Here we developed a systems glycobiology approach to reverse engineer the complexity of HIV glycan heterogeneity to guide antigenicity-based <i>de novo</i> glycoprotein design. bNAb binding was assessed against a panel of 94 recombinant gp120 monomers exhibiting defined glycan site occupancies. Using a Bayesian machine learning algorithm, bNAb-specific glycan footprints were identified and used to design antigens that selectively alter bNAb antigenicity as a proof-of concept. Our approach provides a new design strategy to predictively modulate antigenicity via the alteration of glycan topography, thereby focusing the humoral immune response on sites of viral vulnerability for HIV.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/XbpST9Ne8uU" width="1" />

<p>by Reuben M. Buckley, R. Daniel Kortschak, David L. Adelson</p>

The forces driving the accumulation and removal of non-coding DNA and ultimately the evolution of genome size in complex organisms are intimately linked to genome structure and organisation. Our analysis provides a novel method for capturing the regional variation of lineage-specific DNA gain and loss events in their respective genomic contexts. To further understand this connection we used comparative genomics to identify genome-wide individual DNA gain and loss events in the human and mouse genomes. Focusing on the distribution of DNA gains and losses, relationships to important structural features and potential impact on biological processes, we found that in autosomes, DNA gains and losses both followed separate lineage-specific accumulation patterns. However, in both species chromosome X was particularly enriched for DNA gain, consistent with its high L1 retrotransposon content required for X inactivation. We found that DNA loss was associated with gene-rich open chromatin regions and DNA gain events with gene-poor closed chromatin regions. Additionally, we found that DNA loss events tended to be smaller than DNA gain events suggesting that they were able to accumulate in gene-rich open chromatin regions due to their reduced capacity to interrupt gene regulatory architecture. GO term enrichment showed that mouse loss hotspots were strongly enriched for terms related to developmental processes. However, these genes were also located in regions with a high density of conserved elements, suggesting that despite high levels of DNA loss, gene regulatory architecture remained conserved. This is consistent with a model in which DNA gain and loss results in turnover or “churning” in regulatory element dense regions of open chromatin, where interruption of regulatory elements is selected against.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/H1rMm4y09CQ" width="1" />

Abstract<p>wHypofunction of <i>N</i>-methyl-d-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) in inhibitory GABAergic interneurons is implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia (SZ), a heritable disorder with many susceptibility genes. However, it is still unclear how SZ risk genes interfere with NMDAR-mediated synaptic transmission in diverse inhibitory interneuron populations. One putative risk gene is neuregulin 1 (NRG1), which signals via the receptor tyrosine kinase ErbB4, itself a schizophrenia risk gene. The type-I isoform of <i>NRG1</i> shows increased expression in the brain of SZ patients, and ErbB4 is enriched in GABAergic interneurons expressing parvalbumin (PV+) or cholecystokinin (CCK+). Here, we investigated ErbB4 expression and synaptic transmission in interneuronal populations of the hippocampus of transgenic mice over-expressing NRG1 type-I (NRG1<sup>tg-type-I</sup> mice). Immunohistochemical analyses confirmed that ErbB4 was co-expressed with either PV or CCK in hippocampal interneurons, but we observed a reduced number of ErbB4-immunopositive interneurons in the NRG1<sup>tg-type-I</sup> mice. NMDAR-mediated currents in interneurons expressing PV (including PV+ basket cells) or CCK were reduced in NRG1<sup>tg-type-I</sup> mice compared to their littermate controls. We found no difference in AMPA receptor-mediated currents. Optogenetic activation (5 pulses at 20 Hz) of local glutamatergic fibers revealed a decreased NMDAR-mediated contribution to disynaptic GABAergic inhibition of pyramidal cells in the NRG1<sup>tg-type-I</sup> mice. GABAergic synaptic transmission from either PV+ or CCK+ interneurons, and glutamatergic transmission onto pyramidal cells, did not significantly differ between genotypes. The results indicate that synaptic NMDAR-mediated signaling in hippocampal interneurons is sensitive to chronically elevated NGR1 type-I levels. This may contribute to the pathophysiological consequences of increased <i>NRG1</i> expression in SZ.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Hypofunction of NMDA receptors in inhibitory GABAergic interneurons is implicated in pathophysiology of schizophrenia (SZ), but it is largely unknown how SZ risk genes interfere with NMDAR-mediated signaling in specific interneurons. We investigated synaptic transmission in hippocampus of mice over-expressing the type-I isoform of the putative SZ risk gene, NRG1, and found markedly reduced NMDAR-mediated synaptic responses in GABAergic interneuron types labeled for PV or CCK which are known to express the NRG1 receptor ErbB4. The NMDAR hypofunction changed synaptic excitatory drive of interneurons during hippocampal network activity. The observed reductions of NMDAR-mediated transmission in these interneurons may contribute to the hippocampal dysfunction observed with increased NGR1 type-I expression, and may provide a link to the genetic predisposition to SZ.</p>

Abstract<p>Juvenile Batten disease is the most common progressive neurodegenerative disorder of childhood. It is associated with mutations in the <i>CLN3</i> gene, causing loss of function of CLN3 protein and degeneration of cerebellar and retinal neurons. It has been proposed that changes in granule cell AMPA-type glutamate receptors (AMPARs) contribute to the cerebellar dysfunction. In this study we compared AMPAR properties and synaptic transmission in cerebellar granule cells from wild-type and <i>Cln3</i> knockout mice. In <i>Cln3</i><sup><i>ex1–6</i></sup> cells the amplitude of AMPA-evoked whole-cell currents was unchanged. Similarly, we found no change in the amplitude, kinetics, or rectification of synaptic currents evoked by individual quanta, or in their underlying single-channel conductance. We found no change in cerebellar expression of GluA2 or GluA4 protein. By contrast, we observed a reduced number of quantal events following mossy-fiber stimulation in Sr<sup>2+</sup>, altered short-term plasticity in conditions of reduced extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, and reduced mossy fiber vesicle number. Thus, while our results suggest early presynaptic changes in the <i>Cln3</i><sup><i>ex1–6</i></sup> mouse model of juvenile Batten disease, they reveal no evidence for altered postsynaptic AMPARs.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Juvenile Batten disease is an inherited lysosomal storage disorder that affects children and leads to premature death.

Parental care is a key evolutionary innovation that influences the fitness of parents and offspring. How the brain coordinates such a complex behavior remains poorly understood. Kohl and colleagues recently uncovered the organizational principles of hypothalamic galanin neurons and their connections in mice. Their findings revealed a striking picture in which discrete neuronal pools control distinct aspects of parental behavior.

Intracellular recording allows measurement and perturbation of the membrane potential of identified neurons with sub-millisecond and sub-millivolt precision. This gives intracellular recordings a unique capacity to provide rich information about individual cells (e.g., high-resolution characterization of inputs, outputs, excitability, and structure). Hence, such recordings can elucidate the mechanisms that underlie fundamental phenomena, such as brain state, sparse coding, gating, gain modulation, and learning.

State-of-the-art light-sheet and confocal microscopes allow recording of entire embryos in 3D and over time (3D+t) for many hours. Fluorescently labeled structures can be segmented and tracked automatically in these terabyte-scale 3D+t images, resulting in thousands of cell migration trajectories that provide detailed insights to large-scale tissue reorganization at the cellular level. Here we present EmbryoMiner, a new interactive open-source framework suitable for in-depth analyses and comparisons of entire embryos, including an extensive set of trajectory features. Starting at the whole-embryo level, the framework can be used to iteratively focus on a region of interest within the embryo, to investigate and test specific trajectory-based hypotheses and to extract quantitative features from the isolated trajectories. Thus, the new framework provides a valuable new way to quantitatively compare corresponding anatomical regions in different embryos that were manually selected based on biological prior knowledge. As a proof of concept, we analyzed 3D+t light-sheet microscopy images of zebrafish embryos, showcasing potential user applications that can be performed using the new framework.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/fPwmNSZz3xw" width="1" />

<p>by Nicholas T. Franklin, Michael J. Frank</p>

Humans are remarkably adept at generalizing knowledge between experiences in a way that can be difficult for computers. Often, this entails generalizing constituent pieces of experiences that do not fully overlap, but nonetheless share useful similarities with, previously acquired knowledge. However, it is often unclear how knowledge gained in one context should generalize to another. Previous computational models and data suggest that rather than learning about each individual context, humans build latent abstract structures and learn to link these structures to arbitrary contexts, facilitating generalization. In these models, task structures that are more popular across contexts are more likely to be revisited in new contexts. However, these models can only re-use policies as a whole and are unable to transfer knowledge about the transition structure of the environment even if only the goal has changed (or vice-versa). This contrasts with ecological settings, where some aspects of task structure, such as the transition function, will be shared between context separately from other aspects, such as the reward function. Here, we develop a novel non-parametric Bayesian agent that forms independent latent clusters for transition and reward functions, affording separable transfer of their constituent parts across contexts. We show that the relative performance of this agent compared to an agent that jointly clusters reward and transition functions depends environmental task statistics: the mutual information between transition and reward functions and the stochasticity of the observations. We formalize our analysis through an information theoretic account of the priors, and propose a meta learning agent that dynamically arbitrates between strategies across task domains to optimize a statistical tradeoff.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/X_ZyVI2ySQ4" width="1" />

Abstract
<p>Ischemic stroke is the leading cause of disability, and effective therapeutic strategies are needed to promote complete recovery. Neuroinflammation plays a significant role in stroke pathophysiology, and there is limited understanding of how it affects recovery. The aim of this study was to characterize the spatiotemporal expression profile of microglial activation and whether dampening microglial/macrophage activation post-stroke facilitates the recovery. For dampening microglial/macrophage activation, we chose intranasal administration of naloxone, a drug that is already in clinical use for opioid overdose and is known to decrease microglia/macrophage activation. We characterized the temporal progression of microglia/macrophage activation following cortical ischemic injury in rat and found the peak activation in cortex 7 d post-stroke. Unexpectedly, there was a chronic expression of phagocytic cells in the thalamus associated with neuronal loss. (+)-Naloxone, an enantiomer that reduces microglial activation without antagonizing opioid receptors, was administered intranasally starting 1 d post-stroke and continuing for 7 d. (+)-Naloxone treatment decreased microglia/macrophage activation in the striatum and thalamus, promoted behavioral recovery during the 14-d monitoring period, and reduced neuronal death in the lesioned cortex and ipsilateral thalamus. Our results are the first to show that post-stroke intranasal (+)-naloxone administration promotes short-term functional recovery and reduces microglia/macrophage activation. Therefore, (+)-naloxone is a promising drug for the treatment of ischemic stroke, and further studies should be conducted.</p>

<p>Filters are widely used for the modulation, typically attenuation, of amplitudes of different frequencies within neurophysiological signals. Filters, however, also induce changes in the phases of different frequencies whose amplitude is unmodulated. These phase shifts cause time lags in the filtered signals, leading to a disruption of the timing information between different frequencies within the same signal and between different signals. The emerging time lags can be either constant in the case of linear phase (LP) filters or vary as a function of the frequency in the more common case of non-LP (NLP) filters. Since filters are used ubiquitously online in the early stages of data acquisition, the vast majority of neurophysiological signals thus suffer from distortion of the timing information even prior to their sampling. This distortion is often exacerbated by further multiple offline filtering stages of the sampled signal. The distortion of timing information may cause misinterpretation of the results and lead to erroneous conclusions. Here we present a variety of typical examples of filter-induced phase distortions and discuss the evaluation and restoration of the timing information underlying the original signal.</p>

Abstract
<p>Fragile X premutation disorder is caused by CGG triplet repeat expansions in the 5' untranslated region of FMR1 mRNA. The question of how expanded CGG repeats cause disease is a subject of continuing debate. Our work indicates that CGG-repeat structures compete with regulatory BC1 RNA for access to RNA transport factor hnRNP A2. As a result, BC1 RNA is mislocalized in vivo, as its synapto-dendritic presence is severely diminished in brains of CGG-repeat knock-in animals (a premutation mouse model). Lack of BC1 RNA is known to cause seizure activity and cognitive dysfunction. Our working hypothesis thus predicted that absence, or significantly reduced presence, of BC1 RNA in synapto-dendritic domains of premutation animal neurons would engender cognate phenotypic alterations. Testing this prediction, we established epileptogenic susceptibility and cognitive impairments as major phenotypic abnormalities of CGG premutation mice. In CA3 hippocampal neurons of such animals, synaptic release of glutamate elicits neuronal hyperexcitability in the form of group I metabotropic glutamate receptor–dependent prolonged epileptiform discharges. CGG-repeat knock-in animals are susceptible to sound-induced seizures and are cognitively impaired as revealed in the Attentional Set Shift Task. These phenotypic disturbances occur in young-adult premutation animals, indicating that a neurodevelopmental deficit is an early-initial manifestation of the disorder. The data are consistent with the notion that RNA mislocalization can contribute to pathogenesis.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.06758">Clamping and Synchronization in the strongly coupled FitzHugh-Nagumo model. (arXiv:1804.06758v1 [math.AP])</a></h4>

<p>We investigate the dynamics of a limit of interacting FitzHugh-Nagumo neurons
in the regime of large interaction coefficients. We consider the dynamics
described by a mean-field model given by a nonlinear evolution partial
differential equation representing the probability distribution of one given
neuron in a large network. The case of weak connectivity previously studied
displays a unique stationary solution. Here, we consider the case of strong
connectivities, and exhibit the presence of complex, non-necessarily stationary
behaviors. To this end, using Hopf-Cole transformation, we demonstrate that the
solutions exponentially concentrate around a singular Dirac measure as the
connectivity parameter diverges, centered at the zeros of a time-dependent
continuous function. We next characterize the points at which the measure
concentrates, and exhibit a particular solution corresponding to a Dirac
measure at a time satisfy an ordinary differential equation identical to the
original FitzHugh-Nagumo system. Classically, this solution may feature
multiple stable fixed points or periodic orbits, respectively corresponding to
a clumping of the whole system at rest, or a synchronization of cells on a
periodic solution. We illustrate these results with numerical simulations of
neural networks with a relatively modest number of neurons and finite coupling
strength, and show that away from the bifurcations of the limit system, the
asymptotic equation recovers the main properties of more realistic networks.

Tyssowski et al. report that different durations of neuronal activity induce different gene expression profiles, enabling inference of past neuronal activity from gene expression data. Furthermore, they show that MAPK/ERK signaling partially establishes this activity-pattern-to-gene-induction coupling.

<p>Following the loss of a sensory modality, such as deafness or blindness, crossmodal plasticity is commonly identified in regions of the cerebrum that normally process the deprived modality. It has been hypothesized that significant changes in the patterns of cortical afferent and efferent projections may underlie these functional crossmodal changes. However, studies of thalamocortical and corticocortical connections have refuted this hypothesis, instead revealing a profound resilience of cortical afferent projections following deafness and blindness. This report is the first study of cortical outputs following sensory deprivation, characterizing cortical projections to the superior colliculus in mature cats (<i>N</i> = 5, 3 female) with perinatal-onset deafness. The superior colliculus was exposed to a retrograde pathway tracer, and subsequently labeled cells throughout the cerebrum were identified and quantified. Overall, the percentage of cortical projections arising from auditory cortex was substantially increased, not decreased, in early-deaf cats compared with intact animals. Furthermore, the distribution of labeled cortical neurons was no longer localized to a particular cortical subregion of auditory cortex but dispersed across auditory cortical regions. Collectively, these results demonstrate that, although patterns of cortical afferents are stable following perinatal deafness, the patterns of cortical efferents to the superior colliculus are highly mutable.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> When a sense is lost, the remaining senses are functionally enhanced through compensatory crossmodal plasticity. In deafness, brain regions that normally process sound contribute to enhanced visual and somatosensory perception. We demonstrate that hearing loss alters connectivity between sensory cortex and the superior colliculus, a midbrain region that integrates sensory representations to guide orientation behavior. Contrasting expectation, the proportion of projections from auditory cortex increased in deaf animals compared with normal hearing, with a broad distribution across auditory fields. This is the first description of changes in cortical efferents following sensory loss and provides support for models predicting an inability to form a coherent, multisensory percept of the environment following periods of abnormal development.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/16/4031?rss=1">Primary Traumatic Axonopathy in Mice Subjected to Impact Acceleration: A Reappraisal of Pathology and Mechanisms with High-Resolution Anatomical Methods</a></h4>

<p>Traumatic axonal injury (TAI) is a common neuropathology in traumatic brain injury and is featured by primary injury to axons. Here, we generated TAI with impact acceleration of the head in male <i>Thy1-eYFP-H</i> transgenic mice in which specific populations of neurons and their axons are labeled with yellow fluorescent protein. This model results in axonal lesions in multiple axonal tracts along with blood–brain barrier disruption and neuroinflammation. The corticospinal tract, a prototypical long tract, is severely affected and is the focus of this study. Using optimized CLARITY at single-axon resolution, we visualized the entire corticospinal tract volume from the pons to the cervical spinal cord in 3D and counted the total number of axonal lesions and their progression over time. Our results divulged the presence of progressive traumatic axonopathy that was maximal at the pyramidal decussation. The perikarya of injured corticospinal neurons atrophied, but there was no evidence of neuronal cell death. We also used CLARITY at single-axon resolution to explore the role of the NMNAT2-SARM1 axonal self-destruction pathway in traumatic axonopathy. When we interfered with this pathway by genetically ablating SARM1 or by pharmacological strategies designed to increase levels of Nicotinamide (Nam), a feedback inhibitor of SARM1, we found a significant reduction in the number of axonal lesions early after injury. Our findings show that high-resolution neuroanatomical strategies reveal important features of TAI with biological implications, especially the progressive axonopathic nature of TAI and the role of the NMNAT2-SARM1 pathway in the early stages of axonopathy.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> In the first systematic application of novel high-resolution neuroanatomical tools in neuropathology, we combined CLARITY with 2-photon microscopy, optimized for detection of single axonal lesions, to reconstruct the injured mouse brainstem in a model of traumatic axonal injury (TAI) that is a common pathology associated with traumatic brain injury. The 3D reconstruction of the corticospinal tract at single-axon resolution allowed for a more advanced level of qualitative and quantitative understanding of TAI. Using this model, we showed that TAI is an axonopathy with a prominent role of the NMNAT2-SARM1 molecular pathway, that is also implicated in peripheral neuropathy. Our results indicate that high-resolution anatomical models of TAI afford a level of detail and sensitivity that is ideal for testing novel molecular and biomechanical hypotheses.</p>

(FE) four cylindrical shell model of a peripheral nerve and a 32 channel
dual-ring nerve cuff. The central layer of the FE model contains impedance
changes representative of neural activity of -0.3 in the length axis and -8.8 x
10-4 in the radial axis. Four of the electrode patterns generate longitudinal
drive current, which runs perpendicular to the anisotropic axis. Main results:
Transverse current patterns produce higher resolution than longitudinal
patterns but are also more susceptible to noise and errors, and exhibit poorer
sensitivity to impedance changes in central sample locations. Three of the four
longitudinal current patterns considered can reconstruct fascicle level
impedance changes with up to 0.2 mV noise and error, which corresponds to
between -5.5 and +0.18 dB of the normalised signal standard deviation. Reducing
the spacing between the two electrode rings in all longitudinal current
patterns reduced the signal to error ratio across all depth locations of the
sample. Significance: Electrode patterns which target the large impedance
change in the anisotropic length axis can provide improved robustness against
noise and errors, which is a critical step towards real time EIT imaging of
neural activity in peripheral nerve.

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.05964">Appropriate kernels for Divisive Normalization explained by Wilson-Cowan equations. (arXiv:1804.05964v1 [q-bio.NC])</a></h4>

<p>The interaction between wavelet-like sensors in Divisive Normalization is
classically described through Gaussian kernels that decay with spatial
distance, angular distance and frequency distance. However, simultaneous
explanation of (a) distortion perception in natural image databases and (b)
contrast perception of artificial stimuli requires very specific modifications
in classical Divisive Normalization. First, the wavelet response has to be
high-pass filtered before the Gaussian interaction is applied. Then, distinct
weights per subband are also required after the Gaussian interaction. In
summary, the classical Gaussian kernel has to be left- and right-multiplied by
two extra diagonal matrices.
</p>
<p>In this paper we provide a lower-level justification for this specific
empirical modification required in the Gaussian kernel of Divisive
Normalization. Here we assume that the psychophysical behavior described by
Divisive Normalization comes from neural interactions following the
Wilson-Cowan equations. In particular, we identify the Divisive Normalization
response with the stationary regime of a Wilson-Cowan model. From this
identification we derive an expression for the Divisive Normalization kernel in
terms of the interaction kernel of the Wilson-Cowan equations. It turns out
that the Wilson-Cowan kernel is left- and-right multiplied by diagonal matrices
with high-pass structure. In conclusion, symmetric Gaussian inhibitory
relations between wavelet-like sensors wired in the lower-level Wilson-Cowan
model lead to the appropriate non-symmetric kernel that has to be empirically
included in Divisive Normalization to explain a wider range of phenomena.

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>We investigated, in 445 healthy adults whose Heschl’s gyrus (HG) gyrification patterns had been previously identified, how an in vivo MRI marker of intracortical myelination of HG and the planum temporale (PT) varied as a function of HG gyrification pattern and, in cases of duplication, of anatomical characteristics of the second HG (H2). By measuring the MRI T1/T2 ratio in regions of interest covering the first HG (H1), H2 in cases of common stem (H2CSD), or complete posterior duplication (H2CPD) and the PT, we showed that H1 had the highest T1/T2 values, while the PT had the lowest. The major impact of duplication was a decrease in both H1 and PT T1/T2 values in cases of left CPD. Concerning H2, the right and left T1/T2 values of right H2CSD were closer to those of H1, and those of left H2CPD were closer to those of PT. After adjusting for verbal skills, rhyming performance was not associated with T1/T2 values in left regions, but it decreased with increasing right PT T1/T2 values. These results reveal the existence of hemispheric differences in H2 myelination and underline the importance of neuroimaging markers of intracortical myelination for investigating brain structure–function relationships.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Mature granule cells are poorly excitable neurons that were recently shown to fire action potentials, preferentially in bursts. It is believed that the particularly pronounced short-term facilitation of mossy fiber synapses makes granule cell bursting a very effective means of properly transferring information to CA3. However, the mechanism underlying the unique bursting behavior of mature granule cells is currently unknown. Here, we show that Cav3.2 T-type channels at the axon initial segment are responsible for burst firing of mature granule cells in rats and mice. Accordingly, Cav3.2 knockout mice fire tonic spikes and exhibit impaired bursting, synaptic plasticity and dentate-to-CA3 communication. The data show that Cav3.2 channels are strong modulators of bursting and can be considered a critical molecular switch that enables effective information transfer from mature granule cells to the CA3 pyramids.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Vascular endothelial growth factor (<span style="font-style: italic;">Vegfa</span>) is essential for promoting the vascularization of the embryonic murine forebrain. In addition, it directly influences neural development, although its role in the forming forebrain is less well elucidated. It was recently suggested that <span style="font-style: italic;">Vegfa</span> may influence the development of GABAergic interneurons, inhibitory cells with crucial signaling roles in cortical neuronal circuits. However, the mechanism by which it affects interneuron development remains unknown. Here we investigated the developmental processes by which <span style="font-style: italic;">Vegfa</span> may influence cortical interneuron development by analyzing transgenic mice that ubiquitously express the Vegfa120 isoform to perturb its signaling gradient. We found that interneurons reach the dorsal cortex at mid phases of corticogenesis despite an aberrant vascular network. Instead, endothelial ablation of Vegfa alters cortical interneuron numbers, their intracortical distribution and spatial proximity to blood vessels. We show for the first time that vascular-secreted guidance factors promote early-migrating interneurons in the intact forebrain in vivo and identify a novel role for vascular-Vegfa in this process.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Mutations in PRoline-Rich Transmembrane protein 2 (<span style="font-style: italic;">PRRT2</span>) underlie a group of paroxysmal disorders including epilepsy, kinesigenic dyskinesia and migraine. Most of the mutations lead to impaired PRRT2 expression and/or function, emphasizing the pathogenic role of the PRRT2 deficiency. In this work, we investigated the phenotype of primary hippocampal neurons obtained from mouse embryos in which the <span style="font-style: italic;">PRRT2</span> gene was constitutively inactivated. Although PRRT2 is expressed by both excitatory and inhibitory neurons, its deletion decreases the number of excitatory synapses without significantly affecting the number of inhibitory synapses or the nerve terminal ultrastructure. Analysis of synaptic function in primary PRRT2 knockout excitatory neurons by live imaging and electrophysiology showed slowdown of the kinetics of exocytosis, weakened spontaneous and evoked synaptic transmission and markedly increased facilitation. Inhibitory neurons showed strengthening of basal synaptic transmission, accompanied by faster depression. At the network level these complex synaptic effects resulted in a state of heightened spontaneous and evoked activity that was associated with increased excitability of excitatory neurons in both PRRT2 knockout primary cultures and acute hippocampal slices. The data indicate the existence of network instability/hyperexcitability as the possible basis of the paroxysmal phenotypes associated with <span style="font-style: italic;">PRRT2</span> mutations.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Tau is associated with hypometabolism in patients with Alzheimer’s disease. In normal aging, the association between tau and glucose metabolism is not fully characterized. We used [<sup>18</sup>F] AV-1451, [<sup>18</sup>F] Fluorodeoxyglucose, and [<sup>11</sup>C] Pittsburgh Compound-B (PiB) PET to measure associations between tau and glucose metabolism in cognitively normal older adults (<span style="font-style: italic;">N</span> = 49). Participants were divided into amyloid-negative (PiB–, <span style="font-style: italic;">n</span> = 28) and amyloid-positive (PiB+, <span style="font-style: italic;">n</span> = 21) groups to determine effects of amyloid-β. We assessed both local and across-brain regional tau–glucose metabolism associations separately in PiB–/PiB+ groups using correlation matrices and sparse canonical correlations. Relationships between tau and glucose metabolism differed by amyloid status, and were primarily spatially distinct. In PiB– subjects, tau was associated with broad regions of increased glucose metabolism. In PiB+ subjects, medial temporal lobe tau was associated with widespread hypometabolism, while tau outside of the medial temporal lobe was associated with decreased and increased glucose metabolism. We further found that regions with earlier tau spread were associated with stronger negative correlations with glucose metabolism. Our findings indicate that in normal aging, low levels of tau are associated with a phase of increased metabolism, while high levels of tau in the presence of amyloid-β are associated with hypometabolism at downstream sites.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Why are we so slow in choosing the lesser of 2 evils? We considered whether such slowing relates to uncertainty about the value of these options, which arises from the tendency to avoid them during learning, and whether such slowing relates to frontosubthalamic inhibitory control mechanisms. In total, 49 participants performed a reinforcement-learning task and a stop-signal task while fMRI was recorded. A reinforcement-learning model was used to quantify learning strategies. Individual differences in lose–lose slowing related to information uncertainty due to sampling, and independently, to less efficient response inhibition in the stop-signal task. Neuroimaging analysis revealed an analogous dissociation: subthalamic nucleus (STN) BOLD activity related to variability in stopping latencies, whereas weaker frontosubthalamic connectivity related to slowing and information sampling. Across tasks, fast inhibitors increased STN activity for successfully canceled responses in the stop task, but decreased activity for lose–lose choices. These data support the notion that fronto-STN communication implements a rapid but transient brake on response execution, and that slowing due to decision uncertainty could result from an inefficient release of this “hold your horses” mechanism.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Histological sections offer high spatial resolution to examine laminar architecture of the human cerebral cortex; however, they are restricted by being 2D, hence only regions with sufficiently optimal cutting planes can be analyzed. Conversely, noninvasive neuroimaging approaches are whole brain but have relatively low resolution. Consequently, correct 3D cross-cortical patterns of laminar architecture have never been mapped in histological sections. We developed an automated technique to identify and analyze laminar structure within the high-resolution 3D histological BigBrain. We extracted white matter and pial surfaces, from which we derived histologically verified surfaces at the layer I/II boundary and within layer IV. Layer IV depth was strongly predicted by cortical curvature but varied between areas. This fully automated 3D laminar analysis is an important requirement for bridging high-resolution 2D cytoarchitecture and in vivo 3D neuroimaging. It lays the foundation for in-depth, whole-brain analyses of cortical layering.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Youths with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder symptomatology often exhibit residual inattention and/or hyperactivity in adulthood; however, this is not true for all individuals. We recently reported that dimensional, multi-informant ratings of hyperactive/inattentive symptoms are associated with ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) structure. Herein, we investigate the degree to which vmPFC structure during adolescence predicts hyperactive/inattentive symptomatology at 5-year follow-up. Structural equation modeling was used to test the extent to which adolescent vmPFC volume predicts hyperactive/inattentive symptomatology 5 years later in early adulthood. 1104 participants (<span style="font-style: italic;">M</span> = 14.52 years, standard deviation = 0.42; 583 females) possessed hyperactive/inattentive symptom data at 5-year follow-up, as well as quality controlled neuroimaging data and complete psychometric data at baseline. Self-reports of hyperactive/inattentive symptomatology were obtained during adolescence and at 5-year follow-up using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). At baseline and 5-year follow-up, a hyperactive/inattentive latent variable was derived from items on the SDQ. Baseline vmPFC volume predicted adult hyperactive/inattentive symptomatology (standardized coefficient = −0.274, <span style="font-style: italic;">P</span> &lt; 0.001) while controlling for baseline hyperactive/inattentive symptomatology. These results are the first to reveal relations between adolescent brain structure and adult hyperactive/inattentive symptomatology, and suggest that early structural development of the vmPFC may be consequential for the subsequent expression of hyperactive/inattentive symptoms.</span>

In this issue of Neuron, Liao and colleagues (2018) uncover a surprising way that the guidance molecule MIG14/Wntless operates in dendrite self-avoidance in sensorimotor neurons. Not only does MIG14/Wntless not require the soluble cue Wntless, but it can mediate direct cell-cell contact at the plasma membrane. During dendrite tip contact, MIG14/Wntless drives local bursts of WASP-dependent actin filament assembly that facilitate sister dendrite repulsion.

Despite the translational promise of non-invasive neuroimaging, its practical application to individuals has remained largely elusive. In this issue of Neuron, Gratton et al. present data from nine highly sampled adult humans and demonstrate that functional brain networks are in large part composed of individual-specific features that are stable over time. Such data represent a critical prerequisite for the development of new diagnostics and personalized interventions for neuropsychiatric illnesses.

Obernier et al. show that the primary mode of division of adult ventricular-subventricular zone (V-SVZ) neural stem cells is symmetric, with the majority generating two non-stem cell progeny, and a minority self-renewing. This discovery has important implications for understanding stem cell dynamics and adult neurogenesis.

To compare information and reach decisions effectively, our brain uses multiple heuristics, which can, however, induce biases in behavior. An elegant study by Akrami et al. (2018) finds evidence for one such heuristic in a sensory-based comparison task and identifies its location to the posterior parietal cortex.

<p>Understanding the relationship between structural and functional connectivity
remains a crucial issue in modern neuroscience. Here we investigate such
relationship through a stochastic neural whole-brain model, using as input the
structural connectivity matrix defined by the human connectome. Importantly, we
address the structure-function relationship both at the group and
individual-based levels. In this work, we show that equalization of the nodes
excitatory input improves the correlation between simulated neural patterns of
the model and various brain functional data. We find that the best model
performance is achieved when the model control parameter is in its critical
value and that equalization minimizes both the variability of the critical
points and neuronal activity patterns among subjects. Our results open new
perspectives in personalized brain modelling with potential applications to
investigate the deviation from criticality due to structural lesions (e.g.
stroke) or brain disorders.

<p>Human speech perception involves transforming a countinous acoustic signal
into discrete linguistically meaningful units, such as phonemes, while
simultaneously causing a listener to activate words that are similar to the
spoken utterance and to each other. The Neighborhood Activation Model
(NAM~\cite{Luce:1986,Luce:1998}) posits that phonological neighbors (two forms
[words] that differ by one phoneme) compete significantly for recognition as a
spoken word is heard. This definition of phonological similarity can be
extended to an entire corpus of forms to produce a phonological neighbor
network~\cite{Vitevitch:2008} (PNN). We study PNNs for five languages: English,
Spanish, French, Dutch, and German. Consistent with previous work, we find that
the PNNs share a consistent set of topological features. Using an approach that
generates random lexicons with increasing levels of phonological realism, we
show that even random forms with minimal relationship to any real language,
combined with only the empirical distribution of language-specific phonological
form lengths, are sufficient to produce the topological properties observed in
the real language PNNs. The resulting pseudo-PNNs are insensitive to the level
of lingusitic realism in the random lexicons but quite sensitive to the shape
of the form length distribution. We therefore conclude that "universal"
features seen across multiple languages are really string universals, not
language universals, and arise primarily due to limitations in the kinds of
networks generated by the one-step neighbor definition. Taken together, our
results indicate that caution is warranted when linking the dynamics of human
spoken word recognition to the topological properties of PNNs, and that the
investigation of alternative similarity metrics for phonological forms should
be a priority.

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.05695">Cochlear detection of double-slip motion in cello bowing. (arXiv:1804.05695v1 [q-bio.NC])</a></h4>

<p>A double-slip motion of a cello sound is investigated experimentally with a
bowing machine and analyzed using a Finite-Difference Time Domain (FDTD)
cochlear model. A double-slip sound is investigated. Here the sawtooth motion
of normal bowing is basically present, but within each period the bow hair
tears off the strings once more within the period, resulting in a blurred
sound. This additional intermediate slip appears around the middle of each
period and drifts temporally around while the sound progresses. When the
double-slip is perfectly in the middle of one period the sound is that of a
regular sawtooth motion. If not, two periodicities are present around double
the fundamental periodicity, making the sound arbitrary. Analyzing the sound
with a Wavelet-transform, the expected double-peak of two periodicities around
the second partial cannot be found. Analyzing the tone with a cochlear FDTD
model including the transfer of mechanical energy into spikes, the doubling and
even more complex behaviour is perfectly represented in the Interspike Interval
(ISI) of two adjacent spikes. This cochlear spike representation fits perfectly
to an amplitude peak detection algorithm, tracking the precise time point of
the double-slip within the fundamental period. Therefore the ear is able to
detect the double-slip motion right at the transition from the basilar membrane
motion into electrical spikes.

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.05266">Robust entropy requires strong and balanced excitatory and inhibitory synapses. (arXiv:1804.05266v1 [q-bio.NC])</a></h4>

<p>It is widely appreciated that well-balanced excitation and inhibition are
necessary for proper function in neural networks. However, in principle, such
balance could be achieved by many possible configurations of excitatory and
inhibitory strengths, and relative numbers of excitatory and inhibitory
neurons. For instance, a given level of excitation could be balanced by either
numerous inhibitory neurons with weak synapses, or few inhibitory neurons with
strong synapses. Among the continuum of different but balanced configurations,
why should any particular configuration be favored? Here we address this
question in the context of the entropy of network dynamics by studying an
analytically tractable network of binary neurons. We find that entropy is
highest at the boundary between excitation-dominant and inhibition-dominant
regimes. Entropy also varies along this boundary with a trade-off between high
and robust entropy: weak synapse strengths yield high network entropy which is
fragile to parameter variations, while strong synapse strengths yield a lower,
but more robust, network entropy. In the case where inhibitory and excitatory
synapses are constrained to have similar strength, we find that a small, but
non-zero fraction of inhibitory neurons, like that seen in mammalian cortex,
results in robust and relatively high entropy.
