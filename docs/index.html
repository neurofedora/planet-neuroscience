<p>This paper provides a personal history of work starting with the discovery that anxiolytic drugs reduce hippocampal theta frequency. It includes parallel work on septal elicitation of theta carried out in Jeffrey Gray's laboratory in Oxford; a statement of my original scientific perspective on the work; and a description of later work in my laboratory in New Zealand confirming the function of theta rhythmicity per se and its mediation of the effects of anxiolytic drugs on behavior. I finish with comments on risk management with such experiments and their use in larger scale theory development.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23670?af=R">The Discovery of Head Direction Cells: A Personal Account</a></h4>

              
                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>This article is my recollection of events surrounding the discovery of head direction (HD) cells by Jim Ranck in 1984 and the first journal publications 6 years later. Ranck first described the fundamental properties of HD cells qualitatively in a <i>Society for Neuroscience</i> abstract (1984) and in the proceedings to a conference. Ranck, however, was convinced by Bob Muller, a faculty colleague in the lab, to delay writing up Jim's discovery until they developed a two-spot video tracking system, which would enable proper quantitative analyses. The development of this system was complex and was still undergoing development when I arrived in the Brooklyn lab in 1986. By this time, Jim had begun to refocus his efforts on thinking about the relationship between space and manifolds and was no longer engaged in active research. It thus befell me (unintentionally) to complete the recordings of these fascinating cells. This endeavor involved recording additional HD cells with the new video tracking system, monitoring the cells' responses following a series of environmental manipulations, and performing quantitative analyses on the data. Throughout 1987, I recorded most of the cells that would form the basis for our 1990 papers published in the <i>Journal of Neuroscience</i>. Along the way, there were many events and emotions: luck, excitement, humor, frustration, tutorials, unintended outcomes, and long-lasting friendships. I was guided and supported during this time by both Bob Muller and John Kubie, but remain forever grateful to Jim for this wonderful opportunity.</p>

	<p>Glioblastoma (GBM) is a highly lethal type of cancer, frequently presenting an unfavorable prognosis. The current treatment options for this neoplasia are still limited, highlighting the need for further research evaluating new drugs to treat GBM or to serve as an adjuvant to improve the efficiency of currently used therapies. In this sense, the inhibition of A2A receptors in the brain has presented a neuroprotective role for several diseases, such as neurodegenerative conditions, and it has been suggested as a possible pharmacological target in some types of cancer; thus, it also can be underscored as a potential target in GBM. Recently, Istradefylline (IST) was approved by the FDA for treating Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease, representing a safe drug that acts through the inhibition of the A2A receptor, and it has also been suggested as an antineoplastic drug. Therefore, this work aims to explore the effects of A2A receptor inhibition as a therapy for GBM and assess the feasibility of this blockage occurring through the effects of IST.</p>

	<p>Substance use disorders (SUDs) and anxiety disorders (ADs) are highly comorbid, a co-occurrence linked to worse clinical outcomes than either condition alone. While the neurobiological mechanisms involved in SUDs and anxiety disorders are intensively studied separately, the mechanisms underlying their comorbidity remain an emerging area of interest. This narrative review explores the neurobiological processes underlying this comorbidity, using the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) framework to map disruptions in positive valence, negative valence, and cognitive systems across the three stages of the addiction cycle: binge/intoxication, withdrawal/negative affect, and preoccupation/anticipation. Anxiety and substance use play a reciprocal role at each stage of addiction, marked by significant psychosocial impairment and dysregulation in the brain. A more thorough understanding of the neural underpinnings involved in comorbid SUDs and anxiety disorders will contribute to more tailored and effective therapeutic interventions and assessments.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/11/12/ENEURO.0495-23.2024?rss=1">Can Information About Stiffness Perception be Inferred from Action Signals Using Models?</a></h4>

              
                <p>We use sensory feedback to form our perception, and control our movements and forces (actions). There is an ongoing debate about the relation between perception and action, with evidence in both directions. For example, there are cases in which perceptual illusions affect action signals and cases where they do not. However, even when they do, it is unknown if perceptual information can be inferred from action signals alone. To answer this question, we utilized a perceptual illusion created by artificial tactile skin stretch, which increases stiffness perception, and affects grip force. We used data recorded in a stiffness discrimination task in which participants compared pairs of virtual objects, comprised of force and artificial skin stretch and indicated which they perceived as stiffer. We explored if models could predict the participants&rsquo; perceptual responses, and the increase in stiffness perception caused by the skin stretch, solely from their recorded action signals. That is, with no information provided about the stimuli. We found that participants&rsquo; perceptual augmentation could be predicted to an extent from their action signals alone. We predicted the average augmentation effect across participants, and a general trend of increased predicted perceptual augmentation for increased real perceptual augmentation. These results indicate that at least some perceptual information is present in action signals. Furthermore, of the action signals examined, grip force was necessary for predicting the augmentation effect, and a motion signal (e.g., position) was needed for predicting human-like perception, shedding light on what information may be presented in the different signals.</p>

                <p>by Roukayatou R. Ouedraogo, Hannah K. Sowers, Spencer R. Lynch, Nathan E. Hudson, Brittany E. Bannish</p>

Fibrinolysis, the plasmin-mediated degradation of the fibrin mesh that stabilizes blood clots, is an important physiological process, and understanding mechanisms underlying lysis is critical for improved stroke treatment. Experimentalists are now able to study lysis on the scale of single fibrin fibers, but mathematical models of lysis continue to focus mostly on fibrin network degradation. Experiments have shown that while some degradation occurs along the length of a fiber, ultimately the fiber is cleaved at a single location. We built a 2-dimensional stochastic model of a fibrin fiber cross-section that uses the Gillespie algorithm to study single fiber lysis initiated by plasmin. We simulated the model over a range of parameter values to learn about patterns and rates of single fiber lysis in various physiological conditions. We also used epifluorescent microscopy to measure the cleavage times of fibrin fibers with different apparent diameters. By comparing our model results to the laboratory experiments, we were able to: 1) suggest value ranges for unknown rate constants(namely that the degradation rate of fibrin by plasmin should be ≤ 10 s<sup>−1</sup> and that if plasmin crawls, the rate of crawling should be between 10 s<sup>−1</sup> and 60 s<sup>−1</sup>); 2) estimate the fraction of fibrin within a fiber cross-section that must be degraded for the fiber to cleave in two; and 3) propose that that fraction is higher in thinner fibers and lower in thicker fibers. Collectively, this information provides more details about how fibrin fibers degrade, which can be leveraged in the future for a better understanding of why fibrinolysis is impaired in certain disease states, and could inform intervention strategies.

                <p>by Kathrin Pabst, Evripidis Gkanias, Barbara Webb, Uwe Homberg, Dominik Endres</p>

Accurate navigation often requires the maintenance of a robust internal estimate of heading relative to external surroundings. We present a model for angular velocity integration in a desert locust heading circuit, applying concepts from early theoretical work on heading circuits in mammals to a novel biological context in insects. In contrast to similar models proposed for the fruit fly, this circuit model uses a single 360° heading direction representation and is updated by neuromodulatory angular velocity inputs. Our computational model was implemented using steady-state firing rate neurons with dynamical synapses. The circuit connectivity was constrained by biological data, and remaining degrees of freedom were optimised with a machine learning approach to yield physiologically plausible neuron activities. We demonstrate that the integration of heading and angular velocity in this circuit is robust to noise. The heading signal can be effectively used as input to an existing insect goal-directed steering circuit, adapted for outbound locomotion in a steady direction that resembles locust migration. Our study supports the possibility that similar computations for orientation may be implemented differently in the neural hardware of the fruit fly and the locust.

                <p>by Melvin Bérard, Laura Merlini, Sophie G. Martin</p>

Starvation, which is associated with inactivation of the growth-promoting TOR complex 1 (TORC1), is a strong environmental signal for cell differentiation. In the fission yeast <i>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</i>, nitrogen starvation has distinct physiological consequences depending on the presence of mating partners. In their absence, cells enter quiescence, and TORC1 inactivation prolongs their life. In presence of compatible mates, TORC1 inactivation is essential for sexual differentiation. Gametes engage in paracrine pheromone signaling, grow towards each other, fuse to form the diploid zygote, and form resistant, haploid spore progenies. To understand the signaling changes in the proteome and phospho-proteome during sexual reproduction, we developed cell synchronization strategies and present (phospho-)proteomic data sets that dissect pheromone from starvation signals over the sexual differentiation and cell–cell fusion processes. Unexpectedly, these data sets reveal phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 during sexual development, which we establish requires TORC1 activity. We demonstrate that TORC1 is re-activated by pheromone signaling, in a manner that does not require autophagy. Mutants with low TORC1 re-activation exhibit compromised mating and poorly viable spores. Thus, while inactivated to initiate the mating process, TORC1 is reactivated by pheromone signaling in starved cells to support sexual reproduction.

                Background Cogan’s syndrome is a rare autoimmune disorder characterized by ocular inflammation, vestibulocochlear dysfunction, and systemic vasculitis. Case Presentation We report a 28-year-old female who experienced decreased visual acuity and ocular redness one month after a COVID-19 infection, with ophthalmological signs linked to keratitis, uveitis and retinal vasculitis. Two weeks later, she developed vertigo, tinnitus, and sudden hearing loss, leading to a diagnosis of Cogan’s disease. The patient received corticosteroid therapy, resulting in regression of ophthalmological signs, but progressed to complete deafness. One month later, she presented with lymphocytic meningitis and high intracranial pressure, which improved under treatment. The patient later received cochlear implants. Objective This case report aims to highlight an atypical presentation of Cogan’s syndrome with neurological involvement following a COVID-19 infection. This case contributes to the limited literature on such presentations. Conclusion Our case is one of only two reported instances of Cogan’s syndrome presenting with neurological signs post-COVID-19 infection, underscoring the rarity and complexity of this condition.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1549/v1?src=rss">Depression diagnosis using Artificial Intelligence: a systematic review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Depression is a prevalent mental health disorder that affects a significant proportion of the global population, posing a major public health challenge. In recent years, the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to mental health diagnosis has garnered increasing attention. This systematic review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of research on AI-based approaches for depression diagnosis, identifying both advancements and gaps in the literature that can guide future studies. Methods A comprehensive search was conducted across leading research databases to identify relevant studies published up to July 2024. A combination of automated and manual filtering was employed to refine the initial set of records. Eligibility criteria were applied to ensure that only studies directly addressing the use of AI for depression diagnosis were included in the final analysis. Results The initial search yielded 1,179 records. Following a rigorous selection process, 145 studies were deemed eligible for inclusion in the review. These studies represent a diverse array of AI techniques and data sources, with a predominant focus on supervised learning algorithms. The most common data sources were social networks, followed by clinical data integrated with psychological assessments. Conclusion The results highlight the growing interest in leveraging AI for depression diagnosis, particularly through the use of supervised learning methods. Social network data has emerged as the most frequently used data source, though clinical data combined with validated psychological tests remains a key area of focus. Despite these advancements, several challenges persist, including data availability and quality, which present opportunities for future research to improve diagnostic accuracy and generalizability.

                Background The Chinese dynamic zero-COVID-19 policy was a very strict policy for COVID-19 response in the Chinese mainland, with the overarching goal of preventing imported infections and domestic flare-ups. Policy and implications The dynamic zero-COVID-19 policy has long been criticized by European and American politicians for the issue of human rights. There are some points that need to be considered with regard to these criticisms: Firstly, the dynamic zero-COVID-19 policy protected millions of Chinese people from death, the outcomes of China’s COVID-19 response demonstrated the correctness and suitability of the dynamic zero-COVID-19 policy, and the policy benefited the world. Secondly, freedom and health were generally conflicted and extremely difficult to be compatible in the COVID-19 pandemic, and the dynamic zero-COVID-19 policy indeed exhibited several advantages in the fight against COVID-19. Thirdly, China struggled to spare no effort to save lives all the time during the COVID-19 pandemic under the dynamic zero-COVID-19 policy. Recommendations Appropriate restrictions on freedom and human rights are justified to protect public health and prevent harm to others in the COVID-19 pandemic, and an important premise is that the implement of these restrictions are based on law. Conclusions In summary, it is biased to censure the Chinese dynamic zero-COVID-19 policy or abandonment of the Chinese dynamic zero-COVID-19 policy based on human rights, and the great achievement of the policy and China’s efforts to fight against the COVID-19 pandemic should not be ignored.

                Background ELIXIR is a pan-European public-funded research infrastructure dedicated to life science data. As such, it must demonstrate public value to its funders and stakeholders. We present methods to inventory research publications linked to ELIXIR that have received funding and support, as well as related citation metrics, used as performance metrics for these audiences. Methods To overcome challenges inherent in ELIXIR’s distributed structure, and the fact that those publishing ELIXIR-supported work are typically working part-time on ELIXIR matters, a semi-automated approach, consisting of text-mining followed by manual curation, is presented. A country-level case study (ELIXIR Italy) refines and expands the methods, notably by introducing more granularity in the curation process (e.g. considering all national-level grants, examining affiliations to report publication per institute) and by additionally looking at the scientific impact of the resources developed and operated by the Italian Node of ELIXIR. Results Overall, the methods described in this article have shown to: (1) be repeatable with acceptable levels of accuracy and consistency (notably across curators); (2) require reasonable effort in terms of curation of monthly ‘harvests’ of publications (obtained by text-mining); and (3) to be well-adapted to ELIXIR’s distributed nature. Conclusions Concrete examples are provided of downstream uses of the inventoried publications and their citations, both for ELIXIR as a whole and for the Italian case study. Limitations of the methods are discussed, particularly the challenges associated with using an ‘Open literature’ database (Europe PMC) for the text-mining, and the constraints related to curation capacity. The methods, along with the valuable lessons learned during their development, are sufficiently generic and pragmatic enough to be readily adapted by other similar research infrastructures.

                Background Rational prescription writing is an important skill to master during internship. This Quality Improvement (QI) project aimed to understand the state of prescription writing among interns posted in the Department of Psychiatry, analyze the causes responsible for errors in prescription writing and bring about a change in the current practice. Methods The MBBS interns are posted in the Department of Psychiatry for 15 days. During day 1 to day 5 of their posting, a pre intervention phase was conducted wherein prescriptions written by interns in the Department of Psychiatry were collected. The prescriptions were scored based on 14 criteria which were selected based on World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines and Medical Council of India (MCI) ideal prescription format. During PDSA (Plan Do Study Act) Cycle 1, an educational handout was distributed to the interns containing the MCI ideal prescription format and WHO guidelines regarding prescription writing. The brochure was also verbally explained to the interns. From day 7 to day 15 of their posting, prescriptions written by the interns were collected. The prescriptions were scored using the same criteria. Results During the pre intervention phase the mean total score of prescriptions was 9.54 ± 1.003. There was a significant improvement in the mean total score to 10.26 ± 0.746. There was a 7.54% improvement. There was also a significant improvement in several individual criteria. Conclusions The first PDSA cycle was successful in improving the quality of prescription writing among interns posted in the Department of Psychiatry. There is a need to implement more PDSA cycles to improve the quality still further.

                Background Cerebral small vessel disease (cSVD) is a progressive neurovascular-degenerative condition without specific treatment that causes lacunar stroke, most intracerebral haemorrhage, vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) and several neuropsychiatric conditions. Objectives To conduct a rapid multi-stage scoping review to identify licensed interventions that could be repurposed for testing in cSVD at phase-3. Methods First, we screened preclinical studies of potential relevance to cSVD and used a drug dictionary to identify studies of potential interventions. Separately, we screened clinical studies of relevance to cSVD and VCI. Following merging, we removed drugs that were unsuitable or impractical to assess long-term in the UK. We then performed mini-meta-analyses for shortlisted interventions assessing effects on cognition and scored these for their relevance to cSVD. Results The preclinical review created a long-list of 1,757 deduplicated interventions. Those that were not available in the UK, not expensive or impractical to administer long-term were merged with 62 interventions identified from 75 relevant clinical studies to create a medium-list of 52 interventions. Focussed literature review short-listed ten interventions for review by an independent scientific advisory group; they ranked three as most suitable for immediate testing: metformin, tadalafil and isosorbide mononitrate. Conclusion This rapid review identified three interventions that are suitable for testing in a late phase-3 (platform) trial involving patients with cSVD. The approach could be improved with partial automation, text mining and generative pre-trained transformer approaches which would help manage the large data volumes. Further, our data-driven approach could be combined with genetic or other mechanistic methods to further de-risk future trials.

                Abstract The comorbidity due to pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) and diabetes mellitus (DM) is a global health problem, but its mechanism remains unclear. It is suspected that hyperglycemic alteration of the immune response to TB and the composition of the lung microbiota play an important role. This scoping review aimed to contribute to the understanding of the mechanisms by mapping evidence on the effect of hyperglycemia on physical health indicators, immune cell counts, cytokine levels, and the composition of lung microbiota in patients with the DM-TB comorbidity. A systematic search for research articles about the relationship between hyperglycemia and physical health, immune cells, and cytokine levels in humans was conducted in MEDLINE, Scopus, and CINAHL Plus. Then, articles on the interactions between the immune cells, cytokines, and lung microbiota were identified through Google Scholar and Google search engines. Characteristics of the studies focusing on effects of hyperglycemia, the findings of the articles relevant to the research objectives, and strengths and weaknesses of the selected articles were charted in a data extraction tool. Twenty-one articles on the effects of hyperglycemia on immune mediators and health outcomes of patients with DM-TB were included. The evidence showed hyperglycemia to be associated with unfavorable treatment outcomes; altered counts and functioning of dendritic cells, monocytes, and CD4+ T cells; and changes in cytokine levels (mainly INF-γ, IL-17, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-α) in patients with DM-TB. The composition of the lung microbiota changed in correlation with changes in physical health outcomes, counts of immune cells, and cytokine levels. Thus, hyperglycemia, immune responses, and dysbiosis of the lung microbiota are integral in the pathogenesis of DM-TB and TB treatment outcomes. A prospective cohort study, especially in individuals with newly diagnosed DM versus known DM and concomitant latent TB versus active TB, is recommended to define causal relationships.

                Background Dental professionals are exposed to either high level of noise which often becomes annoying over a time, and it is largely related to turbines and suctions used during the procedure. We performed this study with an aim to know the need for efforts to reduce impact of noise on young. Methods The study group comprised of 102 dentists (53 males and 49 females) final year dental students, interns and board students of family dentistry, endodontics, prosthodontics was enrolled. The noise assessment device is switched on to know the base noise level in the clinics and to know hearing ability of the dentist through a pre – recorded verbal communication. When the dentist starts the procedure, the same verbal communication is re-introduced and based on his reaction the decibel level is increased to a point where he can understand it. The same is followed after the procedure. Results Using T – test the age and gender mean was assessed, while ANNOVA test was used to know the hearing impairment and its mean before, during and after procedure. We have found that there is an imminent increase of sound during the procedure and thereby associated impairment; which continues but to a lesser decibel level even after the procedure is completed for long time. Discussion and Conclusion We have highlighted few guidelines from various studies which range from reducing multiple turbine usage at a given point of treatment wherever possible to a recommendation to use ear plugs for those procedures related to high noise levels.

                Background This mixed-method action research study explores the impact of a gamified virtual learning tool on elementary students’ self-regulated learning (SRL) skills in English language acquisition. Despite the acknowledged importance of SRL in educational contexts, limited research exists on its development among young learners. The present study is one of the products of the academic unit project “Key Factors and Essential Elements for a Comprehensive Model of Bilingual Education: A Multidimensional Approach for Diverse Contexts and Areas of Knowledge” sponsored by the School of Education at Universidad de La Sabana, institution where the first author conducted her master’s studies, and the corresponding author is a professor and main researcher of the of the academic unit project. Method Six students aged 8-10 participated in the study. Data were collected through semi-structured observations and pre- and post-questionnaires. The tool was designed based on Zimmerman’s SRL model and included tasks structured through gamification elements. For the purpose of quantitative data analysis, descriptive statistics were used; as for qualitative data, thematic analysis was the chosen approach. Results The results revealed that guided use of the gamified tool significantly enhanced students’ use of SRL strategies, particularly in goal setting, monitoring progress, and reflecting on learning outcomes. Students demonstrated increased motivation, engagement, and confidence, although explicit instruction was required to maximize the tool’s benefits. The usability of the tool was rated positively, with participants highlighting its effectiveness for language learning and SRL skill development. Conclusions The study concludes that gamified virtual environments can effectively promote SRL skills in young language learners by fostering motivation and engagement. However, for optimal outcomes, such tools should be supplemented with explicit instruction in SRL strategies. This research contributes to understanding the integration of gamified tools in elementary education, highlighting their potential to develop foundational skills essential for lifelong learning.

                Drawing from historical accounts, cultural practices, archaeological discoveries, and indigenous technical knowledge, the research presents a critical review of varied aspects of the construction of the Konark temple and presents future research directions. To fulfill the purpose, documents were sourced from Scopus, Google Scholar, and ancient texts and palm leaves. Findings suggest the legacy of Narasimhadeva I, the Hindu monarch who remained undefeated during his reign, safeguarded the kingdom from encroaching Muslim rulers. The narrative highlights the bravery of a faithful elephant that revived the king on the battlefield. The Konark temple was built with the dual purpose of showcasing the glory of his victory and devotion to the Sun God. The ancient artisans’ knowledge, skills, and commitment were crucial in erecting this tallest temple structure. The investigation further illuminates the use of sea routes for transporting monumental stones, the ingenuity in laying the temple’s foundation, the selection of high-grade stones, the monumental task of lifting colossal stones, like the world’s heaviest stone hoisted to a height of about two hundred feet, the use of rust-resistant iron, and the application of advanced astronomical knowledge by ancient artisans. The study provides insights into ancient engineering ingenuity, encouraging further exploration of the enduring legacy of the Konark temple’s construction.

                Background The representation of women in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) is disproportionate to graduates from STEM fields. There is limited research addressing challenges facing women retention in STEM in the UAE. Methods A cross-sectional study using a validated questionnaire was conducted. A total of 165 participants were enrolled; 62% males and 35% females. Results More women believed there is gender inequality in STEM (47% versus 28%). 44% of female participants experienced gender inequality in their career. Men were significantly less likely to experience gender inequality (OR=0.06, 95% CI=0.02-0.16). Women reported lack of organizational emphasis on diversity and inclusion for promotion to leadership (44% versus 60%). Conclusion Data confirms gender-based preconceptions and biases in STEM fields. Institutional initiatives and policies to challenge stereotypes and promote gender equality are required. Governmental role is crucial in creating an inclusive environment for women scientists.

                Background/Purpose There are approximately 18.94 million visually impaired children worldwide, with 90% of them living in low-middle income countries. Research shows that visual impairment (VI) has a significant impact on the quality of life (QoL) of those affected. Therefore, it is essential to investigate how VI affects the daily activities of these children to develop management strategies that can help minimize its impact on their QoL. Therefore, qualitative research design was utilized to explore the perceived impact of VI on the daily activities of children living with VI. Methods Using a qualitative approach, purposive sampling was used to identify information-rich participants to partake in focus group discussions (FGDs) and address the aim of the study adequately. Identified data sources were divided into two groups: one with ‘experts’ who worked with children regularly, and another with school-going children aged 6-17 years, from three rural schools in Sekhukhune district, South Africa. The FGDs were guided by semi-structured interview questions. All sessions were recorded, transcribed verbatim, cleaned, coded, and analysed under ten domains, identified from the literature. Results A total of 477 statements and comments related to children’s vision were generated through the nine FGDs. Participants were nine experts working with children, and 49 children living with or without VI. Of the total number of statements, 60% (n = 287) were generated from FGDs with children, 63% (n = 299) were negative statements, and the remaining 19% (n = 92), and 18% (n = 86) were neutral and positive statements respectively. The most generated statements fell under the domains ‘Hobbies, Leisure and Sport’ 21% (n = 101), ‘Education’ 21% (n = 100), and ‘Psychological and Emotional’ 12.8% (n = 61). Conclusion This study offered comprehensive insights into the impact of VI on the daily activities of rural school-aged children and young people.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27166?af=R">Identifying Individuals in the Prodromal Phase of Parkinson's Disease: A Prospective Cohort Study</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>We prospectively evaluated how well combinations of signs and symptoms can identify individuals in the prodromal phase of Parkinson's disease (PD).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>The study comprised 6,108 men who underwent repeated assessments of key prodromal features and were prospectively followed for the development of PD. Two composite measures of prodromal PD were evaluated: (i) the co-occurrence of constipation, probable rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (pRBD), and hyposmia, and (ii) the probability of prodromal PD based on the Movement Disorders Society (MDS) research criteria. We also examined the progression and heterogeneity of the prodromal PD phase.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>One hundred three individuals were newly diagnosed with PD over an average follow-up of 3.4 years. Men with constipation, pRBD, and hyposmia had a 23-fold higher risk of receiving a PD diagnosis in the subsequent 3 years, compared with men without these features (risk ratio [RR] = 23.35, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 10.62–51.33). The risk of PD was 21-fold higher in men with a probability of prodromal PD ≥ 0.8 compared with those with a probability &lt; 0.2 (RR = 21.96, 95% CI = 11.17–43.17). Both the co-occurrence of the 3 non-motor features and an MDS-based probability ≥ 0.8 had comparable predictive values, and both were stronger predictors of PD than any of the features individually. We identified 2 prodromal PD subtypes where RBD and visual color impairment were key discriminators.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our study demonstrates that combinations of key signs and symptoms strongly predict future clinically manifest PD. These measures may be integrated into screening strategies to identify individuals who could be targeted for enrollment into PD prevention trials. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

                <p>Chromatin regulation plays a crucial role in neocortical neurogenesis, and mutations in chromatin modifiers are linked to neurodevelopmental disorders. RBBP4 is a core subunit of several chromatin-modifying complexes; however, its functional role and genome-wide occupancy profile in the neocortical primordium are unknown. To address this, we performed RBBP4 knockdown using CRISPR/Cas9 on neocortical progenitors derived from mice of both sexes at embryonic age 12.5 during deep layer neurogenesis. Our study demonstrates that downregulation of RBBP4 in the E12.5 neocortical progenitors reduced neuronal output, specifically affecting CTIP2-expressing neurons. We demonstrate that RBBP4 plays an essential role in regulating neocortical progenitor proliferation. However, overexpression of RBBP4 alone was not sufficient to regulate neuronal fate. Genome-wide occupancy analysis revealed that RBBP4 primarily binds to distal regulatory elements, and neuron differentiation is a significant GO biological pathway of RBBP4-bound genes. Interestingly, we found that RBBP4 binds to <I>Cdon</I>, a receptor protein in the Shh signaling pathway, and knockdown of <I>Cdon</I> phenocopies RBBP4 knockdown resulting in a significant reduction in neurogenesis, particularly CTIP2-expressing neurons. CDON overexpression could rescue the phenotype caused upon loss of RBBP4 in the neocortex, thereby suggesting the functional link between RBBP4 and its target gene CDON. Our results shed light on the cellular role of RBBP4 and identify CDON as a novel regulator of deep layer neurogenesis in the neocortical progenitors. Our findings are significant in the context of understanding how dysregulated chromatin regulation impacts cellular mechanisms in neurodevelopmental disorders.</p>

                <p>Delay discounting (DD) is a phenomenon where individuals devalue a reward associated with a temporal delay, with the rate of devaluation being representative of impulsive-like behavior. Here, we first sought to develop and validate a mouse DD task to study brain circuits involved in DD decision-making within short developmental time windows, given widespread evidence of developmental regulation of impulse control and risk-taking. We optimized a T-maze DD task for mice that enables training and DD trials within 2 weeks. Mice learned to choose between a large and a small reward located at opposite arms of a T-maze. Once training criteria were met, mice underwent DD whereby the large reward choice was associated with a temporal delay. Task validation showed that adolescent C57BL/6J mice display an increased preference for the small reward upon a temporal delay, confirming increased impulsivity compared with adults. We next used this DD task to explore the neural basis of decision-making. We used tyrosine hydroxylase transgenic mice (TH-Cre) to target TH-positive neurons in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and ventral tegmental area (VTA) with Cre-dependent excitatory or inhibitory designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs). Inhibition of transduced neurons in the NAc decreased preference for the small but immediate reward during DD. Inhibition of TH-positive neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) did not affect impulsive choice in this DD task. These results uncover a novel role for NAc TH-positive neurons in DD behavior and expand the repertoire of behavioral tasks available for studying decision-making across the lifespan.</p>

Neutrophil-derived LL-37, modified at the N terminus, failed to initiate autophagy, while native macrophage-derived LL-37 with an intact di-leucine motif at the N terminus was essential for this process. These findings offer a novel mechanism to control immune responses during infection and inflammation.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97227">CTFFIND5 provides improved insight into quality, tilt, and thickness of TEM samples</a></h4>

              
                Images taken by transmission electron microscopes are usually affected by lens aberrations and image defocus, among other factors. These distortions can be modeled in reciprocal space using the contrast transfer function (CTF). Accurate estimation and correction of the CTF is essential for restoring the high-resolution signal in cryogenic electron microscopy (cryoEM). Previously, we described the implementation of algorithms for this task in the <i>cis</i>TEM software package (Grant et al., 2018). Here we show that taking sample characteristics, such as thickness and tilt, into account can improve CTF estimation. This is particularly important when imaging cellular samples, where measurement of sample thickness and geometry derived from accurate modeling of the Thon ring pattern helps judging the quality of the sample. This improved CTF estimation has been implemented in CTFFIND5, a new version of the <i>cis</i>TEM program CTFFIND. We evaluated the accuracy of these estimates using images of tilted aquaporin crystals and eukaryotic cells thinned by focused ion beam milling. We estimate that with micrographs of sufficient quality CTFFIND5 can measure sample tilt with an accuracy of 3° and sample thickness with an accuracy of 5 nm.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/89674">A neuronal least-action principle for real-time learning in cortical circuits</a></h4>

              
                One of the most fundamental laws of physics is the principle of least action. Motivated by its predictive power, we introduce a neuronal least-action principle for cortical processing of sensory streams to produce appropriate behavioral outputs in real time. The principle postulates that the voltage dynamics of cortical pyramidal neurons prospectively minimizes the local somato-dendritic mismatch error within individual neurons. For output neurons, the principle implies minimizing an instantaneous behavioral error. For deep network neurons, it implies the prospective firing to overcome integration delays and correct for possible output errors right in time. The neuron-specific errors are extracted in the apical dendrites of pyramidal neurons through a cortical microcircuit that tries to explain away the feedback from the periphery, and correct the trajectory on the fly. Any motor output is in a moving equilibrium with the sensory input and the motor feedback during the ongoing sensory-motor transform. Online synaptic plasticity reduces the somatodendritic mismatch error within each cortical neuron and performs gradient descent on the output cost at any moment in time. The neuronal least-action principle offers an axiomatic framework to derive local neuronal and synaptic laws for global real-time computation and learning in the brain.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96926">Mitochondrial respiration atlas reveals differential changes in mitochondrial function across sex and age</a></h4>

              
                Organ function declines with age, and large-scale transcriptomic analyses have highlighted differential aging trajectories across tissues. The mechanism underlying shared and organ-selective functional changes across the lifespan, however, still remains poorly understood. Given the central role of mitochondria in powering cellular processes needed to maintain tissue health, we therefore undertook a systematic assessment of respiratory activity across 33 different tissues in young (2.5 months) and old (20 months) mice of both sexes. Our high-resolution mitochondrial respiration atlas reveals: (1) within any group of mice, mitochondrial activity varies widely across tissues, with the highest values consistently seen in heart, brown fat, and kidney; (2) biological sex is a significant but minor contributor to mitochondrial respiration, and its contributions are tissue-specific, with major differences seen in the pancreas, stomach, and white adipose tissue; (3) age is a dominant factor affecting mitochondrial activity, especially across most brain regions, different fat depots, skeletal muscle groups, eyes, and different regions of the gastrointestinal tract; (4) age effects can be sex- and tissue-specific, with some of the largest effects seen in pancreas, heart, adipose tissue, and skeletal muscle; and (5) while aging alters the functional trajectories of mitochondria in a majority of tissues, some are remarkably resilient to age-induced changes. Altogether, our data provide the most comprehensive compendium of mitochondrial respiration and illuminate functional signatures of aging across diverse tissues and organ systems.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98654">The emergence and evolution of gene expression in genome regions replete with regulatory motifs</a></h4>

              
                Gene regulation is essential for life and controlled by regulatory DNA. Mutations can modify the activity of regulatory DNA, and also create new regulatory DNA, a process called regulatory emergence. Non-regulatory and regulatory DNA contain motifs to which transcription factors may bind. In prokaryotes, gene expression requires a stretch of DNA called a promoter, which contains two motifs called –10 and –35 boxes. However, these motifs may occur in both promoters and non-promoter DNA in multiple copies. They have been implicated in some studies to improve promoter activity, and in others to repress it. Here, we ask whether the presence of such motifs in different genetic sequences influences promoter evolution and emergence. To understand whether and how promoter motifs influence promoter emergence and evolution, we start from 50 ‘promoter islands’, DNA sequences enriched with –10 and –35 boxes. We mutagenize these starting ‘parent’ sequences, and measure gene expression driven by 240,000 of the resulting mutants. We find that the probability that mutations create an active promoter varies more than 200-fold, and is not correlated with the number of promoter motifs. For parent sequences without promoter activity, mutations created over 1500 new –10 and –35 boxes at unique positions in the library, but only ~0.3% of these resulted in de-novo promoter activity. Only ~13% of all –10 and –35 boxes contribute to de-novo promoter activity. For parent sequences with promoter activity, mutations created new –10 and –35 boxes in 11 specific positions that partially overlap with preexisting ones to modulate expression. We also find that –10 and –35 boxes do not repress promoter activity. Overall, our work demonstrates how promoter motifs influence promoter emergence and evolution. It has implications for predicting and understanding regulatory evolution, de novo genes, and phenotypic evolution.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100173">Inclusive, exclusive and hierarchical atlas of NFATc1+/PDGFR-α+ cells in dental and periodontal mesenchyme</a></h4>

              
                Platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFR-α) activity is crucial in the process of dental and periodontal mesenchyme regeneration facilitated by autologous platelet concentrates (APCs), such as platelet-rich fibrin (PRF), platelet-rich plasma (PRP) and concentrated growth factors (CGF), as well as by recombinant PDGF drugs. However, it is largely unclear about the physiological patterns and cellular fate determinations of PDGFR-α<sup>+</sup> cells in the homeostasis maintaining of adult dental and periodontal mesenchyme. We previously identified NFATc1 expressing PDGFR-α<sup>+</sup> cells as a subtype of skeletal stem cells (SSCs) in limb bone in mice, but their roles in dental and periodontal remain unexplored. To this end, in the present study we investigated the spatiotemporal atlas of NFATc1<sup>+</sup> and PDGFR-α<sup>+</sup> cells residing in dental and periodontal mesenchyme in mice, their capacity for progeny cell generation, and their inclusive, exclusive and hierarchical relations in homeostasis. We utilized CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing to generate two dual recombination systems, which were Cre<i>-loxP</i> and Dre<i>-rox</i> combined intersectional and exclusive reporters respectively, to concurrently demonstrate the inclusive, exclusive, and hierarchical distributions of NFATc1<sup>+</sup> and PDGFR-α<sup>+</sup> cells and their lineage commitment. By employing the state-of-the-art transgenic lineage tracing techniques in cooperating with tissue clearing-based advanced imaging and three-dimensional slices reconstruction, we systematically mapped the distribution atlas of NFATc1<sup>+</sup> and PDGFR-α<sup>+</sup> cells in dental and periodontal mesenchyme and tracked their in vivo fate trajectories in mice. Our findings extend current understanding of NFATc1<sup>+</sup> and PDGFR-α<sup>+</sup> cells in dental and periodontal mesenchyme homeostasis, and furthermore enhance our comprehension of their sustained therapeutic impact for future clinical investigations.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98552">Streamlining segmentation of cryo-electron tomography datasets with Ais</a></h4>

              
                Segmentation is a critical data processing step in many applications of cryo-electron tomography. Downstream analyses, such as subtomogram averaging, are often based on segmentation results, and are thus critically dependent on the availability of open-source software for accurate as well as high-throughput tomogram segmentation. There is a need for more user-friendly, flexible, and comprehensive segmentation software that offers an insightful overview of all steps involved in preparing automated segmentations. Here, we present Ais: a dedicated tomogram segmentation package that is geared towards both high performance and accessibility, available on <a href="https://github.com/bionanopatterning/Ais">GitHub</a>. In this report, we demonstrate two common processing steps that can be greatly accelerated with Ais: particle picking for subtomogram averaging, and generating many-feature segmentations of cellular architecture based on in situ tomography data. Featuring comprehensive annotation, segmentation, and rendering functionality, as well as an open repository for trained models at aiscryoet.org, we hope that Ais will help accelerate research and dissemination of data involving cryoET.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/102222">A neurotrophin functioning with a Toll regulates structural plasticity in a dopaminergic circuit</a></h4>

              
                Experience shapes the brain as neural circuits can be modified by neural stimulation or the lack of it. The molecular mechanisms underlying structural circuit plasticity and how plasticity modifies behaviour are poorly understood. Subjective experience requires dopamine, a neuromodulator that assigns a value to stimuli, and it also controls behaviour, including locomotion, learning, and memory. In <i>Drosophila</i>, Toll receptors are ideally placed to translate experience into structural brain change. <i>Toll-6</i> is expressed in dopaminergic neurons (DANs), raising the intriguing possibility that Toll-6 could regulate structural plasticity in dopaminergic circuits. <i>Drosophila</i> neurotrophin-2 (DNT-2) is the ligand for Toll-6 and Kek-6, but whether it is required for circuit structural plasticity was unknown. Here, we show that <i>DNT-2</i>-expressing neurons connect with DANs, and they modulate each other. Loss of function for <i>DNT-2</i> or its receptors <i>Toll-6</i> and kinase-less Trk-like <i>kek-6</i> caused DAN and synapse loss, impaired dendrite growth and connectivity, decreased synaptic sites, and caused locomotion deficits. In contrast, over-expressed <i>DNT-2</i> increased DAN cell number, dendrite complexity, and promoted synaptogenesis. Neuronal activity modified DNT-2, increased synaptogenesis in DNT-2-positive neurons and DANs, and over-expression of DNT-2 did too. Altering the levels of DNT-2 or Toll-6 also modified dopamine-dependent behaviours, including locomotion and long-term memory. To conclude, a feedback loop involving dopamine and DNT-2 highlighted the circuits engaged, and DNT-2 with Toll-6 and Kek-6 induced structural plasticity in this circuit modifying brain function and behaviour.

">A comprehensive spatiotemporal map of dystrophin isoform expression in the developing and adult human brain</a></h4>

              
                Mutations in the dystrophin gene (DMD) cause the severe muscle-wasting disease Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD). Additionally, there is a high incidence of intellectual disability and neurobehavioural comorbidities in individuals with DMD. Similar behavioural abnormalities are found in mdx dystrophic mouse models. Unlike muscle, several dystrophin isoforms are expressed in the human brain, but a detailed map of regional and cellular localisation of dystrophin isoforms is missing. This is crucial in understanding the neuropathology of DMD individuals, and for evaluating the translatability of pre-clinical findings in DMD mouse models receiving genetic therapy interventions. Here, we provide a comprehensive dystrophin expression profile in human brains from early development to adulthood. We reveal expression of dp427p2, dp427c, dp427m and dp40 isoforms in embryonic brains, not previously reported. Dp427p2 and dp140 were greatly downregulated in adult brains, although the latter continued to be expressed across several regions. Importantly, we demonstrate for the first-time expression of DMD transcripts in human motor neurons and co-expression of different dystrophin isoforms within single neurons in both developing and adult brains. Finally, we show localisation of DMD transcripts with GAD1+ GABAergic-associated transcripts in neurons including cerebellar Purkinje cells and interneurons, as well as in the majority of neocortical and hippocampal SLC17A7+ glutamatergic neurones, suggesting a role for dystrophin in signalling at the neuronal inhibitory and excitatory synapses.

">Source to sensor coupling (SoSeC) as an effective tool to localize interacting sources from EEG and MEG data</a></h4>

              
                A standard approach to estimate interacting sources from EEG or MEG data is to first calculate a coupling between all pairs of voxels on a predefined grid within the brain and then average or maximize this coupling matrix along each column or row. Depending on the chosen coupling measure and grid size this approach can be computationally very costly, in particular when a bias is supposed to be removed. We here suggest to replace this approach by a maximization of coupling between each source and the signal in sensor space. The idea is that any neuronal activity which can be estimated from recorded data must be present in sensor space in the first place. Using the imaginary part of coherency as coupling measure makes sure that we do not confuse this source to sensor coupling with a coupling of a source to itself. We found that this approach is hundreds of times faster than the conventional approach. Results for EEG resting state data indicate that the new approach has more statistical power than the conventional approach. The presentation of this specific method is augmented with a discussion of conceptual issues for various forms of vector beamformers and eLoreta.

">Dietary iron deficiency in the adult mouse increases brain endothelial uptake and blood-brain barrier transport of a high-affinity, anti-transferrin receptor antibody</a></h4>

              
                Background and objectives: Brain capillary endothelial cells (BCECs) express transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) to ensure sufficient iron transport into the brain across the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Our main objective was to examine adult mice subjected to dietary iron deficiency (ID) for possible changes in the content of TfR1 in BCECs and the influence thereof on the uptake and transport of high-affinity anti-transferrin receptor IgG1 antibodies (clone Ri7217). Material and methods: We subjected adult, female mice to dietary ID for 8 weeks. Iron and copper were measured using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) in various tissues, including total brain and isolated brain capillaries. Possible effects of ID on cerebral angioarchitecture were estimated using 3D confocal microscopy of optically cleared brain samples with endothelium labelled using intravenous injection of wheat germ agglutinin with subsequent machine learning-based segmentation and vascular tracing. TfR1 was quantified using ELISA. Ri7217 antibodies were conjugated with 1 nm nanogold and brain uptake quantified using ICP-MS. Results: ID significantly reduced the iron content in isolated brain capillaries, liver, spleen, kidney, heart and skeletal muscles. ID increased the copper content in the brain. Analysis of cerebral cortex angioarchitecture revealed no changes following dietary ID except for a minor increase in tortuosity of small-caliber vessels. TfR1 protein was unchanged in the total brain and isolated brain capillaries. In contrast, uptake of nanogold-conjugated Ri7217 increased in the total brain, the supernatant fraction of isolated brain capillaries representing the post-vascular compartment, liver, spleen, and dissected retinae. Conclusions: Targeting TfR1 in ID revealed increased uptake and transport across the BBB of Ri7217 antibodies. Possibly the elevated transport of transferrin receptors through BCECs is due to the increased trafficking of transferrin receptor-containing vesicles in ID, which appeared to have no major effects on the brain angioarchitecture.

">Food-entrainment of circadian timekeeping in the dorsal vagal complex</a></h4>

              
                The dorsal vagal complex (DVC) is a multi-component brainstem satiety centre which has gained attention as a key target of anti-obesity pharmacotherapies. Our recent studies revealed its circadian timekeeping properties, with molecular and electrophysiological 24h rhythms persisting independently of the primary hypothalamic clock. However, the factors entraining these brainstem oscillators, and the downstream transcriptional targets of the DVC molecular clock remain unclear. Here, using fluorescent in situ hybridisation, we demonstrate core clock gene expression in inhibitory and excitatory neuronal populations of the DVC, as well as in its output cholinergic vagal neurons. We further reveal that the molecular clock is associated with rhythmic expression of numerous neurotransmitter receptor genes in the DVC in vivo, with the phase of both clock and clock-controlled gene expression tightly regulated by meal timing. These findings uncover food-entrained circadian rhythms in the DVC and have important implications for clinical studies targeting brainstem satiety mechanisms.

">Stimulation parameters shape effective connectivity pathways: insights from microstate analysis on TMS-evoked potentials</a></h4>

              
                Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)-evoked potentials (TEPs) represent an innovative measure for examining brain connectivity and developing biomarkers of psychiatric conditions. Minimising TEP variability across studies and participants, which may stem from methodological choices, is therefore vital. By combining classic peak analysis and microstate investigation, we tested how TMS pulse waveform and current direction may affect effective connectivity when targeting the primary motor cortex (M1). We aim to disentangle whether changing these parameters affects the degree of activation of the same neural circuitry or may lead to changes in the pathways through which the induced activation spreads. Thirty-two healthy participants underwent a TMS-EEG experiment in which the pulse waveform (monophasic, biphasic) and current direction (posterior-anterior, anterior-posterior, latero-medial) were manipulated. We assessed the latency and amplitude of M1-TEP components and employed microstate analyses to test differences in topographies. Results revealed that TMS parameters strongly influenced M1-TEP components' amplitude but had a weaker role over their latencies. Importantly, microstate analysis showed that the current direction in monophasic stimulations changed the pattern of evoked microstates at the early TEP latencies, as well as their duration and the overall amount of activated brain resources associated. This study shows that the current direction of monophasic pulses may modulate cortical sources contributing to TEP signals, activating neural populations and cortico-cortical paths more selectively. Biphasic stimulation reduces the variability associated with current direction and may be better suited when TMS targeting is blind to anatomical information.

">Molecular architecture of human dermal sleeping nociceptors</a></h4>

              
                Human dermal sleeping nociceptors display ongoing activity in neuropathic pain, affecting 10% of the population. Despite advances in rodents, a molecular marker for these mechano-insensitive C-fibers (CMis) in human skin remains elusive, preventing targeted therapy. In this translational Patch-seq study, we combine single-cell transcriptomics following electrophysiological characterization with single-nucleus and spatial transcriptomics from pigs and humans. We functionally identified CMis in pig sensory neurons with patch-clamp using adapted protocols from human microneurography. We identified oncostatin-M-receptor (OSMR) and somatostatin (SST) as marker genes for CMis. Following dermal injection in healthy human volunteers, oncostatin-M, the ligand of OSMR, exclusively modulates CMis. We identified the entire molecular architecture of human dermal sleeping nociceptors, providing new therapeutic targets and the basis for a mechanistic understanding of neuropathic pain.

">Aberrant Neuronal Synchronization Associated with Cognitive Deficits in a Rodent Model of Childhood Cranial Irradiation</a></h4>

              
                Cranial radiation can be a life-saving intervention in pediatric brain cancer therapy but often results in debilitating cognitive decline. To clarify the underlying mechanisms of these side-effects we have here recorded neurophysiological activity in distributed brain networks involved in decision-making and memory functions in adult rats exposed to cranial irradiation on postnatal day 21. Multi-structure local field potential (LFP) recordings revealed decreased power in irradiated animals in the 4-9 Hz frequency band. Additionally, a distinct slowing of the oscillatory activity was observed preceding erroneous choice in a decision-making task. Moreover, irradiated rats showed reduced dynamics and a fragmented pattern of inter-structural coherence across different phases of the task. Our results suggest that the cognitive deficits and reduced processing speed following irradiation of the juvenile brain arise as a consequence of changes in long-range functional connectivity, including thalamocortical circuits, causing abnormally slow and spatially fractionated patterns of coordinating LFP activity.

">Distinct roles for MNK1 and MNK2 in social and cognitive behavior through kinase-specific regulation of the synaptic proteome and phosphoproteome</a></h4>

              
                Local mRNA translation is required for adaptive changes in the synaptic proteome. The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) interacting protein kinases 1 and 2 (MNK1 and MNK2) have emerged as key regulators of neuronal translation, primarily through phosphorylation of the eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E). The therapeutic benefits of targeting the MNKs are being investigated for nervous system conditions and disorders that affect translation, including autism, pain, and cancer. However, it is still unclear if MNK1 and MNK2 regulate distinct aspects of neuronal translation and how the activity of each kinase is associated with the synaptic and behavioral features linked to MNK signaling. To examine the individual neurobiological functions of each kinase, we used knockout mice lacking either MNK1 or MNK2. We found that the knockout of MNK1 and MNK2 leads to different social and cognitive behavioral profiles and distinct alterations of the cortical synaptic proteome, transcriptome, and phosphoproteome. Loss of MNK1 was associated with an increase in ribosomal protein expression, whereas deletion of MNK2 decreased the expression and phosphorylation of synaptic proteins. Together, our findings provide evidence for a high degree of functional specialization of the MNKs in synaptic compartments and suggest that pharmacological inhibition of individual MNK may provide more specific targets for neurological disorders.

">Binding items to contexts through conjunctive neural representations with the Method of Loci</a></h4>

              
                Schematic prior knowledge can provide a powerful scaffold for episodic memories, yet the neural mechanisms underlying this scaffolding process are still poorly understood. A crucial step of the scaffolding process is the way in which details of a new episode are connected to an existing schema, forming a robust memory representation that can be easily accessed in the future. A unique testbed for studying this binding process is a mnemonic technique called the Method of Loci (MoL), in which people meaningfully connect items to be remembered with a well-learned list of imagined loci. We collected fMRI data from participants in 3 longitudinal sessions while they were enrolled in a month-long MoL training course, all of whom showed dramatic improvements in their ability to remember lists of 20 or 40 words. We obtained neural patterns when the loci and objects are presented by themselves, when they are combined into an integrated representation at encoding, and when the integrated representation was subsequently retrieved, as well as verbal descriptions from the participants about the way they associated each item to each locus. We found that in default mode network regions, including medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), the combined representations of loci and items are highly conjunctive: the unified locus-item representation was substantially different from a linear combination of the isolated locus and item representation, reflecting the addition of new integrative details specific to each combined pair. The conjunctive component of the representation reflected the particular creative details generated by individual participants and increased over time as participants gained expertise in MoL. Our findings reveal a critical role for the default mode network in creating meaningful connections between new information and well-learned schematic contexts.

">Does Precision Grip Research Extend to Unconstrained, Multidigit Grasping?</a></h4>

              
                Most daily tasks require using our hands. Whether taking a sip from a glass or throwing a ball, we effortlessly select appropriate grasps. Yet, despite many possible hand configurations, most grasping research has focused on the finger-and-thumb precision grip. We thus questioned whether findings on precision grip hold under unconstrained grasping conditions. To test this, we compared how participants grasped 3D objects made of brass and wood, with both precision grip and unconstrained grasps. When unconstrained, participants rarely selected precision grips, favoring multi-digit grasps. Nevertheless, in both conditions, participants shifted grasps towards the objects center of mass and, when grasp factors conflicted, the variability in their selections increased, indicating greater uncertainty about the optimal strategy. Further, despite favoring multidigit grasps, participants consistently placed the thumb and index finger on the same positions on the objects, suggesting that in multidigit grasps, the additional fingers primarily provided support. Our findings thus reveal that object material affects unconstrained grasping similarly to precision grip and imply that previous precision grip research may extend to unconstrained, multidigit conditions.

">Upright stance is controlled close to critical stability across different postures</a></h4>

              
                Feedback stabilization of upright standing postures should be reflected by a time-lagged relationship between the ground reaction force (GRF) and the center of mass (COM) state. In this study, we propose a model relating corrective ground reaction forces (Fcorr) to preceding COM position (PCOM) and velocity (VCOM). We first checked the model's validity by simulating an inverted pendulum model with known intrinsic and feedback parameters, to see if we could identify the feedback parameters. Next, we tested this model in 14 young adult volunteers standing in different postures. Our model effectively reconstructed Fcorr in both simulations (R2: 0.50~0.99) and human experimental data (R2: 0.76~0.99). Strikingly, estimated position and velocity gains were similar across postures even between bipedal and unipedal standing, with the position gain slightly above critical stiffness. The estimated delay in normal standing (246{+/-}21ms) was significantly larger than that in unipedal standing and step posture (204{+/-}24ms and 193{+/-}29ms, respectively). In conclusion, our results support that an estimate of the COM state is used to generate corrective ground reaction forces to stabilize upright posture, and our feedback model can be used to characterize this control mechanism. The proposed model requires only easily measurable inputs which may yield value in assessment of balance disorders. Notably, our results showed that stability of upright stance is achieved by maintaining feedback gains at levels just above critical stability.

">Neurons and molecules involved in noxious light sensation in Caenorhabditis elegans</a></h4>

              
                Ultraviolet (UV) light is dangerous to unpigmented organisms, inducing photodamage of cells and DNA. The transparent nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, despite having no eyes, detects light and exhibits negative phototaxis in order to evade sunlight. UV absorption is detected by the photosensor protein LITE-1, that also responds to reactive oxygen species. We investigated which neurons act as noxious photosensors and how they transmit the sensation to the nervous system to evoke escape behavior. We identified the interneuron AVG as a main focus of LITE-1 function in mediating the noxious light evoked escape behavior, with minor roles of the interneuron PVT, the sensory ASK neurons and touch receptor neurons. AVG is activated by blue light, and its optogenetic stimulation causes escape behavior. Signaling from AVG involves chemical neurotransmission, likely directly to premotor interneurons, and to other cells, by extrasynaptic signaling through the neuropeptide NLP-10. NLP-10 signaling is not required for the acute response, but for maintaining responsiveness to repeated noxious stimuli. The source of NLP-10 is largely AVG, however, also other cells contribute, possibly PVT, expressing both LITE-1 and NLP-10. This work uncovers entry points of sensory information to the neuronal circuits mediating the behavioral response to noxious UV/blue light.

">Parental kynurenine 3-monooxygenase genotype in mice directs sex-specific behavioral outcomes in offspring</a></h4>

              
                Background: Disruptions in brain development can impact behavioral traits and increase the risk of neurodevelopmental conditions such as autism spectrum disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder, often in sex-specific ways. Dysregulation of the kynurenine pathway (KP) of tryptophan metabolism has been implicated in cognitive and neurodevelopmental disorders. Increased brain kynurenic acid (KYNA), a neuroactive metabolite implicated in cognition and sleep homeostasis, and variations in the Kmo gene, which encodes kynurenine 3-monooxygenase (KMO), have been identified in these patients. We hypothesize that parental Kmo genetics influence KP biochemistry, sleep behavior and brain energy demands, contributing to impairments in cognition and sleep in offspring through the influence of parental genotype and genetic nurture mechanisms. Methods: A mouse model of partial Kmo deficiency, Kmo heterozygous (HET-Kmo+/-), was used to examine brain KMO activity, KYNA levels, and sleep behavior in HET-Kmo+/- compared to wild-type control (WT-Control) mice. Brain mitochondrial respiration was assessed, and KP metabolites and corticosterone levels were measured in breast milk. Behavioral assessments were conducted on wild-type offspring from two parental groups: i) WT-Control from WT-Control parents, ii) wild-type Kmo (WT-Kmo+/+) from Kmo heterozygous parents (HET-Kmo+/-). All mice were C57Bl/6J background strain. Adult female and male offspring underwent behavioral testing for learning, memory, anxiety-like behavior and sleep-wake patterns. Results: HET-Kmo+/- mice exhibited reduced brain KMO activity, increased KYNA levels, and disrupted sleep architecture and electroencephalogram (EEG) power spectra. Mitochondrial respiration (Complex I and complex II activity) and electron transport chain protein levels were impaired in the hippocampus of HET-Kmo+/- females. Breast milk from HET-Kmo+/- mothers increased kynurenine exposure during lactation but corticosterone levels were unchanged. Compared to WT-Control offspring, WT-Kmo+/+ females showed impaired spatial learning, heightened anxiety, reduced sleep and abnormal EEG spectral power. WT-Kmo+/+ males had deficits in reversal learning but no sleep disturbances or anxiety-like behaviors. Conclusions: These findings suggest that Kmo deficiency impacts KP biochemistry, sleep behavior, and brain mitochondrial function. Even though WT-Kmo+/+ inherit identical genetic material as WT-Control, their development might be shaped by parental physiology, behavior, or metabolic state influenced by their Kmo genotype, leading to phenotypic sex-specific differences in offspring.

">The impact of human agents on spatial navigation and knowledge acquisition in a Virtual Environment</a></h4>

              
                Concepts of spatial navigation rest on the idea of landmarks, which are immobile features or objects in the environment. However, behaviorally relevant objects or fellow humans are often mobile. This raises the question of how the presence of human agents influences spatial exploration and knowledge acquisition. Here, we investigate exploration and performance in subsequent spatial tasks within a virtual environment containing numerous human avatars. In the exploration phase, agents had a locally limited effect on navigation. They prompted participants to revisit locations with agents during their initial exploration without significantly altering overall exploration patterns or the extent of the area covered. However, agents and buildings competed for visual attention. When spatial recall was tested, pointing accuracy toward buildings improved when participants directed their attention to the buildings and nearby agents. In contrast, pointing accuracy for agents showed weaker performance and did not benefit from visual attention directed toward the adjacent building. Active agents and incongruent agent-environment pairings further enhanced pointing accuracy, revealing that violations of expectations by agents can significantly shape navigational knowledge acquisition. Overall, agents influenced spatial exploration by directing attention locally, with the interaction between agent salience and environmental features playing a key role in shaping navigational knowledge acquisition.

">Cortical connectivity, local dynamics and stability correlates of global conscious states</a></h4>

              
                Consciousness emerges from complex neural processes, yet its precise neurobiological correlates remain uncertain. Here a space-time-resolved inference-based framework is applied to estimate the neurophysiological variables of a whole-cortex model and analyze the neural mechanism correlates of global consciousness by way of a correlation analysis between behavioural and neural variable time-series. Using magnetoencephalography (MEG) data from 15 participants under Xenon-induced anesthesia, interconnected neural mass models (NMMs) were developed and time-evolving regional neurophysiological variables and inter-regional connectivity strengths were inferred from the data. Analyses revealed significant correlations between consciousness levels and inter-regional connectivity, particularly in posterior parietal, occipital, and prefrontal regions. Moreover, results support a parietal, rather than frontal, network backbone to facilitate global consciousness. Regional-level analyses further identified correlates of consciousness within the posterior parietal and occipital regions. Lastly, reductions in consciousness were linked to stabilized cortical dynamics, reflected by changes in the eigenmodes of the system. This framework provides a novel, inference-based approach to investigating consciousness, offering a time-resolved perspective on neural mechanism correlates during altered states.

">Test-retest reliability of TMS-evoked potentials over fMRI-based definitions of non-motor cortical targets</a></h4>

              
                Objective: This study assessed the test-retest reliability of TMS evoked potentials (TEPs) across two cortical regions: dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), and angular gyrus in comparison to motor cortex (M1), using individualized and literature based targeting approaches. The study compared the reliability of single pulse TMS, short interval intracortical inhibition (SICI), and long-interval intracortical inhibition (LICI) protocols to evaluate TEP consistency in these regions. Methods: Seventeen healthy participants underwent two TMS EEG sessions spaced by at least one week, with targets for DLPFC and angular gyrus identified using resting-state functional connectivity (RS) and Neurosynth based functional overlays. Motor cortex was targeted using resting motor threshold (RMT). Early TEPs were quantified as peak-to-peak amplitude. Test retest reliability of early TEPs was calculated using the concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) for each region and protocol. Results: M1 demonstrated the highest TEP reliability (CCCmean = 0.59), while DLPFC (CCCmean = 0.40) and angular gyrus (CCCmean = 0.45) showed lower reliability, particularly for anterior DLPFC targets. Neurosynth-based DLPFC targets exhibited slightly higher CCC values (mean CCC = 0.57) compared to RS-based targets (mean CCC = 0.30), but the difference was not statistically significant. No significant differences in reliability were found across single pulse and paired pulse protocols. Lateral targets, DLPFC and angular gyrus, showed lower reliability in comparison to motor cortex which might have been caused by muscle artifacts. Conclusion: While individualized functional targeting methods provide advantages in engaging specific brain networks, their reliability for TEP measurements remains lower than the RMT-based approach for motor cortex. Future studies should integrate neuroimaging-based targeting with real time TEP monitoring to enhance reliability in non-motor regions. This approach could enhance the precision of TMS EEG protocols, especially for clinical applications targeting cortical regions like the DLPFC and angular gyrus.

">A hybrid micro-ECoG for functionally targeted multi-site and multi-scale investigation</a></h4>

              
                Brain function relies on the coordination of activity across a wide range of spatial and temporal scales. The activity of single neurons depends on their unique pattern of local and long-range connectivity and thus on the coordination of local activity with large-scale patterns of distributed activity across brain-wide networks. Understanding integrated, whole brain function requires new tools capable of recording from anatomically connected populations in distributed brain areas to bridge local and global dynamics. Here, we present high-density, micro-electrocorticography arrays that facilitate multi-scale studies of brain activity. The arrays are hybrid designs that integrate the desirable features of silicone elastomers and polyimide films. The silicone elastomer superstructure provides optical transparency and permits repeated mechanical penetration with rigid linear electrode arrays. The polyimide films provide the capacity for fine feature definition through photolithography. This combination facilitates high-throughput functional mapping of areas of interest to target functionally characterized populations for refined, dense sampling. We demonstrate the suitability of the technique for functional mapping of cortical regions in rats, cats and marmosets and the benefit of the resulting functional maps for targeting functionally defined populations for dense, multi-area laminar recordings. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of the hybrid micro-ECoG to localize optogenetically evoked feedforward excitation in down-stream cortical regions to investigate cortico-cortical interactions. Together, these capabilities make the hybrid micro-ECoG a compelling tool for systems neuroscience.

                Autistic traits may arise from atypical sensory experience during postnatal life, but whether there is a causal link between defects in cortical circuitry in the brain, altered sensory processing and social behavior remains unknown. Here, we studied tactile stimuli processing in the barrel cortex (BC) and social interactions in juvenile male mice lacking Cyclin-dependent kinase-like 5 (CDKL5), a model of a severe neurodevelopmental disease showing autistic traits and sensory impairments. We identified in these mice defects of whisker-dependent postnatal sensorimotor reflexes, NMDA receptors-dependent signaling, and dendritic orientation in thalamic inputs-receiving spiny stellate neurons. We also found that CDKL5 is required for mapping and processing whisker-derived tactile stimuli in the BC. Intriguingly, KO mice show autistic traits at p21 that are rescued by neonatal CDKL5 replacement in the BC. Our data suggest that CDKL5 is required to link tactile processing in the BC to the onset of social interaction abilities.

">Birthdate aligns vestibular sensory neurons with central and motor partners across a sensorimotor reflex circuit for gaze stabilization</a></h4>

              
                Developing populations of connected neurons often share spatial and/or temporal features that anticipate their assembly. A unifying spatiotemporal motif might link sensory, central, and motor populations that comprise an entire circuit. In the sensorimotor reflex circuit that stabilizes vertebrate gaze, central and motor partners are paired in time (birthdate) and space (dorso-ventral). To determine if birthdate and/or dorso-ventral organization could align the entire circuit, we measured the spatial and temporal development of the sensory circuit node: the vestibular ganglion neurons. We discovered progressive dorsal-to-ventral development in the vestibular ganglion that diverges from its functional (rostrocaudal) organization. With an acute optical lesion and calcium imaging paradigm, we found that this common spatiotemporal axis anticipated functional sensory-to-central partner matching. We propose a "first-come, first-served" model in which birthdate organizes the sensory, central, and motor populations that comprise the gaze stabilization circuit. Our work suggests a general means for poly-synaptic circuit assembly across embryonically-diverse neural populations.

">Widespread Distribution of α-Synuclein Oligomers in LRRK2-related Parkinson's Disease</a></h4>

              
                Mutations in leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) are the most common cause of familial and sporadic Parkinson's disease (PD). While the clinical features of LRRK2-PD patients resemble those of typical PD, there are significant differences in the pathological findings. The pathological hallmark of definite PD is the presence of -synuclein (SYN)-positive Lewy-related pathology; however, approximately half of LRRK2-PD cases do not have Lewy-related pathology. Lewy-related pathology is a late-stage SYN aggregation that can be visualized with hematoxylin and eosin stains or conventional immunohistochemistry (IHC). Increasing evidence has indicated that SYN oligomers, which represent the early-stage of SYN aggregation, may have neurotoxicity. Visualization of SYN oligomers requires specialized staining techniques, such as SYN-proximity ligation assay (PLA). The distribution and severity of SYN oligomers in the human brain of LRRK2-PD patients remain unknown. In this study, we performed phosphorylated SYN-IHC and SYN-PLA staining on postmortem brain sections of patients with three pathogenic LRRK2 mutants: p.G2019S (n=5), p.I2020T (n=5), and p.R1441C (n=4). The severity of Lewy-related pathology and SYN oligomers were assessed semi-quantitatively in the brainstem, limbic lobe, basal ganglia, and cerebral cortex. SYN oligomers were detected in LRRK2-PD cases even in cases without Lewy-related pathology; a negative correlation was observed between Lewy-related pathology and SYN oligomers (r=-0.26 [-0.39, -0.12]; P<0.0001). Our findings suggest that SYN oligomers may represent a common pathological feature of LRRK2-PD. Notably, patients harboring p.G2019S and p.I2020T had significantly higher levels of SYN oligomers in those without Lewy-related pathology compared to those with Lewy-related pathology. These cases also had a trend toward shorter disease duration. These results imply that in LRRK2-PD, SYN oligomers may initially accumulate in the brain but do not progress to form Lewy-related pathology. The present study suggests that targeting SYN oligomers may be a therapeutic strategy for LRRK2-PD even if there is no Lewy-related pathology.

">Abundant non-inclusion α-synuclein pathology in Lewy body-negative LRRK2-mutant cases</a></h4>

              
                Lewy body diseases are common neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies, which lead to both motor and non-motor symptoms. They are neuropathologically characterized by loss of neuromelanized neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta and -synuclein-immunopositive inclusions (Lewy bodies) in several types of neurons in the brain. A fraction of monogenic PD cases, however, represent a conundrum, as they can present with clinical Lewy body disease but do not have Lewy bodies upon neuropathological examination. For LRRK2, the presence or absence of Lewy bodies is not related to any specific mutation in the gene and different clinical presentation and neuropathology can be present even in the same family. Here, we present the first evidence of widespread -synuclein accumulation detected with proximity ligation assay (PLA) using the MJFR14-6-4-2 antibody in six Lewy body-negative LRRK2 cases and compare the levels with five patients with neuropathologically-verified Lewy body disease cases and six healthy controls. We show that non-inclusion, aggregated -synuclein PLA signal is dominant in the LRRK2 cases, while Lewy-like PLA signal is predominant in late-stage Lewy body disease. Furthermore, LRRK2 cases displayed prominent PLA signal in pontocerebellar tracts and inferior olivary nuclei in the brainstem, which was not seen in idiopathic PD cases. These results suggest that Lewy-body negative -synuclein aggregation in neurons but rather a deficiency in the formation of inclusions.

">Theory of axo-axonic inhibition</a></h4>

              
                The axon initial segment of principal cells of the cortex and hippocampus is contacted by GABAergic interneurons called chandelier cells. The anatomy, as well as alterations in neurological diseases such as epilepsy, suggest that chandelier cells exert an important inhibitory control on action potential initiation. However, their functional role remains unclear, including whether their effect is indeed inhibitory or excitatory. One reason is that there is a relative gap in electrophysiological theory about the electrical effect of axo-axonic synapses. This contribution uses resistive coupling theory, a simplification of cable theory based on the observation that the small initial segment is resistively coupled to the large cell body acting as a current sink, to fill this gap. The main theoretical finding is that a synaptic input at the proximal axon shifts the action potential threshold by an amount equal to the product of synaptic conductance, driving force at threshold, and axial axonal resistance between the soma and either the synapse or of the middle of the initial segment, whichever is closer. The theory produces quantitative estimates useful to interpret experimental observations, and supports the idea that axo-axonic cells can potentially exert powerful inhibitory control on action potential initiation.

">Capturing Dynamic Neuronal Responses to Dominant and Subordinate Social Hierarchy Members with catFISH</a></h4>

              
                Dominance hierarchies are key to social organization in group-living species, requiring individuals to recognize their own and others' ranks. This is particularly complex for intermediate-ranking animals, who navigate interactions with higher- and lower-ranking individuals. Using in situ hybridization, we examined how the brains of intermediate-ranked mice in hierarchies respond to dominant and subordinate stimuli by labeling activity-induced immediate early genes and neuronal markers. We show that distinct neuronal populations in the amygdala and hippocampus respond differentially across social contexts. In the basolateral amygdala, glutamatergic Slc17a7+ neurons, particularly dopamine-receptive Slc17a7+Drd1+ neurons, show elevated IEG expression in response to social stimuli, with a higher response to dominant over subordinate animals. Similar patterns are observed among Slc17a7+Oxtr+ neurons in the dorsal endopiriform nucleus and GABAergic Slc32a+ neurons in the medial amygdala. We also identified distinct neural ensembles selectively active in response to dominant and subordinate hierarchy members. We find a higher degree of reactivation among Slc17a7+Oxtr+ ensembles in the dorsal endopiriform nucleus in animals repeatedly presented with the same hierarchy member, as opposed to those presented with a dominant and subordinate member. We observe a similar pattern among Oxtr+ neurons in the dentate gyrus hilus, while the inverse is observed among Slc17a7+ Avrp1b+Oxtr+ neurons in the distal CA2CA3 region. Collectively, our findings reveal how social context is associated with activity changes in social, olfactory, and memory systems in the brain at the neuronal cell type level. This work lays the foundation for further precise cell-type investigation into how the brain processes social information.

">Task and Behavior-Related Variables Are Encoded by the Postrhinal and Medial Entorhinal Cortex During Non-Spatial Associative Learning</a></h4>

              
                The medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) is pivotal in spatial computations and episodic memory. However, it remains elusive whether MEC could play a more general role in different types of associative learning and how the representations develop during the learning process. It has been shown that the postrhinal cortex (POR), which is directly connected to MEC, integrates visual stimuli with salient outcomes. Here, we use a non-spatial visual association task to investigate whether MEC neurons represent low-level visual cues during learning. Using a Go/NoGo visual association task, we recorded neural activity in MEC and POR throughout the learning phase as mice associated drifting gratings with rewarded, aversive, or neutral outcomes. Our findings reveal that the neural tuning curves in both the POR and MEC change with the learning of the task. From the start of training, the POR neurons exhibited response tuning to the visual cues, and the tuning was stable to cue orientations during learning. In contrast, MEC neurons did not initially respond very strongly to visual cues but developed a robust tuning toward the rewarded trials. While the MEC representation of visual information was limited, it encoded other task elements. A large fraction of the neurons formed distinct functional clusters that were either activated or suppressed by reward-related behavior. Remarkably, these clusters segregated anatomically in MEC and maintained strong within-cluster correlations before and after training. Notably, although the same functional clusters were apparent in the POR, they did not show any anatomical structure as in the MEC. Task reversal induced significant changes in network responses across both regions, with a decrease in overall task-responsive neurons but a slight increase in stimulus representation. Strikingly, information about the choice to lick emerged with learning in both brain areas, and most significantly within the functional cell clusters representing reward consumption and plus-cue stimulus. Our results demonstrate that although neurons in MEC and POR develop behavior-modulated tuning during learning of a non-spatial visual association task, the MEC exhibits stronger within-cluster correlations and anatomical organization. Conversely, the POR population exhibits less structural organization and more specific stimulus-tuning, which is reflective of being a higher visual association area. Our findings reveal that the MEC can encode task- and behavior-related variables beyond spatial information.

                Sparse coding enables cortical populations to represent sensory inputs efficiently, yet its temporal dynamics remain poorly understood. Consistent with theoretical predictions, we show that stimulus onset triggers broad cortical activation, initially reducing sparseness and increasing mutual information. Subsequently, competitive interactions sustain mutual information as activity declines and sparseness increases. Notably, coding efficiency, defined as the ratio of mutual information to metabolic cost, progressively increases, demonstrating the dynamic optimization of sensory representations.

">Cell type transcriptional identities are maintained in cultured ex vivo human brain tissue</a></h4>

              
                It is becoming more broadly accepted that human-based models are needed to better understand the complexities of the human nervous system and its diseases. The recently developed human brain organotypic culture model is one highly promising model that requires the involvement of neurosurgeons and neurosurgical patients. Studies have investigated the electrophysiological properties of neurons in such ex vivo human tissues, but the maintenance of other cell types within explanted brain remains largely unknown. Here, using single-nucleus RNA sequencing, we systematically evaluate the transcriptional identities of the various cell types found in six patient samples after fourteen days in culture (83,501 nuclei from day 0 samples and 45,738 nuclei from day 14 samples). We used two pediatric temporal lobectomy samples, an adult frontal cortex sample, two IDH wild-type glioblastoma samples, and one medulloblastoma sample. We found remarkably high correlations of day 14 transcriptional identities to day 0 tissue, especially in tumor cells (r = 0.87 to 0.95), though microglia (r = 0.86), inhibitory neurons (r = 0.80), and oligodendrocytes (r = 0.75) showed strong preservation of their transcriptional profiles as well. Astrocytes and excitatory neurons showed more moderate preservation (r = 0.65 and 0.54, respectively). Because the main difficulty with organotypic brain cultures is the acquisition of human tissue, which is readily available to neurosurgeons, this model is easily accessible to neurosurgeon-scientists and neurosurgeons affiliated with research laboratories. Broad uptake of this more representative model should prompt advances in our understanding of these uniquely human diseases, lead to more reliable clinical trial performance, and ultimately yield better therapies for our patients.

">Neuronal fatty acid oxidation fuels memory after intensive learning</a></h4>

              
                Metabolic flexibility allows cells to adapt to different fuel sources, which is particularly important for cells with high metabolic demands. In contrast, neurons, which are major energy consumers, are considered to rely almost solely on glucose and its derivatives to support their metabolism [ref 1-3]. Here, using Drosophila melanogaster, we show memory formed after intensive massed training is dependent on mitochondrial fatty acid (FA) {beta}-oxidation to produce ATP in neurons of the mushroom bodies (MB), a major integrative center in insects' brain. We identify neuronal lipid droplets as the main source of FAs for this type of memory. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this intensive massed training is associated with mitochondria network remodeling in the soma of MB neurons, resulting in increased mitochondrial size. Artificially increasing mitochondria size in adult MB neurons increases ATP production in their soma and, at the behavioral level, strikingly results in improved memory performance after massed training. These findings challenge the prevailing view that neurons are unable to use FAs for energy production, and importantly revealing on the contrary that in vivo neuronal FA oxidation has an essential role in cognitive function, including memory formation.

">Online interference of declarative memory on fast and slow adaptive processes in force field motor learning</a></h4>

              
                Error-based motor adaptation is currently understood as a dual-rate process involving a fast adaptive process that learns quickly but also decays rapidly and a slow process that learns slowly but has good retention. While the fast process is typically categorized as procedural learning, recent evidence suggests that it relies on the declarative memory system. To test this hypothesis, we investigated in what manner a declarative memory task interferes with two processes that supposedly underly force field adaptation in reaching. This declarative memory task, which involved learning of a list of words, was assessed through either recognition or recall, and was compared to a non-declarative, vowel counting task, using a within-subject design (n=32). We employed a Bayesian hierarchical dual-rate process model to capture the observed force compensation across trials, expecting that the parameters of the fast process would be affected by the declarative memory task. We examined the 95% highest density interval of the posterior distribution of the difference between the experimental and control condition for each parameter. While most parameters remained unaffected by the declarative memory task, the retention rate of the fast process showed a hint of reduction, suggesting a complex interplay between declarative memory and ongoing motor adaptation processes.

">Psychedelic enhancement of flexible learning weeks after a single dose</a></h4>

              
                Psychedelic drugs have shown therapeutic potential for the treatment of multiple neuropsychiatric disorders chiefly by promoting long-lasting plasticity in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). A critical function of the PFC is the ability to apply previously learned rules to novel scenarios, a skill known as cognitive flexibility. Here, we show that a single dose of 25CN-NBOH, a serotonin 2A receptor-preferring psychedelic, improves performance on a relatively complex flexible reversal learning task in mice, measured 2-3 weeks after the dose. This effect was seen in both male and female mice. This behavioral finding complements previous cellular results showing that a single psychedelic dose induces long-term structural changes in the PFC and uniquely demonstrates sustained improvements in cognitive flexibility in a novel behavioral paradigm weeks after the initial psychedelic dose in mice. This high throughput task also provides a rapid, automated way to assess other candidate psychedelics for their impact on cognitive flexibility in mice.

">Circuit-Level Dynamics of Slow Wave Activity and Propagation During the Awakening Process</a></h4>

              
                Slow-wave activity (SWA) is a hallmark of the loss of consciousness in non-REM sleep and anesthesia. The mechanistic underpinnings of SWA, and its evolution when transitioning towards the conscious brain state is poorly understood. We address this topic by recording multi-area and laminar activity in posterior parietal (PPC) and primary visual (V1) cortices of mice spontaneously awakening from isoflurane anesthesia. Spectral power is stronger in PPC (especially in superficial layers) during deep unconsciousness, but stronger in V1 when awakening. Rostro-caudal (feedback-like) propagation of SWA also shows state-dependent modulation, particularly in layer 5. The excitability of layer 2/3 neurons, hindered at high isoflurane, recovers during awakening, when V1 and the feedforward pathway reacquire a strong role. Detailing the hierarchical and laminar properties of spontaneous traveling oscillations, we provide evidence that SWA is a multiscale phenomenon. Explicating the functional role of these processes is critical to understand the neuronal mechanisms of consciousness.

Evaluating speech-to-brain cortical entrainment and phase-amplitude coupling revealed that prosody’s hierarchical structure is maintained at the neural level during spoken language comprehension. The faithfulness of this tracking varied as a function of the hierarchy’s degree of intactness as well as systematic interindividual differences in audio-motor synchronization abilities.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Arousal states are thought to influence many aspects of cognition and behavior by broadly modulating neural activity. Many studies have observed arousal-related modulations of alpha (~8 to 15 Hz) and gamma (~30 to 50 Hz) power and coherence in local field potentials across relatively small groups of brain regions. However, the global pattern of arousal-related oscillatory modulation in local field potentials is yet to be fully elucidated. We simultaneously recorded local field potentials in numerous cortical and subcortical regions in the primate brain and assessed oscillatory activity and inter-regional coherence associated with arousal state. In high arousal states, we found a uniquely strong and coherent gamma oscillation between the amygdala and basal forebrain. In low arousal rest-like states, a relative increase in coherence at alpha frequencies was present across sampled brain regions, with the notable exception of the medial temporal lobe. We consider how these patterns of activity may index arousal-related brain states that support the processing of incoming sensory stimuli during high arousal states and memory-related functions during rest.</span>

	<p>Background: In the last few years, transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) has attracted attention as a promising approach to interact with ongoing oscillatory cortical activity and, consequently, to enhance cognitive and motor processes. While tACS findings are limited by high variability in young adults&amp;amp;rsquo; responses, its effects on brain oscillations in older adults remain largely unexplored. In fact, the modulatory effects of tACS on cortical oscillations in healthy aging participants have not yet been investigated extensively, particularly during movement. This study aimed to examine the after-effects of 20 Hz and 70 Hz High-Definition tACS on beta oscillations both during rest and movement. Methods: We recorded resting state EEG signals and during a handgrip task in 15 healthy older participants. We applied 10 min of 20 Hz HD-tACS, 70 Hz HD-tACS or Sham stimulation for 10 minutes. We extracted resting-state beta power and movement-related beta desynchronization (MRBD) values to compare between stimulation frequencies and across time. Results: We found that 20 Hz HD-tACS induced a significant reduction in beta power for electrodes C3 and CP3, while 70 Hz did not have any significant effects. With regards to MRBD, 20 Hz HD-tACS led to more negative values, while 70 Hz HD-tACS resulted in more positive ones for electrodes C3 and FC3. Conclusions: These findings suggest that HD-tACS can modulate beta brain oscillations with frequency specificity. They also highlight the focal impact of HD-tACS, which elicits effects on the cortical region situated directly beneath the stimulation electrode.</p>

	<p>Background and objective: It is commonly known that there is a connection between heart disease and depression symptoms. Compared to heart failure patients without concurrent depression, those with depressive symptoms are more likely to have longer hospital stays and more outpatient visits following discharge. Although the exact neurobiological mechanisms causing the correlation between heart disease and depression symptoms are unknown, it is thought that vascular abnormalities may be a major factor. The purpose of this review was to examine the connection between brain networks linked to depression and heart failure (HF). Methods: PRISMA guidelines were followed. We included studies that reported both heart failure as well as depression and neuroimaging. Results: We identified 159 papers, but only 12 articles were included. Our findings show that reduced cerebral blood flow (CBF) following HF, along with other contributing factors such as chronic inflammation and neurovascular dysfunction, can lead to significant brain tissue damage and disruption of neural networks. The resulting alteration in the brain increases the risk of developing depression, as the neural circuits responsible for emotional regulation become compromised. Conclusions: Individuals with heart failure (HF) exhibit reduced regional cerebral blood flow across multiple brain areas, many of which are critical for mood regulation and are commonly implicated in depression, such as the left frontal cortex and right hippocampus.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: The circadian clockwork is implicated in the etiology of addiction, with circadian rhythm disruptions bidirectionally linked to substance abuse, but the molecular mechanisms that underlie this connection are not well known. Methods: Here, we use machine learning to reveal sex- and substance-specific associations with addiction in variants from 51 circadian-related genes (156,702 SNPs) in 98,800 participants from a UK Biobank cohort. We further analyze SNP associations in a subset of the cohort for substance-specific addictions (alcohol, illicit drugs (narcotics), and prescription drugs (opioids)). Results: We find robust (OR &amp;amp;gt; 10) and novel sex-specific and substance-specific associations with variants in synaptic transcription factors (ZBTB20, CHRNB3) and hormone receptors (RORA), particularly in individuals addicted to narcotics and opioids. Circadian-related gene variants associated with male and female addiction were non-overlapping; variants in males primarily involve dopaminergic pathways, while variants in females factor in metabolic and inflammation pathways, with a novel gene association of female addiction with DELEC1, a gene of unknown function. Conclusions: Our findings underscore the complexity of genetic pathways associated with addiction, involving core clock genes and circadian-regulated pathways, and reveal novel circadian-related gene associations that will aid the development of targeted, sex-specific therapeutic interventions for substance abuse.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Cognitive deficits and negative symptoms associated with schizophrenia are poorly managed by current antipsychotics. In order to develop effective treatments, refining animal models of neurodevelopmental disorders is essential. Methods: To address their multifactorial etiology, we developed a new three-hit mouse model based on the hypoglutamatergic hypothesis of the pathology combined with early stress, offering strong construct validity. Thus, a genetic susceptibility (serine racemase deletion) was associated with an early environmental stress (24 h maternal separation at 9 days of age) and a further pharmacological treatment with phencyclidine (PCP, a glutamate receptor antagonist treatment, 10 mg/kg/day, from 8 to 10 weeks of age). The face validity of this model was assessed in female mice 1 and 6 weeks after the end of PCP treatment by a set of behavioral experiments investigating positive- and negative-like symptoms and cognitive deficits. Results: Our results showed that the three-hit mice displayed persistent hyperlocomotion (positive-like symptoms) and social behavior impairment deficits (negative-like symptoms) but non-persistent spatial working memory deficits (cognitive symptoms). Conclusions: Our work confirms the usefulness of a three-hit combination to model, particularly for negative-like symptoms associated with schizophrenia and other psychiatric disorders. The model therefore gathers powerful construct and face validities and supports an involvement of glutamate dysfunction in behavioral symptoms.</p>

                Rationale and Background Low-stakes assessments enhance student learning outcomes by providing a comprehensive view of performance and promoting competency-based education. Multiple low-stakes assessments encourage continuous learning and incorporate formative feedback for a realistic and long-term environment. Diverse assessment methods ensure psychometric rigor, utility and a programmatic assessment approach with multiple data points affording high-stakes decisions on progression. Objective This scoping review aims to systematically identify and map existing literature on the use of low-stakes assessments in medical education and determine their impact on student learning outcomes in terms of, motivation and engagement achievements/competencies. Methods and Analysis The review will use the Joanna Briggs Institute’s framework for scoping review studies, searching eight databases and grey literature. A presearch will be done in PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar using terms related to low-stakes assessment, formative assessment, continuous assessment, and programmatic assessment within the context of medical education. The Covidence Systematic Review tool will aid in screening and conflict resolution. The reference lists of included studies will be checked manually for other relevant literature. Two research team members will independently screen and extract data, resolving discrepancies with a third team member. Inclusion and exclusion criteria will be refined iteratively based on key research themes. The review will follow PRISMA-P guidelines, focusing on the impact of low-stakes assessment on student learning in medical education. Ethics and dissemination No ethical approval is required as all data will be collected from published and grey literature. Findings will be disseminated at relevant conferences and submitted for publication in peer-reviewed journals.

                <p>by Jessica James, Sebastian Towers, Jakob Foerster, Harrison Steel</p>

Directed evolution can enable engineering of biological systems with minimal knowledge of their underlying sequence-to-function relationships. A typical directed evolution process consists of iterative rounds of mutagenesis and selection that are designed to steer changes in a biological system (e.g. a protein) towards some functional goal. Much work has been done, particularly leveraging advancements in machine learning, to optimise the process of directed evolution. Many of these methods, however, require DNA sequencing and synthesis, making them resource-intensive and incompatible with developments in targeted <i>in vivo</i> mutagenesis. Operating within the experimental constraints of established sorting-based directed evolution techniques (e.g. Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting, FACS), we explore approaches for optimisation of directed evolution that could in future be implemented without sequencing information. We then expand our methods to the context of emerging experimental techniques in directed evolution, which allow for single-cell selection based on fitness objectives defined from any combination of measurable traits. Finally, we explore these alternative strategies on the GB1 and TrpB empirical landscapes, demonstrating that they could lead to up to 19-fold and 7-fold increases respectively in the probability of attaining the global fitness peak.

                <p>by Amit Basak, Supratim Sengupta</p>

Humans navigate diverse social relationships and concurrently interact across multiple social contexts. An individual’s behavior in one context can influence behavior in other contexts. Different payoffs associated with interactions in the different domains have motivated recent studies of the evolution of cooperation through the analysis of multichannel games where each individual is simultaneously engaged in multiple repeated games. However, previous investigations have ignored the potential role of network structure in each domain and the effect of playing against distinct interacting partners in different domains. Multiplex networks provide a useful framework to represent social interactions between the same set of agents across different social contexts. We investigate the role of multiplex network structure and strategy linking in multichannel games on the spread of cooperative behavior in all layers of the multiplex. We find that multiplex structure along with strategy linking enhances the cooperation rate in all layers of the multiplex compared to a well-mixed population in Prisoners’ Dilemma games, provided the network structure is identical across layers. The effectiveness of strategy linking in enhancing cooperation depends on the degree of similarity of the network structure across the layers and perception errors due to imperfect memory. Higher cooperation rates are achieved when the degree of structural overlap of the different layers is sufficiently large, and the probability of perception error is relatively low. Our work reveals how the social network structure in different layers of a multiplex can affect the spread of cooperation by limiting the ability of individuals to link strategies across different social domains.

Age prediction based on single cell RNA-Sequencing data (scRNA-Seq) can provide information for patients’ susceptibility to various diseases and conditions. In addition, such analysis can be used to identify aging related genes and pathways. To enable age prediction based on scRNA-Seq data, we developed PolyEN, a new regression model which learns continuous representation for expression over time. These representations are then used by PolyEN to integrate genes to predict an age. Existing and new lung aging data we profiled demonstrated PolyEN’s improved performance over existing methods for age prediction. Our results identified lung epithelial cells as the most significant predictors for non-smokers while lung endothelial cells led to the best chronological age prediction results for smokers.

                <p>by Renata Retkute, William Thurston, Keith Cressman, Christopher A. Gilligan</p>

There is an urgent need for mathematical models that can be used to inform the deployment of surveillance, early warning and management systems for transboundary pest invasions. This is especially important for desert locust, one of the most dangerous migratory pests for smallholder farmers. During periods of desert locust upsurges and plagues, gregarious adult locusts form into swarms that are capable of long-range dispersal. Here we introduce a novel integrated modelling framework for use in predicting gregarious locust populations. The framework integrates the selection of breeding sites, maturation through egg, hopper and adult stages and swarm dispersal in search of areas suitable for feeding and breeding. Using a combination of concepts from epidemiological modelling, weather and environment data, together with an atmospheric transport model for swarm movement we provide a tool to forecast short- and long-term swarm movements. A principal aim of the framework is to provide a practical starting point for use in the next upsurge.

                <p>by Mengya Zhang, Qing Yu</p>

Successful goal-directed behavior requires the maintenance and implementation of abstract task goals on concrete stimulus information in working memory. Previous working memory research has revealed distributed neural representations of task information across cortex. However, how the distributed task representations emerge and communicate with stimulus-specific information to implement flexible goal-directed computations is still unclear. Here, leveraging electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in human participants along with state space analyses, we provided converging evidence in support of a low-dimensional neural geometry of goal information congruent with a designed task space, which first emerged in frontal cortex during goal maintenance and then transferred to posterior cortex through frontomedial-to-posterior theta coherence for implementation on stimulus-specific representations. Importantly, the fidelity of the goal geometry was associated with memory performance. Collectively, our findings suggest that abstract goals in working memory are represented in an organized, task-congruent neural geometry for communications from frontal to posterior cortex to enable computations necessary for goal-directed behaviors.

                Background Leukemia, a heterogeneous group of blood cancers, poses significant challenges to global health due to its complexity, diverse risk factors, and variable outcomes. Accurate and early diagnosis is critical but remains a significant hurdle, particularly in low-resource settings. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and image processing offer transformative solutions to improve leukemia detection and classification, addressing limitations in traditional diagnostic methods. Methods This study systematically reviewed over 25,000 scientific articles sourced from Scopus, employing a PRISMA-guided methodology to ensure a comprehensive and rigorous analysis. The analysis focused on the application of AI, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), in diagnosing four primary leukemia types: acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). It also examined global epidemiological trends, risk factors, and disparities in healthcare access. Results Key risk factors for leukemia include genetic syndromes like Down syndrome, environmental exposures to toxins such as benzene, ionizing radiation, and viral infections. Socio-economic disparities and geographical differences significantly impact leukemia incidence and outcomes. AI-based models, especially CNNs, demonstrated enhanced accuracy, speed, and reliability in diagnosing leukemia compared to traditional methods. However, challenges such as data variability, model scalability, and unequal access to AI technologies continue to hinder widespread adoption. Conclusion AI and image processing technologies hold immense potential to revolutionize leukemia diagnostics by enabling early detection, precise classification, and personalized treatment planning. Addressing critical challenges, including data standardization and equitable access to these technologies, will be vital for global application. This review highlights the transformative role of AI in improving leukemia outcomes and advancing precision medicine worldwide.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Variants in <i>PRKN</i> and <i>PINK1</i> are the leading cause of early-onset autosomal recessive Parkinson's disease, yet many cases remain genetically unresolved. We previously identified a 7 megabases complex structural variant in a pair of monozygotic twins using Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) long-read sequencing. This study aims to determine if ONT long-read sequencing can detect a second variant in other unresolved early-onset Parkinson's disease (EOPD) cases with 1 heterozygous <i>PRKN</i> or <i>PINK1</i> variant.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>ONT long-read sequencing was performed on EOPD patients with 1 reported <i>PRKN</i>/<i>PINK1</i> pathogenic variant, with onset age under 50. Positive controls included EOPD patients with 2 known <i>PRKN</i> pathogenic variants. Initial testing involved short-read targeted panel sequencing for single nucleotide variants and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification for copy number variants.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 47 patients were studied (<i>PRKN</i> “one-variant,” n = 23; <i>PINK1</i> “one-variant,” n = 12; <i>PRKN</i> “two-variants,” n = 12). ONT long-read sequencing identified a second pathogenic variant in 26% of <i>PRKN</i> “one-variant” patients (6/23), but none in <i>PINK1</i> “one-variant” patients (0/12). Detected variants included 1 complex inversion, 2 structural variant overlaps, and 3 duplications. In the <i>PRKN</i> “two-variants” group, both variants were identified in all patients (100%, 12/12).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>ONT long-read sequencing effectively identifies pathogenic structural variants in the <i>PRKN</i> locus missed by conventional methods. It should be considered for unresolved EOPD cases when a second variant is not detected through conventional approaches. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

                Background The Alliance for Healthier Communities is a learning health system that supports Community Health Centres (CHCs) across Ontario, Canada to provide team-based primary health care to people who otherwise experience barriers to care. This case study describes the ongoing process and lessons learned from the first Alliance for Healthier Communities’ Practice Based Learning Network (PBLN) data-driven decision support tool co-development project. Methods We employ an iterative approach to problem identification and methods development for the decision support tool, moving between discussion sessions and case studies with CHC electronic health record (EHR) data. We summarize our work to date in terms of six stages: population-level descriptive-exploratory study, PBLN team engagement, decision support tool problem selection, sandbox case study 1: individual-level risk predictions, sandbox case study 2: population-level planning predictions, project recap and next steps decision. Results The population-level study provided an initial point of engagement to consider how clients are (not) represented in EHR data and to inform problem selection and methodological decisions thereafter. We identified three initial meaningful types of decision support, with target application areas: risk prediction/screening, triaging specialized program referrals, and identifying care access needs. Based on feasibility and expected impact, we started with the goal to support earlier identification of mental health decline after diabetes diagnosis. As discussions deepened around clinical use cases associated with example prediction task set ups, the target problem evolved towards supporting the upstream task of organizational planning and advocacy for adequate mental health care service capacity to meet incoming needs. Conclusions This case study contributes towards a tool to support diabetes and mental health care, as well as lays groundwork for future CHC EHR-based decision support tool initiatives. We share lessons learned and reflections from our process that other primary health care organizations may use to inform their own co-development initiatives while we continue to work on advancing the population-level capacity planning model.

                Background The neglect of visual identity (VI) at the organizational level within higher education institutions (HEIs) has become a critical issue, while previous studies over the past decade has focused on HEI branding and reputation. This creates a potential gap in understanding HEI branding processes. Thus, this study aims to explore the relationship between VI and HEI reputation by integrating the Expressiveness Quotient (EQ) and experiential brand meaning at the organizational level. Method Using a qualitative case study approach, the study involves semi-structured interviews with 29 employees from five top-ranked universities in Indonesia. Furthermore, it analyzes the integration of experiential brand meaning across the stages of awareness, interpretation, appropriation, and communication, alongside the EQ framework to assess how visual identity impacts visibility, distinctiveness, transparency, authenticity, and consistency. Result The findings indicate that visual identity significantly influences perceptions of institutional identity and reputation. Effective management of visual identity elements enhances competitive advantage in academia and aligns internal stakeholder perceptions with external branding, which is essential for a cohesive organizational identity. Conclusion This study emphasizes the strategic importance of visual identity in enhancing institutional reputation and provides a model for universities aiming to strengthen their reputational power through effective visual identity management. The study also reveals strong awareness and acceptance of brand identity.

                Background Dynamic foot posture assessment is essential to determine the pathomechanics of the foot during walking. Currently, there is no affordable method for assessing dynamic foot posture that can be used in a clinical setting. Kinovea, an open-access video analysis-free application, has enabled clinicians to conduct gait analysis at a relatively low cost, but its reliability in assessing dynamic foot posture has not been studied. Methods 32 observations were recorded from various angles throughout the gait cycle, each at varying speeds, and analyzed using Kinovea. Two independent examiners conducted observations to measure the medial longitudinal arch (MLA), first metatarsophalangeal joint (MTP 1), ankle inclination (AI), and calcaneal angle (CA). A third examiner was tasked with comparing the results of intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) between the two examiners. Result The inter-rater reliability showed promising results despite the observations made at 2, 3, and 4 km/h. MLA and MTP 1 observations remained “excellent” at all speeds, while AI and CA had “good” reliability among observers at 2, 3 and 4 kmph, apart from 4 kmph where AI showed “excellent” reliability. Conclusion In this study, Kinovea showed good and excellent reliability among observers in measuring the MLA, MTP 1, AI, and CA at various speeds. Therefore, a suitable alternative to a 3D motion analyzer may not be readily available in certain facilities.

                Background Stool consistency is an important outcome measure to evaluate in the investigation of several gastrointestinal diseases. The Bristol Stool Scale (BSS) is one of the most commonly used tools for evaluation of stool consistency. BSS ranges from 1-7 and each score is assigned to a given consistency of the feces. Self-reported characterizations can differ from an expert evaluation, and the reliability of BSS is unclear. We aimed to evaluate the reliability of BSS by comparing patient scores with expert scores. Methods Patients with inflammatory bowel disease collected stool samples throughout a 3-year follow-up. The stool´s consistency was evaluated with BSS by the patients and matched with an expert score. Agreement between patient and expert scores was assessed using Cohen’s kappa. Results BSS scores from 2280 fecal samples collected from 992 patients at up to five time points were included. When all samples were compared, there was good to substantial agreement between patient and expert scores (Cohen’s weighted kappa: 0.66-0.72). When the BSS scores were simplified and categorized as 1 (scores 1-2), 2 (scores 3-5) or 3 (scores 6-7), the agreement improved slightly (Cohen’s weighted kappa: 0.73-0.77). When the scores from the first sample per patient were compared, the experts were more likely to assign higher scores compared to the patient. The proportion of the lowest assigned scores (1-2) was 12.1% for patients and 8.1% for experts. Conclusions The agreement between patient and expert BSS scores is good to substantial, especially when the BSS scores are simplified into three categories.

Methods Google Scholar, MEDLINE, ProQuest, ScienceDirect, and Scopus databases were searched to identify relevant literature from 2014 to 2023. Observational analytical studies in English that reported the risk factors for neonatal sepsis mortality were chosen. We assessed the risk of bias by using the checklists of the Joanna Briggs Institute. Fixed-effect models were used when the number of included studies was <5; otherwise, random-effects models were employed. Heterogeneity was evaluated using the I2 statistic. Publication bias was assessed using a funnel plot, and a sensitivity analysis was performed. Statistical significance was set at P <0.05. Analyses were conducted using the RevMan 5.4.1. Results Twelve out of 40,587 articles included a total of 2232 patients. The majority of patients were male (50.4%–70%). The I2 statistics showed no heterogeneity across studies for sex, gestational age, birth weight, or requirement for inotropic support. History of invasive ventilation (OR = 35.06 [16.84–72.99]), requirement for inotropic support (OR = 18.04 [8.38–38.81]), low 1st minute Apgar score (OR = 4.93 [2.1–11.58]), convulsive (OR = 4.69 [2.03–10.82]), poor feeding (OR = 3.95 [2.12–7.33]) episodes, preterm birth (OR = 3.63 [2.78–4.74]), low birth weight (OR = 3.02 [1.58–5.75]), early onset sepsis (OR = 2.52 [1.74–3.64]), and lethargy (OR = 2.14 [1.5–3.04]) were associated with neonatal sepsis mortality. Conclusions A history of invasive ventilation use, requirement for inotropic support, low 1st minute Apgar score, convulsions, poor feeding episodes, preterm birth, low birth weight, early onset sepsis, and lethargy were identified as significant risk factors for neonatal sepsis mortality. Clinicians must be vigilant to improve outcomes and prevent death.

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>I have been incredibly fortunate to have worked in the field of hippocampal spatial coding during three of its most exciting decades, the 1990s, 2000s, and 2010s. During this time I had a ringside view of some of the foundational discoveries that were made which have transformed our understanding of the hippocampal system and its role in cognition (especially spatial cognition) and memory. These discoveries inspired me in my own lab over the years to pursue three broad lines of enquiry—3D spatial encoding, context and the sense of direction—which are outlined here. If some of my personal recollections are a little inaccurate (such is the nature of episodic memory!) I apologize in advance.</p>

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>I am lucky to be part of the hippocampus story, if not from the beginning but at least in its formative decades. Being part of this community is a true privilege. As I try to illustrate below, science is made by scientists. My fierce competitors over the years have become my close friends. I hope the field of hippocampus research will stay that way forever.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95521">The geometric basis of epithelial convergent extension</a></h4>

              
                Shape changes of epithelia during animal development, such as convergent extension, are achieved through the concerted mechanical activity of individual cells. While much is known about the corresponding large-scale tissue flow and its genetic drivers, fundamental questions regarding local control of contractile activity on the cellular scale and its embryo-scale coordination remain open. To address these questions, we develop a quantitative, model-based analysis framework to relate cell geometry to local tension in recently obtained time-lapse imaging data of gastrulating <i>Drosophila</i> embryos. This analysis systematically decomposes cell shape changes and T1 rearrangements into internally driven, active, and externally driven, passive, contributions. Our analysis provides evidence that germ band extension is driven by active T1 processes that self-organize through positive feedback acting on tensions. More generally, our findings suggest that epithelial convergent extension results from the controlled transformation of internal force balance geometry which combines the effects of bottom-up local self-organization with the top-down, embryo-scale regulation by gene expression.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95510">Discarded sequencing reads uncover natural variation in pest resistance in Thlaspi arvense</a></h4>

              
                Understanding the genomic basis of natural variation in plant pest resistance is an important goal in plant science, but it usually requires large and labor-intensive phenotyping experiments. Here, we explored the possibility that non-target reads from plant DNA sequencing can serve as phenotyping proxies for addressing such questions. We used data from a whole-genome and -epigenome sequencing study of 207 natural lines of field pennycress (<i>Thlaspi arvense</i>) that were grown in a common environment and spontaneously colonized by aphids, mildew, and other microbes. We found that the numbers of non-target reads assigned to the pest species differed between populations, had significant SNP-based heritability, and were associated with climate of origin and baseline glucosinolate contents. Specifically, pennycress lines from cold and thermally fluctuating habitats, presumably less favorable to aphids, showed higher aphid DNA load, i.e., decreased aphid resistance. Genome-wide association analyses identified genetic variants at known defense genes but also novel genomic regions associated with variation in aphid and mildew DNA load. Moreover, we found several differentially methylated regions associated with pathogen loads, in particular differential methylation at transposons and hypomethylation in the promoter of a gene involved in stomatal closure, likely induced by pathogens. Our study provides first insights into the defense mechanisms of <i>Thlaspi arvense</i>, a rising crop and model species, and demonstrates that non-target whole-genome sequencing reads, usually discarded, can be leveraged to estimate intensities of plant biotic interactions. With rapidly increasing numbers of large sequencing datasets worldwide, this approach should have broad application in fundamental and applied research.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96284">Full-length direct RNA sequencing uncovers stress granule-dependent RNA decay upon cellular stress</a></h4>

              
                Cells react to stress by triggering response pathways, leading to extensive alterations in the transcriptome to restore cellular homeostasis. The role of RNA metabolism in shaping the cellular response to stress is vital, yet the global changes in RNA stability under these conditions remain unclear. In this work, we employ direct RNA sequencing with nanopores, enhanced by 5ʹ end adapter ligation, to comprehensively interrogate the human transcriptome at single-molecule and -nucleotide resolution. By developing a statistical framework to identify robust RNA length variations in nanopore data, we find that cellular stress induces prevalent 5ʹ end RNA decay that is coupled to translation and ribosome occupancy. Unlike typical RNA decay models in normal conditions, we show that stress-induced RNA decay is dependent on XRN1 but does not depend on deadenylation or decapping. We observed that RNAs undergoing decay are predominantly enriched in the stress granule transcriptome while inhibition of stress granule formation via genetic ablation of G3BP1 and G3BP2 rescues RNA length. Our findings reveal RNA decay as a key component of RNA metabolism upon cellular stress that is dependent on stress granule formation.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96129">Mapping spatial patterns to energetic benefits in groups of flow-coupled swimmers</a></h4>

              
                The coordinated motion of animal groups through fluids is thought to reduce the cost of locomotion to individuals in the group. However, the connection between the spatial patterns observed in collectively moving animals and the energetic benefits at each position within the group remains unclear. To address this knowledge gap, we study the spontaneous emergence of cohesive formations in groups of fish, modeled as flapping foils, all heading in the same direction. We show in pairwise formations and with increasing group size that (1) in side-by-side arrangements, the reciprocal nature of flow coupling results in an equal distribution of energy requirements among all members, with reduction in cost of locomotion for swimmers flapping inphase but an increase in cost for swimmers flapping antiphase, and (2) in inline arrangements, flow coupling is non-reciprocal for all flapping phase, with energetic savings in favor of trailing swimmers, but only up to a finite number of swimmers, beyond which school cohesion and energetic benefits are lost at once. We explain these findings mechanistically and we provide efficient diagnostic tools for identifying locations in the wake of single and multiple swimmers that offer opportunities for hydrodynamic benefits to aspiring followers. Our results imply a connection between the resources generated by flow physics and social traits that influence greedy and cooperative group behavior.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97910">Endosomal sorting protein SNX4 limits synaptic vesicle docking and release</a></h4>

              
                Sorting nexin 4 (SNX4) is an evolutionary conserved organizer of membrane recycling. In neurons, SNX4 accumulates in synapses, but how SNX4 affects synapse function remains unknown. We generated a conditional SNX4 knock-out mouse model and report that SNX4 cKO synapses show enhanced neurotransmission during train stimulation, while the first evoked EPSC was normal. SNX4 depletion did not affect vesicle recycling, basic autophagic flux, or the levels and localization of SNARE-protein VAMP2/synaptobrevin-2. However, SNX4 depletion affected synapse ultrastructure: an increase in docked synaptic vesicles at the active zone, while the overall vesicle number was normal, and a decreased active zone length. These effects together lead to a substantially increased density of docked vesicles per release site. In conclusion, SNX4 is a negative regulator of synaptic vesicle docking and release. These findings suggest a role for SNX4 in synaptic vesicle recruitment at the active zone.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99862">Dysfunctional S1P/S1PR1 signaling in the dentate gyrus drives vulnerability of chronic pain-related memory impairment</a></h4>

              
                Memory impairment in chronic pain patients is substantial and common, and few therapeutic strategies are available. Chronic pain-related memory impairment has susceptible and unsusceptible features. Therefore, exploring the underlying mechanisms of its vulnerability is essential for developing effective treatments. Here, combining two spatial memory tests (Y-maze test and Morris water maze), we segregated chronic pain mice into memory impairment-susceptible and -unsusceptible subpopulations in a chronic neuropathic pain model induced by chronic constrictive injury of the sciatic nerve. RNA-Seq analysis and gain/loss-of-function study revealed that S1P/S1PR1 signaling is a determinant for vulnerability to chronic pain-related memory impairment. Knockdown of the S1PR1 in the dentate gyrus (DG) promoted a susceptible phenotype and led to structural plasticity changes of reduced excitatory synapse formation and abnormal spine morphology as observed in susceptible mice, while overexpression of the S1PR1 and pharmacological administration of S1PR1 agonist in the DG promoted an unsusceptible phenotype and prevented the occurrence of memory impairment, and rescued the morphological abnormality. Finally, the Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis and biochemical evidence indicated that downregulation of S1PR1 in susceptible mice may impair DG structural plasticity via interaction with actin cytoskeleton rearrangement-related signaling pathways including Itga2 and its downstream Rac1/Cdc42 signaling and Arp2/3 cascade. These results reveal a novel mechanism and provide a promising preventive and therapeutic molecular target for vulnerability to chronic pain-related memory impairment.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91083">Intramolecular feedback regulation of the LRRK2 Roc G domain by a LRRK2 kinase-dependent mechanism</a></h4>

              
                The Parkinson’s disease (PD)-linked protein Leucine-Rich Repeat Kinase 2 (LRRK2) consists of seven domains, including a kinase and a Roc G domain. Despite the availability of several high-resolution structures, the dynamic regulation of its unique intramolecular domain stack is nevertheless still not well understood. By in-depth biochemical analysis, assessing the Michaelis–Menten kinetics of the Roc G domain, we have confirmed that LRRK2 has, similar to other Roco protein family members, a K<sub>M</sub> value of LRRK2 that lies within the range of the physiological GTP concentrations within the cell. Furthermore, the R1441G PD variant located within a mutational hotspot in the Roc domain showed an increased catalytic efficiency. In contrast, the most common PD variant G2019S, located in the kinase domain, showed an increased K<sub>M</sub> and reduced catalytic efficiency, suggesting a negative feedback mechanism from the kinase domain to the G domain. Autophosphorylation of the G1+2 residue (T1343) in the Roc P-loop motif is critical for this phosphoregulation of both the K<sub>M</sub> and the k<sub>cat</sub> values of the Roc-catalyzed GTP hydrolysis, most likely by changing the monomer–dimer equilibrium. The LRRK2 T1343A variant has a similar increased kinase activity in cells compared to G2019S and the double mutant T1343A/G2019S has no further increased activity, suggesting that T1343 is crucial for the negative feedback in the LRRK2 signaling cascade. Together, our data reveal a novel intramolecular feedback regulation of the LRRK2 Roc G domain by a LRRK2 kinase-dependent mechanism. Interestingly, PD mutants differently change the kinetics of the GTPase cycle, which might in part explain the difference in penetrance of these mutations in PD patients.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/88879">Bestrophin-4 relays HES4 and interacts with TWIST1 to suppress epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in colorectal cancer cells</a></h4>

              
                Bestrophin isoform 4 (<i>BEST4</i>) is a newly identified subtype of the calcium-activated chloride channel family. Analysis of colonic epithelial cell diversity by single-cell RNA-sequencing has revealed the existence of a cluster of <i>BEST4</i>+ mature colonocytes in humans. However, if the role of <i>BEST4</i> is involved in regulating tumour progression remains largely unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that <i>BEST4</i> overexpression attenuates cell proliferation, colony formation, and mobility in colorectal cancer (CRC) in vitro, and impedes the tumour growth and the liver metastasis in vivo. BEST4 is co-expressed with hairy/enhancer of split 4 (<i>HES4</i>) in the nucleus of cells, and HES4 signals <i>BEST4</i> by interacting with the upstream region of the <i>BEST4</i> promoter. <i>BEST4</i> is epistatic to <i>HES4</i> and downregulates TWIST1, thereby inhibiting epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in CRC. Conversely, knockout of BEST4 using CRISPR/Cas9 in CRC cells revitalises tumour growth and induces EMT. Furthermore, the low level of the <i>BEST4</i> mRNA is correlated with advanced and the worse prognosis, suggesting its potential role involving CRC progression.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96810">Cytosolic S100A8/A9 promotes Ca2+ supply at LFA-1 adhesion clusters during neutrophil recruitment</a></h4>

              
                S100A8/A9 is an endogenous alarmin secreted by myeloid cells during many acute and chronic inflammatory disorders. Despite increasing evidence of the proinflammatory effects of extracellular S100A8/A9, little is known about its intracellular function. Here, we show that cytosolic S100A8/A9 is indispensable for neutrophil post-arrest modifications during outside-in signaling under flow conditions in vitro and neutrophil recruitment in vivo, independent of its extracellular functions. Mechanistically, genetic deletion of S100A9 in mice caused dysregulated Ca<sup>2+</sup> signatures in activated neutrophils resulting in reduced Ca<sup>2+</sup> availability at the formed LFA-1/F-actin clusters with defective β<sub>2</sub> integrin outside-in signaling during post-arrest modifications. Consequently, we observed impaired cytoskeletal rearrangement, cell polarization, and spreading, as well as cell protrusion formation in <i>S100a9<sup>-/-</sup></i> compared to wildtype (WT) neutrophils, making <i>S100a9<sup>-/-</sup></i> cells more susceptible to detach under flow, thereby preventing efficient neutrophil recruitment and extravasation into inflamed tissue.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93241">N-terminus of Drosophila melanogaster MSL1 is critical for dosage compensation</a></h4>

              
                The male-specific lethal complex (MSL), which consists of five proteins and two non-coding roX RNAs, is involved in the transcriptional enhancement of X-linked genes to compensate for the sex chromosome monosomy in <i>Drosophila</i> XY males compared with XX females. The MSL1 and MSL2 proteins form the heterotetrameric core of the MSL complex and are critical for the specific recruitment of the complex to the high-affinity ‘entry’ sites (HAS) on the X chromosome. In this study, we demonstrated that the N-terminal region of MSL1 is critical for stability and functions of MSL1. Amino acid deletions and substitutions in the N-terminal region of MSL1 strongly affect both the interaction with roX2 RNA and the MSL complex binding to HAS on the X chromosome. In particular, substitution of the conserved N-terminal amino-acids 3–7 in MSL1 (MSL1<sup>GS</sup>) affects male viability similar to the inactivation of genes encoding roX RNAs. In addition, MSL1<sup>GS</sup> binds to promoters such as MSL1<sup>WT</sup> but does not co-bind with MSL2 and MSL3 to X chromosomal HAS. However, overexpression of MSL2 partially restores the dosage compensation. Thus, the interaction of MSL1 with roX RNA is critical for the efficient assembly of the MSL complex on HAS of the male X chromosome.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/87517">Statistical analysis supports pervasive RNA subcellular localization and alternative 3' UTR regulation</a></h4>

              
                Targeted low-throughput studies have previously identified subcellular RNA localization as necessary for cellular functions including polarization, and translocation. Furthermore, these studies link localization to RNA isoform expression, especially 3’ Untranslated Region (UTR) regulation. The recent introduction of genome-wide spatial transcriptomics techniques enables the potential to test if subcellular localization is regulated in situ pervasively. In order to do this, robust statistical measures of subcellular localization and alternative poly-adenylation (APA) at single-cell resolution are needed. Developing a new statistical framework called SPRAWL, we detect extensive cell-type specific subcellular RNA localization regulation in the mouse brain and to a lesser extent mouse liver. We integrated SPRAWL with a new approach to measure cell-type specific regulation of alternative 3’ UTR processing and detected examples of significant correlations between 3’ UTR length and subcellular localization. Included examples, <i>Timp3</i>, <i>Slc32a1</i>, <i>Cxcl14</i>, and <i>Nxph1</i> have subcellular localization in the mouse brain highly correlated with regulated 3’ UTR processing that includes the use of unannotated, but highly conserved, 3’ ends. Together, SPRAWL provides a statistical framework to integrate multi-omic single-cell resolved measurements of gene-isoform pairs to prioritize an otherwise impossibly large list of candidate functional 3’ UTRs for functional prediction and study. In these studies of data from mice, SPRAWL predicts that 3’ UTR regulation of subcellular localization may be more pervasive than currently known.

	<p>Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic had a negative impact on mental health in the general population. The fear, stress, and uncertainty surrounding that traumatic period could have contributed to the aggravation or possible new onset of obsessive&amp;amp;ndash;compulsive symptoms. Methods: The COvid Mental hEalth Trial (COMET) is a nationwide project organized by the University of Campania &amp;amp;ldquo;Luigi Vanvitelli&amp;amp;rdquo;, designed as an observational investigation that aimed to gather data from a representative sample of the Italian general population. The current study is a report from the main project and it focuses on obsessive&amp;amp;ndash;compulsive (OC) symptoms. Results: A total sample of N = 20,720 took part in the survey. N = 2332 individuals had a total Obsessive&amp;amp;ndash;Compulsive Inventory&amp;amp;mdash;Revised (OCI-R) score greater than or equal to 21 (11.3% of the entire sample), indicating the presence of clinically relevant obsessive&amp;amp;ndash;compulsive symptoms. By excluding patients with a history of previous mental illnesses, we still obtained a high number of individuals with an OCI-R score greater than or equal to 21 (N = 2024), representing 10.3% of the overall sample, possibly indicating a new incidence of OC symptoms during the pandemic. Discussion: Our study highlights a substantial new incidence of obsessive&amp;amp;ndash;compulsive symptoms in the general public. Risk factors or red flags such as being male, being of working age, living in a highly stressful environment such as one of the Italian regions most affected and severely hit by the pandemic, having higher levels of loneliness, and using substances to cope with stress, should be paid particular attention in order to prevent the development of OC symptoms during a critical and traumatic event such as the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

	<p>Objectives: Hearing loss is highly prevalent in older adults and is independently associated with accelerated cognitive decline. Cochlear implants are usually the only effective treatment for people with severe&amp;amp;ndash;profound hearing loss, who have the highest risk of cognitive decline and dementia, however, very few receive them. Current evidence of the effects of cochlear implant use on cognitive decline/dementia outcomes is limited and unclear. This study aimed to investigate the effect of cochlear implant use on longitudinal cognitive performance, as this intervention may be an effective method of modifying cognitive outcomes for older adults with significant hearing loss. Methods: This prospective longitudinal observational study investigated cognitive performance in a convenience sample of older adults (mean age 74 years) with cochlear implants over 4.5 years post-implantation, comparing this with that of community-living adults with untreated hearing loss/normal hearing over 3 years (Australian Imaging, Biomarker and Lifestyle Flagship Study of Ageing; AIBL). All participants were assessed at 18-month intervals from baseline using the same measures. Panel regression was used to compare cognitive trajectories. Results: Cochlear implant users demonstrated significantly improved performance in executive function and working memory, as well as stability in attention, psychomotor function, and visual learning at 4.5-year follow-up. Comparatively, AIBL participants showed significantly greater worsening performance per year in attention and psychomotor function, and stability in working memory and visual learning at 3-year follow-up. Conclusions: Cochlear implant use may delay cognitive decline and/or improve cognitive performance in older adults with severe&amp;amp;ndash;profound hearing loss, providing proof-of-concept evidence of the positive effects of hearing intervention on cognitive performance in older adults with hearing loss.</p>

	<p>After more than 30 years since its inception, the utility of brain imaging for understanding and diagnosing mental illnesses is in doubt, receiving well-grounded criticisms from clinical practitioners. Symptom-based correlational approaches have struggled to provide psychiatry with reliable brain-imaging metrics. However, the emergence of computational psychiatry has paved a new path not only for understanding the psychopathology of mental illness but also to provide practical tools for clinical practice in terms of computational metrics, specifically computational phenotypes. However, these phenotypes still lack sufficient test&amp;amp;ndash;retest reliability. In this review, we describe recent works revealing that mind and brain-related computational phenotypes show structural (not random) variation over time, longitudinal changes. Furthermore, we show that these findings suggest that understanding the causes of these changes will improve the construct validity of the phenotypes with an ensuing increase in test&amp;amp;ndash;retest reliability. We propose that the active inference framework offers a general-purpose approach for causally understanding these longitudinal changes by incorporating brain imaging as observations within partially observable Markov decision processes.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Olfactory dysfunction (OD) is associated with a variety of neurologic deficits and impacts socialization decisions, mood, and overall quality of life. As a common symptom comprising the long COVID condition, persistent COVID-19-associated olfactory dysfunction (C19OD) may further impact the presentations of neuropsychiatric sequelae. Our study aims to characterize the longitudinal burden of depression, anxiety, and neuropsychiatric symptoms in a population with C19OD. Methods: Individuals with perceived C19OD completed a psychophysical screening evaluation of their sense of smell using the comprehensive Sniffin&amp;amp;rsquo; Sticks olfactory assessment. Only those with validated psychophysical OD were included in this prospective longitudinal study for baseline and one-year follow-up. Participants also completed PHQ-9, Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), and neuropsychiatric symptom questionnaires at each time point. Anxiety, depression, and neuropsychiatric symptom prevalence was calculated and compared between time points with Pearson&amp;amp;rsquo;s chi-squared, Fisher&amp;amp;rsquo;s exact, and Wilcoxon rank sum tests. Results: Each neuropsychiatric symptom evaluated in this study was reported by 13&amp;amp;ndash;49% of longitudinal cohort participants at both baseline and follow-up, except for seizure (0% at baseline and follow-up) and word-finding difficulty (61&amp;amp;ndash;68% at baseline and follow-up). Word-finding and focus difficulties were the most commonly reported symptoms. In total, 41% of participants reported some level of depression at baseline and 38% of participants reported depression at one-year follow-up, while 29% and 27% of participants reported some level of anxiety at respective time points. Conclusions: Individuals with C19OD are at risk for developing persistent neuropsychiatric conditions. These neurologic and psychiatric sequelae are persistent with repeated longitudinal assessment, even at nearly 2.5 years following initial COVID-19 diagnosis.</p>

	<p>Background/Objective: Aging is associated with both cognitive and physical decline. Some factors, such as lifestyle and environment, can significantly contribute to accelerating or slowing down the decline processes. Our study aimed to evaluate the impact of lifestyle (active vs. non-active) and environmental context (institutionalized vs. non-institutionalized) on the cognitive functioning, psychological well-being, sleep quality, and daily living skills of elderly people. Methods: Our sample consisted of 182 subjects divided into active and non-active groups (subjects who engage or not in physical and social activities, respectively; mean age in years: 67.19 vs. 68.75) and 245 subjects divided into institutionalized and non-institutionalized groups (i.e., living in a nursing home or not, respectively; mean age in years: 79.49 vs. 71.72). Participants were enrolled voluntarily and randomly in the city of L&amp;amp;rsquo;Aquila. A battery of psychological instruments was administered to evaluate general cognitive decline, depressive symptoms, self-assessed sleep quality, and daily living skills. Results: Regarding lifestyle, the active group exhibited significantly lower levels of depression, better sleep quality, and daily living skills with respect to the non-active group. Regarding environmental context, institutionalized subjects showed higher levels of depression and reduced cognitive functioning, which were linked to reduced sleep quality and worsened daily living skills. When comparing the non-active with the institutionalized group, the latter showed higher levels of depression and reduced cognitive functioning, more sleep complaints, and reduced daily living skills. Conclusions: Our study highlights that an active lifestyle and a non-institutionalized environment, both allowing greater mobility and autonomy, are two factors that positively contribute to the mental and physical well-being of elderly individuals. Furthermore, the healthcare institution context appears to have a greater negative impact on the psycho-physical well-being of the subjects involved compared to a non-active lifestyle.</p>

                <p>The pretectum of vertebrates contains neurons responsive to global visual motion. These signals are sent to the cerebellum, forming a subcortical pathway for processing optic flow. Global motion neurons exhibit selectivity for both direction and speed, but this is usually assessed by first determining direction preference at intermediate velocity (16&ndash;32&deg;/s) and then assessing speed tuning at the preferred direction. A consequence of this approach is that it is unknown if and how direction preference changes with speed. We measured directional selectivity in 114 pretectal neurons from 44 zebra finches (<I>Taeniopygia guttata</I>) across spatial and temporal frequencies, corresponding to a speed range of 0.062&ndash;1,024&deg;/s. Pretectal neurons were most responsive at 32&ndash;64&deg;/s with lower activity as speed increased or decreased. At each speed, we determined if cells were directionally selective, bidirectionally selective, omnidirectionally responsive, or unmodulated. Notably, at 32&deg;/s, 60% of the cells were directionally selective, and 28% were omnidirectionally responsive. In contrast, at 1,024&deg;/s, 20% of the cells were directionally selective, and nearly half of the population was omnidirectionally responsive. Only 15% of the cells were omnidirectionally excited across most speeds. The remaining 85% of the cells had direction tuning that changed with speed. Collectively, these results indicate a shift from a bias for directional tuning at intermediate speeds of global visual motion to a bias for omnidirectional responses at faster speeds. These results suggest a potential role for the pretectum during flight by detecting unexpected drift or potential collisions, depending on the speed of the optic flow signal.</p>

                <p>The medial frontal cortex (mFC) and locus ceruleus (LC) are two brain areas that have been implicated in a range of cognitive phenomena, such as attention, memory, and decision-making. Regulators of these brain regions at the molecular level are not well understood but might help to elucidate underlying mechanisms of disorders that present with deficits in these cognitive domains. To probe this, we used chemogenetic stimulation of neurons in the LC with axonal projections to the prelimbic subregion (PrL) of the mFC and subsequent bulk RNA sequencing from the mouse PrL. We found that stimulation of this circuit caused an increase in transcription of a host of genes, including the <I>Apoe</I> gene. To investigate cell type-specific expression of <I>Apoe</I> in the PrL, we used a dual-virus approach to express either the excitatory DREADD receptor hM3Dq in LC neurons with projections to the PrL or a control virus and found that increases in <I>Apoe</I> expression in the PrL following depolarization of LC inputs is enriched in GABAergic neurons in a sex-dependent manner. The results of these experiments yield insights into how <I>Apoe</I> expression affects function in a cortical microcircuit that is important for attention, memory, and decision-making and point to interneuron-specific expression of <I>Apoe</I> as a potential biomarker for circuit function in disorders such as attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, schizophrenia, and Alzheimer's disease.</p>

                Background Postoperative immobilizatiton for patients with lower extremity fractures causes constipation, which usually affects 50–70% of patients. When it comes to nursing interventions for postoperative constipation, Swedish abdominal massage and warm water drinking therapy are two possible options. Aim The objective of this study is to compare the effectiveness of drinking warm water and Swedish abdominal massage on constipation scores on post-operative lower extremity fractures. Methods A quasi-experimental pre-posttest design without control group design was applied. 30 respondents used simple random sampling technique. The Constipation Assessment Scale (CAS) questionnaire was used to assess the patient’s constipation levels before and after the intervention. The data analysis used independent t-test. Results The mean score of constipation of drinking water group after the intervention was 4.60 while abdominal Swedish massage was 3.56. Although both significantly reduced the constipation score, the p-value was 0.00. Conclusion The protocol of drinking warm water and Swedish abdominal massage immediately after waking up effectively reduced constipation scores on postoperative lower extremity fracture patients and can be use to adjuvant therapy. Further studies are needed to investigate postoperative constipation patients with immobility and the use of strong analgetics.

                Background Artificial Intelligence (AI) offers transformative potential for human-computer interaction, particularly through eye-gesture recognition, enabling intuitive control for users and accessibility for individuals with physical impairments. Methods We developed an AI-driven eye-gesture recognition system using tools like OpenCV, MediaPipe, and PyAutoGUI to translate eye movements into commands. The system was trained on a dataset of 20,000 gestures from 100 diverse volunteers, representing various demographics, and tested under different conditions, including varying lighting and eyewear. Results The system achieved 99.63% accuracy in recognizing gestures, with slight reductions to 98.9% under reflective glasses. These results demonstrate its robustness and adaptability across scenarios, confirming its generalizability. Conclusions This system advances AI-driven interaction by enhancing accessibility and unlocking applications in critical fields like military and rescue operations. Future work will validate the system using publicly available datasets to further strengthen its impact and usability.

                Background Fenugreek, or Trigonella foenum-graecum L, is an edible and medicinal plant of the Fabaceae family. Fenugreek seeds are rich in proteins, lipids, and essential nutrients, and they also contain various phytochemicals, including flavonoids, steroidal saponins, coumarin, and alkaloids such as trigonelline. Trigonelline (TG) is a bioactive plant alkaloid initially extracted from fenugreek seeds. A substantial portion of fenugreek’s health benefits may rely on the presence of TG. This study addresses the critical need for a fast, green, and economical method that overcomes inefficiencies, high solvent usage, and sensitivity limitations in the quantification of TG. Methods Fenugreek seeds from various origins were extracted using three green solvents: acetone (ACt), ethanol (EtOH), and water (H2O). The UPLC-MS/MS method was developed and validated using a green mobile phase of H2O: EtOH, and an r2-value of 0.999 in the linearity range of 0.1-500 ppb was adopted. The method was validated with an accuracy of 98.6% for trace analysis of TG using a small amount (10 mg) of fenugreek samples from five different origins. Results The average extract yield was 5.36 mg/100 mg with a standard deviation (SD) of 6.3, with the highest extract yield observed in H2O. The ESI (+ve) of the UPLC-MS/MS resulted in the fragmentation pattern (m/z) 138→94.10→92.05→78.20. The TG quantification revealed an average TG concentration of 181.4 ppb (SD = 176.4), with the highest amount of TG in H2O extract (mean = 392.7, SD = 132.4 ppb), followed by EtOH (mean = 91.9, SD = 83.3 ppb) and ACt (mean = 59.5, SD = 30.9 ppb). The TG amount observed in the validation step substantiated the efficiency and reproducibility of the developed method. Conclusions The method may be used as an effective tool for a green, rapid, economical, and eco-friendly extraction and quantification of TG in diverse matrices of pharmaceutical, cosmeceutical, herbal, and food products.

                Background The burden of visual impairment and avoidable blindness has been attributed to the shortage and poor distribution of adequately trained eye care personnel. In the district health system, primary health care (PHC) nurses are the first point of contact for eye care patients. To provide adequate eye care, the nurses in PHC clinics apply their knowledge on basic eye health to ensure best practices and management for patients that present at their clinics. Anecdotal evidence regarding the knowledge and practices of these PHC professionals is scarce. The purpose of this study was to evaluate PHC nurses’ knowledge and practices on eye health. Methods A quantitative, cross-sectional study was conducted in a rural district of the Eastern Cape Province in South Africa. Stratified random sampling was used to select 28 from the 74 PHC clinics in the district. A researcher-administered questionnaire using a 5-point likert scale with options strongly disagree, disagree, neutral, agree and strongly agree, was developed, piloted and finalised for this study. The tool had four sections: demographic information, knowledge of eye health, practices on evaluating visual function and identification and management of presenting eye conditions. Data were collected, captured onto MSXcel, cleaned, coded and analysed descriptively, and for Chi-squared significance at 95%, using R statistical software. Results From 200 responses, 86.4% (n=172) were females of the African race. Most (93.5%, n=187) had never undergone formal training in eye care. Only 28% (n=56) correctly identified a mature cataract while 28% (n=56) correctly identified signs of glaucoma; the global leading causes of preventable blindness. A total of 94% (n=188) failed to accurately measure visual acuity on a patient. Conclusions PHC nurses showed poor knowledge and practices of common eye conditions. There is an urgent need for eye health training for PHC nurses, and the clear management protocols on eye care.

With the rapidly development of biotechnology, it is now possible to obtain single-cell multi-omics data in the same cell. However, how to integrate and analyze these single-cell multi-omics data remains a great challenge. Herein, we introduce an interpretable multitask framework (scMoMtF) for comprehensively analyzing single-cell multi-omics data. The scMoMtF can simultaneously solve multiple key tasks of single-cell multi-omics data including dimension reduction, cell classification and data simulation. The experimental results shows that scMoMtF outperforms current state-of-the-art algorithms on these tasks. In addition, scMoMtF has interpretability which allowing researchers to gain a reliable understanding of potential biological features and mechanisms in single-cell multi-omics data.

                <p>by Janez Demšar, Blaž Zupan</p>

Data clustering is a core data science approach widely used and referenced in the scientific literature. Its algorithms are often intuitive and can lead to exciting, insightful results that are easy to interpret. For these reasons, data clustering techniques could be the first method encountered in data science training. This paper proposes a hands-on approach to data clustering training suitable for introductory courses. The education approach features problem-based training that starts with the data and gradually introduces various data processing and analysis methods, illustrating them through visual representations of data and models. The proposed training is suitable for a general audience, does not require a background in statistics, mathematics, or computer science, and aims to engage the audience through practical examples, an exploratory approach to data analysis with visual analysis, experimentation, and a gentle learning curve. The manuscript details the pedagogical units of the training, motivates them through the sequence of methods introduced, and proposes data sets and data analysis workflows to be explored in the class.

The optimal contraception dosing strategy proposed by Gavina et al. recently is a commendable attempt to model a complex physiological process with potenial to apply to real-life data. However, there is a need to take into account the real challenges that arise when moving from the theory to its practical application, and it is important that lessons learnt from clinical studies be taken into consideration in any theoretical modelling. In this manuscript, we spell out these lessons and elaborate practical challenges facing their model.
