              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02962">Intrinsic motivation as constrained entropy maximization</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2502.02962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: "Intrinsic motivation" refers to the capacity for intelligent systems to be motivated endogenously, i.e. by features of agential architecture itself rather than by learned associations between action and reward. This paper views active inference, empowerment, and other formal accounts of intrinsic motivation as variations on the theme of constrained maximum entropy inference, providing a general perspective on intrinsic motivation complementary to existing frameworks. The connection between free energy and empowerment noted in previous literature is further explored, and it is argued that the maximum-occupancy approach in practice incorporates an implicit model-evidence constraint.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03198">SimSort: A Powerful Framework for Spike Sorting by Large-Scale Electrophysiology Simulation</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2502.03198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spike sorting is an essential process in neural recording, which identifies and separates electrical signals from individual neurons recorded by electrodes in the brain, enabling researchers to study how specific neurons communicate and process information. Although there exist a number of spike sorting methods which have contributed to significant neuroscientific breakthroughs, many are heuristically designed, making it challenging to verify their correctness due to the difficulty of obtaining ground truth labels from real-world neural recordings. In this work, we explore a data-driven, deep learning-based approach. We begin by creating a large-scale dataset through electrophysiology simulations using biologically realistic computational models. We then present \textbf{SimSort}, a pretraining framework for spike sorting. Remarkably, when trained on our simulated dataset, SimSort demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization to real-world spike sorting tasks, significantly outperforming existing methods. Our findings underscore the potential of data-driven techniques to enhance the reliability and scalability of spike sorting in experimental neuroscience.

Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) enable direct communication between the brain and external devices. This review highlights the core decoding algorithms that enable multimodal BCIs, including a dissection of the elements, a unified view of diversified approaches, and a comprehensive analysis of the present state of the field. We emphasize algorithmic advancements in cross-modality mapping, sequential modeling, besides classic multi-modality fusion, illustrating how these novel AI approaches enhance decoding of brain data. The current literature of BCI applications on visual, speech, and affective decoding are comprehensively explored. Looking forward, we draw attention on the impact of emerging architectures like multimodal Transformers, and discuss challenges such as brain data heterogeneity and common errors. This review also serves as a bridge in this interdisciplinary field for experts with neuroscience background and experts that study AI, aiming to provide a comprehensive understanding for AI-powered multimodal BCIs.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02529">Active learning of neural population dynamics using two-photon holographic optogenetics</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2412.02529v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in techniques for monitoring and perturbing neural populations have greatly enhanced our ability to study circuits in the brain. In particular, two-photon holographic optogenetics now enables precise photostimulation of experimenter-specified groups of individual neurons, while simultaneous two-photon calcium imaging enables the measurement of ongoing and induced activity across the neural population. Despite the enormous space of potential photostimulation patterns and the time-consuming nature of photostimulation experiments, very little algorithmic work has been done to determine the most effective photostimulation patterns for identifying the neural population dynamics. Here, we develop methods to efficiently select which neurons to stimulate such that the resulting neural responses will best inform a dynamical model of the neural population activity. Using neural population responses to photostimulation in mouse motor cortex, we demonstrate the efficacy of a low-rank linear dynamical systems model, and develop an active learning procedure which takes advantage of low-rank structure to determine informative photostimulation patterns. We demonstrate our approach on both real and synthetic data, obtaining in some cases as much as a two-fold reduction in the amount of data required to reach a given predictive power. Our active stimulation design method is based on a novel active learning procedure for low-rank regression, which may be of independent interest.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02831">How the Stroop Effect Arises from Optimal Response Times in Laterally Connected Self-Organizing Maps</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2502.02831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Stroop effect refers to cognitive interference in a color-naming task: When the color and the word do not match, the response is slower and more likely to be incorrect. The Stroop task is used to assess cognitive flexibility, selective attention, and executive function. This paper implements the Stroop task with self-organizing maps (SOMs): Target color and the competing word are inputs for the semantic and lexical maps, associative connections bring color information to the lexical map, and lateral connections combine their effects over time. The model achieved an overall accuracy of 84.2%, with significantly fewer errors and faster responses in congruent compared to no-input and incongruent conditions. The model's effect is a side effect of optimizing response times, and can thus be seen as a cost associated with overall efficient performance. The model can further serve studying neurologically-inspired cognitive control and related phenomena.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03047">Kozax: Flexible and Scalable Genetic Programming in JAX</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2502.03047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Genetic programming is an optimization algorithm inspired by natural selection which automatically evolves the structure of computer programs. The resulting computer programs are interpretable and efficient compared to black-box models with fixed structure. The fitness evaluation in genetic programming suffers from high computational requirements, limiting the performance on difficult problems. To reduce the runtime, many implementations of genetic programming require a specific data format, making the applicability limited to specific problem classes. Consequently, there is no efficient genetic programming framework that is usable for a wide range of tasks. To this end, we developed Kozax, a genetic programming framework that evolves symbolic expressions for arbitrary problems. We implemented Kozax using JAX, a framework for high-performance and scalable machine learning, which allows the fitness evaluation to scale efficiently to large populations or datasets on GPU. Furthermore, Kozax offers constant optimization, custom operator definition and simultaneous evolution of multiple trees. We demonstrate successful applications of Kozax to discover equations of natural laws, recover equations of hidden dynamic variables and evolve a control policy. Overall, Kozax provides a general, fast, and scalable library to optimize white-box solutions in the realm of scientific computing.

                arXiv:2502.03148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mutation process in evolution strategies has been interlinked with the normal distribution since its inception. Many lines of reasoning have been given for this strong dependency, ranging from maximum entropy arguments to the need for isotropy. However, some theoretical results suggest that other distributions might lead to similar local convergence properties. This paper empirically shows that a wide range of evolutionary strategies, from the (1+1)-ES to CMA-ES, show comparable optimization performance when using a mutation distribution other than the standard Gaussian. Replacing it with, e.g., uniformly distributed mutations, does not deteriorate the performance of ES, when using the default adaptation mechanism for the strategy parameters. We observe that these results hold not only for the sphere model but also for a wider range of benchmark problems.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03287">STEM: Spatial-Temporal Mapping Tool For Spiking Neural Networks</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2502.03287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are promising bio-inspired third-generation neural networks. Recent research has trained deep SNN models with accuracy on par with Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). Although the event-driven and sparse nature of SNNs show potential for more energy efficient computation than ANNs, SNN neurons have internal states which evolve over time. Keeping track of SNN states can significantly increase data movement and storage requirements, potentially losing its advantages with respect to ANNs. This paper investigates the energy effects of having neuron states, and how it is influenced by the chosen mapping to realistic hardware architectures with advanced memory hierarchies. Therefore, we develop STEMS, a mapping design space exploration tool for SNNs. STEMS models SNN's stateful behavior and explores intra-layer and inter-layer mapping optimizations to minimize data movement, considering both spatial and temporal SNN dimensions. Using STEMS, we show up to 12x reduction in off-chip data movement and 5x reduction in energy (on top of intra-layer optimizations), on two event-based vision SNN benchmarks. Finally, neuron states may not be needed for all SNN layers. By optimizing neuron states for one of our benchmarks, we show 20x reduction in neuron states and 1.4x better performance without accuracy loss.

                arXiv:2502.03086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study explores the implementation of large Quantum Restricted Boltzmann Machines (QRBMs), a key advancement in Quantum Machine Learning (QML), as generative models on D-Wave's Pegasus quantum hardware to address dataset imbalance in Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). By leveraging Pegasus's enhanced connectivity and computational capabilities, a QRBM with 120 visible and 120 hidden units was successfully embedded, surpassing the limitations of default embedding tools. The QRBM synthesized over 1.6 million attack samples, achieving a balanced dataset of over 4.2 million records. Comparative evaluations with traditional balancing methods, such as SMOTE and RandomOversampler, revealed that QRBMs produced higher-quality synthetic samples, significantly improving detection rates, precision, recall, and F1 score across diverse classifiers. The study underscores the scalability and efficiency of QRBMs, completing balancing tasks in milliseconds. These findings highlight the transformative potential of QML and QRBMs as next-generation tools in data preprocessing, offering robust solutions for complex computational challenges in modern information systems.

                arXiv:2502.03327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The success of transformers is often linked to their ability to perform in-context learning. Recent work shows that transformers are universal in context, capable of approximating any real-valued continuous function of a context (a probability measure over $\mathcal{X}\subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$) and a query $x\in \mathcal{X}$. This raises the question: Does in-context universality explain their advantage over classical models? We answer this in the negative by proving that MLPs with trainable activation functions are also universal in-context. This suggests the transformer's success is likely due to other factors like inductive bias or training stability.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14744">FSTA-SNN:Frequency-based Spatial-Temporal Attention Module for Spiking Neural Networks</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2501.14744v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are emerging as a promising alternative to Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) due to their inherent energy efficiency. Owing to the inherent sparsity in spike generation within SNNs, the in-depth analysis and optimization of intermediate output spikes are often neglected. This oversight significantly restricts the inherent energy efficiency of SNNs and diminishes their advantages in spatiotemporal feature extraction, resulting in a lack of accuracy and unnecessary energy expenditure. In this work, we analyze the inherent spiking characteristics of SNNs from both temporal and spatial perspectives. In terms of spatial analysis, we find that shallow layers tend to focus on learning vertical variations, while deeper layers gradually learn horizontal variations of features. Regarding temporal analysis, we observe that there is not a significant difference in feature learning across different time steps. This suggests that increasing the time steps has limited effect on feature learning. Based on the insights derived from these analyses, we propose a Frequency-based Spatial-Temporal Attention (FSTA) module to enhance feature learning in SNNs. This module aims to improve the feature learning capabilities by suppressing redundant spike features.The experimental results indicate that the introduction of the FSTA module significantly reduces the spike firing rate of SNNs, demonstrating superior performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines across multiple datasets.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05985">Asynchronous Stochastic Gradient Descent with Decoupled Backpropagation and Layer-Wise Updates</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2410.05985v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The increasing size of deep learning models has made distributed training across multiple devices essential. However, current methods such as distributed data-parallel training suffer from large communication and synchronization overheads when training across devices, leading to longer training times as a result of suboptimal hardware utilization. Asynchronous stochastic gradient descent (ASGD) methods can improve training speed, but are sensitive to delays due to both communication and differences throughput. Moreover, the backpropagation algorithm used within ASGD workers is bottlenecked by the interlocking between its forward and backward passes. Current methods also do not take advantage of the large differences in the computation required for the forward and backward passes. Therefore, we propose an extension to ASGD called Partial Decoupled ASGD (PD-ASGD) that addresses these issues. PD-ASGD uses separate threads for the forward and backward passes, decoupling the updates and allowing for a higher ratio of forward to backward threads than the usual 1:1 ratio, leading to higher throughput. PD-ASGD also performs layer-wise (partial) model updates concurrently across multiple threads. This reduces parameter staleness and consequently improves robustness to delays. Our approach yields close to state-of-the-art results while running up to $5.95\times$ faster than synchronous data parallelism in the presence of delays, and up to $2.14\times$ times faster than comparable ASGD algorithms by achieving higher model flops utilization. We mathematically describe the gradient bias introduced by our method, establish an upper bound, and prove convergence.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to improving Genetic Algorithms (GA) in large or complex problem spaces by incorporating new chromosome patterns in the breeding process through border trade activities. These strategies increase chromosome diversity, preventing premature convergence and enhancing the GA's ability to explore the solution space more effectively. Empirical evidence demonstrates significant improvements in convergence behavior. This approach offers a promising pathway to addressing challenges in optimizing large or complex problem domains.

                arXiv:2502.01706v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Biologically inspired neural networks offer alternative avenues to model data distributions. FlyVec is a recent example that draws inspiration from the fruit fly's olfactory circuit to tackle the task of learning word embeddings. Surprisingly, this model performs competitively even against deep learning approaches specifically designed to encode text, and it does so with the highest degree of computational efficiency. We pose the question of whether this performance can be improved further. For this, we introduce Comply. By incorporating positional information through complex weights, we enable a single-layer neural network to learn sequence representations. Our experiments show that Comply not only supersedes FlyVec but also performs on par with significantly larger state-of-the-art models. We achieve this without additional parameters. Comply yields sparse contextual representations of sentences that can be interpreted explicitly from the neuron weights.

                <p>Deciding how long to keep waiting for uncertain future rewards is a complex problem. Previous research has shown that choosing to stop waiting results from an evaluative process that weighs the subjective value of the awaited reward against the opportunity cost of waiting. Activity in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) tracks the dynamics of this evaluation, while activation in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) and anterior insula (AI) ramps up before a decision to quit is made. Here, we provide causal evidence of the necessity of these brain regions for successful performance in a willingness-to-wait task. Twenty-eight participants (20 female and 8 male) with lesions to different regions of the frontal lobe were tested on their ability to adaptively calibrate how long they waited for monetary rewards. We found that participants with lesions to the vmPFC waited less overall, while participants with lesions to the dmPFC and anterior insula were specifically impaired at calibrating their level of persistence to the environment. These behavioral effects were accounted for by systematic differences in parameter estimates from a computational model of task performance.</p>

                <p>Cognitive control relies on neural representations that are inherently high-dimensional and distributed across multiple subregions in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Traditional approaches tackle prefrontal representation by reducing it into a unidimensional measure (univariate amplitude) or using it to distinguish a limited number of alternatives (pattern classification). In contrast, representational similarity analysis (RSA) enables flexibly formulating various hypotheses about informational contents underlying the neural codes, explicitly comparing hypotheses, and examining the representational alignment between brain regions. Here, we used a multifaceted paradigm wherein the difficulty of cognitive control was manipulated separately for five cognitive tasks. We used RSA to unveil representational contents, measure the representational alignment between regions, and quantify representational generality versus specificity. We found a graded transition in the lateral PFC: The dorsocaudal PFC was tuned to task difficulty (indexed by reaction times), preferentially connected with the parietal cortex, and representationally generalizable across domains. The ventrorostral PFC was tuned to the abstract structure of tasks, preferentially connected with the temporal cortex, and representationally specific. The middle PFC (interposed between the dorsocaudal and ventrorostral PFC) was tuned to individual task sets and ranked in the middle in terms of connectivity and generalizability. Furthermore, whether a region was dimensionally rich or sparse covaried with its functional profile: Low dimensionality (only gist) in the dorsocaudal PFC dovetailed with better generality, whereas high dimensionality (gist plus details) in the ventrorostral PFC corresponded with better ability to encode subtleties. Our findings, collectively, demonstrate how cognitive control is decomposed into distinct facets that transition steadily along prefrontal subregions.</p>

                <p>Excitatory synapses and the actin-rich dendritic spines on which they reside are indispensable for information processing and storage in the brain. In the adult hippocampus, excitatory synapses must balance plasticity and stability to support learning and memory. However, the mechanisms governing this balance remain poorly understood. Tiam1 is an actin cytoskeleton regulator prominently expressed in the dentate gyrus (DG) throughout life. Previously, we showed that Tiam1 promotes dentate granule cell synapse and spine stabilization during development, but its role in the adult hippocampus remains unclear. Here, we deleted Tiam1 from adult forebrain excitatory neurons (<I>Tiam1<sup>fKO</sup></I>) and assessed the effects on hippocampal-dependent behaviors. Adult male and female <I>Tiam1<sup>fKO</sup></I> mice displayed enhanced contextual fear memory, fear extinction, and spatial discrimination. Investigation into underlying mechanisms revealed that dentate granule cells from <I>Tiam1<sup>fKO</sup></I> brain slices exhibited augmented synaptic plasticity and N-methyl-D-aspartate&ndash;type glutamate receptor (NMDAR) function. Additionally, Tiam1 loss in primary hippocampal neurons blocked agonist-induced NMDAR internalization, reduced filamentous actin levels, and promoted activity-dependent spine remodeling. Notably, strong NMDAR activation in wild-type hippocampal neurons triggered Tiam1 loss from spines. Our results suggest that Tiam1 normally constrains hippocampal-dependent learning and memory in the adult brain by restricting NMDAR-mediated synaptic plasticity in the DG. We propose that Tiam1 achieves this by limiting NMDAR availability at synaptic membranes and stabilizing spine actin cytoskeleton and that these constraints can be alleviated by activity-dependent degradation of Tiam1. These findings reveal a previously unknown mechanism restricting hippocampal synaptic plasticity and highlight Tiam1 as a therapeutic target for enhancing cognitive function.</p>

                <p>Reward-predictive cues can affect decision-making by enhancing instrumental responses toward the same (specific transfer) or similar (general transfer) rewards. The main theories on cue-guided decision-making consider specific transfer as driven by the activation of previously learned instrumental actions induced by cues sharing the sensory-specific properties of the reward they are associated with. However, to date, such theoretical assumption has never been directly investigated at the neural level. We hypothesize that such reactivation occurs within the premotor system and could be mapped by lateralized beta (12&ndash;30&nbsp;Hz) desynchronization, a widely used marker of action selection and decision-making policy. To test this hypothesis, 42 participants (22 females) performed a pavlovian-to-instrumental transfer paradigm, while electroencephalographic activity was recorded. We anticipated increased beta desynchronization during the transfer phase when cues promoting specific transfer were presented, compared with cues predicting general transfer and neutral cues. The evidence collected confirmed our hypothesis, thus providing the first neural evidence in favor of the theorized reactivation of instrumental actions and corroborating the presence of two dissociable neural pathways underpinning specific and general transfer.</p>

                <p>Cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART) peptide has been implicated in stress-related behaviors that are regulated by central serotonergic (5-HT) systems in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN). Here, we aimed to investigate the interaction between CART and DRN 5-HTergic systems after initially observing CART axonal terminals in the DRN. We found that microinfusion of CART peptide <SUB>(55&ndash;102)</SUB> into the DRN-induced anxiogenic effects in male C57BL/6J mice, while central administration of CART reduced c-Fos in 5-HT<sup>DRN</sup> neurons. This inhibitory effect of exogenous CART on 5-HT<sup>DRN</sup> activity and local 5-HT release was also demonstrated via in vivo fiber photometry coupled with calcium and 5-HT biosensors. CART inputs to the DRN were observed in various subcortical nuclei, but only those in the centrally projecting Edinger&ndash;Westphal nucleus (EWcp) were highly responsive to stress. Chemogenetic activation of these DRN-projecting CART<sup>EWcp</sup> neurons recapitulated the effects of intra-DRN CART infusion on anxiety-like behavior in males, but not in females, suggesting a sex-specific role for this pathway. Interestingly, CART<sup>EWcp</sup> projections to the DRN made direct synaptic contact primarily with non-5-HT neurons, which were also found to express putative CART receptors. Furthermore, chemogenetic stimulation of this CART<sup>EWcp-&gt;DRN</sup> pathway inhibited 5-HT neurons while increasing activity in local GABAergic neurons. In summary, this study establishes for the first time a neuromodulatory role for CART<sup>EWcp</sup> neurons in 5-HT<sup>DRN</sup> neurotransmission and suggests that CART may drive anxiety-like behavior by promoting feedforward inhibition of 5-HT neurons.</p>

                <p>Neuroendocrine cells react to physical, chemical, and synaptic signals originating from tissues and the nervous system, releasing hormones that regulate various body functions beyond the synapse. Neuroendocrine cells are often embedded in complex tissues making direct tests of their activation mechanisms and signaling effects difficult to study. In the nematode worm <I>Caenorhabditis elegans</I>, four uterine-vulval (uv1) neuroendocrine cells sit above the vulval canal next to the egg-laying circuit, releasing tyramine and neuropeptides that feedback to inhibit egg laying. We have previously shown uv1 cells are mechanically deformed during egg laying, driving uv1 Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients. However, whether egg-laying circuit activity, vulval opening, and/or egg release triggered uv1 Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity was unclear. Here, we show uv1 responds directly to mechanical activation. Optogenetic vulval muscle stimulation triggers uv1 Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity following muscle contraction even in sterile animals. Direct mechanical prodding with a glass probe placed against the worm cuticle triggers robust uv1 Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity similar to that seen during egg laying. Direct mechanical activation of uv1 cells does not require other cells in the egg-laying circuit, synaptic or peptidergic neurotransmission, or transient receptor potential vanilloid  and Piezo channels. EGL-19 L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, but not P/Q/N-type or ryanodine receptor Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, promote uv1 Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity following mechanical activation. L-type channels also facilitate the coordinated activation of uv1 cells across the vulva, suggesting mechanical stimulation of one uv1 cell cross-activates the other. Our findings show how neuroendocrine cells like uv1 report on the mechanics of tissue deformation and muscle contraction, facilitating feedback to local circuits to coordinate behavior.</p>

                <p>We employed high-resolution fMRI to distinguish the impacts of anisometropia and strabismus amblyopia on the evoked ocular dominance (OD) response. Sixteen amblyopic participants (eight females) plus eight individuals with normal vision (one female), participated in this study for whom we measured the difference between the response to stimulation of the two eyes, across areas V1&ndash;V4. In controls, the evoked OD response formed the expected striped pattern within V1. Compared to controls, the OD response in amblyopic participants formed larger fused patches that extended into downstream visual areas. Moreover, both anisometropic and strabismic participants showed elevated OD responses across V1&ndash;V4. Beyond these common effects, and despite similar densities of amblyopia between the two groups, strabismus, and anisometropia had differential impacts on the OD bias, binocular response, and correlation between V1 depth levels. Specifically, we found a greater increase in the size of the V1 portion that responded preferentially to fellow eye stimulation in anisometropic compared with strabismic individuals. We also found a greater difference between the amplitudes of the response to binocular stimulation, in those regions that responded preferentially to the fellow versus amblyopic eye, in anisometropic compared with strabismic participants. In contrast, strabismic participants demonstrated an increased correlation between the OD responses evoked within V1 superficial and deep depths, whereas anisometropic individuals did not. These results provide the primary direct functional evidence for distinct impacts of strabismus and anisometropia on the mesoscale functional organization of the human visual system, thus extending what was inferred previously about amblyopia from animal models.</p>

                <p>The neurotransmitter dopamine (DA) has a multifaceted role in healthy and disordered brains through its action on multiple subtypes of dopaminergic receptors. How the modulation of these receptors influences learning and motivation by altering intrinsic brain-wide networks remains unclear. Here, we performed parallel behavioral and resting-state functional MRI experiments after administration of two different DA receptor antagonists in male and female macaque monkeys. Systemic administration of SCH-23390 (D1 antagonist) slowed probabilistic learning when subjects had to learn new stimulus&ndash;reward associations and diminished functional connectivity (FC) in corticocortical and frontostriatal connections. In contrast, haloperidol (D2 antagonist) improved learning and broadly enhanced FC in cortical connections. Further comparisons between the effect of SCH-23390/haloperidol on behavioral and resting-state FC revealed specific cortical and subcortical networks associated with the cognitive and motivational effects of DA manipulation, respectively. Thus, we reveal distinct brain-wide networks that are associated with the dopaminergic control of learning and motivation via DA receptors.</p>

                <p>The precuneus is a site of early amyloid-beta (A&beta;) accumulation. Previous cross-sectional studies reported increased precuneus fMRI activity in older adults with mild cognitive deficits or elevated A&beta;. However, longitudinal studies in early Alzheimer's disease (AD) are lacking and the relationship to the Apolipoprotein-E (<I>APOE</I>) genotype is unclear. Investigating the PREVENT-AD dataset, we assessed how baseline and longitudinal precuneus activity during successful memory retrieval relates to future A&beta; and tau burden and change in memory performance. We further studied the moderation by <I>APOE</I>4 genotype. We included 165 older adults (age, 62.8 &plusmn; 4.4&nbsp;years; 113 female; 66 <I>APOE</I>4 carriers) who were cognitively normal at baseline with a family history of AD. All participants performed task-fMRI at baseline and underwent <sup>18</sup>F-flortaucipir-PET and <sup>18</sup>F-NAV4694-A&beta;-PET on average 5&nbsp;years later. We found that higher baseline activity and greater longitudinal increase in precuneus activity were associated with higher A&beta; burden in <I>APOE</I>4 carriers but not noncarriers. We observed no effects of precuneus activity on tau burden. Finally, <I>APOE</I>4 noncarriers with low baseline precuneus activity exhibited better longitudinal performance in an independent memory test compared with (1) noncarriers with higher baseline activity and (2) <I>APOE</I>4 carriers. Our findings suggest that higher task-related precuneus activity during memory retrieval at baseline and over time are associated with greater A&beta; burden in cognitively normal <I>APOE</I>4 carriers. Our results further indicate that the absence of "hyperactivation" and the absence of the <I>APOE</I>4 allele is related with better future cognitive outcomes in cognitively normal older adults at risk for AD.</p>

                <p>The mammalian auditory system encodes sounds with subtypes of spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) that differ in sound level sensitivity, permitting discrimination across a wide range of levels. Recent work suggests the physiologically defined SGN subtypes correspond to at least three molecular subtypes. It is not known how information from the different subtypes converges within the cochlear nucleus. We examined this issue using transgenic mice of both sexes that express Cre recombinase in SGNs that are positive for markers of two subtypes: CALB2 (calretinin) in type 1a SGNs and LYPD1 in type 1c SGNs, which correspond to high- and low-sensitivity subtypes, respectively. We crossed these with mice expressing floxed channelrhodopsin, which allowed specific activation of axons from type 1a or 1c SGNs using optogenetics. We made voltage-clamp recordings from bushy cells in the anteroventral cochlear nucleus (AVCN) and found that the synapses formed by CALB2- and LYPD1-positive SGNs had similar EPSC amplitudes and short-term plasticity. Immunohistochemistry revealed that individual bushy cells receive a mix of 1a, 1b, and 1c synapses with VGluT1-positive puncta of similar sizes. We used optogenetic stimulation during in vivo recordings to classify chopper and primary-like units as receiving versus nonreceiving 1a- or 1c-type inputs. These groups showed no significant difference in threshold or spontaneous rate, suggesting the subtypes do not segregate into distinct processing streams in the AVCN. Our results indicate that principal cells in the AVCN integrate information from all SGN subtypes with extensive convergence, which could optimize sound encoding across a large dynamic range.</p>

                <p>The gustatory system allows animals to assess the nutritive value and safety of foods prior to ingestion. The first step in gustation is the interaction of taste stimuli with one or more specific sensory receptors that are generally believed to be present on the apical surface of the taste receptor cells. However, this assertion is rarely tested. We recently identified OTOP1 as a proton channel and showed that it is required for taste response to acids (sour) and ammonium. Here, we examined the cellular and subcellular localization of OTOP1 by tagging the endogenous OTOP1 protein with an N-terminal HA epitope (HA-OTOP1). Using both male and female HA-OTOP1 mice and high-resolution imaging, we show that OTOP1 is strictly localized to the apical tips of taste cells throughout the tongue and oral cavity. Interestingly, immunoreactivity is observed in the actin-rich taste pore above the tight junctions defined by zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) and also immediately below these junctions. Surprisingly, OTOP1 immunoreactivity is not restricted to Type III taste receptor cells (TRCs) that mediate sour taste but is also observed in glia-like Type I TRCs proposed to perform housekeeping functions, a result that is corroborated by scRNA-seq data. The apical localization of OTOP1 supports the contention that OTOP1 functions as a taste receptor and suggests that OTOP1 may be accessible to orally available compounds that could act as taste modifiers.</p>

                <p>Perineuronal nets (PNNs) are a specialized extracellular matrix that surrounds certain populations of neurons, including (inhibitory) parvalbumin (PV)-expressing interneurons throughout the brain and (excitatory) CA2 pyramidal neurons in hippocampus. PNNs are thought to regulate synaptic plasticity by stabilizing synapses and as such, could regulate learning and memory. Most often, PNN functions are queried using enzymatic degradation with chondroitinase, but that approach does not differentiate PNNs on CA2 neurons from those on adjacent PV cells. To disentangle the specific roles of PNNs on CA2 pyramidal cells and PV neurons in behavior, we generated conditional knock-out mouse strains with the primary protein component of PNNs, aggrecan (<I>Acan</I>), deleted from either CA2 pyramidal cells (Amigo2 <I>Acan</I> KO) or from PV cells (PV <I>Acan</I> KO). Male and female animals of each strain were tested for social, fear, and spatial memory, as well as for reversal learning. We found that Amigo2 <I>Acan</I> KO animals, but not PV <I>Acan</I> KO animals, had impaired social memory and reversal learning. PV <I>Acan</I> KOs, but not Amigo2 <I>Acan</I> KOs, had impaired contextual fear memory. These findings demonstrate independent roles for PNNs on each cell type in regulating hippocampal-dependent memory. We further investigated a potential mechanism of impaired social memory in the Amigo2 <I>Acan</I> KO animals and found reduced input to CA2 from the supramammillary nucleus (SuM), which signals social novelty. Additionally, Amigo2 <I>Acan</I> KOs lacked a social novelty-related local field potential response, suggesting that CA2 PNNs may coordinate functional SuM connections and associated physiological responses to social novelty.</p>

                <p>Transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) and vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) channels are crucial for detecting and transmitting nociceptive stimuli. Inflammatory pain is associated with sustained increases in TRPA1 and TRPV1 expression in primary sensory neurons. However, the epigenetic mechanisms driving this upregulation remain unknown. G9a (encoded by <I>Ehmt2</I>) catalyzes H3K9me2 and generally represses gene transcription. In this study, we found that intrathecal administration of UNC0638, a specific G9a inhibitor, or G9a-specific siRNA, substantially reduced complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA)-induced pain hypersensitivity. Remarkably, CFA treatment did not induce persistent pain hypersensitivity in male and female mice with conditional <I>Ehmt2</I> knock-out in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons. RNA sequencing and quantitative PCR analyses showed that CFA treatment caused a sustained increase in mRNA levels of <I>Trpa1</I> and <I>Trpv1</I> in the DRG. <I>Ehmt2</I> knock-out in DRG neurons elevated baseline <I>Trpa1</I> and <I>Trpv1</I> mRNA levels but notably reversed CFA-induced increases in their expression. Chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed that CFA treatment reduced G9a and H3K9me2 levels while increasing H3K9ac and H3K4me3&mdash;activating histone marks&mdash;at <I>Trpa1</I> and <I>Trpv1</I> promoters in the DRG. Strikingly, conditional <I>Ehmt2</I> knock-out in DRG neurons not only diminished H3K9me2 but also reversed CFA-induced increases in H3K9ac and H3K4me3 at <I>Trpa1</I> and <I>Trpv1</I> promoters. Our findings suggest that G9a in primary sensory neurons constitutively represses <I>Trpa1</I> and <I>Trpv1</I> transcription under normal conditions but paradoxically enhances their transcription during tissue inflammation. This latter action accounts for inflammation-induced TRPA1 and TRPV1 upregulation in the DRG. Thus, G9a could be targeted for alleviating persistent inflammatory pain.</p>

                <p>The prefrontal cortex (PFC) plays a key role in high-level cognitive functions and emotional behaviors, and PFC alterations correlate with different brain disorders including major depression and anxiety. In mice, the first two postnatal weeks represent a critical period of high sensitivity to environmental changes. In this temporal window, serotonin (5-HT) levels regulate the wiring of PFC cortical neurons. Early-life insults and postnatal exposure to the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine (FLX) affect PFC development leading to depressive and anxiety-like phenotypes in adult mice. However, the mechanisms responsible for these dysfunctions remain obscure. We found that early postnatal FLX exposure (PNFLX) results in reduced overall firing and high-frequency bursting of putative pyramidal neurons (PNs) of deep layers of the medial PFC of adult mice of both sexes in vivo. Ex vivo, patch-clamp recordings revealed that PNFLX abolished high-frequency firing in a distinct subpopulation of deep-layer mPFC PNs, which transiently express the serotonin transporter SERT during the first 2 postnatal weeks. SERT+ and SERT&ndash; PNs exhibit distinct morphofunctional properties. Genetic deletion of 5-HT7Rs and pharmacological 5-HT7R blockade partially rescued both the PNFLX-induced reduction of PN firing in vivo and the altered firing of SERT+ PNs in vitro. This indicates a pivotal role of this 5-HTR subtype in mediating 5-HT-dependent maturation of PFC circuits that are susceptible to early-life insults. Overall, our results suggest potential novel neurobiological mechanisms, underlying detrimental neurodevelopmental consequences induced by early-life alterations of 5-HT levels.</p>

Bell Jar utilizes Mattes mutual information-directed B-spline transformations to achieve precise alignments, even with damaged sample tissues. While user input remains a requirement for fine-tuning section matches, the platform streamlines the process, aiding rapid analyses in high-throughput neuroanatomy studies. As a standalone desktop application with a user-friendly interface, Bell Jar&rsquo;s performance, which surpasses traditional manual and existing automated methods, can improve the reproducibility and throughput of histological analyses.</p>

                <p>Observing lip movements of a speaker facilitates speech understanding, especially in challenging listening situations. Converging evidence from neuroscientific studies shows stronger neural responses to audiovisual stimuli compared with audio-only stimuli. However, the interindividual variability of this contribution of lip movement information and its consequences on behavior are unknown. We analyzed source-localized magnetoencephalographic responses from 29 normal-hearing participants (12 females) listening to audiovisual speech, both with and without the speaker wearing a surgical face mask, and in the presence or absence of a distractor speaker. Using temporal response functions to quantify neural speech tracking, we show that neural responses to lip movements are, in general, enhanced when speech is challenging. After controlling for speech acoustics, we show that lip movements contribute to enhanced neural speech tracking, particularly when a distractor speaker is present. However, the extent of this visual contribution to neural speech tracking varied greatly among participants. Probing the behavioral relevance, we demonstrate that individuals who show a higher contribution of lip movements in terms of neural speech tracking show a stronger drop in comprehension and an increase in perceived difficulty when the mouth is occluded by a surgical face mask. In contrast, no effect was found when the mouth was not occluded. We provide novel insights on how the contribution of lip movements in terms of neural speech tracking varies among individuals and its behavioral relevance, revealing negative consequences when visual speech is absent. Our results also offer potential implications for objective assessments of audiovisual speech perception.</p>

                Abstract Background The cervical vertebral maturation method serves as a predictive tool for assessing growth status through the analysis of cervical vertebrae morphology. Prior to initiating treatment, it is crucial to ascertain the maturation stage to identify the optimal timing for intervention. In the context of cervical vertebral maturation assessment, two predominant methodologies are commonly employed, the Cervical Vertebrae Maturation (CVM) and the Cervical Stage (CS). This study aims to evaluate the reproducibility of these two methods. Methods Ninety cephalometric radiographs that met the inclusion criteria were selected. Two orthodontists classified the cervical vertebrae using the Baccetti, Franchi and McNamara method published in 2002 (CVM) and 2005 (CS) through manual tracing. Intra- and interexaminer reliability were analyzed using Weighted Kappa values. Results The intraexaminer reliability for CVM method in both examiners were described as almost perfect agreement. (κw = 0.86 and κw = 0.87). Intraexaminer reliability for CS method in both examiners were almost perfect agreement (κw = 0.95 and κw = 0.88). Agreement between examiners in the CVM method was moderate (κw = 0.66), and in the CS method, it was substantial (κw = 0.82). Conclusions The CS method showed superior reproducibility compared to the CVM method as a result of its more straightforward assessment approach. When assessing growth status using the cervical vertebrae analysis method, the CS method is more reliable than CVM method.

                Background The COVID-19 pandemic has led to instructions and suggestions from governments and experts to maintain social (physical) distance between people to prevent aerosol transmission of the virus, which is now becoming the norm. Thus, we examined whether the pandemic extended the distance between personal belongings. Methods We recruited 68 university students and instructed them to place their belongings on a long table following another participant (i.e., confederate). We measured the physical distance between the two belongings (i.e., the participant’s and the confederate’s). We collected data between June 10, 2022 and January 23, 2023. Pre-pandemic data was from Ariga (2016). Analysis was completed with one-tailed t-tests. Results Compared with the pre-pandemic results, via one-tailed t-test, the distance between the two belongings during the pandemic was significantly longer. Our results supported the hypothesis that the psychological framework for processing people’s belongings has dramatically changed during this pandemic. Conclusion This change may have been driven by social distancing practices or an increase in perceived vulnerability to disease. Our results provide new implications for future public spatial design, in other words, not only the distance between people, but also the distance between their belongings.

                The Wallacea region of Indonesia has high biodiversity and highly unique and endangered species. Its terrestrial ecosystems have unique flora and fauna found nowhere else. Nevertheless, the strategy for protecting and conserving the Wallacea ecosystem is like that in other parts of Indonesia, since it refers to the national forest and environmental regulations. The uniqueness of the Wallacea ecosystem does not reflect the extraordinary efforts of protecting and conserving the region’s pristine ecosystem. The continuing decline of the forestland and expansions of agricultural lands have indicated the need for a more fundamental and integrative approach to conserving and protecting the Wallacea ecosystem, particularly forestlands. We use the actor-centered power (ACP) approach or ideas and use the Wallacea Line to highlight how this idea is contested and confronted with the dynamics of complex societies and ecosystems. The ACP approach is the most widely used one in the implementation of the community forest (CF) program in Indonesia. The CF program is one of Indonesia’s community-based forest management schemes that empowers local communities to manage state forests sustainably. We chose two national parks established in the Wallacea region, Mutis on Timor Island and Matalawa on Sumba Island, to elaborate further on the development, conservation, and changes that occurred within that landscape. The ACP approach, in line with the spirit of the decentralization era, has mixed consequences for forest management and the biodiversity of the Wallacea region. Regarding the specific characteristics of the Wallacea region and lessons learned from the ACP approach implementation in the CF program, we then propose a sustainable model of reforestation and forest protection that applies the principle of “unity in diversity,” where all actors involved have space for the growth of creativity and positive contributions to sustainable forest protection.

                <p>by Jamel Simpson, Peter M. Kasson</p>

Betacoronaviruses pose an ongoing pandemic threat. Antigenic evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 virus has shown that much of the spontaneous antibody response is narrowly focused rather than broadly neutralizing against even SARS-CoV-2 variants, let alone future threats. One way to overcome this is by focusing the antibody response against better-conserved regions of the viral spike protein. This has been demonstrated empirically in prior work, but we posit that systematic design tools will further potentiate antigenic focusing approaches. Here, we present a design approach to predict stable chimeras between SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses, creating synthetic spike proteins that display a desired conserved region, in this case S2, and vary other regions. We leverage AlphaFold to predict chimeric structures and create a new metric for scoring chimera stability based on AlphaFold outputs. We evaluated 114 candidate spike chimeras using this approach. Top chimeras were further evaluated using molecular dynamics simulation as an intermediate validation technique, showing good stability compared to low-scoring controls. Experimental testing of five predicted-stable and two predicted-unstable chimeras confirmed 5/7 predictions, with one intermediate result. This demonstrates the feasibility of the underlying approach, which can be used to design custom immunogens to focus the immune response against a desired viral glycoprotein epitope.

<i>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</i> is a human-specific pathogen that causes the important sexually transmitted infection, gonorrhoea, an inflammatory condition of the genitourinary tract. The bacterium is closely related to the meningococcus, a leading cause of bacterial meningitis. Both these invasive bacterial species undergo autolysis when in the stationary phase of growth. Autolysis is a form of programmed cell death (PCD) which is part of the life cycle of remarkably few bacteria and poses an evolutionary conundrum as altruistic death provides no obvious benefit for single-celled organisms. Here, we searched for genes present in these 2 invasive species but not in other members of the <i>Neisseria</i> genus. We identified a ~3.4 kb horizontally acquired region, we termed the <i>nap</i> island, which is largely restricted to the gonococcus and meningococcus. The <i>nap</i> island in the gonococcus encodes 3 cationic, bacteriocin-like peptides which have no detectable antimicrobial activity. Instead, the gonococcal <i>N</i><i>eisseria</i> autolysis peptides (Naps) promote autolytic cell death when bacteria enter the stationary phase of growth. Furthermore, strains lacking the Naps exhibit reduced autolysis in assays of PCD. Expression of Naps is likely to be phase variable, explaining how PCD could have arisen in these important human pathogens. NapC also induces lysis of human cells, so the peptides are likely to have multiple roles during colonisation and disease. The acquisition of the nap island contributed to the emergence of PCD in the gonococcus and meningococcus and potentially to the appearance of invasive disease in <i>Neisseria</i> spp.

                <p>by Jiwon Yu, Junha Cha, Geon Koh, Insuk Lee</p>

Cell type-specific actions of disease genes add a significant layer of complexity to the genetic architecture underlying diseases, obscuring our understanding of disease mechanisms. Single-cell omics have revealed the functional roles of genes at the cellular level, identifying cell types critical for disease progression. Often, a gene impact on disease through its altered network within specific cell types, rather than mere changes in expression levels. To explore the cell type-specific roles of disease genes, we developed HCNetlas (human cell network atlas), a resource cataloging cell type-specific gene networks (CGNs) for various healthy tissue cells. We also devised 3 network analysis methods to investigate cell type-specific functions of disease genes. These methods involve comparing HCNetlas CGNs with those derived from disease-affected tissue samples. These methods find that systemic lupus erythematosus genes predominantly function in myeloid cells, and Alzheimer’s disease genes mainly play roles in inhibitory and excitatory neurons. Additionally, they suggest that many lung cancer-related genes may exert their roles in immune cells. These findings suggest that HCNetlas has the potential to link disease-associated genes to cell types of action, facilitating development of cell type-resolved diagnostics and therapeutic strategies for complex human diseases.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/12-1441/v2?src=rss">Epidemiological profiles and causes of sudden deaths of various ages in Ethiopia: an autopsy-based study [version 2; peer review: 3 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background Sudden death is an important global public health issue. An autopsy is an important source of epidemiological data, as the considerable causes of sudden death remain hermetic until postmortem examination. This study is devoted to evaluating the sociodemographic, behavioral, clinical and pathological characteristics of sudden deaths of various ages in Ethiopia. Methods This is an observational, prospective, descriptive study that included all sudden deaths observed over 1 year at St. Paul’s Hospital and Millennium Medical College, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Results Sudden death (n = 568) accounted for 11.5% (95% CI: 10.6-12.4) of all autopsied cases. There were 482 males and 86 females (M:F ratio of 5.6:1) and a mean age of 44.8±17.349. The peak age group was the fourth and fifth decades, accounting for 43.9% of the cases. Chronic substance abuse and a history of prior illness were declared in 40.1% and 38% of cases of sudden death, respectively. Cardiovascular (36.1%), respiratory (32.6%), and gastrointestinal system (19.5%) pathologies were the most common causes. The leading underlying causes of sudden death were ischemic heart disease and pneumonia. Most (86.6%) sudden deaths occurred outside of a hospital setting. Conclusions Most of the causes of sudden death in Ethiopia can be prevented and treated. The majority of sudden deaths are silent without preexisting symptoms. Therefore, it is vital to develop public health measures that will help educate the community about the importance of recognizing the manifestation of various clinical conditions and the need to seek immediate clinical help. Furthermore, efforts should be made to make healthcare facilities accessible and affordable with adequate diagnostic and management capacity. Documentation of autopsy-based data could provide important epidemiological information to guide medical services, prevention efforts, and control measures.

<p>This study uses a 12-week chronic unpredictable stress (PCUS) model to examine rat anxiety-like behaviors and hippocampal transcriptomic responses to stress and to chronic 4-week treatment with a classical antidepressant fluoxetine, an anti-inflammatory agent eicosapentaenoic acid, a pro-inflammatory agent lipopolysaccharide and their combinations.</p>

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Chronic stress is a common trigger of multiple neuropsychiatric illnesses. Animal models are widely used to study stress-induced brain disorders and their interplay with neuroinflammation and other neuroimmune processes. Here, we apply the prolonged 12-week chronic unpredictable stress (PCUS) model to examine rat behavioral and hippocampal transcriptomic responses to stress and to chronic 4-week treatment with a classical antidepressant fluoxetine, an anti-inflammatory agent eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), a pro-inflammatory agent lipopolysaccharide and their combinations. Overall, PCUS evoked anxiety-like behavioral phenotype in rats, corrected by chronic fluoxetine (alone or combined with other drugs), and EPA. PCUS also evoked pronounced transcriptomic responses in rat hippocampi, involving &gt; 200 differentially expressed genes. While pharmacological manipulations did not affect hippocampal gene expression markedly, <i>Gpr6</i>, <i>Drd2</i> and <i>Adora2a</i> were downregulated in stressed rats treated with fluoxetine, EPA and fluoxetine + EPA, suggesting their respective protein products (G protein-coupled receptor 6, dopamine D2 receptor and adenosine A2A receptor) as potential evolutionarily conserved targets under chronic stress. Overall, these findings support the validity of rat PCUS paradigm as a useful model to study stress-related anxiety pathogenesis, and call for further research probing how various conventional and novel drugs may (co)modulate behavioral and neurotranscriptomic biomarkers of chronic stress.</p>

                Background Breast cancer remains a significant global health concern, with over 7.8 million cases reported in the last five years. Early detection and accurate classification are crucial for reducing mortality rates and improving outcomes. Machine learning (ML) has emerged as a transformative tool in medical imaging, enabling more efficient and accurate diagnostic processes. Objective This study aims to develop a machine learning-based predictive model for early detection and classification of breast cancer using the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Diagnostic dataset. Methods The dataset, comprising 569 samples and 32 features derived from fine needle aspirate biopsy images, was pre-processed through data cleaning, normalization using the Robust Scaler, and feature selection. Five supervised ML algorithms—Logistic Regression, Support Vector Classification (SVC) with linear and radial basis function (RBF) kernels, Decision Tree, and Random Forest—were implemented. Models were evaluated using performance metrics, including accuracy, precision, sensitivity, specificity, and F1 scores. Results The SVC-RBF model demonstrated the highest accuracy (98.68%) and balanced performance across other metrics, making it the most effective classifier for distinguishing between benign and malignant tumors. Key features such as texture mean and area (worst) significantly contributed to classification accuracy. Conclusions This study highlights the potential of ML algorithms, particularly SVC-RBF, to revolutionize breast cancer diagnostics through improved accuracy and efficiency. Future research should validate these findings with diverse datasets and explore their integration into clinical workflows to enhance decision-making and patient care.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-163/v1?src=rss">Recombinant  expression of receptor binding domains of all eight subtypes of botulinum neurotoxin type A for generation of antitoxins with broad reactivity [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Botulinum neurotoxin type A (BoNT/A) represents a major threat to global public health because of its most potent toxicity with the longest persistence. Several camelid single-domain antibodies (or VHHs) have been reported to exhibit high neutralizing activity against the receptor binding domain (HC) of the BoNT/A subtype used to generate them. However, it remains unclear if these VHHs can neutralize effectively HC of other BoNT/A subtypes. This study aimed to generate HC domains of all eight BoNT/A subtypes and to screen for VHHs with broad reactivity against these domains. Methods HC domains of BoNT/A1-A8 were recombinantly produced in Escherichia coli. The bont/HCA1 fragment was amplified from sludge sample and cloned into pET45b vector by Gibson assembly. Expression vectors for HC domains of BoNT/A2-A8 were derived from pET45b-HCA1 by site-directed mutagenesis and/or in-house gene synthesis. Similarly, VHHs were synthesized and cloned into pET22b vector. Recombinant protein were purified by Ni-NTA spin columns and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. ELISA was used to confirm the antigenicity of HC domains and to evaluate the reactivity of VHHs to these domains. Results SDS-PAGE analysis and ELISA results with commercial polyclonal antibody demonstrated the HC domains of all eight BoNT/A subtypes were correctly produced. ELISA results using a VHH panel indicated that, apart from ciA-C2, a well-characterized VHH specific for HC of BoNT/A1, two new VHHs were found to recognize the HC domains of all BoNT/A subtypes, of which VHH-A3 displayed EC50 values for these domains close to those of ciA-C2. Conclusion This study provided a resource to comprehensively identify antitoxins conferring broad protection against BoNT/A.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>We introduce DHARANI, the first online platform with three-dimensional (3D) histological reconstructions of the developing human brain from 14 to 24 gestational weeks (GW) across the five fetal brains. DHARANI features 5132 Nissl, hematoxylin and eosin stained, 20 µm coronal and sagittal sections, postmortem MRI, and a neuroanatomical atlas with 466 annotated sections covering ∼500 brain structures. It is accessible online at <a target="_blank"
   title="Link to external resource"
   href="https://brainportal.humanbrain.in/publicview/index.html">https://brainportal.humanbrain.in/publicview/index.html</a>. The 3D reconstruction enables a volumetric view of the fetal brain, allowing visualization in all three planes akin to MRI, previously unachievable with histological datasets from the fetal brain. This allowed qualitative assessment of the growth of brain regions and layers throughout the second trimester. “DHARANI” documents the initiation of sulci, with the lateral fissure, calcarine, parieto-occipital, and cingulate sulci, at 14 GW. The central and postcentral sulci appear by 24 GW; however, cytoarchitectonic boundaries become visible before sulcal patterns. Cortical plate (CP) lamination begins at 24 GW in the parietal and occipital cortices. The frontal cortex lacks lamination at 24 GW, although putative Betz cells are already visible and show early patterning in the intermediate zone. The cell-sparse layer between the CP and subplate, containing late migratory neurons, begins in the orbital cortex at 14 GW and reaches the frontal cortex by 17 GW. The appearance of the honeycomb pattern in the occipital and parietal cortex occurs after 14 GW. Additionally, we describe the development of the thalamic pregeniculate with the rotation of the lateral geniculate nucleus. Cerebellar nuclei and an early Purkinje cell layer appear by 21 GW in the already foliated cerebellar cortex.</p>

                In this issue of Neuron, Xin et al. reveal how the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) orchestrates social dominance through subcortical pathways to the amygdala and brainstem. Using optogenetics and functional mapping, they identify opposing win- and lose-related circuits, uncovering a laminar organization driving competitive behavior in mice.

                High-throughput methods are revolutionizing our ability to classify neurons based on their transcriptome. In this issue of Neuron, Hozhabri and colleagues first categorize songbird GABAergic neurons by functional role and then link these functional subtypes to molecular identity.

                Memories for events that we experience in our lives are not immutable but change organizationally and qualitatively over time. In this issue of Neuron, Lei and colleagues highlight how memory recall triggers these changes, leading to the formation of a new, updated memory trace (or engram) in the hippocampus.

                Using single-cell technologies on postmortem brains, Handsaker et al. have demonstrated that substantial somatic expansion of the CAG repeat that causes Huntington’s disease results in progressive transcriptional dysregulation and drives the loss of spiny projection neurons in the caudate.

                Triglyceride (TG) secretion from the liver is critical in NAFLD progression and liver physiology, but the mechanism is not entirely clear. Song et al. show that Metrnl increases hepatic phosphatidylcholine synthesis to promote TG secretion and enhances fatty acid oxidation, suggesting an important role of Metrnl in liver lipid metabolism.

Conventional methods of analysing bacterial growth suggest that a small subset of hyper-resilient bacteria is the main cause of this poor efficacy. However, direct monitoring of antibiotic action in real time reveals that such methods are misleading, and that Salmonella resilience is a population-wide trait.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97424">A model-based factorization method for scRNA data unveils bifurcating transcriptional modules underlying cell fate determination</a></h4>

              
                Manifold-learning is particularly useful to resolve the complex cellular state space from single-cell RNA sequences. While current manifold-learning methods provide insights into cell fate by inferring graph-based trajectory at cell level, challenges remain to retrieve interpretable biology underlying the diverse cellular states. Here, we described MGPfact<sup>XMBD</sup>, a model-based manifold-learning framework and capable to factorize complex development trajectories into independent bifurcation processes of gene sets, and thus enables trajectory inference based on relevant features. MGPfact<sup>XMBD</sup> offers a more nuanced understanding of the biological processes underlying cellular trajectories with potential determinants. When bench-tested across 239 datasets, MGPfact<sup>XMBD</sup> showed advantages in major quantity-control metrics, such as branch division accuracy and trajectory topology, outperforming most established methods. In real datasets, MGPfact<sup>XMBD</sup> recovered the critical pathways and cell types in microglia development with experimentally valid regulons and markers. Furthermore, MGPfact<sup>XMBD</sup> discovered evolutionary trajectories of tumor-associated CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and yielded new subtypes of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells with gene expression signatures significantly predictive of the responses to immune checkpoint inhibitor in independent cohorts. In summary, MGPfact<sup>XMBD</sup> offers a manifold-learning framework in scRNA-seq data which enables feature selection for specific biological processes and contributing to advance our understanding of biological determination of cell fate.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/88334">Deterministic genetic barcoding for multiplexed behavioral and single-cell transcriptomic studies</a></h4>

              
                Advances in single-cell sequencing technologies have provided novel insights into the dynamics of gene expression and cellular heterogeneity within tissues and have enabled the construction of transcriptomic cell atlases. However, linking anatomical information to transcriptomic data and positively identifying the cell types that correspond to gene expression clusters in single-cell sequencing data sets remains a challenge. We describe a straightforward genetic barcoding approach that takes advantage of the powerful genetic tools in <i>Drosophila</i> to allow in vivo tagging of defined cell populations. This method, called <span class="underline">Ta</span>rgeted <span class="underline">G</span>enetically-<span class="underline">E</span>ncoded <span class="underline">M</span>ultiplexing (TaG-EM), involves inserting a DNA barcode just upstream of the polyadenylation site in a Gal4-inducible <i>UAS-GFP</i> construct so that the barcode sequence can be read out during single-cell sequencing, labeling a cell population of interest. By creating many such independently barcoded fly strains, TaG-EM enables positive identification of cell types in cell atlas projects, identification of multiplet droplets, and barcoding of experimental timepoints, conditions, and replicates. Furthermore, we demonstrate that TaG-EM barcodes can be read out using next-generation sequencing to facilitate population-scale behavioral measurements. Thus, TaG-EM has the potential to enable large-scale behavioral screens in addition to improving the ability to multiplex and reliably annotate single-cell transcriptomic experiments.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98701">Cortical tracking of hierarchical rhythms orchestrates the multisensory processing of biological motion</a></h4>

              
                When observing others’ behaviors, we continuously integrate their movements with the corresponding sounds to enhance perception and develop adaptive responses. However, how the human brain integrates these complex audiovisual cues based on their natural temporal correspondence remains unclear. Using electroencephalogram (EEG), we demonstrated that rhythmic cortical activity tracked the hierarchical rhythmic structures in audiovisually congruent human walking movements and footstep sounds. Remarkably, the cortical tracking effects exhibit distinct multisensory integration modes at two temporal scales: an additive mode in a lower-order, narrower temporal integration window (step cycle) and a super-additive enhancement in a higher-order, broader temporal window (gait cycle). Furthermore, while neural responses at the lower-order timescale reflect a domain-general audiovisual integration process, cortical tracking at the higher-order timescale is exclusively engaged in the integration of biological motion cues. In addition, only this higher-order, domain-specific cortical tracking effect correlates with individuals’ autistic traits, highlighting its potential as a neural marker for autism spectrum disorder. These findings unveil the multifaceted mechanism whereby rhythmic cortical activity supports the multisensory integration of human motion, shedding light on how neural coding of hierarchical temporal structures orchestrates the processing of complex, natural stimuli across multiple timescales.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100849">Disruption of the CRF1 receptor eliminates morphine-induced sociability deficits and firing of oxytocinergic neurons in male mice</a></h4>

              
                Substance-induced social behavior deficits dramatically worsen the clinical outcome of substance use disorders; yet, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Herein, we investigated the role for the corticotropin-releasing factor receptor 1 (CRF<sub>1</sub>) in the acute sociability deficits induced by morphine and the related activity of oxytocin (OXY)- and arginine-vasopressin (AVP)-expressing neurons of the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN). For this purpose, we used both the CRF<sub>1</sub> receptor-preferring antagonist compound antalarmin and the genetic mouse model of CRF<sub>1</sub> receptor-deficiency. Antalarmin completely abolished sociability deficits induced by morphine in male, but not in female, C57BL/6J mice. Accordingly, genetic CRF<sub>1</sub> receptor-deficiency eliminated morphine-induced sociability deficits in male mice. Ex vivo electrophysiology studies showed that antalarmin also eliminated morphine-induced firing of PVN neurons in male, but not in female, C57BL/6J mice. Likewise, genetic CRF<sub>1</sub> receptor-deficiency reduced morphine-induced firing of PVN neurons in a CRF<sub>1</sub> gene expression-dependent manner. The electrophysiology results consistently mirrored the behavioral results, indicating a link between morphine-induced PVN activity and sociability deficits. Interestingly, in male mice antalarmin abolished morphine-induced firing in neurons co-expressing OXY and AVP, but not in neurons expressing only AVP. In contrast, in female mice antalarmin did not affect morphine-induced firing of neurons co-expressing OXY and AVP or only OXY, indicating a selective sex-specific role for the CRF<sub>1</sub> receptor in opiate-induced PVN OXY activity. The present findings demonstrate a major, sex-linked, role for the CRF<sub>1</sub> receptor in sociability deficits and related brain alterations induced by morphine, suggesting new therapeutic strategy for opiate use disorders.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98714">Microbiota from young mice counteracts susceptibility to age-related gout through modulating butyric acid levels in aged mice</a></h4>

              
                Gout is a prevalent form of inflammatory arthritis that occurs due to high levels of uric acid in the blood leading to the formation of urate crystals in and around the joints, particularly affecting the elderly. Recent research has provided evidence of distinct differences in the gut microbiota of patients with gout and hyperuricemia compared to healthy individuals. However, the link between gut microbiota and age-related gout remained underexplored. Our study found that gut microbiota plays a crucial role in determining susceptibility to age-related gout. Specifically, we observed that age-related gut microbiota regulated the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway and modulated uric acid metabolism. More scrutiny highlighted the positive impact of ‘younger’ microbiota on the gut microbiota structure of old or aged mice, enhancing butanoate metabolism and butyric acid content. Experimentation with butyrate supplementation indicated that butyric acid exerts a dual effect, inhibiting inflammation in acute gout and reducing serum uric acid levels. These insights emphasize the potential of gut microbiome rejuvenation in mitigating senile gout, unraveling the intricate dynamics between microbiota, aging, and gout. It potentially serves as a therapeutic target for senile gout-related conditions.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99988">Early-life stress induces persistent astrocyte dysfunction associated with fear generalisation</a></h4>

              
                Early-life stress can have lifelong consequences, enhancing stress susceptibility and resulting in behavioural and cognitive deficits. While the effects of early-life stress on neuronal function have been well-described, we still know very little about the contribution of non-neuronal brain cells. Investigating the complex interactions between distinct brain cell types is critical to fully understand how cellular changes manifest as behavioural deficits following early-life stress. Here, using male and female mice we report that early-life stress induces anxiety-like behaviour and fear generalisation in an amygdala-dependent learning and memory task. These behavioural changes were associated with impaired synaptic plasticity, increased neural excitability, and astrocyte hypofunction. Genetic perturbation of amygdala astrocyte function by either reducing astrocyte calcium activity or reducing astrocyte network function was sufficient to replicate cellular, synaptic, and fear memory generalisation associated with early-life stress. Our data reveal a role of astrocytes in tuning emotionally salient memory and provide mechanistic links between early-life stress, astrocyte hypofunction, and behavioural deficits.

">Neural correlates of boundary extension during visual imagination</a></h4>

              
                People typically remember seeing a greater expanse of a scene than was visible in a studied close-up (boundary extension, BE). Multivoxel pattern analysis was used to test the neural correlates of BE. Classifiers were trained using a whole-brain searchlight method to discriminate between close-up and wider-angle versions of 16 scenes during repeated perceptual exposures. Earlier, each subject studied either the close or wide version of each scene and then visually imagined it from memory. If a brain region reflects BE, then unlike classification during perception, visual images of close views should sometimes be misclassified as wide (capturing false memory beyond the view), whereas visual images of wide views should be correctly classified. BE-consistent patterns during imagery were found in high-level visual regions, including posterior superior parietal cortex. This pattern did not reflect a brain-wide bias toward better classification of wider-angle views: the pattern reversed (better classification of close views) in the early visual cortex, presenting a novel distinction between early and late visual representations in imagery. We propose that this method reflects active maintenance of boundary-extended scene representations in memory and that it holds promise as a general purpose tool for decoding false memory in the brain.

">A Meta-analysis of Perceptual Pseudoneglect reveals the Functional Anatomy of Perceptual Judgements</a></h4>

              
                Major evidence for a right-hemisphere dominance of the brain in spatial and/or attentional tasks comes from lesion studies in patients with spatial neglect. However, the neuroanatomy of the different forms of neglect remains a matter of debate, and it remains unclear how dysfunctions in neglect relate to intact processes. In the healthy brain, perceptual pseudoneglect is the equivalent of neglect as observed in paradigms such as the line bisection task. Therefore, the current study investigated the intact functional anatomy of perceptual pseudoneglect using a meta-analysis to compensate for some of the limitations of individual imaging studies. We collated the data from 24 articles that tested 952 participants with a range of paradigms (landmark task, line bisection, grating-scales task, and number line task) obtaining 337 foci. Using Activation Likelihood Estimation (ALE) we identified a right-hemisphere biased network of cortical areas, including superior and intraparietal regions, the intraoccipital sulcus together with other occipital regions, as well as inferior frontal areas that were associated with perceptual pseudoneglect in partial agreement with lesion studies in patients with neglect. The present results are consistent with a framework of neural computations that explains the neural and behavioural asymmetries of perceptual pseudoneglect as due the need for to an integrated representation of spatial information during perceptual judgments.

">Oscillatory impact of Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation at very weak-intensity on the primary motor cortex: A TMS-EEG study in the human brain</a></h4>

              
                Background: Very weak transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS, 10 mT, ~0.05-10 V/m) has been explored in animal models showcasing potential for effective neuromodulation. However, the physiological effects of these type of pulsed fields remain rather unexplored in humans. Objective: We here aimed to characterize the neural effects of very weak TMS pulsed fields ( ~6V/m, ~6% of the resting motor threshold, rMT) and explore their ability to evoke and/or modulate local oscillatory activity generated on human primary motor regions. Methods: Neuronavigated TMS was employed in a cohort of healthy participants (n=18) to deliver single pulses and short bursts of rhythmic (20 Hz) TMS at very weak intensity and at conventional levels (here referred as high intensity) usually employed in human applications (~113V/m, ~77% rMT), to the left primary motor cortex (M1). In parallel, their potential to evoke brain activity such as Transcranial Evoked Potentials (TEPs), and to entrain or modulate local ongoing oscillations was explored with scalp EEG recordings. Results: Both, single TMS pulses and 4-pulse rhythmic TMS beta (20 Hz) bursts delivered at conventional intensity elicited consistent Transcranial Evoked Potentials (TEPs) and beta-synchronized Event Related Spectral Perturbations (ERSP) around the left M1 area. Most interestingly, very-weak intensity TMS modulated in this same area oscillatory activity at a mu-alpha frequency (7-13 Hz) only for rhythmic TMS bursts time-locked to -the troughs of the local ongoing beta oscillations. Conclusions: Our data provide first time support for the modulation of oscillatory signals with TMS delivered at an unprecedentedly weak intensity on the human primary motor cortex. This evidence enriches current knowledge on the impact of weak pulsed magnetic fields in humans, paving the way for future neurotherapeutics with a new generation of portable and autonomous low-intensity multichannel TMS devices.

">Viral-mediated fluorescent labeling of hyaluronan reveals extracellular matrix dynamics in the mouse brain in vivo</a></h4>

              
                The extracellular matrix (ECM) of the brain is primarily composed of the glycan polymer hyaluronan (HA), a core scaffold that nucleates proteoglycans forming a self-assembled matrix that acts as structural framework and signaling hub. Since most of the neural matrix is composed of sugars, development of genetically encoded tags has been limited. Therefore, although several staining protocols exist for ECM in fixed tissue, there are no reliable matrix labels for live imaging. Here we report a viral-mediated fluorescent probe that binds to HA and labels the mouse brain ECM. The vector encodes the HA binding domain from neurocan fused to GFP and an externalization tag (AAV-Ncan-GFP), enabling transduced cells to secrete the fluorescent hyalectan into the extracellular space, thereby labeling HA. We demonstrate stable probe expression in organotypic brain slices, as well as in vivo in the mouse cortex, where it labels both perineuronal nets and interstitial matrix. We validate HA labeling through colocalization with HABP and sensitivity to hyaluronidase, and confirm the probe extracellular localization by shadow imaging. As a proof of concept, we combine AAV-Ncan-GFP with dendritic spine imaging ex vivo and calcium transient imaging in vivo, providing a real-time map of local ECM alongside neural function. The probe enables time-lapse imaging of ECM dynamics in live mice, facilitating longitudinal studies across a wide range of timescales, from minutes to days. The results establish AAV-Ncan-GFP as a valuable tool for real-time observation of brain ECM and a promising resource to explore ECM dynamics and brain function in vivo.

">Automated assessment of the mouse body-language reveals pervasive behavioral disruption in a two-hit model of psychiatric vulnerability</a></h4>

              
                The influence of early-life experiences is widely acknowledged as a crafting tool that sculpts complex behavioral patterns and well-being of living organisms. The use of preclinical models can provide invaluable insight into how a negative environmental push interplays with genetic make-up in shaping psychiatric vulnerability. However, the assessment of psychiatric traits in cross-species studies often relies on the use of surrogate metrics as a proxy for the internal state, limiting the interpretation to context-dependent outcomes. In this work, we exploited a validated computational tool for digitalized ethological screening to identify spontaneous hallmarks of altered behavioral functioning in a dual-hit mouse model of psychiatric vulnerability. To do so, mice carrying heterozygous deletion of the gene coding for Contactin-associated protein-like 2 (Cntnap2+/-) and their wild-type (WT) littermates were raised with limited bedding and nesting (LBN). These animals were compared to both WT and Cntnap2+/- mice raised in standard conditions, mapping their spontaneous behavior during freely-moving exploration. Our data show that descriptors of motility state or surrogate anxiety indicators largely failed in detecting subtle diversion from control conditions. By contrast, automated segmentation of the body-language revealed a significant impact of both genotype and early-life experience in shaping the spontaneous behavioral programming. Thus, using unsupervised clustering, we unveiled two alternative neurobehavioral profiles within our dataset. We found that one of the identified profiles largely overlapped with Cntnap2+/- mice raised with LBN, while the other was equally shared among controls. We conclude that the coincidence of early-life adversity and Cntnap2 haploinsufficiency drastically reshapes behavioral structure in rodents.

">Subjective sleep quality in healthy young adults moderates associations of sensitivity to punishment and reward with functional connectivity of regions relevant for insomnia disorder</a></h4>

              
                Chronic unhealthy sleeping behaviours are a major risk factor for the emergence of mood and anxiety disorders. Nevertheless, we are still lacking understanding why some individuals are more prone than others to affective dysregulation caused by sleep disruption. With preliminary evidence suggesting that brain activity during positive and negative emotional processing might play an important modulating role, we conducted whole-brain resting-state functional connectivity analyses in a large cohort of healthy young adults (N = 155). Using regions consistently affected in insomnia disorder as seeds, we investigated sleep quality-related neural connectivity patterns that were both insensitive and sensitive to the interactions with individual measures of reward and punishment processing, additionally assessing the links with indices of emotional health. Majority of the findings reflected interactions between sleep quality and reinforcement sensitivity, with the opposite associations reported in the good and poor sleepers. One of such connections, the coupling between precentral gyrus and posterior insula, was additionally negatively linked to trait anxiety, with the lowest connectivity values observed in poor sleepers with higher sensitivity to punishment. In turn, the only finding associated solely with sleep quality, i.e. coupling between subgenual anterior cingulate cortex and thalamus, was also related to the habitual use of emotion suppression strategies. As such, the present study provides evidence that affective functioning plays an essential role in determining the effects of poor sleep quality on brain connectivity and emotional health, providing a plausible mechanism for why certain individuals are more susceptible to sleep-related affective dysregulation than others.

">SurfNet: Reconstruction of Cortical Surfaces via Coupled Diffeomorphic Deformations</a></h4>

              
                To achieve fast and accurate cortical surface reconstruction from brain magnetic resonance images (MRIs), we develop a method to jointly reconstruct the inner (white-gray matter interface), outer (pial), and midthickness surfaces, regularized by their interdependence. Rather than reconstructing these surfaces separately without taking into consideration their interdependence as in most existing methods, our method learns three diffeomorphic deformations jointly to optimize the midthickness surface to lie halfway between the inner and outer cortical surfaces and simultaneously deforms it inward and outward towards the inner and outer cortical surfaces, respectively. The surfaces are encouraged to have a spherical topology by regularization terms for non-negativeness of the cortical thickness and symmetric cycle-consistency of the coupled surface deformations. The coupled reconstruction of cortical surfaces also facilitates an accurate estimation of the cortical thickness based on the diffeomorphic deformation trajectory of each vertex on the surfaces. Validation experiments have demonstrated that our method achieves state-of-the-art cortical surface reconstruction performance in terms of accuracy and surface topological correctness on large-scale MRI datasets, including ADNI, HCP, and OASIS.

">Genetic and environmental contributions to ReHo and fALFF in early adolescence vary across brain regions</a></h4>

              
                Research on genetic and environmental influences on brain function generally focuses on connections between brain areas. A different yet unexplored approach is to examine activity within local brain regions. We investigated the influence of genes and environmental effects on two specific measures of local brain function: Regional Homogeneity (ReHo) and fractional Amplitude of Low-Frequency Fluctuations (fALFF). Participants were drawn from a sample of adolescent twins on two occasions (mean ages 11.5 and 13.2 years, N = 278 and 248). Results showed that genetic and environmental factors influenced brain function in almost all 210 cortical regions examined. Moreover, genetic and common environmental factors influencing ReHo and fALFF values at wave 1 (9-14 years) also influenced values at wave 2 (10-16 years) for many regions. However, the influence of genetic and common environmental factors varied across the cortex, exhibiting different patterns in different regions. Furthermore, we found new (i.e., independent) genetic and environmental influences on brain activity at wave 2, again with regional patterns. Exploratory analyses found weak associations between anxiety and depressive symptoms and local brain function in several regions of the temporal lobe. These findings are consistent with similar studies of other resting-state functional MRI metrics (i.e., functional connectivity).

">Remote Cortical Network for Frontal Cognitive Symptoms derived from Tau Accumulation in Progressive Supranuclear Palsy</a></h4>

              
                Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by movement impairments and frontal cognitive dysfunctions. While motor symptoms are linked with subcortical tau deposits, mechanisms underlying the frontal cognitive symptoms remain unclear due to limited tau accumulation in the frontal cortex and heterogeneous tau distribution. Here, we combined high-contrast tau PET with normative connectome to identify a common network extended from tau deposits underlying the frontal cognitive symptoms in PSP. Regions with tau deposition were connected to a common cortical network that was not detectable through atrophy-based analyses. This network was primarily overlapped with canonical action-mode and frontoparietal networks. While the degree of subcortical tau deposition or atrophy correlated with motor symptoms, only connectivity between tau deposition sites and the derived cortical network explained the frontal cognitive deficits. These findings propose network mechanisms underlying frontal cognitive impairments in PSP, emphasizing the role for remote effects of pathological tau deposits.

">Master control genes in the regeneration of rod photoreceptors from endogenous progenitor cells in zebrafish retina</a></h4>

              
                Retinitis Pigmentosa is a chronic retinal degenerative disease characterized by the gradual loss of rod, and later, cone photoreceptors until the individual is completely blind. Regeneration of photoreceptors from endogenous progenitor cells is a possible therapeutic approach, but mammals do not do this naturally. Mammalian models can be induced to generate retinal progenitors from Muller glial cells, but there has been limited success in rod photoreceptor specific regeneration. Unlike mammals, zebrafish have the natural ability to regenerate neurons after injury or disease and can provide insight into the molecular mechanisms of regeneration. In this study, we used a zebrafish model of Retinitis Pigmentosa to investigate the class of progenitors responsible for rod photoreceptor regeneration in the context of chronic disease. Using bioinformatic analyses of single-cell RNA sequencing datasets, we identified master regulator genes responsible for proliferation of retinal progenitors, differentiation of progenitors into rod photoreceptors, and maturation of the new rod photoreceptors. Using transient knockdown of gene expression in adult regenerating retina we determined that e2f1, e2f2, e2f3 and aurkb are critical for proliferation of progenitors, and prdm1a is critical for differentiation of progenitors into rod photoreceptors. This study provides a list of master regulators responsible for the specific regeneration of rod photoreceptors during chronic retinal degeneration.

">Reduced inter-subject functional connectivity during movies in autism: Replicability across cross-national fMRI datasets</a></h4>

              
                Background: Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by repetitive behaviors and difficulties in social communication and interaction. Previous research has shown that these symptoms are linked to idiosyncratic behavioral and brain activity patterns while viewing natural social events in movies. This study aimed to investigate the replicability of brain activity idiosyncrasy in autistic individuals by comparing their inter-subject functional connectivity (ISFC) with that of neurotypical individuals. Methods: We tested for ISFC differences between autism and neurotypical groups using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from two independent datasets from Germany (Nneurotypical = 25, 7 Males, 18 Females; Nautism = 22, 12 Males, 10 Females) and Finland (Nneurotypical = 19, Nautism = 18; All males). Participants watched short movie stimuli, and pairwise ISFCs were computed across 273 brain regions. Group differences were evaluated using subject-wise permutation tests for each dataset. Results: In both datasets, the autism group showed lower ISFCs compared to the neurotypical group, specifically between visual regions (e.g., occipital gyrus, cuneus) and parietal regions (e.g.,superior and inferior parietal lobules), as well as between visual regions and frontal regions (e.g.,inferior frontal gyrus, precentral gyrus). ISFC was higher in the Finnish autism group in temporal regions associated with sound and speech processing. Conclusions: The study confirmed the replicability of reduced ISFCs in autistic individuals during naturalistic movie-watching, especially between visual and parietal/frontal brain regions. These findings reinforce the utility of ISFC and naturalistic movie-watching paradigm in studying neural connectivity alterations in autism.

">Information Shielding Through Neural Deactivation: A Fundamental Mechanism of Human Information Processing</a></h4>

              
                Information processing is a core issue in cognitive neuroscience. The brain can either accept or shield information. However, information shielding has traditionally been regarded as a byproduct of other cognitive processes that prepare brain areas for activation, with the accompanying brain deactivation seen as merely supportive. Here, we offer an alternative perspective, demonstrating that people can directly perform information shielding without engaging other cognitive processes. Using information shielding as a novel investigative lens, we provide direct evidence that deactivation serves as a primary mechanism in its own right. We found that information shielding was characterized by a deactivation-dominant neural dynamic, with initial executive control region activation giving way to increased sensory region deactivation, especially after a 3-second boundary. Neural decoding results further confirmed this deactivation trend. This deactivation pattern was consistent across both auditory and visual modalities. Furthermore, non-invasive brain stimulation demonstrated a causal relationship between the deactivation pattern and information shielding, and we found that this deactivation mechanism extended to general unnecessary information processing, regardless of whether the necessity was determined objectively or subjectively. This challenges the conventional emphasis on activation as the primary mode of information processing and opens new fundamental avenues for understanding inhibitory cognitive processes.

">Early life adversity and White Matter Microstructural Organization - a systematic review.</a></h4>

              
                Early life adversity, defined as exposure to stressful events during childhood, is a significant risk factor for the development of psychiatric disorders. Diffusion tensor imaging studies employing tract-based spatial statistics have shown microstructural abnormalities in white matter among individuals exposed to early life adversity; however, robust conclusions are yet to be drawn. This systematic review synthesizes findings of previous tract-based spatial statistics studies to identify the white matter alterations in adult brains exposed to early life adversity, in papers with methodological consistency. The literature search (April 2024) was conducted to identify tract-based spatial statistics studies that compared diffusion metrics between adults exposed to early life adversity and adults not. Embase, Pubmed, and PsycInfo were searched, retrieving 2458 articles. Following deduplication, 1739 titles and/or abstracts were screened. 1699 articles were excluded, and 40 full texts were reviewed. Seven articles, reporting on 764 subjects, met the inclusion criteria and were included in the narrative synthesis. Compared to controls, adults exposed to early life adversity showed lower fractional anisotropy values in white matter tracts of the limbic and visual processing systems, specifically the anterior thalamic radiation, inferior longitudinal fasciculus, corona radiata, uncinate fasciculus, inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, and cingulum bundle. This systematic review highlights that early life adversity may underlie emotional dysregulation and contribute to an increased risk of psychopathology in later life and explores the potential neurobiological mechanisms that underpin these structural changes. Understanding these associations is crucial for developing targeted interventions aimed at mitigating the long-term impact of early life adversity.

">Coordinated representational drift supports stable place coding in hippocampal CA1</a></h4>

              
                The phenomenon of representational drift (i.e., changing neuronal tuning during repeated exposure to the same stimuli), is a fundamental paradox in neuroscience that raises the question how stable behaviour can emerge from unstable neural representations. Place cells in CA1 of the hippocampus are crucial for spatial navigation and memories but show gradual changes in their preferred firing location over time when exposed to the same environment. This drift occurs despite the fact that the animal maintains the ability to navigate and to perform spatial tasks, suggesting a complex relationship between neural activity and behaviour. Here, we show that while the spatial tuning functions of individual CA1 neurons drift over time, stable space coding prevails at the population level: Representational drift is not random but can be described as a translation and rotation in population state space, which preserves the internal geometry of population activity over time. Compensating for the coordinated translation and rotation allows for drift correction and a recovery of spatial tuning on future days. Moreover, the preserved internal geometry stabilises downstream readout under noisy conditions. We propose that the conserved population geometry might serve as a mechanism by which downstream reader networks achieve effective drift correction and, thus, ameliorate the readout of stable information.

">APOE4 exacerbates glucocorticoid stress hormone-induced tau pathology via mitochondrial dysfunction</a></h4>

              
                APOE4 is the leading genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease, and chronic stress is a leading environmental risk factor. Studies suggest that APOE4 confers vulnerability to the behavioral and neuropathological effects of chronic stress, representing a potential mechanism by which this genetic variant accelerates Alzheimer's onset and progression. Whether and how APOE4-mediated stress vulnerability manifests in neurons of the hippocampus, a brain region particularly susceptible to stress and Alzheimer's pathology, remains unexplored. Using a combination of in vivo and in vitro experiments in humanized APOE4 and APOE3 knockin mice and primary hippocampal neurons from these animals, we investigate whether and how APOE4 confers sensitivity to glucocorticoids, the main stress hormones. We find that a major hallmark of stress/glucocorticoid-induced brain damage, tau pathology (i.e. tau accumulation, hyperphosphorylation, and spreading) is exacerbated in APOE4 versus APOE3 mice. Moreover, APOE4 animals exhibit underlying mitochondrial dysfunction and enhanced glucocorticoid receptor activation in the hippocampus, factors that likely contribute to tau pathogenesis in both the presence and absence of stress/glucocorticoids. Supporting this concept, we show that opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore drives mitochondrial dysfunction and tau pathology in APOE4 mice, and that pharmacological inhibition of pore opening is protective against ApoE4-mediated mitochondrial damage, tau phosphorylation and spreading, and downstream hippocampal synapse loss. These findings shed light on the mechanisms of stress vulnerability in APOE4 carriers and identify the mitochondrial permeability transition pore as a potential therapeutic target for ameliorating Alzheimer's pathogenesis in this population.

">Distinct Structural Connectivity Patterns Associated with Variations in Language Lateralisation</a></h4>

              
                Hemispheric asymmetries in white matter tracts are proposed key determinants of language lateralisation, yet evidence in healthy individuals remains inconsistent. This suggests that simple tractography techniques might not be sensitive enough to identify language dominance. Significant insights into the functional organization of the human brain may be achieved by considering networks and brain connectivity, providing more information about discrepancies in people with different hemispheric language dominance. In this study, we examined 285 healthy participants compare their structural connectomes at the whole-brain level and determine the networks responsible for the three different functional language lateralisation groups (typical, atypical and strongly atypical). Probabilistic tractography generated whole-brain tractograms, and white matter fibres were filtered according to anatomical Boolean guidelines. Connectivity matrices with nodes corresponding to supramodal sentence areas in the language atlas and edges weighted by fractional anisotropy (FA) were generated to compare the groups using graph theory and network-based statistic (NBS) approaches. We demonstrated that both atypical (bilateral) and strongly atypical (right-lateralised) lateralisation are characterised by heightened interhemispheric temporal connectivity. Post-hoc analyses showed that strongly atypical individuals exhibited increased temporo-frontal connectivity, while atypical individuals had enhanced temporal and frontal connectivity but lacked temporo-frontal connections. These connectivity patterns diverge from traditional models of hemispheric dominance, suggesting a reliance on integrated bilateral networks in atypically lateralised individuals. This reflects distinct neural mechanisms underlying atypical language organisation, departing from developmental trajectory of typical lateralisation and offering insights into cognitive flexibility and clinical applications.

">Developmental Variations in Recurrent Spatiotemporal Brain Propagations from Childhood to Adulthood</a></h4>

              
                The brain undergoes profound structural and functional transformations from childhood to adolescence. Convergent evidence suggests that neurodevelopment proceeds in a hierarchical manner, characterized by heterogeneous maturation patterns across brain regions and networks. However, the maturation of the intrinsic spatiotemporal propagations of brain activity remains largely unexplored. This study aims to bridge this gap by delineating spatiotemporal propagations from childhood to early adulthood. By leveraging a recently developed approach that captures time-lag dynamic propagations, we characterized intrinsic dynamic propagations along three axes: sensory-association (S-A), 'task-positive' to default networks (TP-D), and somatomotor-visual (SM-V) networks, which progress towards adult-like brain dynamics from childhood to early adulthood. Importantly, we demonstrated that as participants mature, there is a prolonged occurrence of the S-A and TP-D propagation states, indicating that they spend more time in these states. Conversely, the prevalence of SM-V propagation states declines during development. Notably, top-down propagations along the S-A axis exhibited an age-dependent increase in occurrence, serving as a superior predictor of cognitive scores compared to bottom-up S-A propagation. These findings were replicated across two independent cohorts (N = 677 in total), emphasizing the robustness and generalizability of these findings. Our results provide new insights into the emergence of adult-like functional dynamics during youth and their role in supporting cognition.

">Hippocampus responds to mismatches with predictions based on episodic memories but not generalised knowledge</a></h4>

              
                Prediction errors drive learning by signalling a mismatch between our expectations and reality. The hippocampus plays a key role in mismatch detection, but it is not known what information the hippocampus uses to form expectations. Here we show that the human hippocampus bases its expectations on episodic memories and not generalised schematic knowledge. Across three fMRI experiments, we demonstrate that the hippocampus is selectively engaged by mismatches with episodic memories of specific events. In contrast, mismatches with schematic knowledge activate regions of the Semantic Control and Multiple Demand Networks, as well as subcortical regions involved in prediction error signalling. Notably, mismatches with episodic memories also engage the Default Mode Network. Overall, our findings provide direct support for some models of learning via mismatch detection and refute models that propose the hippocampus plays a wider role as a more generalised mismatch detector.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Gender differences in adaptation to high-altitude environments are evident, but the specific patterns in Tibetan brains remain unclear. We analyzed T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging scans and neuropsychological test results from 61 male and 68 female Tibetans, with lowland Han participants as controls. Tibetan females had poorer performance than males in digit serial accumulation and forward digit span. Both Tibetan and Han males had significantly larger global gray matter volume and white matter volume than females, only Tibetan female brains contained a larger proportion of gray matter than male brains. Tibetan females (vs. males) had smaller regional gray matter volume in the left rostral middle frontal gyrus and pars opercularis and right caudal middle frontal gyrus, and gray matter volume in the left pars opercularis in all Tibetans had a significant positive correlation with forward digit span. Conversely, Tibetan females had greater cortical thickness in these regions, which negatively correlated with altitude. Han populations exhibited different gender-based patterns in gray matter volume and cortical thickness compared to Tibetans. These findings suggest that Tibetan female brains are more susceptible to high-altitude, and the observed gender differences in brain volume may relate to distinct neuropsychological performances.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div> Extracting spatial or temporal patterns across experiences is essential for skill acquisition and predictive processes. The prefrontal cortex plays a central role in regulating competitive cognitive systems, with a particular influence on executive functions, often opposing statistical learning. This regulatory function may account for observed improvements in the acquisition and consolidation of statistical regularities following inhibition of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex via repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation. However, whether access to previously acquired statistical knowledge can similarly benefit from dorsolateral prefrontal cortex inhibition remains unclear. This preregistered study investigated the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex’s role in retrieving pre-existing statistical knowledge of temporal regularities. Healthy human participants engaged in an implicit probabilistic sequence learning task followed by a 24-h consolidation period. Before retesting, they received either 1 Hz repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation or sham stimulation over the left, right, or bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex for 10 min. We observed that retrieval of statistical regularities was enhanced in the Bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex group compared to the Sham group. Our findings suggest that dorsolateral prefrontal cortex inhibition may facilitate access to statistical knowledge, particularly when interhemispheric compensatory mechanisms are limited. These insights advance our understanding of the dynamic neural background of statistical learning and may inform strategies for cognitive enhancement.</span>

                Background Hitherto, BDNF levels in humans have been primarily measured in serum and/or plasma where these levels are readily measurable, but primarily reflect the content of BDNF in blood platelets. By contrast, previous attempts to measure BDNF levels in readily accessible human body fluids such as saliva have been complicated by a lack of sensitivity and/or specificity of BDNF ELISAs (see Discussion). Recently, the suitability of a highly sensitive BDNF ELISA assay was validated using mouse plasma and serum where conventional BDNF ELISA fail to detect BDNF. In this report, we demonstrate that BDNF levels in human saliva are extremely low, in the low pg/mL range, yet detectable in all saliva samples tested. Methods Saliva samples were collected from healthy volunteers by a passive drool method. All samples were aliquoted and immediately frozen to keep at -80°C until use. At the time of use, the samples were thawed, centrifuged to remove any remaining particles and BDNF measurement conducted by using a previously validated BDNF ELISA assay (see below). Recombinant mature BDNF was used as a reference. Results The intra-assay variability was in the range of CV = 1.8 to 4.9%. Saliva samples could be kept frozen at -80°C for 2 months until use for measurements, but more than 4 freeze and thaw cycles caused BDNF losses presumably due to structural change of the antigen. The measurements were not affected by the method of collection provided the samples were diluted at least 2-fold. Conclusions The results indicate that human saliva samples collected in a non-invasive fashion can be used as a source of material to try and correlate BDNF levels with human conditions of interest. These results also confirm those of an independent study published recently using the same BDNF ELISA kit to measure BDNF levels in human saliva samples.

                Background Nefopam hydrochloride (NPH) is a non-narcotic analgesic that is severely affected by its extensive hepatic metabolism resulting in low oral bioavailability. This study aimed to develop NPH thermosensitive in situ gel to enhance its bioavailability by avoidance of first pass effect through rectal administration. Methods A cold method was employed to develop NPH thermosensitive rectal in situ gel utilizing various concentrations of poloxamer 407 (P 407) and poloxamer 188 (P188) alone or in mixture as thermosensitive polymers and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose K4M (HPMCK4M) as well as carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) as mucoadhesive polymers. The achieved formulas were assessed for various in vitro constraints including: solution-gel temperature, gelation time, appearance, pH, gel strength, viscosity, in vitro drug release study. Furthermore, the optimized formula was evaluated for in vivo localization and permeability. Results The obtained outcomes demonstrated a direct correlation between solution-gelation temperatures and poloxamer 188 concentration as well as an inverse correlation with the concentration of both P407 and HPMCK4M. A direct correlation was perceived between the mucoadhesive forces and viscosity with HPMCK4M concentration. Additionally, an inverse correlation was observed between NPH released with HPMCK4M concentration. The optimal NPH gel formula (F8) (18% P407/2% P188 and 0.6%) presented a compatible pH value (7.2±0.35), an acceptable sol-gel T (35.4 °C), gel strength (39.54 ± 0.803), a mucoadhesion force of 6340.6 dyne/cm2 and sustained drug release of 85% at 8 hrs. Additionally it showed sufficient localization and a permeation flux of 0.0398 mg/cm2/h, and apparent permeability (Papp) of 1.99*10−3. Conclusions It was concluded that this drug delivery system may serve as a promising alternative to other dosage forms containing NPH, owing to avoidance of first-pass metabolism, enhanced bioavailability, non-invasiveness, and reduced adverse effects associated with other forms.

Also, we present fuzzy ideals of autometrized algebras and provide examples to illustrate our findings. We examine the homomorphisms of both the images and the inverse images of fuzzy subalgebras and ideals. Furthermore, we introduce fuzzy congruences on autometrized algebras. We prove that in normal autometrized algebra, the set of all fuzzy ideals is in one-to-one correspondence with the set of all fuzzy congruences.

                Background Miniplates are frequently used in oral and maxillofacial surgery to address malocclusion issues. However, surface damage to miniplates is a significant concern that can affect surgical outcomes and patient quality of life. This study aims to evaluate the influence of miniplate surface damage on bacterial attachment, which may lead to postoperative infections. Methods Miniplates with varying degrees of surface damage were used in this study. The damaged surfaces were subjected to special treatments to simulate postoperative conditions. Various bacterial strains, including Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Streptococcus mutans, were tested. Each type of bacteria was cultured on different miniplates for specific durations, and bacterial attachment was subsequently measured and analyzed. Results Surface damage to miniplates significantly influenced bacterial attachment. Miniplates with more severe surface damage exhibited higher levels of bacterial attachment compared to undamaged miniplates. Furthermore, the type of bacteria impacted attachment levels, with certain strains demonstrating higher adhesion than others. Conclusion Surface damage to miniplates increases the risk of postoperative infections due to enhanced bacterial attachment. Therefore, maintaining the integrity of miniplates during and after orthognathic surgery is crucial. Further research is necessary to develop prevention and management strategies for postoperative infections related to miniplate surface damage.

                Background Early-life food consumption patterns may affect children’s health by increasing susceptibility to developing non-communicable chronic diseases (NCDs) in adulthood. Aims To evaluate Jordanian children and adolescents’ energy and macronutrient intake and how closely they adhere to dietary recommendations. Methods This cross-sectional study used data from Jordan’s Population-based Food Consumption Survey, a household population-based study conducted in Jordan between 2021 and 2022 (561 children and adolescents 8-19 years). Dietary intake was assessed using the two non-consecutive 24-hour dietary recall methods (24-h DR). The estimated food group and nutrient intakes were compared to nutritional recommendations, including MyPlate dietary guidelines. Results The prevalence of overweight/obese individuals based on body mass index (BMI) was 44%, and the average waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) was 24.7%. Compared to MyPlate dietary guidelines, children and adolescents had a higher added sugar intake (57g/day). Also, consuming vegetables, fruits, and dairy fell short of MyPlate dietary guidelines. The total discretionary calorie intake in children and adolescents was approximately one-third of the total energy intake. Conclusion The food consumption of Jordanian children and adolescents includes high intakes of discretionary calories, with a low intake of fruits, vegetables, and dairy products. The prevalence of overweight/obesity was elevated compared to international norms.

                Background Natural products databases are well-structured data sources that offer new molecular development opportunities in drug discovery, agrochemistry, food, cosmetics, and several other research disciplines or chemical industries. The crescent world’s interest in the development of these databases is related to the exploration of chemical diversity in geographical regions with rich biodiversity. Methods In this work, we introduce and discuss Nat-UV DB, the first natural products database from a coastal zone of Mexico. We discuss its construction, curation, and chemoinformatic characterization of their content, and chemical space coverage compared with other compound databases, like approved drugs, and other Mexican (BIOFACQUIM and UNIIQUIM databases) and the Latin American natural products database (LaNAPDB). Results Nat-UV DB comprises 227 compounds that contain 112 scaffolds, of which 52 are not present in previous natural product databases. The compounds present in Nat-UV DB have a similar size, flexibility, and polarity to previously reported natural products and approved drug datasets. Conclusions Nat-UV DB compounds have a higher structural and scaffold diversity than the approved drugs, but they have low structural and scaffold diversity in contrast with other natural products in the reference datasets. This database serves as a valuable addition to the global natural products landscape, bridging gaps in exploring biodiversity-rich regions.

                Introduction Osteochondral fractures (OCF)s of the femoral condyle are rare in pediatric patients but can have significant implications if missed or left untreated. Surgical fixation is often recommended, particularly in young, to restore joint congruency and function. Case report We report the case of a 14-year-old boy who presented with isolated weight-bearing OCF of the lateral femoral condyle following a sports injury. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a 30.4 mm osteochondral fragment confirmed by arthroscopy but unsuitable for percutaneous management due to its size and location. Open reduction and internal fixation were performed using headless compression screws, a technique reserved for those cases where based on sufficient detached fragment bone to facilitate secure fixation and bone-to-bone healing. Conclusion This case underscores the importance of prompt diagnosis and individualized treatment to prevent long-term joint damage, contributing valuable insights into the management of pediatric femoral osteochondral fractures.

                Background Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a highly effective tool for the detection of prostate cancer (PCa). Diffusion-weighted MRI (DW-MRI) is a sensitive technique that depends on the b value and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) value for the diagnosis of PCa. The main objective of this study was to determine the optimal b-value and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) value in DW-MRI for the diagnosis of prostate cancer. Methods A prospective study including 26 male participants were conducted. MRI examinations were performed with T2 fat saturation sequences, and Diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) sequences with b-values (800, 1000, 1500, and 2000 mm2/s) were used, and the corresponding ADC maps were calculated. Qualitative and quantitative analyses were conducted. Results According to the present study, a b-value of 0,1500 mm2/s exhibited the highest Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), Signal Intensity Ratio (SIR), and Contrast-to-Noise Ratio (CNR). Area Under the Curve (AUC) for 0,1500 mm2/s was 0.80, indicating a high diagnostic accuracy for prostate cancer. Conclusion DWI with a b-value of 1500 mm2/s provides good diagnostic accuracy for differential diagnosis of prostate lesions. DWI is a crucial sequence in multiparametric MRI of the prostate and offers detailed information that enhances the accuracy of prostate cancer diagnosis and management.
