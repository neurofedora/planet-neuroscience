              <h4><a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">Structural basis for enhanced infectivity and immune evasion of SARS-CoV-2 variants</a></h4>

              
                <p>Several fast-spreading variants of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have become the dominant circulating strains in the COVID-19 pandemic. We report here cryo&ndash;electron microscopy structures of the full-length spike (S) trimers of the B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants, as well as their biochemical and antigenic properties. Amino acid substitutions in the B.1.1.7 protein increase both the accessibility of its receptor binding domain and the binding affinity for receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The enhanced receptor engagement may account for the increased transmissibility. The B.1.351 variant has evolved to reshape antigenic surfaces of the major neutralizing sites on the S protein, making it resistant to some potent neutralizing antibodies. These findings provide structural details on how SARS-CoV-2 has evolved to enhance viral fitness and immune evasion.</p>

                <p>A novel variant of concern (VOC) named CAL.20C (B.1.427/B.1.429), which was originally detected in California, carries spike glycoprotein mutations S13I in the signal peptide, W152C in the N-terminal domain (NTD), and L452R in the receptor-binding domain (RBD). Plasma from individuals vaccinated with a Wuhan-1 isolate&ndash;based messenger RNA vaccine or from convalescent individuals exhibited neutralizing titers that were reduced 2- to 3.5-fold against the B.1.427/B.1.429 variant relative to wild-type pseudoviruses. The L452R mutation reduced neutralizing activity in 14 of 34 RBD-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). The S13I and W152C mutations resulted in total loss of neutralization for 10 of 10 NTD-specific mAbs because the NTD antigenic supersite was remodeled by a shift of the signal peptide cleavage site and the formation of a new disulfide bond, as revealed by mass spectrometry and structural studies.</p>

                <p>We report de novo genome assemblies, transcriptomes, annotations, and methylomes for the 26 inbreds that serve as the founders for the maize nested association mapping population. The number of pan-genes in these diverse genomes exceeds 103,000, with approximately a third found across all genotypes. The results demonstrate that the ancient tetraploid character of maize continues to degrade by fractionation to the present day. Excellent contiguity over repeat arrays and complete annotation of centromeres revealed additional variation in major cytological landmarks. We show that combining structural variation with single-nucleotide polymorphisms can improve the power of quantitative mapping studies. We also document variation at the level of DNA methylation and demonstrate that unmethylated regions are enriched for cis-regulatory elements that contribute to phenotypic variation.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">A noncoding RNA modulator potentiates phenylalanine metabolism in mice</a></h4>

              
                <p>The functional role of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in inherited metabolic disorders, including phenylketonuria (PKU), is unknown. Here, we demonstrate that the mouse lncRNA <I>Pair</I> and human <I>HULC</I> associate with phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH). <I>Pair</I>-knockout mice exhibited excessive blood phenylalanine (Phe), musty odor, hypopigmentation, growth retardation, and progressive neurological symptoms including seizures, which faithfully models human PKU. <I>HULC</I> depletion led to reduced PAH enzymatic activities in human induced pluripotent stem cell&ndash;differentiated hepatocytes. Mechanistically, <I>HULC</I> modulated the enzymatic activities of PAH by facilitating PAH-substrate and PAH-cofactor interactions. To develop a therapeutic strategy for restoring liver lncRNAs, we designed GalNAc-tagged lncRNA mimics that exhibit liver enrichment. Treatment with GalNAc-<I>HULC</I> mimics reduced excessive Phe in <I>Pair</I><sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> and <I>Pah</I><sup>R408W/R408W</sup> mice and improved the Phe tolerance of these mice.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">Quantum-enhanced sensing of displacements and electric fields with two-dimensional trapped-ion crystals</a></h4>

              
                <p>Fully controllable ultracold atomic systems are creating opportunities for quantum sensing, yet demonstrating a quantum advantage in useful applications by harnessing entanglement remains a challenging task. Here, we realize a many-body quantum-enhanced sensor to detect displacements and electric fields using a crystal of ~150 trapped ions. The center-of-mass vibrational mode of the crystal serves as a high-<I>Q</I> mechanical oscillator, and the collective electronic spin serves as the measurement device. By entangling the oscillator and collective spin and controlling the coherent dynamics via a many-body echo, a displacement is mapped into a spin rotation while avoiding quantum back-action and thermal noise. We achieve a sensitivity to displacements of 8.8 &plusmn; 0.4 decibels below the standard quantum limit and a sensitivity for measuring electric fields of 240 &plusmn; 10 nanovolts per meter in 1 second. Feasible improvements should enable the use of trapped ions in searches for dark matter.</p>

Direct time-domain measurements of &bull;QOOH unimolecular dissociation rates over a wide range of energies were found to be in accord with those predicted theoretically using state-of-the-art electronic structure characterizations of the transition state barrier region. Unimolecular decay was enhanced by substantial heavy-atom tunneling involving O-O elongation and C-C-O angle contraction along the reaction pathway. Master equation modeling yielded a fully a priori prediction of the pressure-dependent thermal unimolecular dissociation rates for the &bull;QOOH intermediate&mdash;again increased by heavy-atom tunneling&mdash;which are required for global models of atmospheric and combustion chemistry.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">Suppressing atomic diffusion with the Schwarz crystal structure in supersaturated Al-Mg alloys</a></h4>

              
                <p>High atomic diffusivity in metals enables substantial tuneability of their structure and properties by tailoring the diffusional processes, but this causes their customized properties to be unstable at elevated temperatures. Eliminating diffusive interfaces by fabricating single crystals or heavily alloying helps to address this issue but does not inhibit atomic diffusion at high homologous temperatures. We discovered that the Schwarz crystal structure was effective at suppressing atomic diffusion in a supersaturated aluminum&ndash;magnesium alloy with extremely fine grains. By forming these stable structures, diffusion-controlled intermetallic precipitation from the nanosized grains and their coarsening were inhibited up to the equilibrium melting temperature, around which the apparent across-boundary diffusivity was reduced by about seven orders of magnitude. Developing advanced engineering alloys using the Schwarz crystal structure may lead to useful properties for high-temperature applications.</p>

                <p>Recent advances in nanofluidics have enabled the confinement of water down to a single molecular layer. Such monolayer electrolytes show promise in achieving bioinspired functionalities through molecular control of ion transport. However, the understanding of ion dynamics in these systems is still scarce. Here, we develop an analytical theory, backed up by molecular dynamics simulations, that predicts strongly nonlinear effects in ion transport across quasi&ndash;two-dimensional slits. We show that under an electric field, ions assemble into elongated clusters, whose slow dynamics result in hysteretic conduction. This phenomenon, known as the memristor effect, can be harnessed to build an elementary neuron. As a proof of concept, we carry out molecular simulations of two nanofluidic slits that reproduce the Hodgkin-Huxley model and observe spontaneous emission of voltage spikes characteristic of neuromorphic activity.</p>

                <p>Incorporating passive radiative cooling structures into personal thermal management technologies could effectively defend humans against intensifying global climate change. We show that large-scale woven metafabrics can provide high emissivity (94.5%) in the atmospheric window and high reflectivity (92.4%) in the solar spectrum because of the hierarchical-morphology design of the randomly dispersed scatterers throughout the metafabric. Through scalable industrial textile manufacturing routes, our metafabrics exhibit desirable mechanical strength, waterproofness, and breathability for commercial clothing while maintaining efficient radiative cooling ability. Practical application tests demonstrated that a human body covered by our metafabric could be cooled ~4.8&deg;C lower than one covered by commercial cotton fabric. The cost-effectiveness and high performance of our metafabrics present substantial advantages for intelligent garments, smart textiles, and passive radiative cooling applications.</p>

                <p>Arboreal animals often leap through complex canopies to travel and avoid predators. Their success at making split-second, potentially life-threatening decisions of biomechanical capability depends on their skillful use of acrobatic maneuvers and learning from past efforts. Here, we found that free-ranging fox squirrels (<I>Sciurus niger</I>) leaping across unfamiliar, simulated branches decided where to launch by balancing a trade-off between gap distance and branch-bending compliance. Squirrels quickly learned to modify impulse generation upon repeated leaps from unfamiliar, compliant beams. A repertoire of agile landing maneuvers enabled targeted leaping without falling. Unanticipated adaptive landing and leaping "parkour" behavior revealed an innovative solution for particularly challenging leaps. Squirrels deciding and learning how to launch and land demonstrates the synergistic roles of biomechanics and cognition in robust gap-crossing strategies.</p>

                <p>Gag, the primary structural protein of HIV-1, is recruited to the plasma membrane for virus assembly by its matrix (MA) domain. Gag is subsequently cleaved into its component domains, causing structural maturation to repurpose the virion for cell entry. We determined the structure and arrangement of MA within immature and mature HIV-1 through cryo&ndash;electron tomography. We found that MA rearranges between two different hexameric lattices upon maturation. In mature HIV-1, a lipid extends out of the membrane to bind with a pocket in MA. Our data suggest that proteolytic maturation of HIV-1 not only assembles the viral capsid surrounding the genome but also repurposes the membrane-bound MA lattice for an entry or postentry function and results in the partial removal of up to 2500 lipids from the viral membrane.</p>

We combined cryo&ndash;electron microscopy (cryo-EM), binding, and computational analyses to study variant spikes, including one that was involved in transmission between minks and humans, and others that originated and spread in human populations. All variants showed increased angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor binding and increased propensity for receptor binding domain (RBD)&ndash;up states. While adaptation to mink resulted in spike destabilization, the B.1.1.7 (UK) spike balanced stabilizing and destabilizing mutations. A local destabilizing effect of the RBD E484K mutation was implicated in resistance of the B.1.1.28/P.1 (Brazil) and B.1.351 (South Africa) variants to neutralizing antibodies.

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Maternal Oxycodone Treatment Results in Neurobehavioral Disruptions in Mice Offspring</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Opioid drugs are increasingly being prescribed to pregnant women. Such compounds can also bind and activate opioid receptors in the fetal brain, which could lead to long-term brain and behavioral disruptions. We hypothesized that maternal treatment with oxycodone (OXY), the primary opioid at the center of the current crisis, leads to later neurobehavioral disorders and gene expression changes in the hypothalamus and hippocampus of resulting offspring. Female mice were treated daily with 5 mg OXY/kg or saline solution (control; CTL) for two weeks before breeding and then throughout gestation. Male and female offspring from both groups were tested with a battery of behavioral and metabolic tests to measure cognition, exploratory-like, anxiety-like, voluntary physical activity, and socio-communication behaviors. qPCR analyses were performed for candidate gene expression patterns in the hypothalamus and hippocampus of OXY and CTL derived offspring. Developmental exposure to OXY caused socio-communication changes that persisted from weaning through adulthood. Such offspring also showed cognitive impairments, reduced voluntary physical activity, and weighed more than CTL counterparts. In the hippocampus, prenatal exposure to OXY caused sex-dependent differences in expression of genes encoding opioid receptors and those involved in serotonin signaling. OXY exposure induced changes in neuropeptide hormone expression and the epigenetic modulator, <I>Dnmt3a</I>, in the hypothalamus, which could result in epigenetic changes in this brain region. The findings suggest cause for concern that consumption of OXY by pregnant mothers may result in permanent neurobehavioral changes in their offspring. Further work is needed to determine the potential underpinning epigenetic mechanisms.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Action Costs Rapidly and Automatically Interfere with Reward-Based Decision-Making in a Reaching Task</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>It is widely assumed that we select actions we value the most. While the influence of rewards on decision-making has been extensively studied, evidence regarding the influence of motor costs is scarce. Specifically, how and when motor costs are integrated in the decision process is unclear. Twenty-two right-handed human participants performed a reward-based target selection task by reaching with their right arm toward one of two visual targets. Targets were positioned in different directions according to biomechanical preference, such that one target was systematically associated with a lower motor cost than the other. Only one of the two targets was rewarded, either in a congruent or incongruent manner with respect to the associated motor cost. A timed-response paradigm was used to manipulate participants&rsquo; reaction times (RT). Results showed that when the rewarded target carried the highest motor cost, movements produced at short RT (&lt;350 ms) were deviated toward the other (i.e., non-rewarded, low-cost (LC) target). In this context participants needed an additional 150-ms delay to reach the same percentage of rewarded trials as when the LC target was rewarded. Crucially, motor costs affected the total earnings of participants. These results demonstrate a robust interference of motor costs in a simple reward-based decision-making task. They point to the rapid and automatic integration of motor costs at an early stage of processing, potentially through the direct modulation of competing action representations in parieto-frontal regions. The progressive overcoming of this bias with increasing RT is likely achieved through top-down signaling pertaining to expected rewards.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Cross-sectional versus longitudinal comparisons of age-related change have often revealed differing results. In the current study, we used within-subject task-based fMRI to investigate changes in voxel-based activations and behavioral performance across the life span in the Reference Ability Neural Network cohort, at both baseline and 5 year follow-up. We analyzed fMRI data from between 127 and 159 participants (20&ndash;80 years) on a battery of tests relating to each of four cognitive reference abilities. We applied a Gaussian age kernel to capture continuous change across the life span using a 5 year sliding window centered on each age in our participant sample, with a subsequent division into young, middle, and old age brackets. This method was applied separately to both cross-sectional approximations of change and real longitudinal changes adopting a comparative approach. We then focused on longitudinal measurements of neural change to identify regions expressing peak changes and fluctuations of sign change across our sample. Our results revealed several regions expressing divergence between cross-sectional and longitudinal measurements in each domain and age bracket; behavioral comparisons between measurements showed differences in change curves for all four domains, with processing speed displaying the steepest declines. In the longitudinal change measurement, we found lack of support for age-related frontal increases across analysis types, instead finding more posterior regions displaying peak increases in activation, particularly in the old age bracket. Our findings encourage greater focus on longitudinal measurements of age-related changes, which display appreciable differences from cross-sectional approximations.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">General Anesthesia Disrupts Complex Cortical Dynamics in Response to Intracranial Electrical Stimulation in Rats</a></h4>

              
                <p>The capacity of human brain to sustain complex cortical dynamics appears to be strongly associated with conscious experience and consistently drops when consciousness fades. For example, several recent studies in humans found a remarkable reduction of the spatiotemporal complexity of cortical responses to local stimulation during dreamless sleep, general anesthesia, and coma. However, this perturbational complexity has never been directly estimated in non-human animals <I>in vivo</I> previously, and the mechanisms that prevent neocortical neurons to engage in complex interactions are still unclear. Here, we quantify the complexity of electroencephalographic (EEG) responses to intracranial electrical stimulation in rats, comparing wakefulness to propofol, sevoflurane, and ketamine anesthesia. The evoked activity changed from highly complex in wakefulness to far simpler with propofol and sevoflurane. The reduced complexity was associated with a suppression of high frequencies that preceded a reduced phase-locking, and disruption of functional connectivity and pattern diversity. We then showed how these parameters dissociate with ketamine and depend on intensity and site of stimulation. Our results support the idea that brief periods of activity-dependent neuronal silence can interrupt complex interactions in neocortical circuits, and open the way for further mechanistic investigations of the neuronal basis for consciousness and loss of consciousness across species.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Role of NMDA Receptors in Adult Neurogenesis and Normal Development of the Dentate Gyrus</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>The NMDA receptors are a type of glutamate receptors, which is involved in neuronal function, plasticity and development in the mammalian brain. However, how the NMDA receptors contribute to adult neurogenesis and development of the dentate gyrus is unclear. In this study, we investigate this question by examining a region-specific knock-out mouse line that lacks the NR1 gene, which encodes the essential subunit of the NMDA receptors, in granule cells of the dentate gyrus (DG-NR1KO mice). We found that the survival of newly-generated granule cells, cell proliferation and the size of the granule cell layer are significantly reduced in the dorsal dentate gyrus of adult DG-NR1KO mice. Our results also show a significant reduction in the number of immature neurons and in the volume of the granule cell layer, starting from three weeks of postnatal age. DG-NR1KO mice also showed impairment in the expression of an immediate early gene, Arc, and behavior during the novelty-suppressed feeding and open field test. These results suggest that the NMDA receptors in granule cells have a role in adult neurogenesis in the adult brain and contributes to the normal development of the dentate gyrus.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Modelling conformational state dynamics and its role on infection for SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein variants</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Natália Teruel, Olivier Mailhot, Rafael J. Najmanovich</p>

The SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein needs to be in an open-state conformation to interact with ACE2 to initiate viral entry. We utilise coarse-grained normal mode analysis to model the dynamics of Spike and calculate transition probabilities between states for 17081 variants including experimentally observed variants. Our results correctly model an increase in open-state occupancy for the more infectious D614G via an increase in flexibility of the closed-state and decrease of flexibility of the open-state. We predict the same effect for several mutations on glycine residues (404, 416, 504, 252) as well as residues K417, D467 and N501, including the N501Y mutation recently observed within the B.1.1.7, 501.V2 and P1 strains. This is, to our knowledge, the first use of normal mode analysis to model conformational state transitions and the effect of mutations on such transitions. The specific mutations of Spike identified here may guide future studies to increase our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 infection mechanisms and guide public health in their surveillance efforts.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Relating simulation studies by provenance—Developing a family of Wnt signaling models</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Kai Budde, Jacob Smith, Pia Wilsdorf, Fiete Haack, Adelinde M. Uhrmacher</p>

For many biological systems, a variety of simulation models exist. A new simulation model is rarely developed from scratch, but rather revises and extends an existing one. A key challenge, however, is to decide which model might be an appropriate starting point for a particular problem and why. To answer this question, we need to identify entities and activities that contributed to the development of a simulation model. Therefore, we exploit the provenance data model, PROV-DM, of the World Wide Web Consortium and, building on previous work, continue developing a PROV ontology for simulation studies. Based on a case study of 19 Wnt/β-catenin signaling models, we identify crucial entities and activities as well as useful metadata to both capture the provenance information from individual simulation studies and relate these forming a family of models. The approach is implemented in WebProv, a web application for inserting and querying provenance information. Our specialization of PROV-DM contains the entities Research Question, Assumption, Requirement, Qualitative Model, Simulation Model, Simulation Experiment, Simulation Data, and Wet-lab Data as well as activities referring to building, calibrating, validating, and analyzing a simulation model. We show that most Wnt simulation models are connected to other Wnt models by using (parts of) these models. However, the overlap, especially regarding the Wet-lab Data used for calibration or validation of the models is small. Making these aspects of developing a model explicit and queryable is an important step for assessing and reusing simulation models more effectively. Exposing this information helps to integrate a new simulation model within a family of existing ones and may lead to the development of more robust and valid simulation models. We hope that our approach becomes part of a standardization effort and that modelers adopt the benefits of provenance when considering or creating simulation models.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Integration of a physiologically-based pharmacokinetic model with a whole-body, organ-resolved genome-scale model for characterization of ethanol and acetaldehyde metabolism</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Leo Zhu, William Pei, Ines Thiele, Radhakrishnan Mahadevan</p>

Ethanol is one of the most widely used recreational substances in the world and due to its ubiquitous use, ethanol abuse has been the cause of over 3.3 million deaths each year. In addition to its effects, ethanol’s primary metabolite, acetaldehyde, is a carcinogen that can cause symptoms of facial flushing, headaches, and nausea. How strongly ethanol or acetaldehyde affects an individual depends highly on the genetic polymorphisms of certain genes. In particular, the genetic polymorphisms of mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase, ALDH2, play a large role in the metabolism of acetaldehyde. Thus, it is important to characterize how genetic variations can lead to different exposures and responses to ethanol and acetaldehyde. While the pharmacokinetics of ethanol metabolism through alcohol dehydrogenase have been thoroughly explored in previous studies, in this paper, we combined a base physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model with a whole-body genome-scale model (WBM) to gain further insight into the effect of other less explored processes and genetic variations on ethanol metabolism. This combined model was fit to clinical data and used to show the effect of alcohol concentrations, organ damage, ALDH2 enzyme polymorphisms, and ALDH2-inhibiting drug disulfiram on ethanol and acetaldehyde exposure. Through estimating the reaction rates of auxiliary processes with dynamic Flux Balance Analysis, The PBPK-WBM was able to navigate around a lack of kinetic constants traditionally associated with PK modelling and demonstrate the compensatory effects of the body in response to decreased liver enzyme expression. Additionally, the model demonstrated that acetaldehyde exposure increased with higher dosages of disulfiram and decreased ALDH2 efficiency, and that moderate consumption rates of ethanol could lead to unexpected accumulations in acetaldehyde. This modelling framework combines the comprehensive steady-state analyses from genome-scale models with the dynamics of traditional PK models to create a highly personalized form of PBPK modelling that can push the boundaries of precision medicine.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">The Δ40p53 isoform inhibits p53-dependent eRNA transcription and enables regulation by signal-specific transcription factors during p53 activation</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Cecilia B. Levandowski, Taylor Jones, Margaret Gruca, Sivapriya Ramamoorthy, Robin D. Dowell, Dylan J. Taatjes</p>

The naturally occurring Δ40p53 isoform heterotetramerizes with wild-type p53 (WTp53) to regulate development, aging, and stress responses. How Δ40p53 alters WTp53 function remains enigmatic because their co-expression causes tetramer heterogeneity. We circumvented this issue with a well-tested strategy that expressed Δ40p53:WTp53 as a single transcript, ensuring a 2:2 tetramer stoichiometry. Human MCF10A cell lines expressing Δ40p53:WTp53, WTp53, or WTp53:WTp53 (as controls) from the native TP53 locus were examined with transcriptomics (precision nuclear run-on sequencing [PRO-seq] and RNA sequencing [RNA-seq]), metabolomics, and other methods. Δ40p53:WTp53 was transcriptionally active, and, although phenotypically similar to WTp53 under normal conditions, it failed to induce growth arrest upon Nutlin-induced p53 activation. This occurred via Δ40p53:WTp53-dependent inhibition of enhancer RNA (eRNA) transcription and subsequent failure to induce mRNA biogenesis, despite similar genomic occupancy to WTp53. A different stimulus (5-fluorouracil [5FU]) also showed Δ40p53:WTp53-specific changes in mRNA induction; however, other transcription factors (TFs; e.g., E2F2) could then drive the response, yielding similar outcomes vs. WTp53. Our results establish that Δ40p53 tempers WTp53 function to enable compensatory responses by other stimulus-specific TFs. Such modulation of WTp53 activity may be an essential physiological function for Δ40p53. Moreover, Δ40p53:WTp53 functional distinctions uncovered herein suggest an eRNA requirement for mRNA biogenesis and that human p53 evolved as a tetramer to support eRNA transcription.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">IL-25–induced shifts in macrophage polarization promote development of beige fat and improve metabolic homeostasis in mice</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Lingyi Li, Lei Ma, Zewei Zhao, Shiya Luo, Baoyong Gong, Jin Li, Juan Feng, Hui Zhang, Weiwei Qi, Ti Zhou, Xia Yang, Guoquan Gao, Zhonghan Yang</p>

Beige fat dissipates energy and functions as a defense against cold and obesity, but the mechanism for its development is unclear. We found that interleukin (IL)-25 signaling through its cognate receptor, IL-17 receptor B (IL-17RB), increased in adipose tissue after cold exposure and β3-adrenoceptor agonist stimulation. IL-25 induced beige fat formation in white adipose tissue (WAT) by releasing IL-4 and IL-13 and promoting alternative activation of macrophages that regulate innervation and up-regulate tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) up-regulation to produce more catecholamine including norepinephrine (NE). Blockade of IL-4Rα or depletion of macrophages with clodronate-loaded liposomes in vivo significantly impaired the beige fat formation in WAT. Mice fed with a high-fat diet (HFD) were protected from obesity and related metabolic disorders when given IL-25 through a process that involved the uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1)-mediated thermogenesis. In conclusion, the activation of IL-25 signaling in WAT may have therapeutic potential for controlling obesity and its associated metabolic disorders.

                Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic, autoimmune disease characterized by widespread clinical manifestations and immunological disorders. A myriad of ocular manifestations can be seen in patients with SLE. The most vision-threatening complication is vaso-occlusive retinopathy including retinal vein occlusion (RVO). RVO associated with SLE is well described in the literature and its association with antiphospholipid antibodies is recognized. However, RVO as the initial manifestation of SLE is scarcely reported. Herein, we report the first case of recurrent RVO as the primary manifestation of SLE in a 40-year-old male patient. He had two consecutive episodes of decreased vision. Ophthalmologic examination disclosed a branch retinal vein occlusion the first time and a central retinal vein occlusion the second time. The diagnosis of SLE was established based on clinical and immunological criteria. He was prescribed antiplatelet therapy, hydroxychloroquine at 5.5 mg/kg/day, and intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) antibodies regimen. He slowly improved under treatment.

                Background Most bacterial genomes contain integrated bacteriophages—prophages—in various states of decay. Many are active and able to excise from the genome and replicate, while others are cryptic prophages, remnants of their former selves. Over the last two decades, many computational tools have been developed to identify the prophage components of bacterial genomes, and it is a particularly active area for the application of machine learning approaches. However, progress is hindered and comparisons thwarted because there are no manually curated bacterial genomes that can be used to test new prophage prediction algorithms. Methods We present a library of gold-standard bacterial genome annotations that include manually curated prophage annotations, and a computational framework to compare the predictions from different algorithms. We use this suite to compare all extant stand-alone prophage prediction algorithms to identify their strengths and weaknesses. We provide a FAIR dataset for prophage identification, and demonstrate the accuracy, precision, recall, and f1 score from the analysis of seven different algorithms for the prediction of prophages. Results We identified different strengths and weaknesses between the prophage prediction tools. Several tools exhibit exceptional f1 scores, while others have better recall at the expense of more false positives. The tools vary greatly in runtime performance with few exhibiting all desirable qualities for large-scale analyses. Conclusions Our library of gold-standard prophage annotations and benchmarking framework provide a valuable resource for exploring strengths and weaknesses of current and future prophage annotation tools. We discuss caveats and concerns in this analysis, how those concerns may be mitigated, and avenues for future improvements. This framework will help developers identify opportunities for improvement and test updates. It will also help users in determining the tools that are best suited for their analysis.

                Background: Stroke is a significant global health hazard that ripples continuum multi-spectral effects to the patients as well their caretakers.   Methods: We studied 28 consecutive cohorts of patients with recurrent strokes managed in our centre within the last two years.  Results: The most common recurrence stroke pattern was of that of hemorrhagic to hemorrhagic subtype observed in 50% of the patients. The most common anatomical region of involvement was cortical – cortical seen in 39.28% of our cohorts. The surgical intervention was required in 17.85% whereas 42.85% of them were managed conservatively. Paradoxically, 39.28% of patients left against medical advice. The receiver operating curve (ROC) predicting mode of management was highest (area under the curve (AUC) =0.635) for compliance to therapy followed by stroke territory (AUC=0.578), age (AUC=0.457) and motor grading (AUC=0.374). The receiver operating curve (ROC) for influencing decision to leave against medical advice was highest (area under the curve (AUC) =0.861) for motor score followed by sex (AUC=0.701) and age (AUC=0.564). The analysis of variance (ANOVA) study pertaining to the mode of management was significantly connoted by the motor score and the stroke territory only. The ANOVA study pertaining to the decision to leave against medical advice was significantly governed by the motor score, stroke territory, and sex respectively. The multivariate analysis for variables governing mode of management was significant for motor score and the stroke territory only. The multivariate analysis for variables governing leave against medical advice was significant for sex, motor score and the stroke territory.  Conclusions: This study aims to appraise early dichotomization of high-risk patients for recurrent strokes to reduce the continuum of neurological events as well as to mitigate the financial aspects governing stroke care.

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/inpress.rss">Cellular senescence at the crossroads of inflammation and Alzheimer's disease</a></h4>

              
                Aging is a key risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the reasons for this association are not well understood. Senescent cells accumulate in aged tissues and have been shown to play causal roles in age-related pathologies through their proinflammatory secretome. The question arises whether senescence-induced inflammation might contribute to AD and bridge the gap between aging and AD. Here, we highlight the role of cellular senescence as a driver of the aging phenotype, and discuss the current evidence that connects senescence with AD and neurodegeneration.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Unsupervised machine learning reveals key immune cell subsets in COVID-19, rhinovirus infection, and cancer therapy</a></h4>

              
                For an emerging disease like COVID-19, systems immunology tools may quickly identify and quantitatively characterize cells associated with disease progression or clinical response. With repeated sampling, immune monitoring creates a real-time portrait of the cells reacting to a novel virus before disease specific knowledge and tools are established. However, single cell analysis tools can struggle to reveal rare cells that are under 0.1% of the population. Here, the machine learning workflow Tracking Responders Expanding (T-REX) was created to identify changes in both very rare and common cells in diverse human immune monitoring settings. T-REX identified cells that were highly similar in phenotype and localized to hotspots of significant change during rhinovirus and SARS-CoV-2 infections. Specialized reagents used to detect the rhinovirus-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> cells, MHCII tetramers, were not used during unsupervised analysis and instead 'left out' to serve as a test of whether T-REX identified biologically significant cells. In the rhinovirus challenge study, T-REX identified virus-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells based on these cells being a distinct phenotype that expanded by ≥95% following infection. T-REX successfully identified hotspots containing virus-specific T cells using pairs of samples comparing Day 7 of infection to samples taken either prior to infection (Day 0) or after clearing the infection (Day 28). Mapping pairwise comparisons in samples according to both the direction and degree of change provided a framework to compare systems level immune changes during infectious disease or therapy response. This revealed that the magnitude and direction of systemic immune change in some COVID-19 patients was comparable to that of blast crisis acute myeloid leukemia patients undergoing induction chemotherapy and characterized the identity of the immune cells that changed the most. Other COVID-19 patients instead matched an immune trajectory like that of individuals with rhinovirus infection or melanoma patients receiving checkpoint inhibitor therapy. T-REX analysis of paired blood samples provides an approach to rapidly identify and characterize mechanistically significant cells and to place emerging diseases into a systems immunology context.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Met and Cxcr4 cooperate to protect skeletal muscle stem cells against inflammation-induced damage during regeneration</a></h4>

              
                Acute skeletal muscle injury is followed by an inflammatory response, removal of damaged tissue, and the generation of new muscle fibers by resident muscle stem cells, a process well characterized in murine injury models. Inflammatory cells are needed to remove the debris at the site of injury and provide signals that are beneficial for repair. However, they also release chemokines, reactive oxygen species as well as enzymes for clearance of damaged cells and fibers, which muscle stem cells have to withstand in order to regenerate the muscle. We show here that MET and CXCR4 cooperate to protect muscle stem cells against the adverse environment encountered during muscle repair. This powerful cyto-protective role was revealed by the genetic ablation of <i>Met</i> and <i>Cxcr4</i> in muscle stem cells of mice, which resulted in severe apoptosis during early stages of regeneration. TNFα neutralizing antibodies rescued the apoptosis, indicating that TNFα provides crucial cell-death signals during muscle repair that are counteracted by MET and CXCR4. We conclude that muscle stem cells require MET and CXCR4 to protect them against the harsh inflammatory environment encountered in an acute muscle injury.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Characterization of cephalic and non-cephalic sensory cell types provides insight into joint photo- and mechanoreceptor evolution</a></h4>

              
                Rhabdomeric opsins (r-opsins) are light-sensors in cephalic eye photoreceptors, but also function in additional sensory organs. This has prompted questions on the evolutionary relationship of these cell types, and if ancient r-opsins were non-photosensory. A molecular profiling approach in the marine bristleworm <i>Platynereis dumerilii</i> revealed shared and distinct features of cephalic and non-cephalic of <i>r-opsin1</i>-expressing cells. Non-cephalic cells possess a full set of phototransduction components, but also a mechanosensory signature. Prompted by the latter, we investigated <i>Platynereis </i>putative mechanotransducer, and found <i>nompc </i>and<i> pkd2.1</i> co-expressed with <i>r-opsin1 </i>in TRE cells by HCR RNA-FISH. To further assess the role of r-Opsin1 in these cells, we studied its signaling properties and unraveled that r-Opsin1 is a Gαq-coupled blue-light receptor. Profiling of cells from <i>r-opsin1</i> mutants versus wild-types, and a comparison under different light conditions reveals that in the non-cephalic cells, light - mediated by r-Opsin1 - adjusts the expression level of a calcium transporter relevant for auditory mechanosensation in vertebrates. We establish a deep learning-based quantitative behavioral analysis for animal trunk movements, and identify a light- and r-Opsin-1-dependent fine-tuning of the worm's undulatory movements in headless trunks, which are known to require mechanosensory feedback. Our results provide new data on peripheral cell types of likely light-sensory/mechanosensory nature. These results point towards a concept in which such a multisensory cell type evolved to allow for fine-tuning of mechanosensation by light. This implies that light-independent mechanosensory roles of r-opsins may have evolved secondarily.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Precise optical control of gene expression in C. elegans using improved genetic code expansion and Cre recombinase</a></h4>

              
                Synthetic strategies for optically controlling gene expression may enable the precise spatiotemporal control of genes in any combination of cells that cannot be targeted with specific promoters. We develop an improved genetic code expansion system in <i>C. elegans</i> and use it to create a photo-activatable Cre recombinase. We laser-activate Cre in single neurons within a bilaterally symmetric pair to selectively switch on expression of a loxP controlled optogenetic channel in the targeted neuron. We use the system to dissect, in freely moving animals, the individual contributions of the mechanosensory neurons PLML/PLMR to the <i>C. elegans</i> touch response circuit, revealing distinct and synergistic roles for these neurons. We thus demonstrate how genetic code expansion and optical targeting can be combined to break the symmetry of neuron pairs and dissect behavioural outputs of individual neurons that cannot be genetically targeted.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Ancient viral genomes reveal introduction of human pathogenic viruses into Mexico during the transatlantic slave trade</a></h4>

              
                After the European colonization of the Americas there was a dramatic population collapse of the Indigenous inhabitants caused in part by the introduction of new pathogens. Although there is much speculation on the etiology of the Colonial epidemics, direct evidence for the presence of specific viruses during the Colonial era is lacking. To uncover the diversity of viral pathogens during this period, we designed an enrichment assay targeting ancient DNA (aDNA) from viruses of clinical importance and applied it to DNA extracts from individuals found in a Colonial hospital and a Colonial chapel (16<sup>th</sup> c. - 18<sup>th</sup> c.) where records suggest victims of epidemics were buried during important outbreaks in Mexico City. This allowed us to reconstruct three ancient human parvovirus B19 genomes, and one ancient human hepatitis B virus genome from distinct individuals. The viral genomes are similar to African strains, consistent with the inferred morphological and genetic African ancestry of the hosts as well as with the isotopic analysis of the human remains, suggesting an origin on the African continent. This study provides direct molecular evidence of ancient viruses being transported to the Americas during the transatlantic slave trade and their subsequent introduction to New Spain. Altogether, our observations enrich the discussion about the etiology of infectious diseases during the Colonial period in Mexico.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Evolution of diversity in metabolic strategies</a></h4>

              
                Understanding the origin and maintenance of biodiversity is a fundamental problem. Many theoretical approaches have been investigating ecological interactions, such as competition, as potential drivers of diversification. Classical consumer-resource models predict that the number of coexisting species should not exceed the number of distinct resources, a phenomenon known as the competitive exclusion principle. It has recently been argued that including physiological tradeoffs in consumer-resource models can lead to violations of this principle and to ecological coexistence of very high numbers of species. Here we show that these results crucially depend on the functional form of the tradeoff. We investigate the evolutionary dynamics of resource use constrained by tradeoffs and show that if the tradeoffs are non-linear, the system either does not diversify, or diversifies into a number of coexisting species that does not exceed the number of resources. In particular, very high diversity can only be observed for linear tradeoffs.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Adipocyte NR1D1 dictates adipose tissue expansion during obesity</a></h4>

              
                The circadian clock component NR1D1 (REVERBα) is considered a dominant regulator of lipid metabolism, with global <i>Nr1d1</i> deletion driving dysregulation of white adipose tissue (WAT) lipogenesis and obesity. However, a similar phenotype is not observed under adipocyte-selective deletion (<i>Nr1d1<sup>Flox2-6</sup>:Adipoq<sup>Cre</sup></i>), and transcriptional pro1ling demonstrates that, under basal conditions, direct targets of NR1D1 regulation are limited, and include the circadian clock and collagen dynamics. Under high-fat diet (HFD) feeding, <i>Nr1d1<sup>Flox2-6</sup>:Adipoq<sup>Cre</sup></i> mice do manifest profound obesity, yet without the accompanying WAT in2ammation and 1brosis exhibited by controls. Integration of the WAT NR1D1 cistrome with differential gene expression reveals broad control of metabolic processes by NR1D1 which is unmasked in the obese state. Adipocyte NR1D1 does not drive an anticipatory daily rhythm in WAT lipogenesis, but rather modulates WAT activity in response to alterations in metabolic state. Importantly, NR1D1 action in adipocytes is critical to the development of obesity-related WAT pathology and insulin resistance.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Risk of motor vehicle collisions after methadone use</a></h4>

              
                Methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) can alleviate opioid dependence. However, MMT possibly increases the risk of motor vehicle collisions. The current study investigated preliminary estimation of motor vehicle collision incidence rates. Furthermore, in this population-based retrospective cohort study with frequency-matched controls, opiate adults receiving MMT (cases) and those not receiving MMT (controls) were identified at a 1:2 ratio by linking data from several nationwide administrative registry databases. From 2009 to 2016, the crude incidence rate of motor vehicle collisions was the lowest in the general adult population, followed by that in opiate adults, and it was the highest in adults receiving MMT. The incidence rates of motor vehicle collisions were significantly higher in opiate users receiving MMT than in those not receiving MMT. Kaplan–Meier curves of the incidence of motor vehicle collisions differed significantly between groups, with a significant increased risk during the first 90 days of follow-up. In conclusion, drivers receiving MMT have higher motor vehicle collision risk than those not receiving MMT in opiate users, and it is worthy of noticing road safety in such drivers, particularly during the first 90 days of MMT.

                Background: Prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) has been linked to atypical brain development and a wide range of cognitive and behavioral impairments, including poor reading performance in childhood and adolescence. However, little is known about how structural and/or functional teratogenesis in the brain mediate reading impairment in fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) and whether neural correlates of reading and phonological processing differ between FASD subtypes with different clinical presentations in facial morphology. Methods: The current study utilized functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to characterize functional and structural mechanisms mediating reading deficits in 26 syndromal adolescents with PAE-related facial dysmorphology (i.e., fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) or partial FAS (PFAS)) and 30 heavily exposed (HE) without this dysmorphology, in comparison with 19 typically developing controls. Importantly, the levels of PAE and reading ability were comparable between the FAS/PFAS and HE groups in the current study. Results: Compared to the nonsyndromal HE and control groups, the syndromal adolescents showed greater activation in the right precentral gyrus during an fMRI phonological processing task and rightward lateralization in an important reading-related tract (inferior longitudinal fasciculus, ILF), suggesting an atypical reliance on the right hemisphere during reading. By contrast, in the HE group, better reading skills were associated with increased neural activation in the left angular gyrus (LAG) and higher fractional anisotropy in the white matter organization of the left ILF. However, the brain function-behavior relation was weaker in the HE than among the controls, suggesting less efficient function of the typical reading neural network that may contribute to the observed reading impairments. Conclusions: Our findings provide the first evidence for the distinctive functional and structural mechanisms underlying atypical reading and phonological processing in PAE adolescents with and without FAS facial dysmorphology.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The decoy SNARE Tomosyn sets tonic versus phasic release properties and is required for homeostatic synaptic plasticity</a></h4>

              
                Synaptic vesicle release probability (Pr) is a key presynaptic determinant of synaptic strength established by cell intrinsic properties and further refined by plasticity. To characterize mechanisms that generate Pr heterogeneity between distinct neuronal populations, we examined glutamatergic tonic (Ib) and phasic (Is) motoneurons in Drosophila with stereotyped differences in Pr and synaptic plasticity. We found the decoy SNARE Tomosyn is differentially expressed between these motoneuron subclasses and contributes to intrinsic differences in their synaptic output. Tomosyn expression enables tonic release in Ib motoneurons by reducing SNARE complex formation and suppressing Pr to generate decreased levels of synaptic vesicle fusion and enhanced resistance to synaptic fatigue. In contrast, phasic release dominates when Tomosyn expression is low, enabling high intrinsic Pr at Is terminals at the expense of sustained release and robust presynaptic potentiation. In addition, loss of Tomosyn disrupts the ability of tonic synapses to undergo presynaptic homeostatic potentiation (PHP).

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Synaptic plasticity is predicted by spatiotemporal firing rate patterns and robust to in vivo-like variability</a></h4>

              
                Synaptic plasticity, the experience-induced change in connections between neurons, underlies learning and memory in the brain. Most of our understanding of synaptic plasticity derives from in vitro experiments with precisely repeated stimulus patterns; however, neurons exhibit significant variability in vivo during repeated experiences. Further, the spatial pattern of synaptic inputs to the dendritic tree influences synaptic plasticity, yet is not considered in most synaptic plasticity rules. Here, we address the sensitivity of plasticity to trial-to-trial variability and delineate how spatiotemporal synaptic input patterns produce plasticity with in vivo-like conditions using a data-driven computational model with a calcium-based plasticity rule. Using in vivo spike train recordings as inputs, we show that plasticity is strongly robust to trial-to-trial variability of spike timing, and derive general synaptic plasticity rules describing how spatiotemporal patterns of synaptic inputs control the magnitude and direction of plasticity. Specifically, a high temporal input firing rate to a synapse late in a trial correlated with neighboring synaptic activity produces potentiation, while an earlier, moderate firing rate that is negatively correlated with neighboring synaptic activity produces depression. Together, our results reveal that calcium dynamics can unify diverse plasticity rules and reveal how spatiotemporal firing rate patterns control synaptic plasticity.

                Concerns about animal welfare and meat quality have encouraged research on new methods for the stunning of broilers during animal slaughter. In this study, the electroencephalogram (EEG) and electrocardiogram (ECG) of broilers were acquired during stunning using an electrical hybrid instead of a single frequency. Considering a square wave with a current of 220 mA and a frequency of 1100 Hz (duty-cycle 50%), the hybrid-frequency waveform is obtained generating pulses at 6600 Hertz in the pulse-width phase. Sixty broilers aged 42 days were randomly sampled; thirty were used for EEG measurement and thirty for ECG measurement. For EEG measurements, the birds' scalps were anesthetized, and EEG electrode needles were inserted on the subcutaneous part of the occipital scalp. For ECG, the non-invasive surface electrode was used. The electrodes were connected to a digital EEG/ECG system. The results showed that the hybrid-frequency waveform system generated epileptic forms in the birds' EEGs. Therefore, a hybrid-frequency system may present better carcass quality results, while preserving the birds' welfare, when compared with a single frequency system use.

	<p>Performance validity tests (PVTs) are used for the detection of noncredible performance in neuropsychological assessments. The aim of the study was to assess the efficacy (i.e., discrimination capacity) of a novel PVT, the Multi-Level Pattern Memory Test (MPMT). It includes stages that allow profile analysis (i.e., detecting noncredible performance based on an analysis of participants’ performance across stages) and minimizes the likelihood that it would be perceived as a PVT by examinees. In addition, it utilizes nonverbal stimuli and is therefore more likely to be cross-culturally valid. In Experiment 1, participants that were instructed to simulate cognitive impairment performed less accurately than honest controls in the MPMT (n = 67). Importantly, the MPMT has shown an adequate discrimination capacity, though somewhat lower than an established PVT (i.e., Test of Memory Malingering—TOMM). Experiment 2 (n = 77) validated the findings of the first experiment while also indicating a dissociation between the simulators’ objective performance and their perceived cognitive load while performing the MPMT. The MPMT and the profile analysis based on its outcome measures show initial promise in detecting noncredible performance. It may, therefore, increase the range of available PVTs at the disposal of clinicians, though further validation in clinical settings is mandated. The fact that it is an open-source software will hopefully also encourage the development of research programs aimed at clarifying the cognitive processes involved in noncredible performance and the impact of PVT characteristics on clinical utility.</p>

	<p>Autism is associated with gastrointestinal dysfunction and gut microbiota dysbiosis, including an overall increase in Clostridium. Modulation of the gut microbiota is suggested to improve autistic symptoms. In this study, we explored the implementation of two different interventions that target the microbiota in a rodent model of autism and their effects on social behavior: the levels of different fecal Clostridium spp., and hippocampal transcript levels. Autism was induced in young Sprague Dawley male rats using oral gavage of propionic acid (PPA) for three days, while controls received saline. PPA-treated animals were divided to receive either saline, fecal transplant from healthy donor rats, or Bifidobacterium for 22 days, while controls continued to receive saline. We found that PPA attenuated social interaction in animals, which was rescued by the two interventions. PPA-treated animals had a significantly increased abundance of fecal C. perfringens with a concomitant decrease in Clostridium cluster IV, and exhibited high hippocampal Bdnf expression compared to controls. Fecal microbiota transplantation or Bifidobacterium treatment restored the balance of fecal Clostridium spp. and normalized the level of Bdnf expression. These findings highlight the involvement of the gut–brain axis in the etiology of autism and propose possible interventions in a preclinical model of autism.</p>

	<p>Parenting a child with a disability, such as neurodevelopmental disorders and genetic syndromes, implies a high level of stress. During the COVID-19 outbreak—as a period implying additional challenges—few studies have specifically investigated caregivers’ distress among neurodevelopmental disabilities. The objective of the study is to investigate whether during the COVID-19 pandemic, the level of parental stress differs between four disability groups including neurodevelopmental disorders (autism spectrum disorder (ASD), attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)) and genetic syndromes (Rett syndrome (RTT), Sotos syndrome (SS)) in comparison to families with typical development offspring (TD). In total, 220 Italian parents of children affected by neurodevelopmental disabilities (74 ASD, 51 ADHD, 34 SS, 21 RTT, 40 TD; age M 9.4 ± SD 4.2) underwent a standardized evaluation for stress related to parenting through the self-report questionnaire, Parental Stress Index-Short Form (PSI-SF). The main findings show greater levels of parental stress—mainly linked to child behavioral characteristics rather than parental sense of competence—in parents of children affected by a disability in comparison to children with typical development. This study highlights the need to support not only individuals with special needs but also their own caregivers: core figures in the management and outcome of children disorders.</p>

	<p>Operculo-insular epilepsy (OIE) is an under-recognized condition that can mimic temporal and extratemporal epilepsies. Previous studies have revealed structural connectivity changes in the epileptic network of focal epilepsy. However, most reports use the debated streamline-count to quantify ‘connectivity strength’ and rely on standard tracking algorithms. We propose a sophisticated cutting-edge method that is robust to crossing fibers, optimizes cortical coverage, and assigns an accurate microstructure-reflecting quantitative conectivity marker, namely the COMMIT (Convex Optimization Modeling for Microstructure Informed Tractography)-weight. Using our pipeline, we report the connectivity alterations in OIE. COMMIT-weighted matrices were created in all participants (nine patients with OIE, eight patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), and 22 healthy controls (HC)). In the OIE group, widespread increases in ‘connectivity strength’ were observed bilaterally. In OIE patients, ‘hyperconnections’ were observed between the insula and the pregenual cingulate gyrus (OIE group vs. HC group) and between insular subregions (OIE vs. TLE). Graph theoretic analyses revealed higher connectivity within insular subregions of OIE patients (OIE vs. TLE). We reveal, for the first time, the structural connectivity distribution in OIE. The observed pattern of connectivity in OIE likely reflects a diffuse epileptic network incorporating insular-connected regions and may represent a structural signature and diagnostic biomarker.</p>

                <p>The study of RNA modifications in large clinical cohorts can reveal relationships between the epitranscriptome and human diseases, although this is especially challenging. We developed ModTect (<A HREF="https://github.com/ktan8/ModTect">https://github.com/ktan8/ModTect</A>), a statistical framework to identify RNA modifications de novo by standard RNA-sequencing with deletion and mis-incorporation signals. We show that ModTect can identify both known (<I>N</I><sup>1</sup>-methyladenosine) and previously unknown types of mRNA modifications (<I>N</I><sup>2</sup>,<I>N</I><sup>2</sup>-dimethylguanosine) at nucleotide-resolution. Applying ModTect to 11,371 patient samples and 934 cell lines across 33 cancer types, we show that the epitranscriptome was dysregulated in patients across multiple cancer types and was additionally associated with cancer progression and survival outcomes. Some types of RNA modification were also more disrupted than others in patients with cancer. Moreover, RNA modifications contribute to multiple types of RNA-DNA sequence differences, which unexpectedly escape detection by Sanger sequencing. ModTect can thus be used to discover associations between RNA modifications and clinical outcomes in patient cohorts.</p>

                <p>DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair is initiated by MRE11 nuclease for both homology-directed repair (HDR) and alternative end joining (Alt-EJ). Here, we found that GRB2, crucial to timely proliferative RAS/MAPK pathway activation, unexpectedly forms a biophysically validated GRB2-MRE11 (GM) complex for efficient HDR initiation. GRB2-SH2 domain targets the GM complex to phosphorylated H2AX at DSBs. GRB2 K109 ubiquitination by E3 ubiquitin ligase RBBP6 releases MRE11 promoting HDR. RBBP6 depletion results in prolonged GM complex and HDR defects. GRB2 knockout increased MRE11-XRCC1 complex and Alt-EJ. Reconstitution with separation-of-function GRB2 mutant caused HDR deficiency and synthetic lethality with PARP inhibitor. Cell and cancer genome analyses suggest biomarkers of low GRB2 for noncanonical HDR deficiency and high MRE11 and GRB2 expression for worse survival in HDR-proficient patients. These findings establish GRB2&rsquo;s role in binding, targeting, and releasing MRE11 to promote efficient HDR over Alt-EJ DSB repair, with implications for genome stability and cancer biology.</p>

                <p>Posttranscriptional gene silencing (PTGS) is a regulatory mechanism to suppress undesired transcripts. Here, we identified <I>Flowering locus VE</I> (<I>FVE</I>), a well-known epigenetic component, as a new player in cytoplasmic PTGS. Loss-of-function <I>fve</I> mutations substantially reduced the accumulation of transgene-derived small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). FVE interacts with suppressor of gene silencing 3 (SGS3), a master component in PTGS. FVE promotes SGS3 homodimerization that is essential for its function. FVE can bind to single-stranded RNA and double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) with moderate affinities, while its truncated form FVE-8 has a significantly increased binding affinity to dsRNA. These affinities affect the association and channeling of SGS3-RNA to downstream dsRNA binding protein 4 (DRB4)/Dicer-like protein 2/4 (DCL2/4) complexes. Hence, FVE, but not FVE-8, biochemically enhances the DRB4/DCL2/4 activity in vitro. We surmise that FVE promotes production of transgene-derived siRNAs through concertedly tuning SGS3-DRB4/DCL2/4 functions. Thus, this study revealed a noncanonical role of FVE in PTGS.</p>

                <p>Eukaryotic initiation factor 4A-III (eIF4A3), a core helicase component of the exon junction complex, is essential for splicing, mRNA trafficking, and nonsense-mediated decay processes emerging as targets in cancer therapy. Here, we unravel eIF4A3&rsquo;s tumor-promoting function by demonstrating its role in ribosome biogenesis (RiBi) and p53 (de)regulation. Mechanistically, eIF4A3 resides in nucleoli within the small subunit processome and regulates rRNA processing via R-loop clearance. <I>EIF4A3</I> depletion induces cell cycle arrest through impaired RiBi checkpoint&ndash;mediated p53 induction and reprogrammed translation of cell cycle regulators. Multilevel omics analysis following <I>eIF4A3</I> depletion pinpoints pathways of cell death regulation and translation of alternative mouse double minute homolog 2 (<I>MDM2</I>) transcript isoforms that control p53. EIF4A3 expression and subnuclear localization among clinical cancer specimens correlate with the RiBi status rendering eIF4A3 an exploitable vulnerability in high-RiBi tumors. We propose a concept of eIF4A3&rsquo;s unexpected role in RiBi, with implications for cancer pathogenesis and treatment.</p>

                <p>Cement is the most produced material in the world. A major player in greenhouse gas emissions, it is the main binding agent in concrete, providing a cohesive strength that rapidly increases during setting. Understanding how such cohesion emerges is a major obstacle to advances in cement science and technology. Here, we combine computational statistical mechanics and theory to demonstrate how cement cohesion arises from the organization of interlocked ions and water, progressively confined in nanoslits between charged surfaces of calcium-silicate-hydrates. Because of the water/ions interlocking, dielectric screening is drastically reduced and ionic correlations are proven notably stronger than previously thought, dictating the evolution of nanoscale interactions during cement hydration. By developing a quantitative analytical prediction of cement cohesion based on Coulombic forces, we reconcile a fundamental understanding of cement hydration with the fully atomistic description of the solid cement paste and open new paths for scientific design of construction materials.</p>

Our results demonstrated that BCG vaccination resulted in diminished plasma levels of types 1, 2, and 17 and other proinflammatory cytokines and type 1 interferons. BCG vaccination also resulted in decreased plasma levels of CC, CXC chemokines, APPs, MMPs, and growth factors. Plasma levels of the aforementioned parameters were significantly lower in vaccinated individuals when compared to unvaccinated control individuals. Thus, our study demonstrates the immunomodulatory properties of BCG vaccination and suggests its potential utility in nonspecific vaccination of COVID-19 by down-modulating pathogenic inflammatory responses.</p>

                <p>Cointegration of multistate single-transistor neurons and synapses was demonstrated for highly scalable neuromorphic hardware, using nanoscale complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) fabrication. The neurons and synapses were integrated on the same plane with the same process because they have the same structure of a metal-oxide semiconductor field-effect transistor with different functions such as homotype. By virtue of 100% CMOS compatibility, it was also realized to cointegrate the neurons and synapses with additional CMOS circuits. Such cointegration can enhance packing density, reduce chip cost, and simplify fabrication procedures. The multistate single-transistor neuron that can control neuronal inhibition and the firing threshold voltage was achieved for an energy-efficient and reliable neural network. Spatiotemporal neuronal functionalities are demonstrated with fabricated single-transistor neurons and synapses. Image processing for letter pattern recognition and face image recognition is performed using experimental-based neuromorphic simulation.</p>

                <p>Slow slip events (SSEs) represent a slow faulting process leading to aseismic strain release often accompanied by seismic tremor or earthquake swarms. The larger SSEs last longer and are often associated with intense and energetic tremor activity, suggesting that aseismic slip controls tremor genesis. A similar pattern has been observed for SSEs that trigger earthquake swarms, although no comparative studies exist on the source parameters of SSEs and tremor or earthquake swarms. We analyze the source scaling of SSEs and associated tremor- or swarm-like seismicity through our newly compiled dataset. We find a correlation between the aseismic and seismic moment release indicating that the shallower SSEs produce larger seismic moment release than deeper SSEs. The scaling may arise from the heterogeneous frictional and rheological properties of faults prone to SSEs and is mainly controlled by temperature. Our results indicate that similar physical phenomena govern tremor and earthquake swarms during SSEs.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">Early evidence for historical overfishing in the Gulf of Mexico</a></h4>

              
                <p>Fisheries encompass complex interplays between social, economic, and environmental factors, but limitations on historical fisheries data can hamper efforts to identify and contextualize the long-term spatiotemporal patterns that shape them. We integrate 2500 years of stable isotope (<sup>34</sup>S, <sup>13</sup>C, and <sup>15</sup>N) and zooarchaeological evidence from Gulf of Mexico fisheries to assess cultural, demographic, and technological changes affecting sheepshead (<I>Archosargus probatocephalus</I>) populations and fishing practices in Louisiana, USA. Concurrent with human population growth, average sizes of sheepshead caught decreased from the 1720s to 1830s. The size of fish caught after the 1830s increased to pre-1720 levels at the same time that isotopic compositions of fish bone collagen show that fish were being caught from a more diverse range of ecosystems, including distant seagrass beds. Our findings provide the first evidence for large-scale depressions of historical sheepshead populations and the processes driving them, including rapid human population growth and sustained harvesting pressure.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">Efficient energy transport in an organic semiconductor mediated by transient exciton delocalization</a></h4>

              
                <p>Efficient energy transport is desirable in organic semiconductor (OSC) devices. However, photogenerated excitons in OSC films mostly occupy highly localized states, limiting exciton diffusion coefficients to below ~10<sup>&ndash;2</sup> cm<sup>2</sup>/s and diffusion lengths below ~50 nm. We use ultrafast optical microscopy and nonadiabatic molecular dynamics simulations to study well-ordered poly(3-hexylthiophene) nanofiber films prepared using living crystallization-driven self-assembly, and reveal a highly efficient energy transport regime: transient exciton delocalization, where energy exchange with vibrational modes allows excitons to temporarily re-access spatially extended states under equilibrium conditions. We show that this enables exciton diffusion constants up to 1.1 &plusmn; 0.1 cm<sup>2</sup>/s and diffusion lengths of 300 &plusmn; 50 nm. Our results reveal the dynamic interplay between localized and delocalized exciton configurations at equilibrium conditions, calling for a re-evaluation of exciton dynamics and suggesting design rules to engineer efficient energy transport in OSC device architectures not based on restrictive bulk heterojunctions.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">Oxygen-deficient metal oxides supported nano-intermetallic InNi3C0.5 toward efficient CO2 hydrogenation to methanol</a></h4>

              
                <p>Direct CO<SUB>2</SUB> hydrogenation to methanol using renewable energy&ndash;generated hydrogen is attracting intensive attention, but qualifying catalysts represents a grand challenge. Pure-/multi-metallic systems used for this task usually have low catalytic activity. Here, we tailored a highly active and selective InNi<SUB>3</SUB>C<SUB>0.5</SUB>/ZrO<SUB>2</SUB> catalyst by tuning the performance-relevant electronic metal-support interaction (EMSI), which is tightly linked with the ZrO<SUB>2</SUB> type&ndash;dependent oxygen deficiency. Highly oxygen-deficient monoclinic-ZrO<SUB>2</SUB> support imparts high electron density to InNi<SUB>3</SUB>C<SUB>0.5</SUB> because of the considerably enhanced EMSI, thereby enabling InNi<SUB>3</SUB>C<SUB>0.5</SUB>/monoclinic-ZrO<SUB>2</SUB> with an intrinsic activity three or two times as high as that of InNi<SUB>3</SUB>C<SUB>0.5</SUB>/amorphous-ZrO<SUB>2</SUB> or InNi<SUB>3</SUB>C<SUB>0.5</SUB>/tetragonal-ZrO<SUB>2</SUB>. The EMSI-governed catalysis observed in the InNi<SUB>3</SUB>C<SUB>0.5</SUB>/ZrO<SUB>2</SUB> system is extendable to other oxygen-deficient metal oxides, in particular InNi<SUB>3</SUB>C<SUB>0.5</SUB>/Fe<SUB>3</SUB>O<SUB>4</SUB>, achieving 25.7% CO<SUB>2</SUB> conversion with 90.2% methanol selectivity at 325&deg;C, 6.0 MPa, 36,000 ml g<SUB>cat</SUB><sup>&ndash;1</sup> hour<sup>&ndash;1</sup>, and H<SUB>2</SUB>/CO<SUB>2</SUB> = 10:1. This affordable catalyst is stable for at least 500 hours and is also highly resistant to sulfur poisoning.</p>

                <p>Determining the presence or absence of a past long-lived lunar magnetic field is crucial for understanding how the Moon&rsquo;s interior and surface evolved. Here, we show that Apollo impact glass associated with a young 2 million&ndash;year&ndash;old crater records a strong Earth-like magnetization, providing evidence that impacts can impart intense signals to samples recovered from the Moon and other planetary bodies. Moreover, we show that silicate crystals bearing magnetic inclusions from Apollo samples formed at ~3.9, 3.6, 3.3, and 3.2 billion years ago are capable of recording strong core dynamo&ndash;like fields but do not. Together, these data indicate that the Moon did not have a long-lived core dynamo. As a result, the Moon was not sheltered by a sustained paleomagnetosphere, and the lunar regolith should hold buried <sup>3</sup>He, water, and other volatile resources acquired from solar winds and Earth&rsquo;s magnetosphere over some 4 billion years.</p>

                <p>Host antibody responses are pivotal for providing protection against infectious agents. We have pioneered a new class of self-assembling micelles based on pentablock copolymers that enhance antibody responses while providing a low inflammatory environment compared to traditional adjuvants. This type of "just-right" immune response is critical in the rational design of vaccines for older adults. Here, we report on the mechanism of enhancement of antibody responses by pentablock copolymer micelles, which act as scaffolds for antigen presentation to B cells and cross-link B cell receptors, unlike other micelle-forming synthetic block copolymers. We exploited this unique mechanism and developed these scaffolds as a platform technology to produce antibodies in vitro. We show that this novel approach can be used to generate laboratory-scale quantities of therapeutic antibodies against multiple antigens, including those associated with SARS-CoV-2 and <I>Yersinia pestis</I>, further expanding the value of these nanomaterials to rapidly develop countermeasures against infectious diseases.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">The Genome-Wide Binding Profile for Human RE1 Silencing Transcription Factor Unveils a Unique Genetic Circuitry in Hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                <p>Early studies in mouse neurodevelopment led to the discovery of the RE1 Silencing Transcription Factor (REST) and its role as a master repressor of neuronal gene expression. Recently, REST was reported to also repress neuronal genes in the human adult brain. These genes were found to be involved in pro-apoptotic pathways; and their repression, associated with increased REST levels during aging, were found to be neuroprotective and conserved across species. However, direct genome-wide REST binding profiles for REST in adult brain have not been identified for any species. Here, we apply this approach to mouse and human hippocampus. We find an expansion of REST binding sites in the human hippocampus that are lacking in both mouse hippocampus and other human non-neuronal cell types. The unique human REST binding sites are associated with genes involved in innate immunity processes and inflammation signaling which, on the basis of histology and recent public transcriptomic analyses, suggest that these new target genes are repressed in glia. We propose that the increases in REST expression in mid-adulthood presage the beginning of brain aging, and that human REST function has evolved to protect the longevity and function of both neurons and glia in human brain.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The RE1 Silencing Transcription Factor (REST) repressor has served historically as a model for gene regulation during mouse neurogenesis. Recent studies of REST have also suggested a conserved role for REST repressor function across lower species during aging. However, direct genome-wide studies for REST have been lacking for human brain. Here, we perform the first genome-wide analysis of REST binding in both human and mouse hippocampus. The majority of REST-occupied genes in human hippocampus are distinct from those in mouse. Further, the REST-associated genes unique to human hippocampus represent a new set related to innate immunity and inflammation, where their gene dysregulation has been implicated in aging-related neuropathology, such as Alzheimer's disease.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Mitochondrial Proteostasis Requires Genes Encoded in a Neurodevelopmental Syndrome Locus</a></h4>

              
                <p>Eukaryotic cells maintain proteostasis through mechanisms that require cytoplasmic and mitochondrial translation. Genetic defects affecting cytoplasmic translation perturb synapse development, neurotransmission, and are causative of neurodevelopmental disorders, such as Fragile X syndrome. In contrast, there is little indication that mitochondrial proteostasis, either in the form of mitochondrial protein translation and/or degradation, is required for synapse development and function. Here we focus on two genes deleted in a recurrent copy number variation causing neurodevelopmental disorders, the 22q11.2 microdeletion syndrome. We demonstrate that SLC25A1 and MRPL40, two genes present in the microdeleted segment and whose products localize to mitochondria, interact and are necessary for mitochondrial ribosomal integrity and proteostasis. Our <I>Drosophila</I> studies show that mitochondrial ribosome function is necessary for synapse neurodevelopment, function, and behavior. We propose that mitochondrial proteostasis perturbations, either by genetic or environmental factors, are a pathogenic mechanism for neurodevelopmental disorders.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The balance between cytoplasmic protein synthesis and degradation, or cytoplasmic proteostasis, is required for normal synapse function and neurodevelopment. Cytoplasmic and mitochondrial ribosomes are necessary for two compartmentalized, yet interdependent, forms of proteostasis. Proteostasis dependent on cytoplasmic ribosomes is a well-established target of genetic defects that cause neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism. Here we show that the mitochondrial ribosome is a neurodevelopmentally regulated organelle whose function is required for synapse development and function. We propose that defective mitochondrial proteostasis is a mechanism with the potential to contribute to neurodevelopmental disease.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Pioneer Axons Utilize a Dcc Signaling-Mediated Invasion Brake to Precisely Complete Their Pathfinding Odyssey</a></h4>

              
                <p>Axons navigate through the embryo to construct a functional nervous system. A missing part of the axon navigation puzzle is how a single axon traverses distinct anatomic choice points through its navigation. The dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons experience such choice points. First, they navigate to the dorsal root entry zone (DREZ), then halt navigation in the peripheral nervous system to invade the spinal cord, and then reinitiate navigation inside the CNS. Here, we used time-lapse super-resolution imaging in zebrafish DRG pioneer neurons to investigate how embryonic axons control their cytoskeleton to navigate to and invade at the correct anatomic position. We found that invadopodia components form in the growth cone even during filopodia-based navigation, but only stabilize when the axon is at the spinal cord entry location. Further, we show that intermediate levels of DCC and cAMP, as well as Rac1 activation, subsequently engage an axon invasion brake. Our results indicate that actin-based invadopodia components form in the growth cone and disruption of the invasion brake causes axon entry defects and results in failed behavioral responses, thereby demonstrating the importance of regulating distinct actin populations during navigational challenges.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Correct spatiotemporal navigation of neuronal growth cones is dependent on extracellular navigational cues and growth cone dynamics. Here, we link <I>dcc</I>-mediated signaling to actin-based invadopodia and filopodia dynamics during pathfinding and entry into the spinal cord using an <I>in vivo</I> model of dorsal root ganglia (DRG) sensory axons. We reveal a molecularly-controlled brake on invadopodia stabilization until the sensory neuron growth cone is present at the dorsal root entry zone (DREZ), which is ultimately essential for growth cone entry into the spinal cord and behavioral response.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">The Axonal Glycolytic Pathway Contributes to Sensory Axon Extension and Growth Cone Dynamics</a></h4>

              
                <p>Understanding the bioenergetics of axon extension and maintenance has wide ranging implications for neurodevelopment and disease states. Glycolysis is a pathway consisting of 10 enzymes and separated into preparatory and payoff phases, the latter producing ATP. Using embryonic chicken sensory neurons, we report that glycolytic enzymes are found through the axon and the growth cone. Pharmacological inhibition of glycolysis in the presence of NGF impairs axon extension and growth cone dynamics within minutes without affecting axon maintenance. Experiments using microfluidic chambers show that the effect of inhibiting glycolysis on axon extension is local along distal axons and can be reversed by promoting mitochondrial respiration. Knockdown of GAPDH simplifies growth cone morphology and is rescued by shRNA-resistant GAPDH expression. Rescue of GAPDH using KillerRed fused to GAPDH followed by localized chromophore-assisted light inactivation of KillerRed-GAPDH in distal axons halts growth cone dynamics. Considering filament polymerization requires ATP, inhibition of glycolysis results in a paradoxical increase in axonal actin filament levels. The effect on actin filaments is because of enzymes before GAPDH, the first enzyme in the payoff phase. In the absence of NGF, inhibition of glycolysis along distal axons results in axon degeneration independent of cell death. These data indicate that the glycolytic pathway is operative in distal axons and contributes to the rate of axon extension and growth cone dynamics in the presence of NGF and that, in the absence of NGF, the axonal glycolytic pathway is required for axon maintenance.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Elucidation of the sources of ATP required for axon extension and maintenance has implications for understanding the mechanism of neuronal development and diseases of the nervous system. While recent work has emphasized the importance of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, the role of the glycolytic pathway in axon morphogenesis and maintenance remains minimally understood. The data reveal that the glycolytic pathway is required for normal sensory axon extension in the presence of NGF, while in the absence of NGF the glycolytic pathway is required for axon maintenance. The results have implications for the understanding of the bioenergetics of axon morphogenesis and plasticity and indicate that NGF has protective effects on sensory axon maintenance in hypoglycemic states.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">The Rac-GAP alpha2-Chimaerin Signals via CRMP2 and Stathmins in the Development of the Ocular Motor System</a></h4>

              
                <p>A precise sequence of axon guidance events is required for the development of the ocular motor system. Three cranial nerves grow toward, and connect with, six extraocular muscles in a stereotyped pattern, to control eye movements. The signaling protein alpha2-chimaerin (&alpha;2-CHN) plays a pivotal role in the formation of the ocular motor system; mutations in <I>CHN1</I>, encoding &alpha;2-CHN, cause the human eye movement disorder Duane Retraction Syndrome (DRS). Our research has demonstrated that the manipulation of &alpha;2-chn signaling in the zebrafish embryo leads to ocular motor axon wiring defects, although the signaling cascades regulated by &alpha;2-chn remain poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that several cytoskeletal regulatory proteins&mdash;collapsin response mediator protein 2 (CRMP2; encoded by the gene <I>dpysl2</I>), stathmin1, and stathmin 2&mdash;bind to &alpha;2-CHN. <I>dpysl2</I>, <I>stathmin1</I>, and especially <I>stathmin2</I> are expressed by ocular motor neurons. We find that the manipulation of <I>dpysl2</I> and of <I>stathmins</I> in zebrafish larvae leads to defects in both the axon wiring of the ocular motor system and the optokinetic reflex, impairing horizontal eye movements. Knockdowns of these molecules in zebrafish larvae of either sex caused axon guidance phenotypes that included defasciculation and ectopic branching; in some cases, these phenotypes were reminiscent of DRS. <I>chn1</I> knock-down phenotypes were rescued by the overexpression of CRMP2 and STMN1, suggesting that these proteins act in the same signaling pathway. These findings suggest that CRMP2 and stathmins signal downstream of &alpha;2-CHN to orchestrate ocular motor axon guidance and to control eye movements.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The precise control of eye movements is crucial for the life of vertebrate animals, including humans. In humans, this control depends on the arrangement of nerve wiring of the ocular motor system, composed of three nerves and six muscles, a system that is conserved across vertebrate phyla. Mutations in the protein alpha2-chimaerin have previously been shown to cause eye movement disorders (squint) and axon wiring defects in humans. Our recent work has unraveled how alpha2-chimaerin coordinates axon guidance of the ocular motor system in animal models. In this article, we demonstrate key roles for the proteins CRMP2 and stathmin 1/2 in the signaling pathway orchestrated by alpha2-chimaerin, potentially giving insight into the etiology of eye movement disorders in humans.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">On the Role of Arkypallidal and Prototypical Neurons for Phase Transitions in the External Pallidum</a></h4>

              
                <p>The external pallidum (globus pallidus pars externa [GPe]) plays a central role for basal ganglia functions and dynamics and, consequently, has been included in most computational studies of the basal ganglia. These studies considered the GPe as a homogeneous neural population. However, experimental studies have shown that the GPe contains at least two distinct cell types (prototypical and arkypallidal cells). In this work, we provide <I>in silico</I> insight into how pallidal heterogeneity modulates dynamic regimes inside the GPe and how they affect the GPe response to oscillatory input. We derive a mean-field model of the GPe system from a microscopic spiking neural network of recurrently coupled prototypical and arkypallidal neurons. Using bifurcation analysis, we examine the influence of dopamine-dependent changes of intrapallidal connectivity on the GPe dynamics. We find that increased self-inhibition of prototypical cells can induce oscillations, whereas increased inhibition of prototypical cells by arkypallidal cells leads to the emergence of a bistable regime. Furthermore, we show that oscillatory input to the GPe, arriving from striatum, leads to characteristic patterns of cross-frequency coupling observed at the GPe. Based on these findings, we propose two different hypotheses of how dopamine depletion at the GPe may lead to phase-amplitude coupling between the parkinsonian beta rhythm and a GPe-intrinsic  rhythm. Finally, we show that these findings generalize to realistic spiking neural networks of sparsely coupled Type I excitable GPe neurons.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Our work provides (1) insight into the theoretical implications of a dichotomous globus pallidus pars externa (GPe) organization, and (2) an exact mean-field model that allows for future investigations of the relationship between GPe spiking activity and local field potential fluctuations. We identify the major phase transitions that the GPe can undergo when subject to static or periodic input and link these phase transitions to the emergence of synchronized oscillations and cross-frequency coupling in the basal ganglia. Because of the close links between our model and experimental findings on the structure and dynamics of prototypical and arkypallidal cells, our results can be used to guide both experimental and computational studies on the role of the GPe for basal ganglia dynamics in health and disease.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">No Evidence for Entrainment: Endogenous Gamma Oscillations and Rhythmic Flicker Responses Coexist in Visual Cortex</a></h4>

              
                <p>Over the past decades, numerous studies have linked cortical gamma oscillations (~30&ndash;100 Hz) to neurocomputational mechanisms. Their functional relevance, however, is still passionately debated. Here, we asked whether endogenous gamma oscillations in the human brain can be entrained by a rhythmic photic drive &gt;50 Hz. Such a noninvasive modulation of endogenous brain rhythms would allow conclusions about their causal involvement in neurocognition. To this end, we systematically investigated oscillatory responses to a rapid sinusoidal flicker in the absence and presence of endogenous gamma oscillations using magnetoencephalography (MEG) in combination with a high-frequency projector. The photic drive produced a robust response over visual cortex to stimulation frequencies of up to 80 Hz. Strong, endogenous gamma oscillations were induced using moving grating stimuli as repeatedly done in previous research. When superimposing the flicker and the gratings, there was no evidence for phase or frequency entrainment of the endogenous gamma oscillations by the photic drive. Unexpectedly, we did not observe an amplification of the flicker response around participants' individual gamma frequencies (IGFs); rather, the magnitude of the response decreased monotonically with increasing frequency. Source reconstruction suggests that the flicker response and the gamma oscillations were produced by separate, coexistent generators in visual cortex. The presented findings challenge the notion that cortical gamma oscillations can be entrained by rhythmic visual stimulation. Instead, the mechanism generating endogenous gamma oscillations seems to be resilient to external perturbation.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> We aimed to investigate to what extent ongoing, high-frequency oscillations in the gamma-band (30&ndash;100 Hz) in the human brain can be entrained by a visual flicker. Gamma oscillations have long been suggested to coordinate neuronal firing and enable interregional communication. Our results demonstrate that rhythmic visual stimulation cannot hijack the dynamics of ongoing gamma oscillations; rather, the flicker response and the endogenous gamma oscillations coexist in different visual areas. Therefore, while a visual flicker evokes a strong neuronal response even at high frequencies in the gamma-band, it does not entrain endogenous gamma oscillations in visual cortex. This has important implications for interpreting studies investigating the causal and neuroprotective effects of rhythmic sensory stimulation in the gamma-band.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Paraventricular Nucleus Oxytocin Subsystems Promote Active Paternal Behaviors in Mandarin Voles</a></h4>

              
                <p>Paternal care plays a critical role in the development of brain and behaviors in offspring in monogamous species. However, the neurobiological mechanisms, especially the neuronal circuity, underlying paternal care is largely unknown. Using socially monogamous male mandarin voles (<I>Microtus mandarinus</I>) with high levels of paternal care, we found that paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN) to ventral tegmental area (VTA) or nucleus accumbens (NAc) oxytocin (OT) neurons are activated during paternal care. Chemogenetic activation/inhibition of the PVN OT projection to VTA promoted/decreased paternal care, respectively. Chemogenetic inhibition of the PVN to VTA OT pathway reduced dopamine (DA) release in the NAc of male mandarin voles during licking and grooming of pups as revealed by <I>in vivo</I> fiber photometry. Optogenetic activation/inhibition of the VTA to NAc DA pathway possibly enhanced/suppressed paternal behaviors, respectively. Furthermore, chemogenetic activation/inhibition of PVN to NAc OT circuit enhanced/inhibited paternal care. This finding is a first step toward delineating the neuronal circuity underlying paternal care and may have implications for treating abnormalities in paternal care associated with paternal postpartum depression or paternal abuse.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Paternal behavior is essential for offspring survival and development in some mammalian species. However, the circuit mechanisms underlying the paternal brain are poorly understood. We show that manipulation of paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN) to ventral tegmental area (VTA) oxytocin (OT) projections as well as VTA to nucleus accumbens (NAc) DA projections promote paternal behaviors. Inhibition the PVN to VTA OT pathway reduces DA release in the NAc during pup licking and grooming. PVN to NAc OT circuit is also essential for paternal behaviors. Our findings identify two new neural circuits that modulate paternal behaviors.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Human Hippocampal Neurons Track Moments in a Sequence of Events</a></h4>

              
                <p>An indispensable feature of episodic memory is our ability to temporally piece together different elements of an experience into a coherent memory. Hippocampal time cells&mdash;neurons that represent temporal information&mdash;may play a critical role in this process. Although these cells have been repeatedly found in rodents, it is still unclear to what extent similar temporal selectivity exists in the human hippocampus. Here, we show that temporal context modulates the firing activity of human hippocampal neurons during structured temporal experiences. We recorded neuronal activity in the human brain while patients of either sex learned predictable sequences of pictures. We report that human time cells fire at successive moments in this task. Furthermore, time cells also signaled inherently changing temporal contexts during empty 10 s gap periods between trials while participants waited for the task to resume. Finally, population activity allowed for decoding temporal epoch identity, both during sequence learning and during the gap periods. These findings suggest that human hippocampal neurons could play an essential role in temporally organizing distinct moments of an experience in episodic memory.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Episodic memory refers to our ability to remember the what, where, and when of a past experience. Representing time is an important component of this form of memory. Here, we show that neurons in the human hippocampus represent temporal information. This temporal signature was observed both when participants were actively engaged in a memory task, as well as during 10-s-long gaps when they were asked to wait before performing the task. Furthermore, the activity of the population of hippocampal cells allowed for decoding one temporal epoch from another. These results suggest a robust representation of time in the human hippocampus.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Neural Encoding of Auditory Statistics</a></h4>

              
                <p>The human brain extracts statistical regularities embedded in real-world scenes to sift through the complexity stemming from changing dynamics and entwined uncertainty along multiple perceptual dimensions (e.g., pitch, timbre, location). While there is evidence that sensory dynamics along different auditory dimensions are tracked independently by separate cortical networks, how these statistics are integrated to give rise to unified objects remains unknown, particularly in dynamic scenes that lack conspicuous coupling between features. Using tone sequences with stochastic regularities along spectral and spatial dimensions, this study examines behavioral and electrophysiological responses from human listeners (male and female) to changing statistics in auditory sequences and uses a computational model of predictive Bayesian inference to formulate multiple hypotheses for statistical integration across features. Neural responses reveal multiplexed brain responses reflecting both local statistics along individual features in frontocentral networks, together with global (object-level) processing in centroparietal networks. Independent tracking of local surprisal along each acoustic feature reveals linear modulation of neural responses, while global melody-level statistics follow a nonlinear integration of statistical beliefs across features to guide perception. Near identical results are obtained in separate experiments along spectral and spatial acoustic dimensions, suggesting a common mechanism for statistical inference in the brain. Potential variations in statistical integration strategies and memory deployment shed light on individual variability between listeners in terms of behavioral efficacy and fidelity of neural encoding of stochastic change in acoustic sequences.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The world around us is complex and ever changing: in everyday listening, sound sources evolve along multiple dimensions, such as pitch, timbre, and spatial location, and they exhibit emergent statistical properties that change over time. In the face of this complexity, the brain builds an internal representation of the external world by collecting statistics from the sensory input along multiple dimensions. Using a Bayesian predictive inference model, this work considers alternative hypotheses for how statistics are combined across sensory dimensions. Behavioral and neural responses from human listeners show the brain multiplexes two representations, where local statistics along each feature linearly affect neural responses, and global statistics nonlinearly combine statistical beliefs across dimensions to shape perception of stochastic auditory sequences.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Noise Correlations for Faster and More Robust Learning</a></h4>

              
                <p>Distributed population codes are ubiquitous in the brain and pose a challenge to downstream neurons that must learn an appropriate readout. Here we explore the possibility that this learning problem is simplified through inductive biases implemented by stimulus-independent noise correlations that constrain learning to task-relevant dimensions. We test this idea in a set of neural networks that learn to perform a perceptual discrimination task. Correlations among similarly tuned units were manipulated independently of an overall population signal-to-noise ratio to test how the format of stored information affects learning. Higher noise correlations among similarly tuned units led to faster and more robust learning, favoring homogenous weights assigned to neurons within a functionally similar pool, and could emerge through Hebbian learning. When multiple discriminations were learned simultaneously, noise correlations across relevant feature dimensions sped learning, whereas those across irrelevant feature dimensions slowed it. Our results complement the existing theory on noise correlations by demonstrating that when such correlations are produced without significant degradation of the signal-to-noise ratio, they can improve the speed of readout learning by constraining it to appropriate dimensions.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Positive noise correlations between similarly tuned neurons theoretically reduce the representational capacity of the brain, yet they are commonly observed, emerge dynamically in complex tasks, and persist even in well-trained animals. Here we show that such correlations, when embedded in a neural population with a fixed signal-to-noise ratio, can improve the speed and robustness with which an appropriate readout is learned. In a simple discrimination task such correlations can emerge naturally through Hebbian learning. In more complex tasks that require multiple discriminations, correlations between neurons that similarly encode the task-relevant feature improve learning by constraining it to the appropriate task dimension.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">4R Tau Modulates Cocaine-Associated Memory through Adult Dorsal Hippocampal Neurogenesis</a></h4>

              
                <p>The development, persistence and relapse of drug addiction require drug memory that generally develops with drug administration-paired contextual stimuli. Adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN) contributes to cocaine memory formation; however, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Male mice hippocampal expression of Tau was significantly decreased during the cocaine-associated memory formation. Genetic overexpression of four microtubule-binding repeats Tau (4R Tau) in the mice hippocampus disrupted cocaine memory by suppressing AHN. Furthermore, 4R Tau directly interacted with phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-p85 and impaired its nuclear translocation and PI3K-AKT signaling, processes required for hippocampal neuron proliferation. Collectively, 4R Tau modulates cocaine memory formation by disrupting AHN, suggesting a novel mechanism underlying cocaine memory formation and provide a new strategy for the treatment of cocaine addiction.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Drug memory that generally develops with drug-paired contextual stimuli and drug administration is critical for the development, persistence and relapse of drug addiction. Previous studies have suggested that adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN) plays a role in cocaine memory formation. Here, we showed that Tau was significantly downregulated in the hippocampus in the cocaine memory formation. Tau knock-out (KO) promoted AHN in the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG), resulting in the enhanced memory formation evoked by cocaine-cue stimuli. In contrast, genetically overexpressed 4R Tau in the hippocampus disrupted cocaine-cue memory by suppressing AHN. In addition, 4R Tau interacted directly with phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-p85 and hindered its nuclear translocation, eventually repressing PI3K-AKT signaling, which is essential for hippocampal neuronal proliferation.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Inhibition of Epigenetic Modifiers LSD1 and HDAC1 Blocks Rod Photoreceptor Death in Mouse Models of Retinitis Pigmentosa</a></h4>

              
                <p>Epigenetic modifiers are increasingly being investigated as potential therapeutics to modify and overcome disease phenotypes. Diseases of the nervous system present a particular problem as neurons are postmitotic and demonstrate relatively stable gene expression patterns and chromatin organization. We have explored the ability of epigenetic modifiers to prevent degeneration of rod photoreceptors in a mouse model of retinitis pigmentosa (RP), using rd10 mice of both sexes. The histone modification eraser enzymes lysine demethylase 1 (LSD1) and histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) are known to have dramatic effects on the development of rod photoreceptors. In the RP mouse model, inhibitors of these enzymes blocked rod degeneration, preserved vision, and affected the expression of multiple genes including maintenance of rod-specific transcripts and downregulation of those involved in inflammation, gliosis, and cell death. The neuroprotective activity of LSD1 inhibitors includes two pathways. First, through targeting histone modifications, they increase accessibility of chromatin and upregulate neuroprotective genes, such as from the Wnt pathway. We propose that this process is going in rod photoreceptors. Second, through nonhistone targets, they inhibit transcription of inflammatory genes and inflammation. This process is going in microglia, and lack of inflammation keeps rod photoreceptors alive.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Retinal degenerations are a leading cause of vision loss. RP is genetically very heterogeneous, and the multiple pathways leading to cell death are one reason for the slow progress in identifying suitable treatments for patients. Here we demonstrate that inhibition of LSD1and HDAC1 in a mouse model of RP leads to preservation of rod photoreceptors and visual function, retaining of expression of rod-specific genes, and with decreased inflammation, cell death, and Mu&#x0308;ller cell gliosis. We propose that these epigenetic inhibitors cause more open and accessible chromatin, allowing expression of neuroprotective genes. A second mechanism that allows rod photoreceptor survival is suppression of inflammation by epigenetic inhibitors in microglia. Manipulation of epigenetic modifiers is a new strategy to fight neurodegeneration in RP.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Educational interventions for shared decision making and the role of patient agency:  A Systematic Review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background:  Shared decision making is critical to patient-centered care and yet there is limited consensus on effective teaching approaches for training physicians in this domain. As a collaborative process in which the patient and physician co-create a decision, patient and relational agency may be important contributors and studies with patient-reported outcomes may identify successful approaches and determine gaps in pedagogy.  The authors conducted a systematic review of educational interventions for shared decision making, focusing on patient-reported outcomes and consideration of agency.  Methods:  Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, and Web of Science were searched for studies describing educational interventions with patient-level outcomes published between January 2000 and January 2020. Articles were excluded if they were not in English, included only patient interventions, or reported only physician outcomes.  Quality assessment was performed using the Medical Education Research Study Quality Instrument (MERSQI).  Data about the educational methods used were extracted and included studies were assessed for quality. Thematic analysis was performed to identify the potential role of agency. Results: 26 articles were identified describing 17 unique studies.  Educational interventions were diverse in duration and content, with multiple components.  Three-quarters of studies used role play or simulated patients and 82% included tools to facilitate shared decisions.  Although no articles explicitly discussed facilitating agency as a component of the intervention or as an outcome, one qualitative study demonstrated themes of patient and relational agency. Conclusions:  Educational interventions included small group discussion, decision aids, role play, and simulated patients, and improved a range of patient outcomes, but our study included only studies including practicing physicians, limiting applicability to trainees and other health care providers. Interventions have not included explicit instructional design around agency, but qualitative analyses demonstrated interventions may facilitate agency and shared decision making. Future instructional strategies should consider the complexity inherent in co-constructing decisions.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Using citation tracking for systematic literature searching - study protocol for a scoping review of methodological studies and a Delphi study [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Up-to-date guidance on comprehensive study identification for systematic reviews is crucial. According to current recommendations, systematic searching should combine electronic database searching with supplementary search methods. One such supplementary search method is citation tracking. It aims at collecting directly and/or indirectly cited and citing references from "seed references". Tailored and evidence-guided recommendations concerning the use of citation tracking are strongly needed. Objective: We intend to develop recommendations for the use of citation tracking in systematic literature searching for health-related topics. Our study will be guided by the following research questions: What is the benefit of citation tracking for systematic literature searching for health-related topics? Which methods, citation indexes, and other tools are used for citation tracking? What terminology is used for citation tracking methods? Methods: Our study will have two parts: a scoping review and a Delphi study. The scoping review aims at identifying methodological studies on the benefit and use of citation tracking in systematic literature searching for health-related topics with no restrictions on study design, language, and publication date. We will perform database searching in MEDLINE (Ovid), CINAHL (EBSCOhost), Web of Science Core Collection, two information science databases, web searching, and contact experts in the field. Two reviewers will independently perform study selection. We will conduct direct backward and forward citation tracking on included articles. Data from included studies will be extracted using a prespecified extraction sheet and presented in both tabular and narrative form. The results of the scoping review will inform the subsequent Delphi study through which we aim to derive consensus recommendations for the future practice and research of citation tracking.

                Biological agents and infectious pathogens have the potential to cause very significant harm, as the natural occurrence of disease and pandemics makes clear. As a way to better understand the risk of Global Catastrophic Biological Risks due to human activities, rather than natural sources, this paper reports on a dataset of 71 incidents involving either accidental or purposeful exposure to, or infection by, a highly infectious pathogenic agent. There has been significant effort put into both reducing the risk of purposeful spread of biological weapons, and biosafety intended to prevent the exposure to, or release of, dangerous pathogens in the course of research. Despite these efforts, there are incidents of various types that could potentially be controlled or eliminated by different lab and/or bioweapon research choices and safety procedures. The dataset of events presented here was compiled during a project conducted in 2019 to better understand biological risks from anthropic sources. The events which are listed are unrelated to clinical treatment of naturally occurring outbreaks, and are instead entirely the result of human decisions and mistakes. While the events cover a wide range of cases, the criteria used covers a variety of events previously scattered across academic, policy, and other unpublished or not generally available sources.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Deep geometric representations for modeling effects of mutations on protein-protein binding affinity</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Xianggen Liu, Yunan Luo, Pengyong Li, Sen Song, Jian Peng</p>

Modeling the impact of amino acid mutations on protein-protein interaction plays a crucial role in protein engineering and drug design. In this study, we develop GeoPPI, a novel structure-based deep-learning framework to predict the change of binding affinity upon mutations. Based on the three-dimensional structure of a protein, GeoPPI first learns a geometric representation that encodes topology features of the protein structure via a self-supervised learning scheme. These representations are then used as features for training gradient-boosting trees to predict the changes of protein-protein binding affinity upon mutations. We find that GeoPPI is able to learn meaningful features that characterize interactions between atoms in protein structures. In addition, through extensive experiments, we show that GeoPPI achieves new state-of-the-art performance in predicting the binding affinity changes upon both single- and multi-point mutations on six benchmark datasets. Moreover, we show that GeoPPI can accurately estimate the difference of binding affinities between a few recently identified SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S protein. These results demonstrate the potential of GeoPPI as a powerful and useful computational tool in protein design and engineering. Our code and datasets are available at: https://github.com/Liuxg16/GeoPPI.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">The unbiased estimation of the fraction of variance explained by a model</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Dean A. Pospisil, Wyeth Bair</p>

The correlation coefficient squared, <i>r</i><sup>2</sup>, is commonly used to validate quantitative models on neural data, yet it is biased by trial-to-trial variability: as trial-to-trial variability increases, measured correlation to a model’s predictions decreases. As a result, models that perfectly explain neural tuning can appear to perform poorly. Many solutions to this problem have been proposed, but no consensus has been reached on which is the least biased estimator. Some currently used methods substantially overestimate model fit, and the utility of even the best performing methods is limited by the lack of confidence intervals and asymptotic analysis. We provide a new estimator, r ^ ER 2, that outperforms all prior estimators in our testing, and we provide confidence intervals and asymptotic guarantees. We apply our estimator to a variety of neural data to validate its utility. We find that neural noise is often so great that confidence intervals of the estimator cover the entire possible range of values ([0, 1]), preventing meaningful evaluation of the quality of a model’s predictions. This leads us to propose the use of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) as a quality metric for making quantitative comparisons across neural recordings. Analyzing a variety of neural data sets, we find that up to ∼ 40% of some state-of-the-art neural recordings do not pass even a liberal SNR criterion. Moving toward more reliable estimates of correlation, and quantitatively comparing quality across recording modalities and data sets, will be critical to accelerating progress in modeling biological phenomena.

                <p>by Xing Zhang, Yamin Meng, Yizhou Huang, Dan Zhang, Weiguo Fang</p>

Pathogenic fungi precisely respond to dynamic microenvironments during infection, but the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. The insect pathogenic fungus <i>Metarhizium robertsii</i> is a representative fungus in which to study broad themes of fungal pathogenicity as it resembles some major plant and mammalian pathogenic fungi in its pathogenesis. Here we report on a novel cascade that regulates response of <i>M</i>. <i>robertsii</i> to 2 distinct microenvironments during its pathogenesis. On the insect cuticle, the transcription factor COH2 activates expression of cuticle penetration genes. In the hemocoel, the protein COH1 is expressed due to the reduction in epigenetic repression conferred by the histone deacetylase HDAC1 and the histone 3 acetyltransferase HAT1. COH1 interacts with COH2 to reduce COH2 stability, and this down-regulates cuticle penetration genes and up-regulates genes for hemocoel colonization. Our work significantly advances the insights into fungal pathogenicity in insects.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The purpose of this study was to identify disease relevant genes and explore underlying immunological mechanisms that contribute to early and late onset forms of myasthenia gravis.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We used a novel genomic methodology to integrate genomewide association study (GWAS) findings in myasthenia gravis with cell-type specific information, such as gene expression patterns and promotor-enhancer interactions, in order to identify disease-relevant genes. Subsequently, we conducted additional genomic investigations, including an expression quantitative analysis of 313 healthy people to provide mechanistic insights.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We identified several genes that were specifically linked to early onset myasthenia gravis including <i>TNIP1</i>, <i>ORMDL3</i>, <i>GSDMB</i>, and <i>TRAF3</i>. We showed that regulators of toll-like receptor 4 signaling were enriched among these early onset disease genes (fold enrichment = 3.85, <i>p</i> = 6.4 × 10<sup>−3</sup>). In contrast, T-cell regulators <i>CD28</i> and <i>CTLA4</i> were exclusively linked to late onset disease. We identified 2 causal genetic variants (rs231770 and rs231735; posterior probability = 0.98 and 0.91) near the <i>CTLA4</i> gene. Subsequently, we demonstrated that these causal variants result in low expression of <i>CTLA4</i> (rho = −0.66, <i>p</i> = 1.28 × 10<sup>−38</sup> and rho = −0.52, <i>p</i> = 7.01 × 10<sup>−22</sup>, for rs231735 and rs231770, respectively).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The disease-relevant genes identified in this study are a unique resource for many disciplines, including clinicians, scientists, and the pharmaceutical industry. The distinct immunological pathways linked to early and late onset myasthenia gravis carry important implications for drug repurposing opportunities and for future studies of drug development.

When modelling population demand, geographical weights with different distance decay coefficients can reflect diverse distance tolerances in facility utilization and could lead to erratic accessibility results. Quantifying accessibility as the sum of weighted supply-demand ratios can alleviate the distance decay coefficient's influence and generate stable geographic patterns. However, the effects of weighted ratios on different FCA models and resources have not been investigated. Methods: To identify impacts of weighted ratios on various FCA variants, this study contrasted the accessibility calculated from the sum of ratios (access) and the sum of weighted ratios (access ratios) within three prevalent FCA models: enhanced two-step FCA (E2SFCA), modified two-step FCA (M2SFCA), and three-step FCA (3SFCA). In addition, the accessibilities of various resources evaluate the stability of the weighted ratios' effect. This study therefore examined the accessibilities to primary schools, job opportunities, and major hospitals in Shanghai. Shanghai is a case study that provides lessons on using big data to measure accessibility in metropolitan areas. Results: Geographic weights can not only mitigate the impact of the distance decay coefficients, but can also eliminate model features,  which reduces the performance of the M2SFCA's supply decay and the 3SFCA's population demand adjustment in accessibility results. Moreover, weighted ratios tend to overestimate accessibility in marginal communities that lie within fewer catchments, regardless of the resource type. This tendency can lead to an epistemological trap that creates an inaccurate and counter-intuitive perception of resource distribution in a given area. Conclusions: The results identify a gap between the methodological logic and the empirical perception in accessibility measurements. This study concludes that the use of geographic weights needs to be cautious and epistemologically consistent.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Strategies for cellular deconvolution in human brain RNA sequencing data [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Statistical deconvolution strategies have emerged over the past decade to estimate the proportion of various cell populations in homogenate tissue sources like brain using gene expression data. However, no study has been undertaken to assess the extent to which expression-based and DNAm-based cell type composition estimates agree. Results: Using estimated neuronal fractions from DNAm data, from the same brain region (i.e., matched) as our bulk RNA-Seq dataset, as proxies for the true unobserved cell-type fractions (i.e., as the gold standard), we assessed the accuracy (RMSE) and concordance (R2) of four reference-based deconvolution algorithms: Houseman, CIBERSORT, non-negative least squares (NNLS)/MIND, and MuSiC. We did this for two cell-type populations - neurons and non-neurons/glia - using matched single nuclei RNA-Seq and mismatched single cell RNA-Seq reference datasets. With the mismatched single cell RNA-Seq reference dataset, Houseman, MuSiC, and NNLS produced concordant (high correlation; Houseman R2 = 0.51, 95% CI [0.39, 0.65]; MuSiC R2 = 0.56, 95% CI [0.43, 0.69]; NNLS R2 = 0.54, 95% CI [0.32, 0.68]) but biased (high RMSE, >0.35) neuronal fraction estimates. CIBERSORT produced more discordant (moderate correlation; R2 = 0.25, 95% CI [0.15, 0.38]) neuronal fraction estimates, but with less bias (low RSME, 0.09). Using the matched single nuclei RNA-Seq reference dataset did not eliminate bias (MuSiC RMSE = 0.17). Conclusions: Our results together suggest that many existing RNA deconvolution algorithms estimate the RNA composition of homogenate tissue, e.g. the amount of RNA attributable to each cell type, and not the cellular composition, which relates to the underlying fraction of cells.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Simple statistical insights into the COVID-19 data of Saudi Arabia: figures prior to vaccination campaign [version 2; peer review: 1 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: COVID-19, the disease caused by the newly emerging coronavirus, SARS-COV2, is still a major health burden worldwide as it continues to spread rapidly in many countries after being contained for a while. The aim of the study was to analyze the official current disease estimates in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to anticipate future risks and needs. Methods: Publicly available COVID-19 data published by the Saudi Ministry of Health were analyzed to extract statistical estimates of the disease. These include monthly case fatality rates, death rates/1000, comparison of death figures and regression analysis. Results: The number of confirmed, recovered and deaths surged in the middle of the outbreak (June and July). The case fatality rates reported later in September-November were the highest despite the decline in the number of confirmed cases. The death rates/1000 were higher during the middle of the outbreak, where the highest numbers of deaths were recorded. The number of recovered cases was the highest as well during this time. Regression analysis showed that the number of deaths was related to that of confirmed cases, especially during the peak time. On the other hand, the number of recovered cases was related to that of confirmed cases at the beginning of the outbreak. Conclusion: Statistical estimates of COVID-19 fatalities provide simple figures to understand the disease progression pattern and the health care management success in disease containment. However, the absolute numbers should never be disregarded to reflect on the real situation.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=10974547&type=etoc&feed=rss">Is cyclooxygenase‐1 involved in neuroinflammation?</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p><i>Purpose:</i> Reactive microglia are an important hallmark of neuroinflammation. Reactive microglia release various inflammatory mediators, such as cytokines, chemokines, and prostaglandins, which are produced by enzymes like cyclooxygenases (COX). The inducible COX-2 subtype has been associated with inflammation, whereas the constitutively expressed COX-1 subtype is generally considered as a housekeeping enzyme. However, recent evidence suggests that COX-1 can also be upregulated and may play a prominent role in the brain during neuroinflammation. In this review, we summarize the evidence that supports this involvement of COX-1. <i>Methods</i>: Five databases were used to retrieve relevant studies that addressed COX-1 in the context of neuroinflammation. The search resulted in 32 articles, describing <i>in vitro</i>, <i>in vivo</i>, post mortem, and <i>in vivo</i> imaging studies that specifically investigated the COX-1 isoform under such conditions. <i>Results</i>: Reviewed literature generally indicated that the overexpression of COX-1 was induced by an inflammatory stimulus, which resulted in an increased production of prostaglandin E2. The pharmacological inhibition of COX-1 was shown to suppress the induction of inflammatory mediators like prostaglandin E2. Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging studies in animal models confirmed the overexpression of COX-1 during neuroinflammation. The same imaging method, however, could not detect any upregulation of COX-1 in patients with Alzheimer's disease. <i>Conclusion</i>: Taken together, studies in cultured cells and living rodents suggest that COX-1 is involved in neuroinflammation. Most postmortem studies on human brains indicate that the concentration of COX-1-expressing microglial cells is increased near sites of inflammation. However, evidence for the involvement of COX-1 in neuroinflammation in the living human brain is still largely lacking.</p>

                Background:Diarrhea is still the leading cause of childhood death worldwide, as well as a major cause for concern in developing countries. This study was conducted to investigate the factors related to childhood diarrhea in Cambodia. Methods:A cross-sectional study of the secondary data from the Cambodia Demographic and Health Survey 2014 was conducted using the combined dataset of household data and children’s data. A generalized linear mixed model was used to analyze the determinant factors of childhood diarrhea. Results:The surveys included 2,828 children, aged 12 to 35 months. The prevalence of diarrhea in the last 2 weeks was 16.44% (95% CI: 14.72%-18.31%). Factors with statistically significant associations with childhood diarrhea in Cambodia were: maternal unemployment, compared with being in employment (AOR = 1.43; 95% CI: 1.14-1.78); the child being male (AOR = 1.25; 95%CI: 1.02-1.53); the presence of unimproved toilet facilities (AOR = 1.17; 95%CI: 1.05-1.31) compared with improved toilet facilities; and unhygienic disposal of children’s stools (AOR = 1.32; 95%CI: 1.06-1.64) compared with hygienic disposal of children’s stools when controlling for other covariates. Both maternal age (one year older; AOR = 0.85; 95%CI: 0.78– 0.93) and child age (one month older; AOR = 0.86; 95%CI: 0.78-0.94) had significant negative associations with the occurrence of childhood diarrhea. Conclusion:Childhood diarrhea remains a public health concern in Cambodia. The probability of diarrhea occurring is shown to be increased by maternal unemployment, the sex of the child being male, lack of provision of improved toilet facilities, and the unhygienic disposal of children’s stools; whereas increasing maternal age and child’s age were associated with a reduced chance of diarrhea occurring. On the basis of these results, we recommend provision of programs focusing on reducing diarrhea through the construction of improved toilet facilities and the promotion of behavior to improve hygiene, specifically targeting younger mothers.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Brain-derived neurotrophic factor, nerve growth factor, and high sensitivity C-reactive protein levels in urine in overactive bladder patients: a meta-analysis [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Overactive bladder (OAB) is a clinical syndrome characterized by a combination of symptoms including urgency, frequency, and nocturia, with or without urinary incontinence. Overactive bladder has a high prevalence especially in those of an older age and women, with diagnosis depending on the patient’s symptoms. This study aims to assess brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), nerve growth factor (NGF), and high sensitivity C-reactive protein (HSCRP) in urine as biomarkers in OAB. Methods: Studies were searched from Pubmed, Science Direct, Wiley Online Library, and Google Scholar. All studies assessing BDNF, NGF, and HSCRP in urine in OAB patients were included. The standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were then calculated. Results: A total of 85 studies were included with a total of 11,483 subjects (6,885 OAB patients and 4,598 controls). Based on data analysis results, urinary NGF/Creatinine (NGF/Cr) and NGF level in OAB patients were significantly higher than control (SMD = 1.00, 95%CI = 0.80-1.20, P<0.00001; and SMD = 1.11, 95%CI = 0.79-1.43, P<0.00001). NGF/Cr level was found higher in OAB with incontinence (OAB wet) compared with OAB without incontinence (OAB dry) (SMD = 0.41, 95%CI = 0.23-0.60, P<0.0001), and decreased after treatment (SMD = 0.76, 95%CI = 0.49-1.03, P<0.00001). Urinary BDNF/Cr level was significantly higher in OAB patients compared with controls (SMD = 1.97, 95%CI = 1.14-2.79, P<0.00001), and also decreased significantly after treatment (SMD = 0.75, 95%CI = 0.42-1.08, P<0.00001). The level of HSCRP was significantly higher in OAB patients when compared with controls (SMD = 0.38, 95%CI = 0.12-0.64, P<0.004). Conclusions: The level of BDNF/Cr, NGF/Cr, NGF, and HSCRP in urine were found higher in OAB compared with controls, which means they may be used as a biomarkers for OAB.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Case Report: Kikuchi-Fujimoto Disease: A case of supraclavicular lymphadenopathy [version 2; peer review: 2 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Kikuchi-Fujimoto Disease (KFD), also known as histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis, is a rare cause of cervical lymphadenopathy. Patients usually present with localized lymphadenopathy, fever and fatigue. Because of the poorly understood etiology, it can be mistaken for an infectious disease or even malignance. Here we discuss a case of KFD that initially presented with left sided cervical lymphadenopathy that later progressed to left supraclavicular lymph nodes. Due to its characteristic overlap with other disorders like tuberculous lymphadenitis and lymphoma, KFD remains an arduous diagnosis for physicians. Therefore, one should be made aware of symptoms that can lead to misdiagnosis in patients.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Perceived stress and generalized anxiety in the Indian population due to lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic: a cross-sectional study [version 3; peer review: 2 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Research on the psychosocial toll of the COVID-19 pandemic is being conducted in various countries. This study aimed to examine stress levels and causal stressors for perceived stress and generalized anxiety in the Indian population related to the lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A total of 300 adults were invited to participate in the online study via snowball and virtual snowball sampling. They were requested to complete electronic survey forms for assessing perceived stress and anxiety, and questions related to psychosocial stressors. Frequency and percentage were used for categorical variables. Unpaired t-test was applied to compare responses based on gender, level of education, employment, and place of residence. A p-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Result: In total, 257 out of the 300 invited, responded and completed the survey. Men accounted for 58% (n=149) of the respondents. Overall, 84% (n=217) of participants had moderate to severe levels of perceived stress and 88% (n=228) had moderate to severe levels of anxiety. Women, as well as those not employed, reported significantly higher perceived stress and anxiety, urban residents reported higher perceived stress, while level of education had no difference in terms of perceived stress as well as anxiety. Fear of contracting COVID-19 was the highest stressor followed by difficulties in executing a routine exercise schedule and worry about the future. Conclusion: The psychosocial impact of the nationwide lockdown on the Indian population has been high. Vulnerable groups for increased stress and anxiety include women, younger ages, and the unemployed. The stressors recognized include fear of contracting COVID-19, inability to execute a routine exercise schedule and worry about the future.
