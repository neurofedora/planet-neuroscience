Several aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases have been linked to CMT. <i>DARS2</i>, encoding the mitochondrial aspartyl-tRNA synthetase, has been typically associated with leukoencephalopathy with brainstem and spinal cord involvement and lactate elevation. This study aimed to investigate the association between biallelic <i>DARS2</i> variants and axonal CMT.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We investigated 5 individuals from 3 unrelated families with axonal CMT and biallelic <i>DARS2</i> variants. Functional studies in fibroblasts assessed their effects on DARS2 expression, localization, and mitochondrial function. Enzymatic activity was evaluated in HEK293 cells.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The 5 individuals, including 4 adults, presented with childhood-onset progressive axonal CMT. None had leukoencephalopathy, but one showed central nervous system involvement, with intellectual disability and epilepsy. Genetic analysis identified compound heterozygous <i>DARS2</i> variants: family A, p.Ser238Phe and p.Arg336Cys; family B, p.Ser238Phe and p.Ile25Thrfs*38; family C, c.492+2T&gt;C and p.Pro503Leu. Functional studies revealed reduced DARS2 protein levels, mitochondrial network abnormalities, and impaired mitochondrial function. p.Ser238Phe behaves as a hypomorphic allele, whereas p.Pro503Leu reduced DARS2 enzymatic activity by 75%.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our findings expand the <i>DARS2</i>-related disease spectrum, establishing a novel association with axonal CMT. Hypomorphic variants, such as p.Ser238Phe, when paired with more deleterious variants, result in isolated axonal CMT, whereas more severe combinations—although not as deleterious as those seen in leukoencephalopathy with brainstem and spinal cord involvement and lactate elevation—result in axonal CMT with central nervous system involvement, albeit without leukoencephalopathy. These observations raise the possibility that <i>DARS2</i>-associated diseases form a continuum rather than representing strictly distinct central or peripheral nervous system disorders.

                The brain regulates breathing in response to changes in CO2/H+ by a process referred to as respiratory chemoreception. The retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN) is essential for this function. RTN neurons are intrinsically activated by CO2/H+. Astrocytes contribute as well, by providing a CO2/H+-dependent purinergic drive to augment neural activity directly and indirectly by causing vasoconstriction. Here, we summarize preclinical studies in rodents that identify: (i) mechanisms of CO2/H+ detection by RTN neurons; (ii) how this information is integrated at the neural network level; and (iii) how RTN neural activity is shaped by CO2/H+ sensitive astrocytes. We also discuss how disruption of RTN chemoreception might contribute to breathing problems in disease, and highlight the therapeutic potential of targeting CO2/H+-dependent and -independent regulatory elements of RTN neurons.

                Lo et al. show that binge feeding suppresses piriform (olfactory) cortex activity, reducing the brain’s representation of food flavor. This suppression is driven by the olfactory tubercle and promotes continued eating by decreasing sensory satiation. The findings link sensory suppression to overeating and highlight a cortical mechanism regulating appetite.

                Yuan et al. combine deep brain stimulation with neural activity monitoring to optimize stimulation parameters for the anterior cingulate cortex. They show that inhibitory DBS produces rapid, long-lasting antidepressant-like effects and suppresses mood-regulating networks, offering a circuit-based blueprint for optimizing neuromodulation therapies.

                The CA3 region of the hippocampus is the major site of sharp wave initiation, and a brain region crucially involved in learning and memory. Highly recurrent connectivity within its excitatory network is thought to underlie processes involved in memory formation. Recent work has indicated that distinct subpopulations of pyramidal neurons within this region may contribute differently to network activity, including sharp waves, in CA3. Exactly how these contributions may arise is not yet known. Here, we disentangle the local connectivity between two distinct CA3 cell types in mice: thorny and athorny pyramidal cells. We find an asymmetry in the connectivity between these two populations, with athorny cells receiving strong input from both athorny and thorny cells. Conversely, the thorny cell population receives very little input from the athorny population. Computational modeling suggests that this connectivity scheme may determine the sequential activation of these cell types during large network events such as sharp waves.

                The sauropod hind limb was the main support that allowed their gigantic body masses and a wide range of dynamic stability adaptations. It was closely related to the position of the center of masses of their multi-ton barrel-shaped bodies and experienced one of the most noticeable posture changes during macronarian evolution. Deeply branched macronarians achieved increasingly arched hind limbs in what is known as wide-gauge posture. However, it is not clear if this evolutionary trend is related to the evolutionary cascade toward gigantism even though some titanosaurians were the largest terrestrial vertebrates that ever existed. We tested evolutionary changes in hind limb morphology in the Macronaria phylogenetic tree by 3D geometric morphometrics. The macronarian hind limb does become progressively more arched toward deeply branched groups, specifically Saltasauridae. However, there is morphological convergence between different macronarian subclades. Wide-gauge posture does not correlate with changes in body size deeper in the macronarian evolutionary tree and acted as an exaptation to gigantism. Despite some titanosaurian subclades becoming some of the largest vertebrates, there is not a statistically significant trend toward a particular body size, but we identify a phyletic body size decrease in Macronaria.

">O-GlcNAcase promotes dendritic spine morphogenesis while downregulating their GluA2-containing AMPA receptors</a></h4>

              
                Dendritic spines are essential for synaptic transmission, neural circuit organization, and cognitive function. Their morphology and density influence synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory. Many proteins in dendritic spines are modified with O-GlcNAc, a monosaccharide that can be attached and removed from serines and threonines. O-GlcNAc has been implicated in multiple brain disorders, yet the role of O-GlcNAcase (OGA), the enzyme that removes O-GlcNAc modification from proteins, in dendritic spine regulation remains unclear. This study examines the role of OGA in spine and synapse morphogenesis. Immunohistochemical and biochemical analyses reveal OGA present in dendritic spines. Functional assays show that OGA promotes spine maturation, increases spine density, and alters synapse size. Additionally, OGA modulates the -amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAR), down-regulating GluA2-containing receptors in developing and mature neurons. These findings highlight OGA as a key regulator of excitatory synaptic remodeling and a therapeutic target for synapse-related pathologies such as Alzheimer's disease and autism.

">E/I ratio and net E+I strength are differentially affected across brain disorders</a></h4>

              
                Neuronal oscillations wax and wane near criticality, switching between high- and low-power states. However, the link between this bistability and excitation-inhibition balance is not well understood. Using a computational model, we demonstrate that bistability is influenced by two key factors: the excitatory-inhibitory (E/I) ratio and the combined strength of excitatory and inhibitory activity (E+I). We developed algorithms to infer both metrics from electrophysiological data and validated them in vivo. In intracranial recordings from epilepsy patients, both E/I and E+I increased during seizures, while interictally, E+I remained elevated in seizure zones as E/I decreased, consistent with compensatory inhibition. Extending the framework to scalp EEG from eight disorders, we found that Alzheimer's disease is better classified by E/I changes, whereas autism spectrum disorder and ADHD are distinguished by E+I alterations. Our findings highlight the importance of bistability in understanding EI regulation and offer handles for diagnostic and treatment decision support.

">Neural correlates of motor sequence learning and enhanced offline consolidation in 7- to 11-year-old children</a></h4>

              
                Intro: Many daily activities involve series of interrelated movements and thus the capacity to learn new motor sequences is vital for everyday functioning. Although learning new skills is especially prominent throughout childhood, remarkably few studies have examined the neural underpinnings of motor sequence learning (MSL) in children. Methods: Twenty-two children (7-11 years) and 23 adults (18-30 years) underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging while completing two sessions of a MSL task, separated by a 5-hour offline period of wakefulness. Results: Analyses of the behavioral data revealed comparable initial learning in children and adults. However, and consistent with previous research, children exhibited superior motor memory consolidation over the 5-hour offline epoch. Neuroimaging analyses revealed that children exhibited smaller modulations in brain activity between task and rest epochs in a widespread network of areas, including the sensorimotor cortex, supplementary motor area, cerebellum, putamen and regions associated with the default mode network. Similar levels of activity during task and rest epochs in the hippocampus, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and somatosensory cortex were associated with better motor memory consolidation in children. Conclusion: Results potentially suggest that the continued engagement of the developing brain during interleaved rest contributes to the childhood advantage in motor memory consolidation.

">Indirect pathway neurons in the tail of the striatum regulate inhibitory control over sensory driven behavior</a></h4>

              
                Inhibitory control, or the ability to withhold action in certain situations, is behaviorally essential. Disrupted inhibitory control is linked to various neuropsychiatric symptoms, making it critical to understand the underlying neural basis. We examined how the tail of the striatum (TS), a major basal ganglia sensory hub, regulates actions to sensory stimuli. Mice performed an auditory Go/NoGo task where we recorded cell-specific activity of TS neurons. Both major striatal types were active during target sounds, but non-target sounds preferentially engaged indirect pathway neurons. Temporarily silencing this activity increased errors to non-target stimuli, indicating a role in suppressing inappropriate action. In mice deficient for the synaptic adhesion molecule Neurexin1, a gene linked to autism spectrum disorder and ADHD, TS indirect pathway recruitment was reduced, and these mice demonstrated auditory-specific inhibitory control deficits. Altogether, these findings highlight a subcortical target to potentially improve attentional and behavioral regulation in neurodevelopmental disorders.

">PHA-4/FoxA controls the function of pharyngeal and extrapharyngeal enteric neurons of C. elegans</a></h4>

              
                FoxA transcription factors pattern gut tissue across animal phylogeny. Beyond their early patterning function, little is known about whether they control the terminal differentiation and/or function of the fully mature enteric nervous system, the intrinsic nervous system of the gut. We show here that the expression and function of the sole C. elegans FoxA homolog, PHA-4, reaches beyond its previously described pioneer factor roles in patterning the foregut. Through the engineering of neuron-specific cis-regulatory alleles, Cre-mediated cell-specific knockouts and degron-mediated, temporally controlled PHA-4/FoxA removal in postmitotic neurons, we found that PHA-4/FoxA is required not only to initiate the terminal differentiation program of foregut-associated enteric neurons, but also to maintain their functional properties throughout the life of the animal. Moreover, we discovered novel sites of expression of PHA-4/FoxA in extrapharyngeal enteric neurons that innervate the hindgut (AVL and DVB), a GABAergic interneuron that controls foregut function during sleep (RIS), and a peptidergic neuron, PVT, which we implicate here in controlling defecation behavior. We show that while PHA-4/FoxA is not required for the developmental specification of AVL, DVB, RIS, and PVT, it is required to enable these neurons to control enteric functions. Taken together, pha-4 is the only transcription factor known to date that is expressed in and required for the proper function of all distinct types of enteric neurons in a nervous system.

">Extreme Small-World, Modular, and Rich-Club Topology of Single-Neuron Networks in Mouse Primary Visual Cortex</a></h4>

              
                Understanding whether the canonical topologies of macroscale connectomes, such as small-world architecture, hub dominance, rich-club cores, and modularity, extend to local cortical microcircuitry has remained challenging due to limitations in simultaneously recording large neuronal populations in vivo. Here, using ultra-large-scale, high-resolution calcium imaging, we tracked spontaneous activity from approximately 2,000 neurons across the mouse primary visual cortex (V1). Across multiple mice and correlation thresholds, V1 neuronal networks exhibited hallmark characteristics of efficient brain organization, but in a markedly intensified form compared to macroscopic brain networks. Local clustering coefficients remained an order of magnitude above random levels, while characteristic path lengths approached those observed in random networks, yielding an exceptionally high small-world index that substantially exceeded typical values previously reported at macroscopic scales. Degree distributions followed a power-law, identifying highly connected hub neurons whose interconnections formed a robust rich-club integrative core. Community detection analyses showed robust modularity upon pruning weak connections, indicating functionally specialized neuronal clusters interconnected predominantly through hubs. These findings provide one of the first direct in vivo evidence that single cortical microcircuits not only recapitulate but intensify network topologies observed at macroscopic scale, implying evolutionarily conserved design principles underlying brain organization from neurons to systems.

                Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor (GLP1R) agonists like semaglutide drive weight loss through the brain, but insights into their intracellular signaling mechanisms are lacking. Although canonically GLP1Rs signal through the stimulatory alpha Gs protein, we find that semaglutide utilizes both Gs- and Gq-signaling pathways in GLP1Rs in the area postrema (AP)--the primary site of semaglutide action in the brain--to differentially regulate neuronal activation across distinct neuronal clusters. Semaglutide also drives graded increases of the essential secondary messenger cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) in Glp1r-expressing AP neurons (APGlp1r) through Gs-dependent and -independent manners. Inhibition of the cAMP-degradation enzyme phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) can enhance and sustain these cAMP responses, whereas disruption of Gs or cAMP signaling in APGlp1r neurons abolishes semaglutide-induced weight loss and downstream brain-wide activation. Our systematic characterization of semaglutide's signaling mechanisms in the brain provides avenues for improving the performance of obesity therapeutics.

">Longitudinal three-photon imaging for tracking amyloid plaques and vascular degeneration in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease</a></h4>

              
                Significance: Vascular abnormalities may contribute to amyloid-beta accumulation and neurotoxicity in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The ability to monitor vascular degeneration as AD progresses is essential. Three-photon fluorescence microscopy (3PM) enables high-resolution deep tissue imaging with minimal invasiveness and photodamage. Aim: This study established a longitudinal 3P imaging pipeline to quantify vascular degeneration and amyloid plaque formation in the APP NL-G-F mouse model. Approach: A cranial window allowed repeated 3P imaging at four-week intervals beginning at five weeks after surgery. Vessels labelled with Texas-Red were segmented using DeepVess, while plaques labelled with methoxy-XO4 were segmented using custom scripts. Quantitative analyses assessed vascular parameters (diameter, density, tortuosity, length, inter-vessel distance) and plaque metrics (radius, nearest plaque-to-vessel distance). Results: We imaged the same field over 4 weeks quantifying a decrease in vasculature and increase in amyloid plaque formation with age. Significant decreases in vessel diameter, increases in inter-vessel distance, and alterations in vessel length were observed. Changes in vessel tortuosity, plaque radius, and plaque proximity to vessels were not significant. Conclusions: This pipeline tracks vascular remodeling and amyloid pathology in deep cortical structures. It offers a tool for studying the interplay between vascular and amyloid pathologies in AD, supporting future research into disease mechanisms and therapeutic strategies.

">ATHENA: Automatically Tracking Hands Expertly with No Annotations</a></h4>

              
                Studying naturalistic hand behaviours is challenging due to the limitations of conventional marker-based motion capture, which can be costly, time-consuming, and encumber participants. While markerless pose estimation exists - an accurate, off-the-shelf solution validated for hand-object manipulation is needed. We present ATHENA (Automatically Tracking Hands Expertly with No Annotations), an open-source, Python-based toolbox for 3D markerless hand tracking. To validate ATHENA, we concurrently recorded hand kinematics using ATHENA and an industry-standard optoelectronic marker-based system (OptiTrack). Participants performed unimanual, bimanual, and naturalistic object manipulation and we compared common kinematic variables like grip aperture, wrist velocity, index metacarpophalangeal flexion, and bimanual span. Our results demonstrated high spatiotemporal agreement between ATHENA and OptiTrack. This was evidenced by extremely high matches (R2 > 0.90 across the majority of tasks) and low root mean square differences (< 1 cm for grip aperture, < 4 cm/s for wrist velocity, and < 5-10 degrees for index metacarpophalangeal flexion). ATHENA reliably preserved trial-to-trial variability in kinematics, offering identical scientific conclusions to marker-based approaches, but with significantly reduced financial and time costs and no participant encumbrance. In conclusion, ATHENA is an accurate, automated, and easy-to-use platform for 3D markerless hand tracking that enables more ecologically valid motor control and learning studies of naturalistic hand behaviours, enhancing our understanding of human dexterity.

">Circular continuum of alpha motoneuron types</a></h4>

              
                Alpha-motoneurons ( - MNs) are traditionally classified into slow (S), fast fatigue-resistant (FR), and fast-fatigable (FF), which exist along a continuum of properties between slow and fast, enabling the generation of graded force and seamless movement. Using combinations of markers, we developed novel immunohistochemistry protocols that enabled co-labeling of six major and transitional  - MN types throughout the mouse lumbar spinal cord with unprecedented detail. Intriguingly, our protocols labeled for the first time:  - MNs of the fast fatigue intermediate (FI) type; a previously undescribed transitional  - MN subtype (FR/FI); and a novel subtype of  - MNs exhibiting hybrid characteristics of both S and FF types -- termed S/FF -- which resist ALS degeneration. Electrophysiological recordings confirmed FR/FI and S/FF subtypes, both exhibiting mixed traits. The discovery of S/FF subtype reveals that  - MNs exist along a circular continuum between slow and fast types, challenging the traditional linear model and reshaping our understanding of their role in motor control.

">GIP receptor agonism suppresses inflammation-induced aversion and food intake via distinct circuits</a></h4>

              
                Glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) is a gut-derived incretin hormone, and pharmacologic modulation of central GIP receptors (GIPR) improves energy homeostasis. Recent reports have demonstrated that GIPR agonism is also anti-aversive. However, the mechanisms by which GIPR signaling impact food intake and aversion are incompletely understood. Here, we show that GIPR agonism abrogatesthe aversive and enhances the anorexigenic effects of the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1{beta} (IL-1{beta}). Aversion-encoding parabrachial calcitonin-gene related peptide (CGRP) neurons were required for IL-1{beta}-induced conditioned taste avoidance (CTA) but not anorexia. Moreover, systemic IL-1{beta} increased in vivo CGRP neural activity, and this was significantly attenuated by co-administration of a GIPR agonist. By contrast, GIPR in the dorsal vagal complex were required for the acute anorectic effect of GIPR agonism but not its anti-aversive effect. Taken together, our data suggest that GIPR agonism reduces food intake and prevents aversion via distinct circuits, and that GIPR agonism may represent an effective approach to alleviate inflammation-induced aversion.

">Microcephaly-like phenotype triggered by novel reassortant and prototypic Oropouche Virus strains in brain organoids</a></h4>

              
                Oropouche virus (OROV) is an emerging arbovirus currently spreading across South America, with increasing reports of neurological manifestations, severe systemic disease, and congenital abnormalities. Although traditionally associated with mild febrile illness, the recent geographic expansion and surge in OROV outbreaks have prompted attention to its neurotropic potential. Here, we investigated the impact of OROV infection on human neural development using neural stem cells (NSCs) and brain organoids derived from induced pluripotent stem cells. Recent OROV isolates exhibiting genomic reassortment and associated with increased neurological manifestations were compared with a prototypical strain for the ability to infect NSCs, early-stage organoids, and more mature cortical-like tissues. OROV infected NSCs efficiently, leading to widespread cell death, depletion of proliferative progenitors, and disruption of neuroepithelial organization. Transcriptomic profiling of infected NSCs revealed a robust reduction of antiviral response genes and an enrichment of pathways related to viral replication, apoptosis, and the inhibition of stem cell maintenance and neuronal differentiation. These molecular signatures aligned with the phenotypic collapse of progenitor pools and cortical structure observed in organoids. OROV antigens were detected in both astrocytes and neurons, with associated structural degeneration. Although a substantial overlap in differentially expressed genes was observed between the two viral strains, some strain-specific transcriptional responses were detected. However, these modest differences did not translate into distinct cytopathogenic effects between the two viral strains. These phenotypes, including the reduced growth of infected organoids, resemble those previously described with Zika virus in the same cellular models, supporting the hypothesis that OROV may impair brain development. Together, these results reveal a previously unrecognized neuroteratogenic potential of OROV strains and provide mechanistic insight into the potential of OROV to induce microcephaly-like phenotypes, highlighting its relevance as a significant threat to maternal-fetal health.

">Targeting intracellular tau with a gene-encoded single-chain antibody promotes neuronal homeostasis and ameliorates tau pathology</a></h4>

              
                The intraneuronal aggregation of tau is a key driver of pathogenesis in tauopathies such as Alzheimer's disease. Passive immunotherapy is a promising strategy for targeting tau, with several tau-specific antibodies having demonstrated the ability to reduce tau pathology and improve behavioural deficits in tau transgenic mouse models. Despite preclinical promise, however, conventional antibodies have limited access to the cell cytoplasm where tau pathology itself originates and accumulates to cause downstream neuronal dysfunction. As such, conventional antibodies are typically limited to targeting extracellular tau, failing to address the primary site of tau pathogenesis. This challenge can be overcome by intracellular antibodies or intrabodies, small antibody fragments that can be expressed within cells to target intracellular antigens like tau. Here, we have generated a single-chain variable fragment (scFv) derived from the N-terminal tau-specific antibody, RNJ1, and investigated its potential as an intrabody to reduce tau pathology and restore neuronal function in a tau transgenic mouse model. The RNJ1 intrabody successfully engaged intracellular tau and reduced total tau and phosphorylated tau inclusions in brains of tau transgenic mice. Furthermore, treatment with the RNJ1 intrabody in female tau transgenic mice induced restoration of various protein pathways important for cellular homeostasis, thus promoting the restoration of neuronal function. Our findings underscore the therapeutic utility of targeting intracellular tau in disease, providing novel insights into the potential mechanisms by which intrabodies ameliorate tau pathology.

">Temporal confounds emulate multivariate fMRI measures of perceptual learning</a></h4>

              
                Human perception inherently involves learning. We can experience the same stimulus completely differently depending on our prior knowledge. Understanding the neural basis of perception therefore requires measurements that capture these temporal dynamics. Multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA) approaches are widely used to characterise changes in neural representations over time. A popular example is the perceptual reorganisation paradigm, which investigates the neural correlates of enhanced recognition of distorted images after cueing with the undistorted version. Studies typically report increased representational similarity of these two images in early visual cortex. However, as these paradigms include an inherent ordering of stimuli that precludes trial randomisation or counterbalancing, they are vulnerable to temporal confounds common to fMRI. Here, we investigate how these confounds could influence current understanding of perceptual reorganisation. We tested different perceptual reorganisation paradigm designs derived from published fMRI studies, and found substantial design-driven order effects at the single-subject level for all paradigms. For certain designs, these effects artificially amplified neural indices of perceptual reorganisation at both the single-subject and group levels, emulating widespread signatures of perceptual reorganisation across the brain. To disentangle perceptual learning processes from measurement artefacts, we recommend (i) selecting designs that minimise the effect of stimulus order confounds on contrasts of interest, (ii) correcting for these confounds, and (iii) confirming results are perceptually driven via negative controls, e.g., stimuli or brain areas not expected to produce perceptual effects. Our work demonstrates how current understanding of perceptual learning mechanisms based on multivariate neuroimaging approaches could be influenced by non-obvious design confounds that misdirect interpretations towards distributed neural processing, and offers practical solutions to address this.

">Functional recovery by transplantation of human iPSC-derived A2B5 positive neural progenitor cell after spinal cord injury in mice</a></h4>

              
                Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) hold great potential for patient-specific therapies. Transplantation of hiPSC-derived neural progenitor cells (NPCs) is a promising reparative strategy for spinal cord injury (SCI), but clinical translation requires efficient differentiation into desired neural lineages and purification before transplantation. Here, differentiated hiPSCs, reprogrammed from human skin fibroblasts using Sendai virus-mediated expression of OCT4, SOX2, KLF4, and C-MYC, into neural rosettes expressing SOX1 and PAX6, followed by neuronal precursors ({beta}-tubulin III+/NESTIN+) and glial precursors (GFAP+/NESTIN+). Both neuronal and glial precursors expressed the A2B5 surface antigen. A2B5+ NPCs, purified by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), proliferated in vitro with mitogens and differentiated into mature neurons and astrocytes under lineage-specific conditions. NOD-SCID mice received a T9 contusion injury followed by transplantation of A2B5+ NPCs, human fibroblasts, or control medium at 8 days post-injury. At two months, grafted NPCs showed robust survival, progressive neuronal maturation ({beta}-tubulin III+ to doublecortin+ to NeuN+), and astrocytic differentiation (GFAP+), particularly in spared white matter. Transplantation significantly increased spared white matter volume and improved hindlimb locomotor recovery, with no teratoma formation observed. These results demonstrate that hiPSC-derived, FACS-purified A2B5+ NPCs can survive, differentiate into neurons and astrocytes, and enhance functional recovery after SCI. This approach offers a safe and effective candidate cell source for treating SCI and potentially other neurological disorders.

">Altered molecular signaling pathways in the hippocampus of rhesus monkeys following chronic alcohol use</a></h4>

              
                Context-induced relapse is a significant factor limiting recovery from alcohol use disorder (AUD). However, the molecular processes in the hippocampus, a critical region for contextual memory impacted by chronic alcohol use, remain poorly understood. We used a non-human primate model to test the hypothesis that chronic alcohol use impacts hippocampal molecular pathways that may serve as therapeutic targets for context-induced relapse and memory processing issues associated with chronic alcohol use. We conducted RNAseq profiling on hippocampal samples from adult male rhesus monkeys with chronic alcohol use (n=7) and controls (n=5) from the Monkey Alcohol Tissue Research Resource (MATRR). We identified 2,575 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in subjects with chronic alcohol use, including genes implicated in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of alcohol dependence, such as GLP2R and GABBR2. Downregulated pathways included chemical synaptic transmission, trans-synaptic signaling, and neuron development, and upregulated pathways involved mitochondrial function. Targeted pathway analysis highlighted significant downregulation of synaptic signaling (e.g., axonal fasciculation) and upregulation of mitochondrial processes (e.g., electron transport). Leading-edge gene analysis revealed several downregulated genes involved in synaptic signaling including GRIN2B, CACNA1C, and NLGN1 as well as upregulated genes such as NDUFS3 and MT-ND1 involved in mitochondrial processes. Drug repurposing analysis identified several targets including epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors, and L-type calcium channel blockers as potential therapeutic targets. Our results provide critical insights into molecular pathways underlying hippocampal pathology in chronic alcohol use, emphasizing the roles of mitochondrial function, synaptic regulation and calcium channels, and offering potential novel therapeutic targets.

">Epigenetic Shifts Reveal Alzheimer's Origins after Sustained Picomolar Aβ Exposure</a></h4>

              
                Recent advances in sequencing have identified genetic risk factors for Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the molecular mechanisms triggering disease onset remain unclear. While high brain levels of amyloid-beta (A{beta}) impair synaptic function and memory, exposure to low picomolar (pM) A{beta} ; concentrations - typical of healthy brains - enhances these functions, while sustained exposure results in impairment. To investigate this transition from physiological to pathological A{beta} ; activity, we profiled DNA methylation and gene expression in C57B16 mice subjected to prolonged pM A{beta}42 exposure. We identified differentially methylated and expressed genes, including those involved in synaptic function, associated with three phases: memory enhancement (brief exposure), a transitional state with intact memory (intermediate), and memory decline (prolonged). These gene sets may represent early molecular drivers of AD pathogenesis.

">Modeling presynaptic inhibition by the amyloid precursor protein demonstrates one potential mechanism for preventing runaway synaptic modification in Alzheimers disease</a></h4>

              
                INTRODUCTION Previous simulations of Hebbian associative memory models inspired the malignant synaptic growth hypothesis of Alzheimers disease (AD), which suggests that cognitive impairments arise due to runaway synaptic modification resulting from poor separation between encoding and retrieval. METHODS We computationally model presynaptic inhibition by the recently identified interaction of soluble amyloid precursor protein (sAPPalpha) with the gamma-aminobutyric acid type B receptor (GABABR) as one potential biological mechanism which can enhance separation between encoding and retrieval. RESULTS Simulations predict that the dual effect of sAPPalpha on long-term potentiation and presynaptic inhibition of glutamatergic synapses maintains effective associative memory function and prevents runaway synaptic modification. Moreover, computational modeling predicts that sAPPalpha, which interacts with the 1a isoform of GABABR, is more effective at stabilizing associative memory than the GABABR agonist Baclofen. DISCUSSION Molecular mechanisms that enhance presynaptic inhibition, such as sAPPalpha-GABABR1a signaling, are potential therapeutic targets for preventing cognitive impairments in AD.

">Structural connectome architecture and biological vulnerability shape cortical atrophy in cocaine use disorder</a></h4>

              
                Cocaine use disorder (CUD) is prevalent and characterized by widespread gray matter atrophy across the cerebral cortex. However, it remains unclear whether and how connectome-based circuits and biological features shape these structural abnormalities. Here, we show that CUD-associated regional atrophy is constrained by the white matter (WM) structural connectome. Along these WM pathways, regions that share similar haemodynamic activity and molecular profiles are more likely to exhibit analogous atrophy patterns. By integrating the structural connectome with these multiple connectivity blueprints, we subsequently identify CUD epicenters and reveal that the prefrontal and visual cortices serve as core systems. Furthermore, we link these epicenters to cortical gene expression patterns and delineate CUD-related transcriptomic enrichment in biological processes, including inter-neuronal communication, synaptic function and neural homeostasis. Finally, we demonstrate that the spatial distribution of these epicenters correlates with cocaine craving-response maps derived from repeated transcranial magnetic stimulation and can track individual variations in clinical behavioural representations, suggesting their potential as key targets for therapeutic intervention. Together, our findings establish a structurally constrained framework for the spread of pathology underlying cortical atrophy in CUD, where initial perturbations propagate via structural connectome pathways to vulnerable regions shaped by neural activity and molecular landscapes.

">The Social Switchboard: Context and Rank Shapes Behavioural and Neural Responses During Macaque Decision-Making</a></h4>

              
                Social interactions shape many of our most ethologically relevant decisions and require considerable cognitive sophistication. Factors such as immediate needs, social bonds, hierarchical status, and reciprocity norms impact decision-making. Yet most laboratory paradigms examine individuals in isolation. We developed a face-to-face cognitive testing platform using a transparent touchscreen that allowed pairs of adult male Macaca fascicularis (n = 6) with established dominance relationships to perform a decision-making task across six social contexts: audience, co-action, envy, cooperation, competition, and altruism. We recorded eye movements simultaneously from both subjects (gaze position and pupil diameter), synchronised behavioural video, and task performance. Across social contexts, macaques performed better in the presence of a conspecific than when tested alone, but performance declined under altruistic and competitive conditions. Dominance substantially modulated motivation: dominant subjects were less willing to engage when rewards were shared (envy), when only the partner was rewarded (altruism), or when contingent action with a subordinate was required (cooperation). Eye-tracking revealed greater pre-choice arousal and social attention during social sessions, indexed by larger pupils, longer fixations on the partner's face, and more saccades before (but not during or after) choices. Pupil dilation was larger in dyads where both individuals were dominant than in dyads where one was subordinate. Finally, noninvasive functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) showed increased cortical engagement relative to baseline in audience, altruism, competition, and cooperation conditions. These findings demonstrate that social context and hierarchical dominance systematically shape choices, attentional allocation, autonomic arousal, and cortical engagement in macaques, and provide a tractable platform for further dissecting the neural bases of contextual social decision-making.

">Tactile Pressure Evokes a Biphasic BOLD Response in Ipsilateral Primary Somatosensory Cortex</a></h4>

              
                Tactile perception is fundamental to how we engage with and interpret our surroundings. While the contralateral primary somatosensory cortex (S1) is thought to be generally responsible for processing tactile information, simultaneous responses in the ipsilateral hemisphere have been observed. This work aims to characterize the blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) response pattern of ipsilateral S1 to unilateral tactile stimuli. In this study, tactile stimuli were applied using a custom pneumatically actuated stimulator designed and built in house (KalantaryArdebily et al., 2024). Three stimulus force levels were applied in an event-related design. As expected we observed an apparent difference in BOLD responses between the contralateral and ipsilateral hemispheres. We found differing response patterns between the Brodmann's areas (BA) within ipsilateral S1. Ipsilateral BA2 had a positive BOLD response similar to that of the contralateral hemisphere. In contrast, ipsilateral BA1 and BA3b appeared to have a biphasic response. That is, those regions had an initial negative response, followed by a secondary positive one. Using multi-echo analysis, we verified that this biphasic response pattern is BOLD-related. In addition, the secondary (positive) phase was more sensitive to tactile stimulus force than the initial "negative" BOLD phase. The ipsilateral BA1 and BA3b responses support a previous hypothesis of bilateral sensory gating (Blatow et al., 2007; Chung et al., 2014; Hamalainen et al., 2000; Kastrup et al., 2008; Klingner et al., 2016; Schafer et al., 2012; Tame et al., 2015). This study extends previous research reporting negative responses in ipsilateral S1, suggesting that the response is BOLD-related, biphasic, and that the previously overlooked secondary positive phase is actually more sensitive to stimulus intensity.

">Normative neural and physiological correlates of parent-child observational threat extinction</a></h4>

              
                The dyadic relationship between a parent and child is a critical facilitator of social learning, particularly in the management of fear. Vicarious extinction, the process of learning by observing a parent extinguish learned threat responses, holds critical translational potential in understanding adolescent psychopathology involving aberrant threat responses. However, normative biological profiles of vicarious extinction have yet to be uncovered. Here, a community sample of 97 parent-child dyads, enriched for trauma-exposure, completed a validated vicarious extinction paradigm. Youth completed all phases during functional magnetic resonance imaging, while caregivers simultaneously completed the behavioral task. Linear models interrogating normative behavioral, physiological, and neural correlates of acquisition and direct and vicarious extinction, controlled for trauma and symptom severity. The degree of parent-child autonomic synchrony was used to predict the strength of extinction learning. Youth behavioral and skin conductance response markers suggest successful threat acquisition and direct and vicarious extinction. Autonomic arousal during active vicarious extinction learning processes was significantly associated with the strength of parent-child synchrony. Neural activation analyses reveal patterns of early encoding of threat and safety discrimination that were reactivated during later threat reinstatement. Finally, results corroborate and expand known models of direct and vicarious extinction, respectively involving the ventromedial and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex. Altogether, this data confirms that youth can directly and vicariously modify learned threat associations with distinct neurobiological profiles. This delineation of vicarious extinction neural circuitry within a normative population is pivotal for understanding how these processes may be altered by the environment and/or psychopathology during adolescence.

">Your Emotions, My Brain: Generalizable Neural Signatures of Emotional Memory Reactivation During Sleep</a></h4>

              
                Reactivation in sleep alters the structure of memories and can potentially be used to restructure upsetting representations. Reactivation can be triggered with auditory cues and then detected using machine learning and electroencephalography (EEG), but can we also detect the emotionality of reactivated memories? We examined this by presenting auditory cues that had been associated with negative or neutral stimuli in wake during subsequent NREM sleep and training a classifier to detect the emotionality of subsequent EEG responses. We were able to detect the reinstatement of emotionality 0.4-0.6 seconds after cue presentation. Importantly, we used a between-participant machine learning pipeline to identify shared neural signatures of emotionality across individuals without fine-tuning the model on testing participants. This approach eliminates the need for individualized wake localizer sessions, establishing a methodologically efficient framework for investigating emotional processing during sleep. Detection of emotional reactivation in sleep will help us to understand how such reactivation impacts upon the emotionality of the memories in the long term, potentially facilitating development of treatments for PTSD and depression through memory restructuring in sleep.

">A Coupling Model of Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation Induced Electric Fields to Neural State Variables</a></h4>

              
                Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation technique used to modulate neural activity, with applications in clinical treatment, diagnostics, and neuroscientific research. TMS targeting the human primary motor cortex (M1) is well studied, aided by experimental readouts from the cerebral cortex, the spinal cord, and activated muscle targets. One key readout is a series of pulses that descend the spinal cord following TMS, called DI-waves. These reflect the output of M1 to the spinal cord and are influenced by TMS parameters such as orientation, strength, and waveform. Previous modeling studies have deployed numerous strategies to explain DI-wave generation, but generally approximate TMS inputs as semi-arbitrary current or synaptic inputs. A consistent missing piece to these models is a biophysically motivated coupling between TMS and the neural states of cells and cell populations. This study aims to leverage cable simulations of realistic neuron morphologies to couple TMS induced electric fields to average state variables of cortical cell populations. This coupling model quantifies the spatial-temporal activation function of directly stimulated axonal fibers and the average input current that downstream cells receive due to synaptic inputs from directly stimulated cells. An example M1 cortical circuit is studied, in which TMS stimulates layer 2/3 excitatory and inhibitory neurons that project synapses onto layer 5 corticospinal neurons. Results indicate that TMS induces unique directionally sensitive distributions of synaptic outputs in time and space for each cell type. Directional and dosage sensitivity carries forward to the dendritic current flowing into layer 5 cells. Ultimately, the coupling model provides a novel architecture to translate electric fields from TMS into activation functions that alter neural states and serve as inputs to cortical circuit modeling. The study of other brain regions is achievable through an alternate choice of cell morphologies, cell locations, and circuit design.

                Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have demonstrated remarkable success in image recognition and exhibit conceptual similarities to the primate ventral visual pathway. Adding recurrence opens the door to exploring temporal dynamics and investigating mechanisms underlying recognition robustness, attentional modulation, and rhythmic perception phenomena. However, modeling spatiotemporal dynamics of biological vision using CNN-based architectures remains challenging. Incorporating functionally beneficial recurrence, capturing biologically plausible temporal phenomena such as adaptation and subadditive temporal summation, and maintaining topographic organization aligned with cortical structure require significant computational considerations. Although recent advances have incorporated neurobiological constraints, the field lacks accessible tools for efficiently integrating, testing, and comparing these approaches. Here, we introduce DynVision, a modular toolbox for constructing and evaluating recurrent convolutional neural networks (RCNNs) with biologically inspired dynamics. Our approach facilitates the incorporation of key visual cortex properties, including realistic recurrent architectures, activity evolution governed by dynamical systems equations, and structured connectivity reflecting cortical arrangements, while maintaining computational efficiency. We demonstrate the framework's utility through systematic analysis of emergent neural dynamics, highlighting how different biologically motivated modifications shape scientifically-relevant response patterns.

                As research on human behavior, such as spatial navigation, increasingly adopts naturalistic settings, establishing best practices for such experiments becomes essential. While virtual reality (VR) offers a bridge between laboratory control and real-world complexity, it does not fully capture the experiential richness of real-world environments. Here, we present a demonstration of a mobile eye-tracking study conducted in a large-scale, outdoor urban environment, featuring unconstrained, long-duration free exploration and outside-pointing tasks. Using the city of Limassol, Cyprus as our testbed, we showcase the feasibility of collecting high-quality mobile eye-tracking, head orientation, and GPS data "in the wild," capturing a wide range of natural behavior with minimal experimental constraints. Based on this experience, we provide a set of best practices tailored to the logistical and methodological challenges posed by complex, real-world urban settings, challenges unlikely to arise in traditional indoor or highly controlled environments. While these recommendations have general relevance, we exemplify them in the context of spatial navigation research. By establishing methodological standards for studies at this scale, we aim to encourage and inform future research into naturalistic human behavior outside the laboratory.

">Characterizing Surround Suppression with Dynamic Natural Scenes</a></h4>

              
                Surround suppression refers to the reduction in perceptual sensitivity to a central stimulus caused by its surrounding context. Previous studies have examined this phenomenon mainly with simple stimuli varying only in low-level visual features, leaving it unclear whether the same principles apply to natural scenes. To address this, we investigated surround suppression in complex and dynamic scenes by systematically manipulating categorical similarity and motion congruence between the center and surrounding scenes. Categorical similarity was examined across four levels: identical exemplars, different exemplars of the same basic-level category, different basic-level categories, and different superordinate categories. Motion direction was manipulated by center and surround drifting either in the same or opposite directions. In two experiments, we measured contrast sensitivity for the center scene during a categorization task. We found that the suppression increased as the categorical similarity between the center and the surround decreased, with the strongest suppression observed for different superordinate categories. This contrasts with results for simple stimuli, where increasing center-surround similarity increases suppression. Yet, consistent with the findings from simple stimuli, suppression was stronger when the center and surround moved in the same direction. These findings show that contextual modulation in natural vision is governed not only by low-level feature similarity but also by high-level categorical structure. Context-dependent suppression may therefore help the visual system prioritize coherent, task-relevant information while filtering incongruent input.

">Analysis of human visual experience data</a></h4>

              
                Exposure to the optical environment, often referred to as visual experience, profoundly influences human physiology and behavior across multiple time scales. In controlled laboratory settings, stimuli can be held constant or manipulated parametrically. However, such exposures rarely replicate real-world conditions, which are inherently complex and dynamic, generating high-dimensional datasets that demand rigorous and flexible analysis strategies. This tutorial presents an analysis pipeline for visual experience datasets, with a focus on reproducible workflows for human chronobiology and myopia research. Light exposure and its retinal encoding affect human physiology and behavior across multiple time scales. Here we provide step-by-step instructions for importing, visualizing, and processing viewing distance and light exposure data using the open-source R package LightLogR. This includes time-series analyses for working distance, biologically relevant light metrics, and spectral characteristics. By leveraging a modular approach, the tutorial supports researchers in building flexible and robust pipelines that accommodate diverse experimental paradigms and measurement systems.

">Pharmacological Depletion of Retinal Mononuclear Phagocytes is Neuroprotective in a Mouse Model of Mitochondrial Optic Neuropathy</a></h4>

              
                Purpose: The Vglut2-Cre;ndufs4loxP/loxP mouse strain with retinal ganglion cell (RGC)-specific mitochondrial complex I dysfunction develops severe RGC degeneration by postnatal day 90 (P90), with accompanying retinal mononuclear phagocyte (MNP) accumulation. We have reported that continuous exposure to hypoxia partially rescues RGC death in these mice, with minimal effect on MNP abundance. We hypothesized that pharmacological depletion of MNPs with the colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor inhibitor pexidartinib would enhance RGC neuroprotection by hypoxia. Methods: Iba1+ retinal MNP depletion was assessed in C57Bl/6J mice fed control or pexidartinib-infused chow beginning at P25. Subsequently, Vglut2-Cre;ndufs4loxP/loxP mice and control littermates were raised under normoxia or hypoxia and fed control or pexidartinib chow from P25 to P90. The neuroprotective effect of pexidartinib and hypoxia alone and in combination was assessed by quantifying RGC soma and axon survival in retinal flat mounts and optic nerve cross sections. Results: Pexidartinib completely depleted retinal MNPs within one week of treatment. Untreated Vglut2-Cre;ndufs4loxP/loxP mice exhibited the expected ~50% reduction of RGC soma and axon survival at P90 (p<0.0001 for both). Hypoxia or pexidartinib monotherapy each reduced RGC degeneration by more than one-half, while their combination resulted in complete RGC neuroprotection (p<0.001 for all three treatments). Normal myelination patterns were restored in mice receiving dual therapy. Conclusions: Pexidartinib effectively depletes retinal MNPs and is neuroprotective in the setting of severe RGC mitochondrial dysfunction. This therapeutic effect is additive to that of hypoxia. Combating retinal neuro-inflammation may therefore be a useful adjunct therapy in mitochondrial optic neuropathies like Leber hereditary optic neuropathy.

">Ten3-Lphn2-mediated target selection across the extended hippocampal network demonstrates a repeated strategy for circuit assembly</a></h4>

              
                How do a limited number of wiring molecules specify trillions of connections in developing brains? We previously found that inverse expression of a ligand-receptor pair, Teneurin-3 (Ten3) and Latrophilin-2 (Lphn2) in CA1 and subiculum instructs CA1[-&gt;]subiculum target selection through Ten3-Ten3 homophilic attraction and Ten3-Lphn2 heterophilic reciprocal repulsion. Here, we leveraged conditional knockouts to systematically demonstrate that these mechanisms generalize to extended hippocampal connections, including entorhinal cortex and hypothalamus. Cooperation between attraction and repulsion differs depending on the order developing axons encounter the attractant and repellent subfields. Strikingly, Ten3 and Lphn2 can serve both as ligands for incoming axons and receptors for their own target selection, within the same neuron; Ten3 can be repulsive or attractive as ligand or receptor. Thus, multifunctionality and repeated use, together with the recurrent circuit motifs prevalent in the brain, enable one ligand-receptor pair to instruct target selection of many more neurons.

                <p>Fiber photometry is a neuroscience technique that can continuously monitor in vivo fluorescence to assess population neural activity or neuropeptide/transmitter release in freely behaving animals. Despite the widespread adoption of this technique, methods to statistically analyze data in an unbiased, objective, and easily adopted manner are lacking. Various pipelines for data analysis exist, but they are often system specific, are only for preprocessing data, and/or lack usability. Current post hoc statistical approaches involve inadvertently biased user-defined time-binned averages or area under the curve analysis. To date, no post hoc user-friendly tool with few assumptions for a standardized unbiased analysis exists, yet such a tool would improve reproducibility and statistical reliability for all users. Hence, we have developed a user-friendly post hoc statistical analysis package in Python that is easily downloaded and applied to data from any fiber photometry system. This Fiber Photometry Post Hoc Analysis (FiPhoPHA) package incorporates a variety of tools, a downsampler, bootstrapped confidence intervals (CIs) for analyzing peri-event signals between groups and compared with baseline, and permutation tests for comparing peri-event signals across comparison periods. We also include the ability to quickly and efficiently sort the data into mean time bins, if desired. This provides an open-source, user-friendly Python package for unbiased and standardized post hoc statistical analysis to improve reproducibility using data from any fiber photometry system.</p>

Tractometry uses diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) to assess physical properties of brain connections. Here, we present an integrative ecosystem of software that performs all steps of tractometry: post-processing of dMRI data, delineation of major white matter pathways, and modeling of the tissue properties within them. This ecosystem also provides a set of interoperable and extensible tools for visualization and interpretation of the results that extract insights from these measurements. These include novel machine learning and statistical analysis methods adapted to the characteristic structure of tract-based data. We benchmark the performance of these statistical analysis methods in different datasets and analysis tasks, including hypothesis testing on group differences and predictive analysis of subject age. We also demonstrate that computational advances implemented in the software offer orders of magnitude of acceleration. Taken together, these open-source software tools—freely available at https://tractometry.org—provide a transformative environment for the analysis of dMRI data.

                <p>by Matt J. Owen, Gary R. Mirams</p>

Ion channel models present many challenging optimisation problems. These include unidentifiable parameters, noisy data, unobserved states, and a combination of both fast and slow timescales. This can make it difficult to choose a suitable optimisation routine <i>a priori</i>. Nevertheless, many attempts have been made to design optimisation routines specifically for ion channel models, however, little work has been done to compare these optimisation approaches. We have developed ionBench, an open-source optimisation benchmarking framework, to evaluate and compare these approaches against a standard set of ion channel optimisation problems. We included implementations of thirty-four unique optimisation approaches that have been previously applied to ion channel models and evaluated them against the ionBench test suite, consisting of five parameter optimisation problems derived from the cardiac ion channel literature. Each optimisation approach was initiated from multiple starting parameters and tasked with reproducing a problem-specific simulated dataset. Through ionBench, we tracked and evaluated the performance of these optimisations, identifying the expected run time until a successful optimisation for each approach, which was used for comparisons. Finally, we used these results, in addition to other literature results, to identify a new efficient approach. Its use could reduce computation time by multiple orders of magnitude, while also improving the reliability of ion channel parameter optimisation.

                <p>by Friederike E. Kohrs, Natascha Drude, Anita Bandrowski, Tracey L. Weissgerber</p>

Many-author non-empirical papers include “how to” articles, recommendations or consensus statements, roadmaps for future research, catalogs of ideas, or calls to action. These papers benefit the research community and broader academic ecosystem by addressing unmet needs or introducing new perspectives and approaches. Large, diverse authorship teams that examine an issue from many different perspectives can create valuable resources that individual co-authors could not develop independently, or in smaller groups. Realizing the potential of many-author non-empirical papers, however, requires very different strategies than researchers would typically use to write papers with fewer authors. In our process, a core team of lead writers typically works together to lead the content generation and writing processes, while many co-authors collaboratively create content and provide feedback on outlines and drafts. Challenges for co-authors may include learning to write a different type of paper, adapting to high-volume feedback, and understanding the very diverse perspectives shared by fellow co-authors. This paper outlines ten simple rules for being a co-author on a many-author non-empirical paper. Although the rules were developed for papers with at least 30 authors, some rules may be useful for many-author research papers or for non-empirical papers with fewer authors. Co-authors may also want to consult our companion paper on ten simple rules for leading a many-author non-empirical paper, as understanding the challenges faced by lead writers will help co-authors to contribute more efficiently and effectively.

Many-author non-empirical papers include recommendations or consensus statements, catalogs of ideas, roadmaps for future research, calls to action, or “how to” articles. These papers have great potential to change the conversation or address unmet needs within research communities. Large, diverse authorship teams can create valuable resources that no individual co-author could create independently. Achieving these goals, however, requires a very different approach than researchers typically use to prepare papers with fewer authors. In the process we describe, a small team of lead writers typically leads the content generation and writing processes. Many co-authors collaborate to create content and provide feedback throughout the writing process. Lead writers face many challenges, including defining the content and structure of the paper, coordinating complex logistics, preparing themselves and co-authors for a unique writing experience, and managing high-volume feedback. Here, we outline ten simple rules for leading a many-author non-empirical paper. These rules guide readers through the content generation and writing processes and highlight practical solutions to common challenges. While these rules were developed by preparing non-empirical papers with at least 30 authors, some rules may apply to research papers or non-empirical papers with fewer authors. Lead writers can also use our companion paper, which shares ten simple rules for being a co-author on a many-author non-empirical paper, to prepare co-authors for an efficient and effective collaborative process.

                <p>by Antoinette Fang, Lakshin Kumar, Kate E. Creevy, Daniel E.L. Promislow, Jing Ma, the Dog Aging Project Consortium </p>

Comorbidity and its association with age are of great interest in geroscience. However, there are few model organisms that are well-suited to study comorbidities that will have high relevance to humans. In this light, we turn our attention to the companion dog. The companion dog shares many morbidities with humans. Thus, a better understanding of canine comorbidity relationships could benefit both humans and dogs. We present an analysis of canine comorbidity networks from the Dog Aging Project, a large epidemiological cohort study of companion dogs in the United States. We included owner-reported health conditions that occurred in at least 60 dogs (n = 160) and included only dogs that had at least one of those health conditions (n = 26,614). We constructed an undirected comorbidity network using a Poisson binomial test, adjusting for age, sex, sterilization status, breed background (i.e., purebred vs. mixed-breed), and weight. The comorbidity network reveals well-documented comorbidities, such as diabetes with cataracts and blindness, and hypertension with chronic kidney disease (CKD). In addition, this network also supports less well-studied comorbidity relationships, such as proteinuria with anemia. A directed comorbidity network accounting for time of reported condition onset suggests that diabetes precedes cataracts, elbow/hip dysplasia before osteoarthritis, and keratoconjunctivitis sicca before corneal ulcer, which are consistent with the canine literature. Analysis of age-stratified networks reveals that global centrality measures increase with age and are the highest in the Senior group compared to the Young Adult and Mature Adult groups. Only the Senior group identified the association between hypertension and CKD. Our results suggest that comorbidity network analysis is a promising method to enhance clinical knowledge and canine healthcare management.

                <p>by Marco Ghibaudi, Chiara La Rosa, Nikita Telitsyn, Jean-Marie Graїc, Chris G. Faulkes, Chet C. Sherwood, Luca Bonfanti</p>

Structural changes involving new neurons can occur through stem cell-driven neurogenesis, and through incorporation of late-maturing “immature” neurons into networks, namely undifferentiated neuronal precursors frozen in a state of arrested maturation. The latter have been found in the cerebral cortex and are particularly abundant in large-brained mammals, covarying with the size of the brain and cortex. Similar cells have been described in the amygdala of some species, although their features and interspecies variation remain poorly understood. Here, their occurrence, number, morphology, molecular expression, age-related changes, and anatomical distribution in amygdala subdivisions were systematically analyzed in eight diverse mammalian species (including mouse, naked mole rat, rabbit, marmoset, cat, sheep, horse, and chimpanzee) widely differing in neuroanatomy, brain size, life span, and socioecology. We identify converging evidence that these amygdala cells are immature neurons and show marked phylogenetic variation, with a significantly greater prevalence in primates. The immature cells are largely located within the amygdala’s basolateral complex, a region that has expanded in primate brain evolution in conjunction with cortical projections. In addition, amygdala immature neurons also appear to stabilize in number through adulthood and old age, unlike other forms of plasticity that undergo marked age-related reduction. These results support the emerging view that large brains performing complex socio-cognitive functions rely on wide reservoirs of immature neurons.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3003280">Plants respond to herbivory through sequential induction of cheaper defenses before more costly ones</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jinlong Wan, Jiahui Yi, Xiao Sun, Evan Siemann, Matthias Erb, Wei Huang</p>

Plants encounter natural antagonist threats of varying intensity and respond by activating multiple defense traits. Due to the fitness costs associated with producing defense traits, plants are expected to activate less costly traits first, reserving more costly defenses for potentially more severe damage (“cheaper first hypothesis”), but evidence to date is scarce. Here, we tested this hypothesis by measuring six putative defense traits in the annual plant <i>Ambrosia artemisiifolia</i>. We found that all traits were effective against insect herbivores, but production of three of them more strongly reduced plant growth, suggesting higher growth costs. When plants were attacked by insect herbivores, less costly traits were induced first, even at the lowest levels of damage, while more costly traits were activated only after higher damage thresholds. This cost-dependent sequential pattern was consistently observed in plants when challenged by 12 different herbivore species from three insect orders. These findings demonstrate that plants can employ the “cheaper first” sequential induction defense strategy, potentially allowing them to reduce defense costs and maximize fitness. Our study provides new insights into how plants fine-tune their defense responses under variable antagonistic pressures.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3003268">Transfer of motor learning is associated with patterns of activity in the default mode network</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Ali Rezaei, Corson N. Areshenkoff, Daniel J. Gale, Anouk J. De Brouwer, Joseph Y. Nashed, J. Randall Flanagan, Jason P. Gallivan</p>

An often-desired feature of motor learning is that it generalizes to untrained scenarios. Yet, how this is supported by brain activity remains poorly understood. Here we show, using human functional MRI and a sensorimotor adaptation task involving the transfer of learning from the trained to untrained hand, that the transfer phase of adaptation re-instantiates a highly similar large-scale pattern of brain activity to that observed during initial adaptation. Notably, we find that these neural changes, rather than occurring at the level of sensorimotor regions, predominantly occur across distributed areas of higher-order transmodal cortex, specifically in regions of the default mode network (DMN). Moreover, we show that these learning-related neural changes relate to the structural properties of transmodal cortex (its myelin content and neurotransmitter receptor density), and that intersubject differences in DMN activity relate to both adaptation- and transfer-phase task performance. Together, these findings suggest that the transfer of learning across the hands is supported by the re-expression of the same activity patterns in the DMN as those that support initial learning. Collectively, these results offer a unique characterization of the whole-brain macroscale changes associated with sensorimotor learning and generalization, and establish a key role for higher-order brain areas, such as the DMN, in the transfer of learning to untrained scenarios.

                <p>by Burcu Tepekule, Ai Ing Lim, Charlotte Jessica E. Metcalf</p>

To achieve immune and microbial homeostasis during adulthood, the developing immune system must learn to identify which microbes to tolerate and which to defend against. How such ‘immune education’ unfolds remains a major knowledge gap. We address this gap by synthesizing existing literature to develop a mechanistic mathematical model representing the interplay between gut ecology and adaptive immunity in humans during early life. Our results indicate that the inflammatory tone of the microenvironment is the mediator of information flow from pre- to post-weaning periods. We evaluate the power of postnatal fecal samples for predicting immunological trajectories and explore breastfeeding scenarios when maternal immunological conditions affect breastmilk composition. Our work establishes a quantitative basis for ‘immune education’, yielding insights into questions of applied relevance.

                <p>by Romain Strock, Valerie W.C. Soo, Pauline Misson, Georgia Roumelioti, Pavel V. Shliaha, Antoine Hocher, Tobias Warnecke</p>

The social life of archaea is poorly understood. In particular, even though competition and conflict are common themes in microbial communities, there is scant evidence documenting antagonistic interactions between archaea and their abundant prokaryotic brethren: bacteria. Do archaea specifically target bacteria for destruction? If so, what molecular weaponry do they use? Here, we present an approach to infer antagonistic interactions between archaea and bacteria from genome sequence. We show that a large and diverse set of archaea encode peptidoglycan hydrolases, enzymes that recognize and cleave a structure—peptidoglycan—that is a ubiquitous component of bacterial cell walls but absent from archaea. We predict the bacterial targets of archaeal peptidoglycan hydrolases using a structural homology approach and demonstrate that the predicted target bacteria tend to inhabit a similar niche to the archaeal producer, indicative of ecologically relevant interactions. Using a heterologous expression system, we demonstrate that two peptidoglycan hydrolases from the halophilic archaeaon <i>Halogranum salarium</i> B-1 kill the halophilic bacterium <i>Halalkalibacterium halodurans,</i> a predicted target, and do so in a manner consistent with peptidoglycan hydrolase activity. Our results suggest that, even though the tools and rules of engagement remain largely unknown, archaeal-bacterial conflicts are likely common, and we present a roadmap for the discovery of additional antagonistic interactions between these two domains of life. Our work has implications for understanding mixed microbial communities that include archaea and suggests that archaea might represent a large untapped reservoir of novel antibacterials.

Protein aggregation is a hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases and is also observed in the brains of elderly individuals without such conditions, suggesting that aging drives the accumulation of protein aggregates. However, the comprehensive understanding of age-dependent protein aggregates involved in brain aging remains unclear. Here, we investigated proteins that become sarkosyl-insoluble with age and identified hyaluronan and proteoglycan link protein 2 (HAPLN2), a hyaluronic acid-binding protein of the extracellular matrix at the nodes of Ranvier, as an age-dependent aggregating protein in mouse brains. Elevated hyaluronic acid levels and impaired microglial function reduced the clearance of HAPLN2, leading to its accumulation. HAPLN2 oligomers induced microglial inflammatory responses both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. Furthermore, age-associated HAPLN2 aggregation was also observed in the human cerebellum. These findings suggest that HAPLN2 aggregation results from age-related decline in brain homeostasis and may exacerbate the brain environment by activating microglia. This study provides new insights into the mechanisms underlying cerebellar aging and highlights the role of HAPLN2 in age-associated changes in the brain.

                Winter et al. synthesize recent advances in the understanding of spinal projecting neurons—a specialized population of brain neurons that extend axons into the spinal cord to regulate motor, sensory, and autonomic functions. The authors propose a conceptual framework for understanding brain-control of bodily functions.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/106611">Occupancy of the HbYX hydrophobic pocket is sufficient to induce gate opening in the archaeal 20S proteasomes</a></h4>

              
                Enhancing proteasome function has been a long-standing but challenging target of interest for the potential treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, emphasizing the importance of understanding proteasome activation mechanisms. Most proteasome activator complexes use the C-terminal HbYX (hydrophobic-tyrosine-almost any residue) motif to bind and trigger gate-opening in the 20 S proteasome. This study defines a critical molecular interaction in the HbYX mechanism that triggers gate opening. We focus on the Hb site interaction and find it plays a surprisingly central and crucial role in driving the allosteric conformational changes that induce gate opening in the archaeal 20 S. We examined the cryo-EM structure of two mutant archaeal proteasomes, αV24Y T20S and αV24F T20S. These two mutants were engineered to place a bulky aromatic residue in the HbYX hydrophobic pocket; both mutants are highly active, though their mechanisms of activation are undefined. Collectively, our findings indicate that the interaction between the Hb group of the HbYX motif and its corresponding hydrophobic pocket is sufficient to induce gate opening in a mechanistically similar way to the HbYX motif. The activation mechanism studied here involves the expansion of the hydrophobic binding site, allosterically altering the state of the IT switch, thus triggering gate opening. Furthermore, we show that the canonical αK66 residue, previously understood to be critical for proteasome activator binding, also plays a key role in stabilizing the open gate, irrespective of activator binding. This study differentiates between the residues in the HbYX motif that support binding interactions (‘YX’) versus those that allosterically contribute to gate opening (‘Hb’). The insights reported here will guide future drug development efforts, particularly in designing small molecule proteasome activators, by targeting the identified hydrophobic pocket.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94165">Progressively shifting patterns of co-modulation among premotor cortex neurons carry dynamically similar signals during action execution and observation</a></h4>

              
                Neurons in macaque premotor cortex show firing rate modulation whether the subject performs an action or observes another individual performing a similar action. Although such mirror neurons have been thought to have highly congruent discharge during execution and observation, many, if not most, show noncongruent activity. Studies of reaching movements, for which low-dimensional neural trajectories exhibit comparatively simple dynamical motifs, have shown that these prevalent patterns of co-modulation pass through subspaces which are shared in part, but in part are visited exclusively during either execution or observation. The neural dynamics of hand movements are more complex, however. We developed a novel approach to examine prevalent patterns of co-modulation during execution and observation of a task that involved reaching, grasping, and manipulation. Rather than following neural trajectories in subspaces that contain their entire time course, we identified time series of instantaneous subspaces, calculated principal angles among them, sampled trajectory segments at the times of selected behavioral events, and projected those segments into the time series of instantaneous subspaces. These instantaneous neural subspaces most often remained distinct during execution versus observation. Nevertheless, latent dynamics during execution and observation could be partially aligned with canonical correlation, indicating some similarity of the relationships among neural representations of different movements relative to one another during execution and observation. We also found that during action execution, mirror neurons showed consistent patterns of co-modulation both within and between sessions, but other non-mirror neurons that were modulated only during action execution and not during observation showed considerable variability of co-modulation.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97100">Syngap1 regulates the synaptic drive and membrane excitability of Parvalbumin-positive interneurons in mouse auditory cortex</a></h4>

              
                SYNGAP1 haploinsufficiency-related intellectual disability (SYNGAP1-ID) is characterized by moderate to severe ID, generalized epilepsy, autism spectrum disorder, sensory processing dysfunction, and other behavioral abnormalities. While numerous studies have highlighted a role of Syngap1 in cortical excitatory neurons development, recent studies suggest that Syngap1 plays a role in GABAergic inhibitory neuron development as well. However, the molecular pathways by which Syngap1 acts on GABAergic neurons, and whether they are similar or different from the mechanisms underlying its effects in excitatory neurons, are unknown. Here, we examined whether, and how, embryonic-onset <i>Syngap1</i> haploinsufficiency restricted to GABAergic interneurons derived from the medial ganglionic eminence (MGE) impacts their synaptic and intrinsic properties in adult primary auditory cortex (A1). We found that <i>Syngap1</i> haploinsufficiency significantly affected the intrinsic properties, overall leading to increased firing threshold and decreased excitatory synaptic drive in Parvalbumin (PV)+ neurons in adult layer IV A1. Further, the AMPA component of thalamocortical evoked EPSC was decreased in PV+ cells from mutant mice. Mutant somatostatin (SST)+ interneurons exhibited decreased spontaneous excitatory input and impaired evoked firing without alterations in firing threshold. Finally, we found that the selective blocking of voltage-gated D-type K<sup>+</sup> currents was sufficient to rescue PV+ mutant cell-intrinsic properties to wild-type levels. Together, these data suggest that <i>Syngap1</i> plays a specific role in the maturation of PV+ cell-intrinsic properties and synaptic drive, and its haploinsufficiency may lead to reduced PV cell recruitment in the adult A1, which could in turn contribute to the auditory processing alterations found in SYNGAP1-ID preclinical models and patients.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/103321">Interplay of YEATS2 and GCDH regulates histone crotonylation and drives EMT in head and neck cancer</a></h4>

              
                The regulation of gene expression is an integral cellular process orchestrated by epigenetic marks like histone modifications. Perturbations in the activity or abundance of epigenetic factors can lead to tumorigenesis. Remarkably, several metabolites influence the epigenetic landscape in cells. Here, we investigated the interplay between a highly expressed epigenetic factor, YEATS2, and a metabolic enzyme, GCDH, in regulating epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in head and neck cancer. We report that the histone reader YEATS2 is responsible for increased invasive potential in head and neck cancer in an SP1-dependent manner. YEATS2 functions by maintaining histone crotonylation, and its abrogation leads to a global decrease in the H3K27cr mark. Mechanistically, we report that YEATS2 maintains high promoter H3K27cr levels by assisting in the recruitment of crotonyltransferase p300 at the promoter of the EMT-promoting gene <i>SPARC</i>. Furthermore, we found that the addition of the H3K27cr mark is also dependent on the crotonyl-CoA-producing enzyme GCDH. Overall, we describe a novel mechanism of interplay between epigenetics and metabolism in head and neck tumorigenesis, which results in the enhanced expression of EMT-related genes in a histone crotonylation-dependent manner.

                <p>Sensory-motor control requires the integration and monitoring of sensory feedback resulting from our behaviors. This self-monitoring is thought to result from comparisons between predictions about the expected sensory consequences of action and the feedback actually received, resulting in activity that encodes feedback error. Although similar mechanisms have been proposed during speech and vocal production, including sensitivity to experimentally perturbed auditory feedback, evidence for a vocal "error signal" has been limited. Here, we recorded from the auditory cortex of vocalizing nonhuman primates, using real-time frequency shifts to introduce feedback errors of varying magnitude and direction. We found neural activity that scaled with the magnitude of feedback error in both directions, consistent with vocal error monitoring at both the individual unit and population levels. This feedback sensitivity was greater than expected based upon passive sensory responses and was specific for units in the vocal frequency range. Feedback responses also predicted subsequent compensatory changes in vocal production. These results provide evidence that the auditory cortex encodes the degree of vocal feedback error using both unit-level error calculations and changes in the population of neurons involved. These mechanisms may provide critical error information necessary for feedback-dependent vocal control.</p>

                <p>Rapsyn is a scaffold protein that is thought to anchor acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ). We showed that it may be an E3 ligase that regulates NMJ development by neddylation. To obtain genetical evidence, we mutated Nae1 (APP-BP1), an obligatory subunit of the neddylation E1 enzyme specifically in muscle cells. The mutation decreased the stability of acetylcholine receptor (AChR)&alpha;, reduced AChR clustering, and impaired NMJ development in <I>Pax7-Cre;Nae1f/f</I> mice (of either sex) and caused neonatal lethality. Moreover, while NMJs were normal in heterozygous mutant mice of Nae1 or rapsyn C366A (a knock-in mutation that eliminates E3 ligase activity), double heterozygous mutant mice (of either sex) displayed NMJ deficits, indicative of a genetic interaction between Nae1 and rapsyn. These results provide genetic evidence for a role of neddylation in NMJ formation and support the notion that rapsyn serves as a neddylation E3 ligase in NMJ formation.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/33/e0299252025?rss=1">Motor Sequence Learning Involves Better Prediction of the Next Action and Optimization of Movement Trajectories</a></h4>

              
                <p>Learning new sequential movements is a fundamental skill for many animals. Motor sequence learning may arise from three distinct processes: (1) improved execution of individual movements independent of their sequential context; (2) enhanced anticipation of "what" movement should be executed next, enabling faster initiation; and (3) the development of motoric sequence-specific representations that encode "how" movements should be optimally performed within a sequence. However, many existing paradigms conflate the "what" and "how" components of learning, as participants often acquire both the sequence content (what to do) and its execution (how to do it). This overlap obscures the distinct contributions of each mechanism to motor sequence learning. In this study, we disentangled these mechanisms in a continuous reaching task by varying how many upcoming targets were visible. When participants (<I>n</I> = 14, 8F) could only see one future target, improvements were mostly due to them learning which target would come next. When they could see four future targets, participants immediately demonstrated faster movement times and increased movement smoothness, surpassing late-stage performance in the one-target condition. Crucially, even with full visibility of future targets, participants showed further sequence-specific learning driven by a continuous optimization of movement trajectories. Follow-up experiments (<I>n</I> = 42, 21F) revealed that the learned sequence representations did not generalize in extrinsic coordinates across limbs and encoded contextual information of four movements or longer. Our paradigm dissociates between the "what" and "how" components of motor sequence learning and provides evidence for the development of motoric sequence representations that guide optimal movement execution.</p>

                <p>Rhythms at a population level are a defining characteristic of both normal and pathological cortical activities, but it is unclear how such rhythms interact with the activity of specific neurons to impact task performance on a trial-by-trial basis. We address this by employing a challenging visual detection task in which male rhesus macaques must signal the presentation of a shape embedded in a noisy background. We analyzed the rhythmic activity in the local field potential (LFP) and single neuron activity in area V4, a brain area strongly implicated in shape perception, prior to such presentations and focused on two different frequency ranges: alpha/beta (10&ndash;30 Hz), in which coherence was particularly strong and spatially extensive, and gamma (50&ndash;70 Hz), which has traditionally been strongly associated with single unit activity. We find that within sessions, there were periods of time during which successful detection was associated with the absence of rhythmic activity prior to shape presentation in either frequency range. During these periods, rhythmic quiescence prior to shape presentation could predict whether the shape would be detected by the animal with high accuracy. Importantly, for both frequency ranges, the individual neurons carrying the most relevant information with regard to the task had the weakest coupling to LFP rhythms. These results are consistent with spatially distributed rhythmic activity acting as a source of decision noise in the context of rapid visual detection by reducing the moment-to-moment reliability of task-relevant information carried by individual neurons.</p>

                <p>Dopamine is an important neuromodulator found throughout the central nervous system that can influence neural circuits involved in sensory, motor, and cognitive functions. In the retina, dopamine is released by specific amacrine cells and plays a role in reconfiguring circuits for photopic vision. This adaptation takes place both in photoreceptors and at postreceptoral sites. The AII amacrine cell, which plays a crucial role for transmission of both scotopic and photopic visual signals, has been considered an important target of dopaminergic modulation, expressed as a change in the strength of electrical coupling mediated by gap junctions between the AIIs. It has been difficult, however, to find clear evidence for expression of dopamine receptors by AII amacrines. Here, we combined injection of fluorescent dye in AIIs with immunolabeling of type 1 dopamine receptors (D1Rs) and made the surprising observation that D1Rs, along with KCNQ2, an M-type K<sup>+</sup> channel, are expressed at the AII axon initial segment-like process (AII-AIS) that also expresses voltage-gated Na<sup>+</sup> (Na<SUB>v</SUB>) channels and generates action potentials. With current-clamp recording of AIIs in rat (male, female) retinal slices, we found that D1R activation reduced spike frequency and increased spike threshold. Taken together with experiments using immunolabeling, pharmacological manipulation, and computational modeling, our results suggest that activation of D1Rs on AIIs reduces the intrinsic excitability of these cells, likely mediated by an intracellular signal transduction pathway involving cAMP, PKA, and phosphorylation of Na<SUB>v</SUB> channels in the AII-AIS. These results suggest a novel mechanism for the role of dopamine in retinal adaptation.</p>

                <p>Primary cilia are conserved sensory hubs essential for signaling transduction and embryonic development. Ciliary dysfunction causes a variety of developmental syndromes with neurological features and cognitive impairment whose basis mostly remains unknown. Despite connections to neural function, the primary cilium remains an overlooked organelle in the brain. Most neurons have a primary cilium; however, it is still unclear how this organelle modulates brain architecture and function, given the lack of any systemic dissection of neuronal ciliary signaling. Here, we present the first in vivo glance at the molecular composition of cilia in the mouse brain. We have adapted in vivo proximity-dependent biotin identification (iBioID), targeting the biotin ligase BioID2 to primary cilia in neurons of male and female mice. We identified tissue-specific signaling networks residing in neuronal cilia, including Eph/Ephrin signaling. We also uncovered a novel connection between primary cilia and gamma-aminobutyric acid signaling. Our iBioID ciliary network presents a wealth of new and neural-specific ciliary signaling proteins and yields new insights into neurological disorders. Our findings are a promising first step in defining the fundamentals of ciliary signaling and their roles in shaping neural circuits and behavior. In the future, this work can be extended to pathological conditions of the brain, with the goal of identifying ciliary signaling pathways disrupted in these disorders and the ultimate aim of finding novel therapeutic strategies.</p>

                <p><I>N</I>-Methyl-<scp>d</scp>-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) control synaptic plasticity and brain development in a manner determined by receptor subunit composition. Pathogenic variants in <I>GRIN2A</I> gene, encoding the NMDAR GluN2A subunit, can cause gain or loss of function of receptors containing the affected subunit and are associated with intellectual disability and epilepsy in patients. While in vitro studies of recombinant receptors have yielded some insights, animal experimental models are essential to better understand the relationship between the molecular pathology of the variants and the disease. Here we introduce a zebrafish model of GluN2A loss of function to study system-level effects of zebrafish <I>grin2Aa</I> and <I>grin2Ab</I> gene deletion. Our electrophysiological analysis revealed functional differences between receptors containing zebrafish GluN2Aa/b and GluN2Bb paralogs comparable with mammalian receptors containing GluN2A versus GluN2B subunits. Both <I>grin2Aa<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup></I> and <I>grin2Ab<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup></I> as well as double-knock-out <I>grin2A<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup></I> zebrafish larvae showed increased locomotor activity in a novel environment. Proteomic analysis suggested that the relative proportion of GluN2B-containing NMDARs may be increased in <I>grin2A</I> mutant fish. Our results highlight fundamental similarities between zebrafish and mammalian NMDAR signaling and validate the use of zebrafish as a model organism to study the neurodevelopmental role of NMDARs. The newly created transgenic zebrafish strains complement the rodent models of GluN2A loss of function and can be used for high-throughput testing of pharmacological or genetic treatment strategies for patients with <I>GRIN2A</I> gene variants.</p>

                <p>Nitrous oxide use disorder (NUD) has recently received increasing social concern for its sharp rise among young people. However, the underlying mechanisms of NUD remain largely unexplored, which obstructs treatment strategy development and may exacerbate the epidemic of N<SUB>2</SUB>O abuse. Thus, specifying the essential mechanisms and targets in NUD are desperately needed. Here we unveiled a series of molecular adaptations regarding N<SUB>2</SUB>O reward memory in nucleus accumbens (NAc) of mice through multi-omics approaches comprising transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics approaches. Our miRNA transcriptomics and pull-down proteomics analyzes uncovered that miR-7220-5p regulated N<SUB>2</SUB>O-induced conditioned-place preference (CPP) and associated increase of dendritic spine density in NAc of male mice. Our pull-down proteomics and metabolomics analyses revealed that miR-7220-5p modulated ERK signaling pathway by directly binding with NR2B receptor. In summary, our work confirmed that restoring miR-7220-5p expression in NAc protected against synaptic abnormality via the NR2B/ERK/CREB signaling, thereby attenuating CPP behaviors in NUD. Selective inhibition of NR2B or ERK signaling blocked the reward memory of N<SUB>2</SUB>O-CPP via NAc microinjection. Our study proposed a potential therapeutic strategy for NUD and provided comprehensive resources of biological data to support future investigations of NUD treatment.</p>

                <p>The dynamics of social dominance play a significant role in regulating access to resources and influencing reproductive success and survival in nonhuman primates. These dynamics are based on aggressive and submissive interactions that create distinct, hierarchically organized social structures. In humans, whose social behavior is similarly organized, the use of brain imaging based on tractography has identified key neuronal networks of the limbic system underlying social behavior. Among them, the uncinate fasciculus and the cingulum bundle have been associated with aggression and some disorders such as psychopathy. In this study, we have used advanced tractography to study the anatomy of connections underlying social dominance in a colony of 15 female squirrel monkeys (<I>Saimiri sciureus</I>). We correlated the biostructural properties of the uncinate fasciculus and cingulum with behavioral hierarchy measures while controlling for factors such as age, weight, handedness, brain size, and hormonal influences. The fornix, a limbic connection involved in memory, was also included as the control tract. Our findings indicate a significant correlation between the integrity of the right uncinate fasciculus and social dominance measures, including normalized David's scores, aggressive behaviors, and submissive behaviors. Trends observed in the left uncinate fasciculus hint at potential bilateral involvement with a right hemispheric lateralization. These results are consistent with human studies linking the uncinate fasciculus to social aggression and disorders, suggesting an evolutionary continuity in the neuroanatomical substrates of social dominance back to at least 35 million years.</p>

                <p>Traumatic brain injury (TBI) can lead to long-lasting cognitive deficits in the human brain, with a considerable contribution of secondary morphological and functional sequela in cortical regions distant to the lesion site. In order to uncover the role of early functional alterations in parvalbumin-positive basket cells (PV-BCs), an interneuron population required to maintain inhibition of neocortical circuits, to this dysfunctional plasticity, we investigated anatomical and electrophysiological properties of PV-BCs in PV-IRES-Cre-tdTomato mice of both sexes 24&nbsp;h after a cortical impact. These experiments revealed that the number of PV-BCs was moderately decreased around the cortical impact site, while their morphology was unaffected. Patch-clamp experiments demonstrated that TBI increased the input resistance of PV-BCs and the amplitude of hyperpolarization-activated inward currents (<I>I</I><SUB>h</SUB>). In addition, the maximal firing frequency upon depolarizing stimuli was decreased. The increase in <I>I</I><SUB>h</SUB> amplitude was paralleled by the appearance of somatic HCN channels in immunohistochemical staining and the occurrence of somatic <I>I</I><SUB>h</SUB> in nucleated patch recordings, suggesting that TBI induced a redistribution of HCN channels from a purely axonal to an additional somatodendritic expression. Pharmacological experiments showed that inhibition of axonal HCN-mediated currents impairs the maximal firing frequency of PV-BCs. Additional in silico simulations disclosed the general importance of axonal HCN channels to maintain high-frequency firing of PV-BCs by counteracting Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup>-pump associated hyperpolarizing currents. In summary, our results suggest that the early loss of PV-BCs and the TBI-induced distinct alterations in their electrophysiological properties can contribute to the establishment of disturbed network activity following TBI.</p>

                <p>by Dimitrios Chalkiadakis, Jaime Sánchez-Claros, Víctor J. López-Madrona, Santiago Canals, Claudio R. Mirasso</p>

Interactions among brain rhythms play a crucial role in organizing neuronal firing sequences during specific cognitive functions. In memory formation, the coupling between the phase of the theta rhythm and the amplitude of gamma oscillations has been extensively studied in the hippocampus. Prevailing perspectives suggest that the phase of the slower oscillation modulates the fast activity. However, recent metrics, such as Cross-Frequency Directionality (CFD), indicate that these electrophysiological interactions can be bidirectional. Using a computational model, we demonstrate that feedforward inhibition modeled by a theta-modulated ING (Interneuron Network Gamma) mechanism induces fast-to-slow interactions, while feedback inhibition through a theta-modulated PING (Pyramidal Interneuron Network Gamma) model drives slow-to-fast interactions. Importantly, in circuits combining both feedforward and feedback motifs, as commonly found experimentally, directionality is flexibly modulated by synaptic strength within biologically realistic ranges. A signature of this interaction is that fast-to-slow dominance in feedforward motifs is associated with gamma oscillations of higher frequency, and <i>vice versa</i>. Using previously acquired electrophysiological data from the hippocampus of rats freely navigating in a familiar environment or in a novel one, we show that CFD is dynamically regulated and linked to the frequency of the gamma band, as predicted by the model. Finally, the model attributes each theta-gamma interaction scheme, determined by the balance between feedforward and feedback inhibition, to distinct modes of information transmission and integration, adding computational flexibility. Our results offer a plausible neurobiological interpretation for cross-frequency directionality measurements associated with the activation of different underlying motifs that serve distinct computational needs.

                <p>by R. Tucker Gilman, CD Durrant, Lucy Malpas, Rebecca N. Lewis</p>

In human languages, words that are used more frequently tend to be shorter than words that are used less frequently. This pattern is known as Zipf’s law of abbreviation. It has been attributed to the principle of least effort – communication is more efficient when words that are used more frequently are easier to produce. Zipf’s law of abbreviation appears to hold in all human languages, and recently attention has turned to whether it also holds in animal communication. In birdsong, which has been used as a model for human language learning and development, researchers have focused on whether more frequently used notes or phrases are shorter than those that are used less frequently. Because birdsong can be highly stereotyped, have high interindividual variation, and have phrase repertoires that are small relative to human language lexicons, studying Zipf’s law of abbreviation in birdsong presents challenges that do not arise when studying human languages. In this paper, we describe a new method for assessing evidence for Zipf’s law of abbreviation in birdsong, and we introduce the R package ZLAvian to implement this method. We used ZLAvian to study Zipf’s law of abbreviation in the songs of 11 bird populations archived in the open-access repository Bird-DB. We did not find strong evidence for Zipf’s law of abbreviation in any population when studied alone, but we found evidence for Zipf’s law in a synthetic analysis across all populations. Overall, the negative concordance between phrase length and frequency of use in birdsong was several times weaker than the negative concordance between word length and frequency of use in written human languages. The method and the results we present here offer a new foundation for researchers studying if or how the principle of least effort shapes animal communication.

Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are gaining increasing traction in the treatment of oncological diseases; however, many clinical failures have also been observed. One key factor limiting ADC effectiveness is the heterogeneous expression of their target antigen. While the vast majority of ADCs in clinical development target antigens on cancer cells (cancer-targeting), they can also target antigens expressed on non-cancerous stromal cells in the tumor microenvironment (stroma-targeting). It remains unclear if ADCs targeting stromal cells can outperform cancer-targeting ADCs. Here, we present three related mathematical models to evaluate: (1) cancer-targeting ADCs with homogeneous target antigen expression, (2) cancer-targeting ADCs with heterogeneous target antigen expression, and (3) stroma-targeting ADCs. Our simulations suggest that cancer-targeting ADCs can achieve high efficacy when their target antigen is homogenously expressed. However, in cases of heterogeneous antigen expression, cancer-targeting ADCs may lead to an initial reduction in tumor size, followed by regrowth due to the elimination of antigen-positive cells and expansion of antigen-negative cells. This limitation could potentially be overcome by stroma-targeting ADCs, as antigen-positive stromal cells may continue to be recruited into the tumor by the oncogenic factors produced by the remaining cancer cells. Furthermore, we demonstrate that ADCs with more permeable payloads and less stable linkers may offer improved efficacy in the context of heterogeneous target expression.

<i>Campylobacter spp.</i> resistant to fluoroquinolones and macrolides are serious public health threats. Studies aiming to identify risk factors for drug-resistant <i>Campylobacter</i> have narrowly focused on antimicrobial use at the farm level. Using chain graphs, we quantified risk factors for fluoroquinolones- and macrolide-resistance in <i>Campylobacter coli</i> isolated from two distinctive swine production systems, conventional and antibiotic-free (ABF). The chain graphs were learned using genotypic and antimicrobial susceptibility data from 1082 isolates and host exposures obtained through surveys for 14 cohorts of pigs. The gyrA T86I point mutation alone explained at least 58% of the variance in ciprofloxacin minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for ABF and 79% in conventional farms. For macrolides, genotype and host exposures explained similar variance in azithromycin and erythromycin MIC. Among host exposures, heavy metal exposures were identified as risk factors in both conventional and ABF. Chain graph models can generate insights into the complex epidemiology of antimicrobial resistance by characterizing context-specific risk factors and facilitating causal discovery.

                <p>by Daniel Sobrido-Cameán, Bramwell Coulson, Michael Miller, Matthew C. W. Oswald, Tom Pettini, David M. D. Bailey, Richard A. Baines, Matthias Landgraf</p>

As developing networks transition from spontaneous irregular to patterned activity, they undergo plastic tuning phases, termed “critical periods”; “critical” because disturbances during these phases can lead to lasting changes in network development and output. Critical periods are common to developing nervous systems, with analogous features shared from insects to mammals, yet the core signaling mechanisms that underlie cellular critical period plasticity have remained elusive. To identify these, we exploited the <i>Drosophila</i> larval locomotor network as an advantageous model system. It has a defined critical period and offers unparalleled access to identified network elements, including the neuromuscular junction as a model synapse. We find that manipulations of a single motoneuron or muscle cell during the critical period lead to predictable, and permanent, cell-specific changes. This demonstrates that critical period adjustments occur at a single-cell level. Mechanistically, we identified mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) as causative. Specifically, we show that ROS produced by Complex-I of the mitochondrial electron transport chain, generated by the reverse flow of electrons, is necessary and instructive for critical period-regulated plasticity. Downstream of ROS, we identified the <i>Drosophila</i> homologue of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF-1α), as required for transducing the mitochondrial ROS signal to the nucleus. This signaling axis is also sufficient to cell autonomously specify changes in neuronal properties and animal behavior but, again, only when activated during the embryonic critical period. Thus, we have identified specific mitochondrial ROS and HIF-1α as primary signals that mediate critical period plasticity.

<p>ASDs are neurodevelopmental disorders of social behavior deficits and repetitive / restricted behaviors, affecting 1 in 31 children in the U.S. Pharmacological interventions for the core symptoms of ASD are lacking. ASD genetics are highly heterogenous, with hundreds of genes conferring risk, though these genes are beginning to converge on shared molecular, cellular, and circuit mechanisms, representing potential new paths for treatment development.

<p>Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are a group of neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by deficits in social communication and interaction and the presence of repetitive and restricted behaviors. ASDs are clinically and genetically heterogeneous with hundreds of genes identified through large-scale whole exome and genome sequencing studies contributing to risk. Recent studies are beginning to illuminate shared mechanisms across ASD-associated genes at the molecular, cellular, circuit, and behavioral levels, identifying neurogenesis and excitatory-inhibitory neuron development as points of biological convergence. These functional analyses of ASD genes provide substantial promise for gaining a deeper understanding of ASD pathophysiology and elucidating novel therapeutic targets.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The efficacy and safety of intra-arterial thrombolysis (IAT) as an adjunct to endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) in large vessel occlusion strokes (LVOS) remain uncertain, with recent randomized controlled trials (RCTs) yielding conflicting results. This meta-analysis aimed to assess the impact of IAT following successful EVT in patients with LVOS.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>A comprehensive search was conducted across PubMed, <a target="_blank"
   title="Link to external resource"
   href="http://clinicaltrials.gov">ClinicalTrials.gov</a>, the Cochrane Library databases, and the International Stroke Conference 2025 abstracts to identify RCTs evaluating IAT following successful EVT from January 2015 to February 2025. The primary outcome was the odds of achieving an excellent functional outcome (defined as a modified Rankin Scale [mRS] = 0–1 at 90 days). Secondary outcomes included 90-day functional independence (mRS = 0–2). Safety measures included symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH), and mortality at 90 days. The protocol was registered in PROSPERO (CRD420250651602).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The primary pooled analysis of 6 RCTs (<i>N</i> = 1,974) showed that IAT significantly increased the likelihood of achieving excellent functional outcome at 90 days (mRS = 0–1: odds ratio [OR] = 1.47, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.21–1.80, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), with a notable effect in anterior circulation (OR = 1.48, 95% CI = 1.18–1.87, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) but not in posterior circulation LVOS (OR = 1.51, 95% CI = 0.83–2.74, <i>p</i> = 0.18). Among thrombolytic drugs, alteplase was most strongly associated with favorable outcomes (mRS = 0–1: OR = 1.94, 95% CI = 1.31–2.87, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), followed by tenecteplase (OR = 1.43, 95% CI = 1.08–1.89, <i>p</i> = 0.01). No significant safety concerns were observed, as there was no increase in the odds of sICH (OR = 1.15, 95% CI = 0.75–1.75, <i>p</i> = 0.51) or 90-day mortality (OR = 1.00, 95% CI = 0.79–1.26, <i>p</i> = 0.99). Sensitivity analyses for all outcomes yielded consistent results.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>IAT following successful EVT significantly enhances the likelihood of achieving an excellent functional outcome, particularly in anterior circulation strokes. Although the benefit in posterior circulation strokes remains uncertain, the lack of significant differences in sICH risk and mortality across thrombolytic drugs and stroke locations support the safety of IAT.
