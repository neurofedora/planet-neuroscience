                <p>Nature Communications, Published online: 22 August 2022; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-31604-w">doi:10.1038/s41467-022-31604-w</a></p>Studies of twisted bilayer transition metal dichalcogenides have so far focused only on those containing group-VI metals. Here, the authors predict that twisted bilayers of ZrS2, with the group-IV metal Zr, form an emergent moiré Kagome lattice with a uniquely strong spin-orbit coupling, leading to quantum-anomalous-Hall and fractional-Chern-insulating states.

                The mammalian inferior colliculus (IC) is thought to encode sound location. However, large-scale simultaneous recordings are lacking to characterise the underlying neuronal population code. Using volumetric two-photon calcium imaging in awake mice, here we simultaneously recorded the activity of ~1,000 IC neurons in response to sounds delivered from 13 different frontal horizontal locations (azimuths). The population responses showed marked trial-to-trial variability and revealed the recruitment of distinct groups of noise-correlated IC neurons as a function of stimulus azimuth. We tested decoding model performance on our data and found that template matching outperformed previously proposed models, where noise correlations helped improve the decoding accuracy. Finally, our volumetric imaging approach revealed that both the central nucleus and dorsal cortex of IC contribute to sound location coding. These findings indicate that noise correlations, together with azimuth tuning, play a key role in shaping the population code for sound location in the mammalian IC.

	<p>Despite the fact that the urge to investigate bilingualism and neurodevelopmental disorders as continuous indices rather than categorical ones has been well-voiced among researchers with respect to research methodological approaches, in the recent literature, when it comes to examining language, cognitive skills and neurodivergent characteristics, it is still the case that the most prevalent view is the categorisation of adults or children into groups. In other words, there is a categorisation of individuals, e.g., monolingual vs. bilingual children or children with typical and atypical/non-typical/non-neurotypical development. We believe that this labelling is responsible for the conflicting results that we often come across in studies. The aim of this review is to bring to the surface the importance of individual differences through the study of relevant articles conducted in bilingual children and children with autism, who are ideal for this study. We concur with researchers who already do so, and we further suggest moving away from labels and instead shift towards the view that not everything is either white or black. We provide suggestions as to how this shift could be implemented in research, while mostly aiming at starting a discourse rather than offering a definite path.</p>

     alt="Analysis of the distribution of vagal afferent projections from different peripheral organs to the nucleus of the solitary tract in rats"/>
<p>We injected retrograde pseudotyped adeno-associated viruses into different peripheral organs and mapped the axonal projections of vagal viscerosensory neurons within the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS). We observed no obvious viscerotopy, with axons from different organs overlapping in NTS subnuclei and with NTS neurons of different neurochemical phenotype. The implications for deciphering this viscerosensory code are discussed.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Anatomical tracing studies examining the vagal system can conflate details of sensory afferent and motor efferent neurons. Here, we used a serotype of adeno-associated virus that transports retrogradely and exhibits selective tropism for vagal afferents, to map their soma location and central termination sites within the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS). We examined the vagal sensory afferents innervating the trachea, duodenum, stomach, or heart, and in some animals, from two organs concurrently. We observed no obvious somatotopy in the somata distribution within the nodose ganglion. The central termination patterns of afferents from different organs within the NTS overlap substantially. Convergence of vagal afferent inputs from different organs onto single NTS neurons is observed. Abdominal and thoracic afferents terminate throughout the NTS, including in the rostral NTS, where the 7th cranial nerve inputs are known to synapse. To address whether the axonal labeling produced by viral transduction is so widespread because it fills axons traveling to their targets, and not just terminal fields, we labeled pre and postsynaptic elements of vagal afferents in the NTS . Vagal afferents form multiple putative synapses as they course through the NTS, with each vagal afferent neuron distributing sensory signals to multiple second-order NTS neurons. We observe little selectivity between vagal afferents from different visceral targets and NTS neurons with common neurochemical phenotypes, with afferents from different organs making close appositions with the same NTS neuron. We conclude that specific viscerosensory information is distributed widely within the NTS and that the coding of this input is probably determined by the intrinsic properties and projections of the second-order neuron.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neurogenic induction by Ngfr reduces reactive astrocytic Lcn2/Slc22a17 signalling, amyloid deposition and Tau phosphorylation</a></h4>

              
                Defects in neurogenic ability in humans could be a culprit of the etiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Enhancing the neurogenic outcome in humans could enhance resilience to counteract neurodegeneration. However, molecular mechanisms that enhance neural stem cell neurogenic potential are largely unknown. We previously showed that zebrafish uses nerve growth factor receptor (NGFR) signalling to enhance pathology-induced neurogenesis. Here, we show that induction of NGFR signalling in mouse astroglia also induce proliferative and neurogenic capacity in the APP/PS1dE9 AD mouse model. Single-cell transcriptomics, spatial proteomics, and functional knockdown experiments showed that NGFR suppressed reactive astrocyte marker Lipocalin-2 (Lcn2). Blockage of Lcn2 receptor, Slc22a17, recapitulated the neurogenic effects of NGFR, and long-term NGFR expression reduced amyloid plaques and Tau phosphorylation. Immunostaining on postmortem human hippocampi with AD or primary age-related Tauopathy and 3D human astroglial cultures showed elevated LCN2 levels correlate with gliosis. Our study link the regulatory role of an autocrine molecular mechanism in astroglia to the neurogenic ability and modulatory effects on pathological hallmarks of AD, supporting the promise of neurogenesis-oriented therapeutic approaches as potential clinical interventions for this disease.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Pre-symptomatic reduction of individuality in the App NL-F knock-in model of Alzheimer's disease</a></h4>

              
                While one third of the risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD) is explained by environment and lifestyle, AD pathology also affects individual lifestyle, possibly long before clinical manifestation of dementia. To study this hidden disease effect with its potentially large impact on coping with AD, we examined in mice how the App NL-F/NL-F (NL-F) knock-in mutation affects the pre-symptomatic response to environmental enrichment (ENR). We assessed the emergence of inter-individual phenotypic variation while both genetic background and the shared environment were held constant, thereby isolating the contribution of individual behavior ('non-shared environment'). After 4 months of ENR, in NL-F both mean and variability of plasma ApoE were increased, suggesting a pre-symptomatic variation in pathogenic processes. Roaming entropy (RE) as a measure of behavioral activity was continuously assessed with radiofrequency identification (RFID) technology and revealed reduced habituation and variance in NL-F compared to controls. Intra-individual variation decreased but behavioral predictability and stability were reduced in NL-F. Seven months after discontinuation of ENR we found no difference in plaque size and number, but ENR increased variance in hippocampal plaque counts in NL-F. A reactive increase in adult hippocampal neurogenesis in NL-F, known from other models, was normalized by ENR. Our data suggest that, while NL-F has early effects on individual behavioral patterns in response to ENR, there are lasting effects at the level of cellular plasticity even after discontinuation of ENR. Hence, early behavior matters for maintaining individual behavioral trajectories and brain plasticity even under maximally constraint conditions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">3D reconstruction of the cerebellar germinal layer reveals intercytoplasmic connections between developing granule cells</a></h4>

              
                The difficulty of retrieving high-resolution, in vivo evidence of the proliferative- and migratory processes occurring in neural germinal zones has limited our understanding of neurodevelopmental mechanisms. Here, we employed a connectomic approach using a high-resolution, serial-sectioning scanning electron microscopy volume to investigate the laminar cytoarchitecture of the transient external granular layer (EGL) of the developing cerebellum, where granule cells coordinate a series of mitotic and migratory events. By integrating image segmentation, 3D reconstruction, and deep learning approaches, we discovered and characterized anatomically complex intercellular connections bridging pairs of cerebellar granule cells throughout the EGL. Connected cells were either mitotic, migratory, or transitioning between these two cell stages, displaying a chronological continuum of proliferative and migratory events never previously observed in vivo at this resolution. This unprecedented ultra-structural characterization poses intriguing hypotheses about intercellular connectivity between developing progenitors, and its possible role in the development of the central nervous system (CNS).

	<p>Introduction: Non-invasive brain stimulation seems to be beneficial for DPD patients. However, the sites used in previous studies were empirical. Exploring new stimulation locations via functional magnetic resonance imaging may improve the efficacy. Objectives: The objective was to find potential locations for non-invasive brain stimulation on the depersonalization-derealization disorder. Methods: We explored the potential brain surface regions from three pipelines: pipeline 1: activation likelihood estimation meta-analysis (five studies with 36 foci included); pipeline 2: functional connectivity analysis based on DPD-network (76 subjects included); and pipeline 3: functional connectivity analysis based on DPD regions of interest from the meta-analysis. Potential targets were the 10&amp;amp;ndash;20 system coordinates for brain surface regions. Results: We identified several potential brain surface regions, including the bilateral medial prefrontal cortex, dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex, superior parietal gyrus, superior temporal gyrus, and right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex as potential sites. Conclusion: Our findings of the potential stimulation targets might help clinicians optimize the application of non-invasive brain stimulation therapy in individuals with DPD.</p>

	<p>Dynamic changes in the oral microbiome have gained attention due to their potential diagnostic role in neurological diseases such as Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease and Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease. Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death and disability in the United States, but no studies have examined the changes in oral microbiome during the acute stage of TBI using a clinically translational pig model. Crossbred piglets (4&amp;amp;ndash;5 weeks old, male) underwent either a controlled cortical impact (TBI, n = 6) or sham surgery (sham, n = 6). The oral microbiome parameters were quantified from the upper and lower gingiva, both buccal mucosa, and floor of the mouth pre-surgery and 1, 3, and 7 days post-surgery (PS) using the 16S rRNA gene. Faith&amp;amp;rsquo;s phylogenetic diversity was significantly lower in the TBI piglets at 7 days PS compared to those of sham, and beta diversity at 1, 3, and 7 days PS was significantly different between TBI and sham piglets. However, no significant changes in the taxonomic composition of the oral microbiome were observed following TBI compared to sham. Further studies are needed to investigate the potential diagnostic role of the oral microbiome during the chronic stage of TBI with a larger number of subjects.</p>

	<p>The technological revolution has led to the birth of new diagnoses, such as gaming disorder. When any addiction, including this one, is associated with other mental disorders, it is considered a dual diagnosis. The objectives of this current work were to estimate the prevalence of dual diagnoses in the adolescent general population while also considering the problematic use of video games and substance addiction and assessing its psychosocial risk factors. Thus, we carried out a cross-sectional study with a sample of 397 adolescents; 16.4% presented problematic videogame use and 3% presented a dual diagnosis. Male gender increased the probability of both a dual diagnosis (OR [95% CI] = 7.119 [1.132, 44.785]; p = 0.036) and problematic video game use (OR [95% CI] = 9.85 [4.08, 23.77]; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). Regarding personality, low conscientiousness, openness, and agreeableness scores were predictors of a dual diagnosis and problematic videogame use, while emotional stability predicted a dual diagnosis (OR [95% CI] = 1.116 [1.030, 1.209]; p = 0.008). Regarding family dynamics, low affection and communication increased both the probability of a dual diagnosis (OR [95% CI] = 0.927 [0.891, 0.965]; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) and problematic video game use (OR [95% CI] = 0.968 [0.945, 0.992]; p = 0.009). Regarding academic performance, bad school grades increased the probability of a dual diagnosis. In summary, male gender, certain personality traits, poor communication, and poor affective family dynamics should be interpreted as red flags that indicate an increased risk of a dual diagnosis in adolescents, which could require early intervention through specific detection programs.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Prognostic Discussion for Infants with Neurologic Conditions: Qualitative Analysis of Family Conferences</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>We characterize the content and role of prognostic discussion for infants with neurologic conditions.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In this descriptive qualitative study, we prospectively enrolled infants (age &lt; 1 year) in the intensive care unit with a neurologic condition anticipated to have ≥1 family conference about prognosis or goals of care. We audiorecorded family conferences as they occurred. We used a rapid-cycle qualitative approach to identify and refine themes.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Forty infants and 61 parents were enrolled; 68 family conferences occurred for 24 infants. The majority of infant cases (n = 23/24, 96%) and conferences (n = 64/68, 94%) included discussion of neurologic prognosis. Common infant diagnoses included prematurity (n = 12, 52%), genetic conditions (n = 9, 35%), and brain malformations (n = 7, 30%). We identified 2 themes relating to the characterization of the infant's prognosis: (1) predictions of impairment and (2) rationale for prognostic predictions. We identified 3 themes characterizing the role of prognostic discussion: (1) aligning parent and clinician understanding of infant outcome, (2) influencing decision-making, and (3) preparing for life at home. We identified 2 themes characterizing discussion of prognostic uncertainty: (1) multilayered types of uncertainty and (2) holding space for hope alongside uncertainty.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>In this cohort of infants with neurologic conditions and their parents, we identified salient themes characterizing the content and role of discussion about neurologic outcome. Our findings highlight that prognostic discussion focuses on anticipated impairments, informs decision-making, and helps families prepare for home life. Future work should characterize whether these findings align with parent preferences for prognostic disclosure. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

                <p>NOTCH1 belongs to the NOTCH family of proteins that regulate cell fate and inflammatory responses. Somatic and germline <i>NOTCH1</i> variants have been implicated in cancer, Adams-Oliver syndrome, and cardiovascular defects. We describe 7 unrelated patients grouped by the presence of leukoencephalopathy with calcifications and heterozygous de novo gain-of-function variants in <i>NOTCH1</i>. Immunologic profiling showed upregulated CSF IP-10, a cytokine secreted downstream of NOTCH1 signaling. Autopsy revealed extensive leukoencephalopathy and microangiopathy with vascular calcifications. This evidence implicates that heterozygous gain-of-function variants in <i>NOTCH1</i> lead to a chronic central nervous system (CNS) inflammatory response resulting in a calcifying microangiopathy with leukoencephalopathy<i>.</i> ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

     alt="Quantification of functional recovery in a larval zebrafish model of spinal cord injury"/>
<p>New open-source software allowed measurement of trunk curvature during dark-evoked larval zebrafish movements following spinal cord transection. Motor deficits caudal to the lesion recovered incompletely, even after regeneration of spinal axons, suggesting that evaluation of function will be critical to understand restoration of circuitry in this central nervous system injury model.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Human spinal cord injury (SCI) is characterized by permanent loss of damaged axons, resulting in chronic disability. In contrast, zebrafish can regenerate axonal projections following central nervous system injury and re-establish synaptic contacts with distant targets; elucidation of the underlying molecular events is an important goal with translational potential for improving outcomes in SCI patients. We generated transgenic zebrafish with GFP-labeled axons and transected their spinal cords at 10 days post-fertilization. Intravital confocal microscopy revealed robust axonal regeneration following the procedure, with abundant axons bridging the transection site by 48 h post-injury. In order to analyze neurological function in this model, we developed and validated new open-source software to measure zebrafish lateral trunk curvature during propulsive and turning movements at high temporal resolution. Immediately following spinal cord transection, axial movements were dramatically decreased caudal to the lesion site, but preserved rostral to the injury, suggesting the induction of motor paralysis below the transection level. Over the subsequent 96 h, the magnitude of movements caudal to the lesion recovered to baseline, but the rate of change of truncal curvature did not fully recover, suggesting incomplete restoration of caudal strength over this time course. Quantification of both morphological and functional recovery following SCI will be important for the analysis of axonal regeneration and downstream events necessary for restoration of motor function. An extensive array of genetic and pharmacological interventions can be deployed in the larval zebrafish model to investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms.</p>

                <h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>To evaluate if the feedback related negativity (FRN) –a neurophysiological marker of incentive processing- can be used to predict the development of impulse control disorders (ICD) in Parkinson’s disease (PD)</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Longitudinal cohort of consecutive non-demented Parkinson’s disease patients with no ICD history. We recorded FRN signals while they performed a gambling task. We calculated the mean amplitude difference between losses and gains (FRNdiff) to be used as a predictor of future ICD development. We performed prospective biannual follow-up assessments for 30 months to detect incident ICD. Finally, we evaluated how basal FRNdiff was associated to posterior development of ICD using survival models.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Between October 7, 2015 and December 16, 2016, we screened 120 patients. Among them, 94 patients performed the gambling and 92 completed the follow up. Eighteen patients developed ICD during follow up while 74 remained free of ICD. Baseline FRNdiff was greater in patients who developed ICD than in those who did not (-2.33 μV vs -0.84μV, p=0.001). No other significant baseline differences were found. The FRNdiff was significantly associated with ICD development in the survival models both when not adjusted (HR of 0.73, CI95% 0.58-0.91, p=0.006) and when controlling for dopamine replacement therapy, sex and age (HR 0.74, CI95% 0.55-0.97, p= 0.035). None of the impulsivity measures evaluated was related to ICD development.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Reward processing differences measured by FRN signals precede ICD development in Parkinson’s disease. This neurophysiological marker permits to identify patients with high risk of ICD development.</p>

	<p>This study investigated the quantitative distribution of cerebral venous oxygen saturation (SvO2) based on quantitative sensitivity mapping (QSM) and determined its prognostic value in patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS). A retrospective study was conducted on 39 hospitalized patients. Reconstructed QSM was used to calculate the cerebral SvO2 of each region of interest (ROI) in the ischemic hemisphere. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and Bland&amp;amp;ndash;Altman analysis were conducted to define the best resolution of the distribution map. The correlation between the cerebral SvO2 in hypoxic regions (SvO2ROI &amp;amp;lt; 0.7) and clinical scores was obtained by Spearman and power analysis. The associations between cerebral SvO2 and unfavorable prognosis were analyzed using multivariate logistic regression. Excellent agreement was found between the cerebral SvO2 in hypoxic regions with a resolution of 7.18 &amp;amp;times; 7.18 &amp;amp;times; 1.6 mm3 and asymmetrically prominent cortical veins regions (ICC: 0.879 (admission), ICC: 0.906 (discharge)). The cerebral SvO2 was significantly negative with clinical scores (all |r| &amp;amp;gt; 0.3). The cerebral SvO2 and its changes at discharge were significantly associated with an unfavorable prognosis (OR: 0.812 and 0.866). Therefore, the cerebral SvO2 in hypoxic regions measured by the quantitative distribution map can be used as an indicator for evaluating the early prognosis of AIS.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Network States Classification based on Local Field Potential Recordings in the Awake Mouse Neocortex</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Recent studies using intracellular recordings in awake behaving mice revealed that cortical network states, defined based on membrane potential features, modulate sensory responses and perceptual outcomes. Single-cell intracellular recordings are difficult and have low yield compared to extracellular recordings of population signals, such as local field potentials (LFPs). However, it is currently unclear how to identify these behaviorally-relevant network states from the LFP. We used simultaneous LFP and intracellular recordings in the somatosensory cortex of awake mice to design a network state classification from the LFP, the Network State Index (NSI). We used the NSI to analyze the relationship between single-cell (intracellular) and population (LFP) signals over different network states of wakefulness. We found that graded levels of population signal faithfully predicted the levels of single-cell depolarization in nonrhythmic regimes whereas, in  ([2&ndash;4 Hz]) oscillatory regimes, the graded levels of rhythmicity in the LFP mapped into a stereotypical oscillatory pattern of membrane potential. Finally, we showed that the variability of network states, beyond the occurrence of slow oscillatory activity, critically shaped the average correlations between single-cell and population signals. Application of the LFP-based NSI to mouse visual cortex data showed that this index increased with pupil size and during locomotion and had a U-shaped dependence on population firing rates. NSI-based characterization provides a ready-to-use tool to understand from LFP recordings how the modulation of local network dynamics shapes the flexibility of sensory processing during behavior.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Measures of Spatial Orientation: Spatial Bias Analogs in Visual and Haptic Tasks</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>The primary sensory modality for probing spatial orientation can vary among psychophysical tasks. In the subjective visual vertical (SVV) task, a visual stimulus is used to measure perceived vertical orientation, while a haptic stimulus is used in the subjective haptic vertical (SHV) task. Here we examined disparity in SHV and SVV task results and asked whether it could be related to biases in probing different spatial estimates by each task. Forty-two healthy volunteers (mean &plusmn; SD age, 25 &plusmn; 10 years; 19 females; 21 left handed) were recruited. The effect of a task to measure spatial orientation was calculated as the difference between SHV and SVV values, and with the head upright and tilted 20&deg; laterally. There was a task bias regardless of head position related to hand use in the haptic task but not handedness (mean head upright &plusmn; SEM: left hand, &ndash;3.7 &plusmn; 1.1&deg;; right hand, 7.9 &plusmn; 1.0&deg;). When this task bias was subtracted out, there was a similar spatial bias using each hand in the SHV task that was also comparable to the SVV task (mean head with left tilt: left hand, 3.9 &plusmn; 0.7&deg;; right hand, 4.4 &plusmn; 0.7&deg;; SVV, 4.9 &plusmn; 0.7&deg;; mean head with right tilt: left hand, &ndash;4.6 &plusmn; 0.9&deg;; right hand, &ndash;4.6 &plusmn; 0.8&deg;; SVV, &ndash;4.7 &plusmn; 1.0&deg;). These findings show that the disparity in visual and haptic measures of spatial orientation is primarily related to a modality-specific bias, and once the effect of hand use is removed from the haptic measurements, the spatial bias becomes comparable to the visual task.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Detecting Spontaneous Neural Oscillation Events in Primate Auditory Cortex</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Electrophysiological oscillations in the brain have been shown to occur as multicycle events, with onset and offset dependent on behavioral and cognitive state. To provide a baseline for state-related and task-related events, we quantified oscillation features in resting-state recordings. We developed an open-source wavelet-based tool to detect and characterize such oscillation events (OEvents) and exemplify the use of this tool in both simulations and two invasively-recorded electrophysiology datasets: one from human, and one from nonhuman primate (NHP) auditory system. After removing incidentally occurring event-related potentials (ERPs), we used OEvents to quantify oscillation features. We identified ~2 million oscillation events, classified within traditional frequency bands: , , &alpha;, &beta;, low , , and high . Oscillation events of 1&ndash;44 cycles could be identified in at least one frequency band 90% of the time in human and NHP recordings. Individual oscillation events were characterized by nonconstant frequency and amplitude. This result necessarily contrasts with prior studies which assumed frequency constancy, but is consistent with evidence from event-associated oscillations. We measured oscillation event duration, frequency span, and waveform shape. Oscillations tended to exhibit multiple cycles per event, verifiable by comparing filtered to unfiltered waveforms. In addition to the clear intraevent rhythmicity, there was also evidence of interevent rhythmicity within bands, demonstrated by finding that coefficient of variation of interval distributions and Fano factor (FF) measures differed significantly from a Poisson distribution assumption. Overall, our study provides an easy-to-use tool to study oscillation events at the single-trial level or in ongoing recordings, and demonstrates that rhythmic, multicycle oscillation events dominate auditory cortical dynamics.</p>

                The extended family is a system that promotes cohesion, togetherness, cooperation and support amongst its members. It has been a cherished tradition in most African societies from pre-colonial era to present period. The existence of this family system accounts for the longevity of ancestral traditions and heritage which is the bedrock and sustenance of most African societies. However, with the adoption of western culture, the effects of global economic meltdown and impacts of inter and intra ethnic conflicts threatens this cherished extended family tradition.. This paper explores the role relationship in kinship in selected West African societies. It adopts an exploratory approach; drawing largely from secondary data. This study posits that role relationship in kinship is an indispensable tie among Africans especially in the western region. Also most of its tenets have become resilient in solidifying the nationhood of most African societies despite acculturation. The paper concludes that notwithstanding the relative influence of modernity and urbanisation, African societies can, through embracing modern technology maintain its extended family ties even if spread over a wide geographical area.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Building a portfolio for not-for-profit activities rather than maximizing social return on investment ratio [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: An influential piece of literature on effective altruism insists that not-for-profit organizations (NFPs) should concentrate their investments on a few activities to maximize their social return on investment (SROI) ratio. However, this creates greater risk for an NFP than building a portfolio of investments in activities. This study investigates whether it is desirable for executives and contributors of NFPs to build a portfolio rather than maximize the expected SROI ratio, and if so, how to build one. Solving these questions will help the chief financial officers (CFOs) of NFPs, who serve as their agents, fulfill their obligations to contributors, who are their principals, and will help advisors provide better services for their contributors, their clients. Methods: Data were collected from a ranking of NFPs, then non-parametric tests were performed on this ranking and the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI). Results: The HHI are between 2013 and 2688. The results of non-parametric tests do not deny that rank and HHI are independent of each other. Most of the NFPs’ investments in activities were in accord with their core competencies. Conclusions: It was found that successful executives build portfolios. The findings of this study should be sufficiently practical in helping NFP executives and contributors decide whether to build portfolios, and if so, how.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Avoiding costly mistakes in groups: The evolution of error management in collective decision making</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Alan Novaes Tump, Max Wolf, Pawel Romanczuk, Ralf H. J. M. Kurvers</p>

Individuals continuously have to balance the error costs of alternative decisions. A wealth of research has studied how single individuals navigate this, showing that individuals develop response biases to avoid the more costly error. We, however, know little about the dynamics in groups facing asymmetrical error costs and when social influence amplifies either safe or risky behavior. Here, we investigate this by modeling the decision process and information flow with a drift–diffusion model extended to the social domain. In the model individuals first gather independent personal information; they then enter a social phase in which they can either decide early based on personal information, or wait for additional social information. We combined the model with an evolutionary algorithm to derive adaptive behavior. We find that under asymmetric costs, individuals in large cooperative groups do not develop response biases because such biases amplify at the collective level, triggering false information cascades. Selfish individuals, however, undermine the group’s performance for their own benefit by developing higher response biases and waiting for more information. Our results have implications for our understanding of the social dynamics in groups facing asymmetrical errors costs, such as animal groups evading predation or police officers holding a suspect at gunpoint.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Recombination-aware phylogeographic inference using the structured coalescent with ancestral recombination</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Fangfang Guo, Ignazio Carbone, David A. Rasmussen</p>

Movement of individuals between populations or demes is often restricted, especially between geographically isolated populations. The structured coalescent provides an elegant theoretical framework for describing how movement between populations shapes the genealogical history of sampled individuals and thereby structures genetic variation within and between populations. However, in the presence of recombination an individual may inherit different regions of their genome from different parents, resulting in a mosaic of genealogical histories across the genome, which can be represented by an Ancestral Recombination Graph (ARG). In this case, different genomic regions may have different ancestral histories and so different histories of movement between populations. Recombination therefore poses an additional challenge to phylogeographic methods that aim to reconstruct the movement of individuals from genealogies, although also a potential benefit in that different loci may contain additional information about movement. Here, we introduce the Structured Coalescent with Ancestral Recombination (SCAR) model, which builds on recent approximations to the structured coalescent by incorporating recombination into the ancestry of sampled individuals. The SCAR model allows us to infer how the migration history of sampled individuals varies across the genome from ARGs, and improves estimation of key population genetic parameters such as population sizes, recombination rates and migration rates. Using the SCAR model, we explore the potential and limitations of phylogeographic inference using full ARGs. We then apply the SCAR to lineages of the recombining fungus <i>Aspergillus flavus</i> sampled across the United States to explore patterns of recombination and migration across the genome.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Mitochondrial mRNA localization is governed by translation kinetics and spatial transport</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Ximena G. Arceo, Elena F. Koslover, Brian M. Zid, Aidan I. Brown</p>

For many nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes, mRNA localizes to the mitochondrial surface co-translationally, aided by the association of a mitochondrial targeting sequence (MTS) on the nascent peptide with the mitochondrial import complex. For a subset of these co-translationally localized mRNAs, their localization is dependent on the metabolic state of the cell, while others are constitutively localized. To explore the differences between these two mRNA types we developed a stochastic, quantitative model for MTS-mediated mRNA localization to mitochondria in yeast cells. This model includes translation, applying gene-specific kinetics derived from experimental data; and diffusion in the cytosol. Even though both mRNA types are co-translationally localized we found that the steady state number, or density, of ribosomes along an mRNA was insufficient to differentiate the two mRNA types. Instead, conditionally-localized mRNAs have faster translation kinetics which modulate localization in combination with changes to diffusive search kinetics across metabolic states. Our model also suggests that the MTS requires a maturation time to become competent to bind mitochondria. Our work indicates that yeast cells can regulate mRNA localization to mitochondria by controlling mitochondrial volume fraction (influencing diffusive search times) and gene translation kinetics (adjusting mRNA binding competence) without the need for mRNA-specific binding proteins. These results shed light on both global and gene-specific mechanisms that enable cells to alter mRNA localization in response to changing metabolic conditions.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Modeling age-specific incidence of colon cancer via niche competition</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Steffen Lange, Richard Mogwitz, Denis Hünniger, Anja Voß-Böhme</p>

Cancer development is a multistep process often starting with a single cell in which a number of epigenetic and genetic alterations have accumulated thus transforming it into a tumor cell. The progeny of such a single benign tumor cell expands in the tissue and can at some point progress to malignant tumor cells until a detectable tumor is formed. The dynamics from the early phase of a single cell to a detectable tumor with billions of tumor cells are complex and still not fully resolved, not even for the well-known prototype of multistage carcinogenesis, the adenoma-adenocarcinoma sequence of colorectal cancer. Mathematical models of such carcinogenesis are frequently tested and calibrated based on reported age-specific incidence rates of cancer, but they usually require calibration of four or more parameters due to the wide range of processes these models aim to reflect. We present a cell-based model, which focuses on the competition between wild-type and tumor cells in colonic crypts, with which we are able reproduce epidemiological incidence rates of colon cancer. Additionally, the fraction of cancerous tumors with precancerous lesions predicted by the model agree with clinical estimates. The correspondence between model and reported data suggests that the fate of tumor development is majorly determined by the early phase of tumor growth and progression long before a tumor becomes detectable. Due to the focus on the early phase of tumor development, the model has only a single fit parameter, the time scale set by an effective replacement rate of stem cells in the crypt. We find this effective rate to be considerable smaller than the actual replacement rate, which implies that the time scale is limited by the processes succeeding clonal conversion of crypts.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">TreeKnit: Inferring ancestral reassortment graphs of influenza viruses</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Pierre Barrat-Charlaix, Timothy G. Vaughan, Richard A. Neher</p>

When two influenza viruses co-infect the same cell, they can exchange genome segments in a process known as reassortment. Reassortment is an important source of genetic diversity and is known to have been involved in the emergence of most pandemic influenza strains. However, because of the difficulty in identifying reassortments events from viral sequence data, little is known about its role in the evolution of the seasonal influenza viruses. Here we introduce TreeKnit, a method that infers ancestral reassortment graphs (ARG) from two segment trees. It is based on topological differences between trees, and proceeds in a greedy fashion by finding regions that are compatible in the two trees. Using simulated genealogies with reassortments, we show that TreeKnit performs well in a wide range of settings and that it is as accurate as a more principled bayesian method, while being orders of magnitude faster. Finally, we show that it is possible to use the inferred ARG to better resolve segment trees and to construct more informative visualizations of reassortments.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Cattle transport network predicts endemic and epidemic foot-and-mouth disease risk on farms in Turkey</a></h4>

              
                <p>by José L. Herrera-Diestra, Michael Tildesley, Katriona Shea, Matthew J. Ferrari</p>

The structure of contact networks affects the likelihood of disease spread at the population scale and the risk of infection at any given node. Though this has been well characterized for both theoretical and empirical networks for the spread of epidemics on completely susceptible networks, the long-term impact of network structure on risk of infection with an endemic pathogen, where nodes can be infected more than once, has been less well characterized. Here, we analyze detailed records of the transportation of cattle among farms in Turkey to characterize the global and local attributes of the directed—weighted shipments network between 2007-2012. We then study the correlations between network properties and the likelihood of infection with, or exposure to, foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) over the same time period using recorded outbreaks. The shipments network shows a complex combination of features (local and global) that have not been previously reported in other networks of shipments; i.e. small-worldness, scale-freeness, modular structure, among others. We find that nodes that were either infected or at high risk of infection with FMD (within one link from an infected farm) had disproportionately higher degree, were more central (eigenvector centrality and coreness), and were more likely to be net recipients of shipments compared to those that were always more than 2 links away from an infected farm. High in-degree (i.e. many shipments received) was the best univariate predictor of infection. Low in-coreness (i.e. peripheral nodes) was the best univariate predictor of nodes always more than 2 links away from an infected farm. These results are robust across the three different serotypes of FMD observed in Turkey and during periods of low-endemic prevalence and high-prevalence outbreaks.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Novel feature selection methods for construction of accurate epigenetic clocks</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Adam Li, Amber Mueller, Brad English, Anthony Arena, Daniel Vera, Alice E. Kane, David A. Sinclair</p>

Epigenetic clocks allow us to accurately predict the age and future health of individuals based on the methylation status of specific CpG sites in the genome and are a powerful tool to measure the effectiveness of longevity interventions. There is a growing need for methods to efficiently construct epigenetic clocks. The most common approach is to create clocks using elastic net regression modelling of all measured CpG sites, without first identifying specific features or CpGs of interest. The addition of feature selection approaches provides the opportunity to optimise the identification of predictive CpG sites. Here, we apply novel feature selection methods and combinatorial approaches including newly adapted neural network, genetic algorithms, and ‘chained’ combinations. Human whole blood methylation data of ~470,000 CpGs was used to develop clocks that predict age with R2 correlation scores of greater than 0.73, the most predictive of which uses 35 CpG sites for a R2 correlation score of 0.87. The five most frequent sites across all clocks were modelled to build a clock with a R2 correlation score of 0.83. These two clocks are validated on two external datasets where they maintain excellent predictive accuracy. When compared with three published epigenetic clocks (Hannum, Horvath, Weidner) also applied to these validation datasets, our clocks outperformed all three models. We identified gene regulatory regions associated with selected CpG as possible targets for future aging studies. Thus, our feature selection algorithms build accurate, generalizable clocks with a low number of CpG sites, providing important tools for the field.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">DSCN: Double-target selection guided by CRISPR screening and network</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Enze Liu, Xue Wu, Lei Wang, Yang Huo, Huanmei Wu, Lang Li, Lijun Cheng</p>

Cancer is a complex disease with usually multiple disease mechanisms. Target combination is a better strategy than a single target in developing cancer therapies. However, target combinations are generally more difficult to be predicted. <i>C</i>urrent CRISPR-cas9 technology enables genome-wide screening for potential targets, but only a handful of genes have been screend as target combinations. Thus, an effective computational approach for selecting candidate target combinations is highly desirable. Selected target combinations also need to be translational between cell lines and cancer patients. We have therefore developed DSCN (double-target selection guided by CRISPR screening and network), a method that matches expression levels in patients and gene essentialities in cell lines through spectral-clustered protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. In DSCN, a sub-sampling approach is developed to model first-target knockdown and its impact on the PPI network, and it also facilitates the selection of a second target. Our analysis first demonstrated a high correlation of the DSCN sub-sampling-based gene knockdown model and its predicted differential gene expressions using observed gene expression in 22 pancreatic cell lines before and after MAP2K1 and MAP2K2 inhibition (<i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.75). In DSCN algorithm, various scoring schemes were evaluated. The ‘diffusion-path’ method showed the most significant statistical power of differentialting known synthetic lethal (SL) versus non-SL gene pairs (<i>P</i> = 0.001) in pancreatic cancer. The superior performance of DSCN over existing network-based algorithms, such as OptiCon and VIPER, in the selection of target combinations is attributable to its ability to calculate combinations for any gene pairs, whereas other approaches focus on the combinations among optimized regulators in the network. DSCN’s computational speed is also at least ten times fast than that of other methods. Finally, in applying DSCN to predict target combinations and drug combinations for individual samples (DSCNi), DSCNi showed high correlation between target combinations predicted and real synergistic combinations (<i>P</i> = 1e-5) in pancreatic cell lines. In summary, DSCN is a highly effective computational method for the selection of target combinations.

Various stakeholders in science have put research integrity high on their agenda. Among them, research funders are prominently placed to foster research integrity by requiring that the organizations and individual researchers they support make an explicit commitment to research integrity. Moreover, funders need to adopt appropriate research integrity practices themselves. To facilitate this, we recommend that funders develop and implement a Research Integrity Promotion Plan (RIPP). This Consensus View offers a range of examples of how funders are already promoting research integrity, distills 6 core topics that funders should cover in a RIPP, and provides guidelines on how to develop and implement a RIPP. We believe that the 6 core topics we put forward will guide funders towards strengthening research integrity policy in their organization and guide the researchers and research organizations they fund.

A clear understanding of how human brain networks reflect task performance has been lacking, in part due to methodological difficulties. A new study combines the temporal resolution of EEG, MRI source localization, and multivariate modeling to address this need.

This Primer explores a new study in PLOS Biology that combines the millisecond temporal resolution of EEG with MRI-based source localization and multivariate modeling to track dynamic task representations in human brain networks throughout a trial.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Mutation patterns of resistance genes for macrolides, aminoglycosides, and rifampicin in nontuberculous mycobacteria isolates from Kenya [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) treatment constitutes a macrolide-based antibiotic regimen in combination with aminoglycosides for Rapid-Growing mycobacteria (RGM), and rifampicin for Slow-Growing mycobacteria (SGM). Mutations in the anti-NTM drug target regions promote NTM evolution to mutant strains that are insusceptible to NTM drugs leading to treatment failure. We, therefore, described the mutation patterns of anti-NTM drug target genes including rrl, rrs, and rpoB in NTM isolates from Kenya.  Methods: We carried out a cross-sectional study that included 122 NTM obtained from the sputum of symptomatic tuberculosis-negative patients in Kenya. All the 122 NTM underwent targeted sequencing of the rrl gene. The 54 RGM were also sequenced for rrs, and the 68 SGM were sequenced for rpoB genes using ABI 3730XL analyzer. The obtained sequences were aligned to their wild-type reference sequences for each gene using Geneious then mutations were identified. Pearson chi-square at 95% confidence interval tested the association of NTM to mutation patterns for each gene. Results: Twenty-eight (23%) of the NTM were resistant to at least one of the antibiotics used in the macrolide-based treatment. Twelve (10.4%) of NTM were macrolide resistant, with 7(58.3%) of RGM and 5(41.7%) of SGM having mutations in the rrl gene. For ten (83.3%) NTM, mutations were found at position 2058, while for two (16.6%) NTM, mutations were found at position 2059. Six (11.1%) of the 54 RGM exhibited mutations in the aminoglycoside target gene rrs at location 1408. Ten (14.7%) of the 68 SGM were resistant to rifampicin, with 40 percent having mutations at codon 531 in the rpoB gene.   Conclusion: We demonstrated a significant level of drug resistance for macrolides, aminoglycosides and rifampicin in NTM isolated from symptomatic TB negative patients in Kenya.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">‘Science by consensus’ impedes scientific creativity and progress: An alternative to funding biomedical research [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                The very low success rates of grant applications to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the National Science Foundation (NSF) are highly detrimental to the progress of science and the careers of scientists. The peer review process that evaluates proposals has been claimed arbitrarily to be the best there is. This consensus system, however, has never been evaluated scientifically against an alternative. Here we delineate the 15 major problems with the peer review process, and challenge the Science Advisor to the President, and the leadership of NIH, NSF, and the U.S. Academy of Sciences to refute each of these criticisms. We call for the implementation of more equitable alternatives that will not constrain the progress of science. We propose a system that will fund 80,000 principal investigators, including young scientists, with just half the current NIH budget, three-fold more than the current number of grants, and that will forego the cumbersome, expensive, and counterproductive peer review stage. Further, we propose that the success of the two methods over 5–10 years be compared scientifically.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">De novo missense variants in SLC32A1 cause a developmental and epileptic encephalopathy due to impaired GABAergic neurotransmission</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Rare inherited missense variants in <i>SLC32A1,</i> the gene that encodes the vesicular GABA transporter (VGAT), have recently been shown to cause genetic epilepsy with febrile seizures plus. We aimed to clarify if <i>de novo</i> missense variants in <i>SLC32A1</i> can also cause epilepsy with impaired neurodevelopment.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Using exome sequencing, we identified four individuals with a developmental and epileptic encephalopathy and <i>de novo</i> missense variants in <i>SLC32A1</i>. To assess causality, we performed functional evaluation of the identified variants in a murine neuronal cell culture model.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The main phenotype comprises moderate to severe intellectual disability, infantile onset epilepsy within the first 18 months of life and a choreiform, dystonic or dyskinetic movement disorder. <i>In silico</i> modeling and functional analyses reveal that three of these variants, which are located in helices that line the putative GABA transport pathway, result in reduced quantal size, consistent with impaired filling of synaptic vesicles with GABA. The fourth variant, located in the VGAT N-terminus, does not affect quantal size, but increases presynaptic release probability, leading to more severe synaptic depression during high frequency stimulation. Thus, variants in VGAT can impair GABAergic neurotransmission via at least two mechanisms, by affecting synaptic vesicle filling and by altering synaptic short-term plasticity.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This work establishes <i>de novo</i> missense variants in <i>SLC32A1</i> as a novel cause of a developmental and epileptic encephalopathy.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The mechanistic role of neutrophil lymphocyte ratio perturbations in the leading non communicable lifestyle diseases [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Inflammation plays a critical role in the development and progression of chronic diseases like type 2 diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Inflammatory responses are indispensable for pathogen control and tissue repair, but they also cause collateral damage. A chronically activated immune system and the resultant immune dysregulation mediated inflammatory surge may cause multiple negative effects, requiring tight regulation and dampening of the immune response to minimize host injury.  While chronic diseases are characterized by systemic inflammation, the mechanistic relationship of neutrophils and lymphocytes to inflammation and its correlation with the clinical outcomes is yet to be elucidated. The neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is an easy-to-measure laboratory marker used to assess systemic inflammation. Understanding the mechanisms of NLR perturbations in chronic diseases is crucial for risk stratification, early intervention, and finding novel therapeutic targets. We investigated the correlation between NLR and prevalent chronic conditions as a measure of systemic inflammation. In addition to predicting the risk of impending chronic conditions, NLR may also provide insight into their progression. This review summarizes the mechanisms of NLR perturbations at cellular and molecular levels, and the key inflammatory signaling pathways involved in the progression of chronic diseases. We have also explored preclinical studies investigating these pathways and the effect of quelling inflammation in chronic disease as reported by a few in vitro, in vivo studies, and clinical trials.

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/inpress.rss">Neurovascular coupling: motive unknown</a></h4>

              
                In the brain, increases in neural activity drive changes in local blood flow via neurovascular coupling. The common explanation for increased blood flow (known as functional hyperemia) is that it supplies the metabolic needs of active neurons. However, there is a large body of evidence that is inconsistent with this idea. Baseline blood flow is adequate to supply oxygen needs even with elevated neural activity. Neurovascular coupling is irregular, absent, or inverted in many brain regions, behavioral states, and conditions.

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/inpress.rss">Prefrontal cortex as a key node in arousal circuitry</a></h4>

              
                The role of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in the mechanism of consciousness is a matter of active debate. Most theoretical and empirical investigations have focused on whether the PFC is critical for the content of consciousness (i.e., the qualitative aspects of conscious experience). However, there is emerging evidence that, in addition to its well-established roles in cognition, the PFC is a key regulator of the level of consciousness (i.e., the global state of arousal). In this opinion article we review recent data supporting the hypothesis that the medial PFC is a critical node in arousal-promoting networks.

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/neuron/inpress.rss">Enhanced excitability of the hippocampal CA2 region and its contribution to seizure activity in a mouse model of temporal lobe epilepsy</a></h4>

              
                Whitebirch et al. find increased intrinsic excitability and net synaptic excitation of CA2 PCs in hippocampal slices from epileptic mice. Chemogenetic inhibition of CA2 PCs in vivo reduces the frequency of spontaneous recurring seizures. Together, these data suggest that pathological hyperexcitability in CA2 circuitry may contribute to seizure activity in epilepsy.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Data-driven causal analysis of observational biological time series</a></h4>

              
                Complex systems are challenging to understand, especially when they defy manipulative experiments for practical or ethical reasons. Several fields have developed parallel approaches to infer causal relations from observational time series. Yet, these methods are easy to misunderstand and often controversial. Here, we provide an accessible and critical review of three statistical causal discovery approaches (pairwise correlation, Granger causality, and state space reconstruction), using examples inspired by ecological processes. For each approach, we ask what it tests for, what causal statement it might imply, and when it could lead us astray. We devise new ways of visualizing key concepts, describe some novel pathologies of existing methods, and point out how so-called ‘model-free’ causality tests are not assumption-free. We hope that our synthesis will facilitate thoughtful application of methods, promote communication across different fields, and encourage explicit statements of assumptions. A video walkthrough is available (Video 1 or <a href="https://youtu.be/AIV0ttQrjK8">https://youtu.be/AIV0ttQrjK8</a>).

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">HLJ1 amplifies endotoxin-induced sepsis severity by promoting IL-12 heterodimerization in macrophages</a></h4>

              
                Heat shock protein (HSP) 40 has emerged as a key factor in both innate and adaptive immunity, whereas the role of HLJ1, a molecular chaperone in HSP40 family, in modulating endotoxin-induced sepsis severity is still unclear. During LPS-induced endotoxic shock, HLJ1 knockout mice shows reduced organ injury and IFN-γ-dependent mortality. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we characterize mouse liver nonparenchymal cell populations under LPS stimulation, and show that HLJ1 deletion affected IFN-γ-related gene signatures in distinct immune cell clusters. In CLP models, HLJ1 deletion reduces IFN-γ expression and sepsis mortality rate when mice are treated with antibiotics. HLJ1 deficiency also leads to reduced serum levels of IL-12 in LPS-treated mice, contributing to dampened production of IFN-γ in natural killer cells but not CD4<sup>+</sup> or CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, and subsequently to improved survival rate. Adoptive transfer of HLJ1-deleted macrophages into LPS-treated mice results in reduced IL-12 and IFN-γ levels and protects the mice from IFN-γ-dependent mortality. In the context of molecular mechanisms, HLJ1 is an LPS-inducible protein in macrophages and converts misfolded IL-12p35 homodimers to monomers, which maintains bioactive IL-12p70 heterodimerization and secretion. This study suggests HLJ1 causes IFN-γ-dependent septic lethality by promoting IL-12 heterodimerization, and targeting HLJ1 has therapeutic potential in inflammatory diseases involving activated IL-12/IFN-γ axis.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">EHMT2 methyltransferase governs cell identity in the lung and is required for KRASG12D tumor development and propagation</a></h4>

              
                Lung development, integrity and repair rely on precise Wnt signaling, which is corrupted in diverse diseases, including cancer. Here, we discover that EHMT2 methyltransferase regulates Wnt signaling in the lung by controlling the transcriptional activity of chromatin-bound β-catenin, through a non-histone substrate in mouse lung. Inhibition of EHMT2 induces transcriptional, morphologic, and molecular changes consistent with alveolar type 2 (AT2) lineage commitment. Mechanistically, EHMT2 activity functions to support regenerative properties of Kras<sup>G12D</sup> tumors and normal AT2 cells - the predominant cell of origin of this cancer. Consequently, EHMT2 inhibition prevents <i>Kras<sup>G12D</sup></i> lung adenocarcinoma tumor formation and propagation and disrupts normal AT2 cell differentiation. Consistent with these findings, low gene <i>EHMT2</i> expression in human lung adenocarcinoma correlates with enhanced AT2 gene expression and improved prognosis. These data reveal EHMT2 as a critical regulator of Wnt signaling, implicating Ehmt2 as a potential target in lung cancer and other AT2-mediated lung pathologies.

                Infection by <i>Taenia solium</i> poses a major burden across endemic countries. The World Health Organization (WHO) 2021–2030 Neglected Tropical Diseases roadmap has proposed that 30% of endemic countries achieve intensified <i>T. solium</i> control in hyperendemic areas by 2030. Understanding geographical variation in age-prevalence profiles and force-of-infection (FoI) estimates will inform intervention designs across settings. Human taeniasis (HTT) and human cysticercosis (HCC) age-prevalence data from 16 studies in Latin America, Africa, and Asia were extracted through a systematic review. Catalytic models, incorporating diagnostic performance uncertainty, were fitted to the data using Bayesian methods, to estimate rates of antibody (Ab)-seroconversion, infection acquisition and Ab-seroreversion or infection loss. HCC FoI and Ab-seroreversion rates were also estimated across 23 departments in Colombia from 28,100 individuals. Across settings, there was extensive variation in all-ages seroprevalence. Evidence for Ab-seroreversion or infection loss was found in most settings for both HTT and HCC and for HCC Ab-seroreversion in Colombia. The average duration until humans became Ab-seropositive/infected decreased as all-age (sero)prevalence increased. There was no clear relationship between the average duration humans remain Ab-seropositive and all-age seroprevalence. Marked geographical heterogeneity in <i>T. solium</i> transmission rates indicate the need for setting-specific intervention strategies to achieve the WHO goals.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Molecular dissection of condensin II-mediated chromosome assembly using in vitro assays</a></h4>

              
                In vertebrates, condensin I and condensin II cooperate to assemble rod-shaped chromosomes during mitosis. Although the mechanism of action and regulation of condensin I have been studied extensively, our corresponding knowledge of condensin II remains very limited. By introducing recombinant condensin II complexes into <i>Xenopus</i> egg extracts, we dissect the roles of its individual subunits in chromosome assembly. We find that one of two HEAT subunits, CAP-D3, plays a crucial role in condensin II-mediated assembly of chromosome axes whereas the other HEAT subunit, CAP-G2, has a very strong negative impact on this process. The SMC ATPase and the basic amino acid clusters of the kleisin subunit CAP-H2 are essential for this process. Deletion of the C-terminal tail of CAP-D3 increases the ability of condensin II to assemble chromosomes and further exposes a hidden function of CAP-G2 in the lateral compaction of chromosomes. Taken together, our results uncover a multilayered regulatory mechanism unique to condensin II, and provide profound implications for the evolution of condensin II.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Sex differences in the impact of electronic nicotine vapor on corticotropin-releasing factor receptor 1 neurons in the mouse ventral tegmental area</a></h4>

              
                Nicotine engages dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) to encode reward and drive the development of nicotine addiction, however how nicotine selectively alters other VTA populations remains to be determined. Here, we used male and female CRF1-GFP mice and nicotine vapor exposure to examine the effects of nicotine in VTA corticotropin-releasing factor receptor 1 (CRF1) neurons. We use immunohistochemistry and electrophysiology to examine neuronal activity, excitability, and inhibitory signaling. We found that VTA CRF1 neurons are mainly dopaminergic and project to the nucleus accumbens (VTA-NAcCRF1 neurons). VTA-NAcCRF1 neurons show greater phasic inhibition in naive females and greater focal nicotine-induced increases in firing in naive males. Following acute nicotine vapor exposure, phasic inhibition was not altered, but focal nicotine-induced tonic inhibition was enhanced in females and diminished in males. Acute nicotine vapor exposure did not affect firing in VTA-NAcCRF1 neurons, but females showed lower baseline firing and higher focal nicotine-induced firing. Activity (cFos) was increased in the CRF1 dopaminergic VTA population in both sexes, but with greater increases in females. Following chronic nicotine vapor exposure, both sexes displayed reduced basal phasic inhibition and the sex difference in tonic inhibition following acute vapor exposure was no longer observed. Additionally, activity of the CRF1 dopaminergic VTA population was no longer elevated in either sex. These findings reveal sex- and exposure-dependent changes in mesolimbic VTA-NAc CRF1 neuronal activity, inhibitory signaling, and nicotine sensitivity following nicotine vapor exposure. These changes potentially contribute to nicotine-dependent behaviors and the intersection between stress, anxiety, and addiction.

                As a highly addictive psychostimulant drug, paternal methamphetamine (METH) exposure enhances the risk of developing addiction to drugs in descendants, however the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is a key brain region that implicated in susceptibility to drugs. Here, male adult mice were exposed to METH for 30 days, followed by mating with naive female mice to create the first-generation (F1) mice. In METH-sired mice, baseline levels of c-Fos were decreased but {beta}1-adrenergic receptor (ADRB1) were increased in mPFC by paternal METH exposure. Trained with subthreshold-dosed administration of METH, METH-sired mice exhibited significant METH-preferred behaviors, accompanied with higher levels of c-Fos, ADRB1 and dendritic spines density in mPFC. Importantly, local blocking ADRB1 activity or specific knockdown of ADRB1 on excitatory neurons of mPFC, both efficiently inhibited METH-preferred behaviors in METH-sired mice. In parallel, levels of p-ERK1/2 and {Delta}FosB, as well as dendritic spine density were reduced by knocking-down mPFC ADRB1 in METH-sired mice. Collectively, these findings suggested that targeting ADRB1 signals in mPFC may represent a promising therapeutic strategy for preventing drug addiction, particularly in progeny with a history of paternal drugs exposure.

                Despite being largely confined to the airways, SARS-CoV-2 infection has been associated with sensory abnormalities that manifest in both acute and long-lasting phenotypes. To gain insight on the molecular basis of these sensory abnormalities, we used the golden hamster infection model to characterize the effects of SARS-CoV-2 versus Influenza A virus (IAV) infection on the sensory nervous system. Efforts to detect the presence of virus in the cervical/thoracic spinal cord and dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) demonstrated detectable levels of SARS-CoV-2 by quantitative PCR and RNAscope uniquely within the first 24 hours of infection. SARS-CoV-2-infected hamsters demonstrated mechanical hypersensitivity during acute infection; intriguingly, this hypersensitivity was milder, but prolonged when compared to IAV-infected hamsters. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of thoracic DRGs from acute infection revealed predominantly neuron-biased signaling perturbations in SARS-CoV-2-infected animals as opposed to type I interferon signaling in tissue derived from IAV-infected animals. RNA-seq of 31dpi thoracic DRGs from SARS-CoV-2-infected animals highlighted a uniquely neuropathic transcriptomic landscape, which was consistent with substantial SARS-CoV-2-specific mechanical hypersensitivity at 28dpi. Ontology analysis of 1, 4, and 30dpi RNA-seq revealed novel targets for pain management, such as ILF3. Meta-analysis of all SARS-CoV-2 RNA-seq timepoints against preclinical pain model datasets highlighted both conserved and unique pro-nociceptive gene expression changes following infection. Overall, this work elucidates novel transcriptomic signatures triggered by SARS-CoV-2 that may underlie both short- and long-term sensory abnormalities while also highlighting several therapeutic targets for alleviation of infection-induced hypersensitivity.

                The role of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is to control trafficking of biomolecules and protect the brain. This function can be compromised by pathological conditions. Parkinsonprimes disease (PD) is characterized by the accumulation of alpha-synuclein aggregates (alphaSN-AGs) such as oligomers and fibrils, which contribute to disease progression and severity. Here we study how alphaSN-AGs affect the BBB in in vitro co-culturing models consisting of human brain endothelial hCMEC/D3 cells alone and co-cultured with astrocytes and neurons/glial cells. When cultivated on their own, hCMEC/D3 cells were compromised by alphaSN-AGs, which decreased cellular viability, mitochondrial membrane potential, wound healing activity, TEER and permeability parameters, as well as increased the levels of ROS and NO. Co-culturing of these cells with activated microglia also increased BBB impairment according to TEER and systemic immune cell transmigration assays. In contrast, hCMEC/D3 cells co-cultured with astrocytes or dopaminergic neurons or simultaneously treated with their conditioned media showed increased resistance against alphaSN-AGs. Our work demonstrates the complex relationship between members of the neurovascular unit (NVU) (perivascular astrocytes, neurons, microglia, and endothelial cells), alphaSN-AGs and BBB.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Beat encoding at mistuned octaves within single sensory neurons</a></h4>

              
                Beats are periodic amplitude modulations resulting from the superposition of two periodic signals of different frequencies. Psychophysical experiments by Georg Simon Ohm, Hermann Helmholtz, and others from the 19th century demonstrate that beats are not only perceived for two close-by frequencies but also at mistuned octaves. However, the physiological mechanisms of this percept are still debated. Motivated by a field study, in which we observed the behavioral relevance of beats at high difference frequencies, we here study the beat encoding over a wide range of difference frequencies in the electric fish Apteronotus leptorhynchus. The activity of P-unit electroreceptor afferents, that share many properties with mammalian auditory fibers, follows a repetitive pattern with slow modulations of their firing rate reoccurring around multiples of the frequency of the carrier signal. By mathematical reasoning and supported by simulations of modified integrate-and-fire models we conclude that neither Hilbert transform, squaring, harmonics of the carrier, nor a threshold operation are sufficient to extract slow beats around the octave. Raising the thresholded signal to a power of three, however, is sufficient to explain the repetitive P-unit responses. Since the threshold-nonlinearity of the afferent's spike generator could be ruled out, it is most likely the transfer function of the electroreceptor synapse that implements such a non-linearity. In the auditory system the hair-cell synapse is known to act as a smooth threshold operation. We thus conclude that this mechanism within each auditory fiber contributes to the perception of beats at mistuned octaves.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Genetically encoded sensors for measuring histamine release both in vitro and in vivo</a></h4>

              
                Histamine (HA) is a key biogenic monoamine involved in a wide range of physiological and pathological processes in both the central nervous system and the periphery. Because the ability to directly measure extracellular HA in real-time will provide important insights into the functional role of HA in complex circuits under a variety of conditions, we developed a series of genetically encoded G protein-coupled receptor activation-based (GRAB) HA (GRABHA) sensors. These sensors produce a robust increase in fluorescence upon HA application, with good photostability, sub-second kinetics, nanomolar affinity, and high specificity. Using these GRABHA sensors, we measured electrical stimulation-evoked HA release in acute brain slices with high spatiotemporal resolution. Moreover, we recorded HA release in the preoptic area of the hypothalamus and in the medial prefrontal cortex during the sleep-wake cycle in freely moving mice, finding distinct patterns of HA release in these specific brain regions. Together, these in vitro and in vivo results show that our GRABHA sensors have high sensitivity and specificity for measuring extracellular HA, thus providing a robust new set of tools for examining the role of HA signaling in both health and disease.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Why does the error negativity peak higher when accuracy is emphasised over speed? The impact of noise and single-trial latency variability challenges traditional interpretations</a></h4>

              
                Understanding human error processing is a highly relevant interdisciplinary goal. More than 30 years of research in this field have established the error negativity (Ne) as a fundamental electrophysiological marker of various types of erroneous decisions (e.g. perceptual, economic) and related clinically relevant variations. A common finding is that the Ne is more pronounced when participants are instructed to focus on response accuracy rather than response speed, an observation that has been interpreted as reflecting more thorough error processing. We challenge this wide-spread interpretation by demonstrating that when controlling for the level of non-event-related noise in the participant-average waveform and for single-trial peak latency variability, the significant speed-accuracy difference in the participant-average waveform vanishes. This suggests that the previously reported Ne differences may be mostly attributable to a more precise alignment of neuro-cognitive processes and not (only) to more intense error processing under accuracy instructions, opening up novel perspectives on previous findings.

                Cortical depth-dependent functional magnetic resonance image (fMRI), also known as layer-fMRI, has the potential to capture directional neural information flow of brain computations within and across large-scale cortical brain networks. E.g., layer-fMRI can differentiate feedforward and feedback cortical input in hierarchically organized brain networks. Recent advancements in 3D-EPI sampling approaches and MR contrast generation strategies have allowed proof-of-principle studies showing that layer-fMRI can provide sufficient data quality for capturing laminar changes in functional connectivity. These studies have however not shown how reliable the signal is and how repeatable the respective results are. It is especially unclear whether whole-brain layer-fMRI functional connectivity protocols are widely applicable across common neuroscience-driven analysis approaches. Moreover, there are no established preprocessing fMRI methods that are optimized to work for whole-brain layer-fMRI datasets. In this work, we aimed to serve the field of layer-fMRI and build tools for future routine whole-brain layer-fMRI in application-based neuroscience research. We have developed publicly available sequences, acquisition protocols, and processing pipelines for whole-brain layer-fMRI. These protocols are validated across 60 hours of scanning in nine participants. Specifically, we identified and exploited methodological advancements for maximizing tSNR efficiency and test-retest reliability. We are sharing an extensive multi-modal whole-brain layer-fMRI dataset (20 scan hours of movie-watching in a single participant) for the purpose of benchmarking future method developments: The Kenshu dataset. With this dataset, we are also exemplifying the usefulness of whole brain layer-fMRI for commonly applied analysis approaches in modern cognitive neuroscience fMRI studies. This includes connectivity analyses, representational similarity matrix estimations, general linear model analyses, principal component analysis clustering, etc. We believe that this work paves the road for future routine measurements of directional functional connectivity across the entire brain.

                If a congenitally blind person learns to distinguish between a cube and a sphere by touch, would they immediately recognise these objects by sight if their vision is restored? This question, posed by Molyneux in 1688, has puzzled philosophers and scientists. We overcame ethical and practical difficulties in the study of cross-modal recognition by using inexperienced chicks. We hatched chicks in darkness, exposed them to tactile smooth vs. bumpy stimuli in darkness and then tested them in a visual recognition task. At first sight, chicks previously exposed to smooth stimuli approached the smooth stimulus significantly more than those exposed to the bumpy stimuli. This shows that cross-modal recognition does not require multi-modal experience. At least in precocial species, supra-modal brain areas already function at birth.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Decision-making in dynamic, continuously evolving environments: quantifying the flexibility of human choice</a></h4>

              
                During perceptual decision-making tasks, centroparietal EEG potentials report an evidence accumulation-to-bound process that is time locked to trial onset. However, decisions in real-world environments are rarely confined to discrete trials; they instead unfold continuously, with accumulation of time-varying evidence being recency-weighted towards its immediate past. Confronted with time-varying stimuli, humans can appropriately adapt their weighting of recent evidence according to the statistics of the environment. The neural mechanisms supporting this adaptation currently remain unclear. Here, we show that humans' ability to adapt evidence weighting to different sensory environments is reflected in changes in centroparietal EEG potentials. We use a novel continuous task design to show that the Centroparietal Positivity (CPP) becomes more sensitive to fluctuations in sensory evidence when large shifts in evidence are less frequent, and is primarily sensitive to fluctuations in decision-relevant (not decision-irrelevant) sensory input. A complementary triphasic component over parietal cortex encodes the sum of recently accumulated sensory evidence, and its magnitude covaries with the duration over which different individuals integrate sensory evidence. Our findings reveal how adaptations in centroparietal responses reflect flexibility in evidence accumulation to the statistics of dynamic sensory environments.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Humans rely more on talker identity than temporal coherence in an audiovisual selective attention task using speech-like stimuli</a></h4>

              
                Audiovisual integration of speech can benefit the listener by not only improving comprehension of what a talker is saying but also helping a listener pick a particular talker's voice out of a mix of sounds. Binding, an early integration of auditory and visual streams that helps an observer allocate attention to a combined audiovisual object, is likely involved in audiovisual speech processing. Although temporal coherence of stimulus features across sensory modalities has been implicated as an important cue for non-speech stimuli (Maddox et al, 2015), the specific cues that drive binding in speech are not fully understood due to the challenges of studying binding in natural stimuli. Here we used speech-like artificial stimuli that allowed us to isolate three potential contributors to binding: temporal coherence (are the face and the voice changing synchronously?), articulatory correspondence (do visual faces represent the correct phones?), and talker congruence (do the face and voice come from the same person?). In a trio of experiments, we examined the relative contributions of each of these cues. Normal hearing listeners performed a dual detection task in which they were instructed to respond to events in a target auditory stream and a visual stream while ignoring events in a distractor auditory stream. We found that viewing the face of a talker who matched the attended voice (i.e., talker congruence) offered a performance benefit. Importantly, we found no effect of temporal coherence on performance in this task, a result that prompts an important recontextualization of previous findings.

                Current approaches for studying pathologic changes in the retina associated with Alzheimer's Disease (AD) remain heterogeneous, limiting the use of retinal amyloid-beta as a viable biomarker for AD. Transcriptomic profiling of the retina has provided cell-specific insight into AD progression in the brain yet is lacking in the retina. In this study, we implemented a non-biased approach through next-generation sequencing to profile frozen archived retinal tissues from autopsy/pathologically confirmed AD and non-diagnosed cases (NonAD). A total of 37,211 nuclei were isolated from frozen retinal tissue punches originating from AD, and 31,326 were isolated from non-diagnosed cases. Gene expression patterns specific to the retinal region and major retinal cell types were represented in both tissue groups. AD-associated genes were differentially expressed in AD retinal glial cells, including microglia. A greater percentage of microglial nuclei from AD retinal nuclei expressed TYRO protein tyrosine kinase-binding protein (TYROBP) compared to nonAD retinal nuclei. However, compared to microglia from single retinal cell datasets from elderly non-diseased individuals, TYROBP expression is highly expressed in the single cell data set, indicating TYROBP transcripts reside within the cytoplasm. However, other AD-associated genes were differentially expressed in AD nuclei such as DOCK2, PICALM, and PLCG2 compared to non-diseased single-cell microglia, implicating a role of these genes in the AD retina. To summarize, we extracted a high number of nuclei from frozen retinal tissue that retain specific gene markers for cell classification and highlighted candidate AD-associated genes in retinal microglia that may be viable in future AD retinal studies.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Egocentric value maps of the near-body environment</a></h4>

              
                Body-part centric response fields are pervasive: they are observed in single neurons, fMRI, EEG, and multiple behavioural measures. This prevalence across scales and measures makes them excellent candidates for studying systems-level neuroscience. Nonetheless, they remain poorly understood because we lack a unifying formal explanation of their origins and role in wider brain function. Here, we provide such explanation. We use reinforcement learning to analytically explain the existence of body-part centric receptive fields, also known as peripersonal field. We then simulate multiple experimental findings considered foundational in the peripersonal space literature. Our results demonstrate that peripersonal fields naturally arise from two simple and plausible assumptions about living agents: 1) they experience reward when they contact objects in the environment, and 2) they act to maximise reward. These simple assumptions are enough to explain empirical findings on stimulus kinematics, tool use, valence, and network-architecture. Our explanation provides further insight. First, it offers multiple empirically testable predictions. Second, it offers a formal description of the notion that the world-agent state is encoded in parieto-premotor cortices, using motor primitives: peripersonal fields provide building blocks that together create a short-term model of the world near the agent in terms of its future states; a successor representation. This short-term, close-range egocentric peripersonal map is analogous to the long-term, long-range allocentric spatial map of place and grid cells, which underlie locomotion and navigation to reach distant objects. Together, these allocentric and egocentric maps allow efficient interactions with a changing environment across multiple spatial and temporal scales.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A biologically plausible dynamic deep network for recognizing structure from motion and biological motion</a></h4>

              
                A breakthrough in the understanding of dynamic 3D shape recognition was the discovery that our visual system can extract 3D shape from inputs having only sparse motion cues such as (i) point light displays and (ii) random dot displays representing rotating 3D shapes - phenomena named as biological motion (BM) processing and structure from motion (SFM) respectively. Previous psychological and computational modeling studies viewed these two as separate phenomena and could not fully identify the shared visual processing mechanisms underlying the two phenomena. Using a series of simulation studies, we describe the operations of a dynamic deep network model to explain the mechanisms underlying both SFM and BM processing. In simulation-1, the proposed Structure from Motion Network (SFMNW) is trained using displays of 5 rotating surfaces (cylinder, cone, ellipsoid, sphere and helix) and tested on its shape recognition performance under a variety of conditions: (i) varying dot density, (ii) eliminating local feature stability by introducing a finite dot lifetime, (iii) orienting shapes, (iv) occluding boundaries and intrinsic surfaces (v) embedding shape in static and dynamic noise backgrounds. Our results indicate that smaller dot density of rotating shape, oriented shapes, occluding boundaries, and dynamic noise backgrounds reduced the model's performance whereas eliminating local feature stability, occluding intrinsic boundaries, and static noise backgrounds had little effect on shape recognition, suggesting that the motion of high curvature regions like shape boundaries provide strong cues in shape recognition. In simulation-2, the proposed Biological Motion Network (BMNW) is trained using 6 point-light actions (crawl, cycle, walk, jump, wave, and salute) and tested its action recognition performance on various conditions: (i) inverted (ii) scrambled (iii) tilted (iv) masked (v) actions, embedded in static and dynamic noise backgrounds. Model performance dropped significantly for the presentation of inverted and tilted actions. On the other hand, better accuracy was attained in distinguishing scrambled, masked actions, performed under static and dynamic noise backgrounds, suggesting that critical joint movements and their movement pattern generated in the course of action (actor configuration) play a key role in action recognition performance. We also presented the above two models with mixed stimuli (a point light actions embedded in rotating shapes), and achieved significantly high accuracies. Based on the above results we hypothesize that visual motion circuitry supporting robust SFM processing is also involved in the BM processing. The proposed models provide new insights into the relationships between the two visual motion phenomena viz., SFM and BM processing.

                Noise-induced hearing impairment can mediate delayed injury of spiral neurons (SGNs), resulting in degeneration of nerve fibers, synaptic degeneration and even death of SGNs. We believe that delayed injury is related to mitochondrial energy metabolism disorders. Therefore, we investigated ATP and the electron transport chain (ETC) in rat SGNs after noise injury and found that with prolonged injury time, ATP synthesis and the expression of complexes II and IV decreased, indicating the functional decline of the ETC. The maintenance of ETC function is related to subunit import and assembly of the complex. The disulfide relay mechanism controlled by the apoptosis inducing factor/coiled-coil-helix-coiled-coil-helix domain-containing protein 4 (AIF/CHCHD4) pathway can regulate mitochondrial protein import. The results showed that AIF expression in SGNs decreased after noise exposure, indicating that noise damage to SGNs can restore intramitochondrial protein input by downregulating the AIF/CHCHD4 pathway, hindering ETC function; insufficient ETC function is a possible reason for the delayed injury of SGNs.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A premotor microcircuit to generate behavior-specific muscle activation patterns in Drosophila larvae</a></h4>

              
                Animals can use a common set of muscles and motor neurons (MNs) to generate diverse locomotor behaviors, but how this is accomplished remains poorly understood. Previously, we characterized the muscle activity patterns for Drosophila larval forward and backward locomotion and found that ventral oblique (VO) muscles become active earlier in backward than in forward locomotion (Zarin et al. 2019). Here, we describe how premotor circuits generate differential activation timing of VO muscles. We identify inhibitory (A06c) and excitatory (A27h) premotor neurons (PMNs) with the greatest number of synapses with VO MNs. Strikingly, A06c is a bi-modal PMN that fires before and after VO MNs in forward locomotion but fires only after MNs in backward locomotion. Further, A27h is a forward-dedicated PMN active only in forward locomotion. These two PMNs interconnect with another forward-dedicated excitatory PMN (A18b3), to create feedforward inhibitory microcircuits that define the activity window for VO MNs/muscles, producing precise VO muscle patterns underlying forward locomotion. Silencing A06c, A27h or A18b3 PMN results in premature VO muscle activation in forward locomotion, resembling early VO activation in backward locomotion. Our results identify PMN micro-circuits that produce unique MN/muscle activity patterns to create behavior-specific motor output.

	<p>Many studies have focused on navigation, spatial skills, and the olfactory system in comparative models, including those concerning the relationship between them and physical activity. Although the results are often in contrast with each other, it is assumed that physical activity can affect cognition in different ways&amp;amp;mdash;both indirectly and through a certain influence on some brain structures. In contrast, there is little research that focuses on the relationship between spatial abilities and olfactory abilities in humans. This research aimed to evaluate and compare the performance in working memory tasks of athletes and non-athletes who require good visual&amp;amp;ndash;spatial navigation, olfactory&amp;amp;ndash;spatial navigation, and olfactory&amp;amp;ndash;semantic skills. The study involved 236 participants (83 athletes) between the ages of 18 and 40. All subjects were matched by age or sex. The standard Corsi Block Tapping Test (CBTT) was administrated to investigate the visual-spatial memory. Olfactory&amp;amp;ndash;spatial navigation and olfactory&amp;amp;ndash;semantic skills were assessed with two modified versions of CBTT: Olfactory CBTT (OCBTT) and Semantic&amp;amp;ndash;Olfactory CBTT (SOCBTT) respectively. The results show differences between the CORSI conditions in direction of a poor performance for athletes. A gender effect in favor of men was also found, particularly in the classic version of the CBTT. Both groups performed better in the classic version of the CBTT than OCBTT and SOCBTT. The mean of SOCBTT results is markedly lower, perhaps due to the different information processing systems needed to perform this kind of task. It is possible to explain how sports practice can affect tasks that require spatial skills and olfactory perception differently, thus supporting new hypotheses and opening new scientific horizons.</p>

	<p>New technologies, such as fiber photometry, can overcome long-standing methodological limitations and promote a better understanding of neuronal mechanisms. This study, for the first time, aimed at employing the newly available dopamine indicator (GRABDA2m) in combination with this novel imaging technique. Here, we present a detailed methodological roadmap leading to longitudinal repetitive transmitter release monitoring in in vivo freely moving animals and provide proof-of-concept data. This novel approach enables a fresh look at dopamine release patterns in the nucleus accumbens, following the medial forebrain bundle (mfb) DBS in a rodent model. Our results suggest reliable readouts of dopamine levels over at least 14 days of DBS-induced photometric measurements. We show that mfb-DBS can elicit an increased dopamine response during stimulation (5 s and 20 s DBS) compared to its baseline dopamine activity state, reaching its maximum peak amplitude in about 1 s and then recovering back after stimulation. The effect of different DBS pulse widths (PWs) also suggests a potential differential effect on this neurotransmitter response, but future studies would need to verify this. Using the described approach, we aim to gain insights into the differences between pathological and healthy models and to elucidate more exhaustively the mechanisms under which DBS exerts its therapeutic action.</p>

	<p>With discoveries of brain and spinal cord mechanisms that control gait, and disrupt gait coordination after disease or injury, and that respond to motor training for those with neurological disease or injury, there is greater ability to construct more efficacious gait coordination training paradigms. Therefore, it is critical in these contemporary times, to use the most precise, sensitive, homogeneous (i.e., domain-specific), and comprehensive measures available to assess gait coordination, dyscoordination, and changes in response to treatment. Gait coordination is defined as the simultaneous performance of the spatial and temporal components of gait. While kinematic gait measures are considered the gold standard, the equipment and analysis cost and time preclude their use in most clinics. At the same time, observational gait coordination scales can be considered. Two independent groups identified the Gait Assessment and Intervention Tool (G.A.I.T.) as the most suitable scale for both research and clinical practice, compared to other observational gait scales, since it has been proven to be valid, reliable, sensitive to change, homogeneous, and comprehensive. The G.A.I.T. has shown strong reliability, validity, and sensitive precision for those with stroke or multiple sclerosis (MS). The G.A.I.T. has been translated into four languages (English, Spanish, Taiwanese, and Portuguese (translation is complete, but not yet published)), and is in use in at least 10 countries. As a contribution to the field, and in view of the evidence for continued usefulness and international use for the G.A.I.T. measure, we have provided this update, as well as an open access copy of the measure for use in clinical practice and research, as well as directions for administering the G.A.I.T.</p>

	<p>Self-enhancement (SE) is often overlooked as a fundamental cognitive ability mediated via the Prefrontal Cortex (PFC). Here, we present research that establishes the relationship between the PFC, SE, and the potential evolved beneficial mechanisms. Specifically, we believe there is now enough evidence to speculate that SE exists to provide significant benefits and should be considered a normal aspect of the self. Whatever the metabolic or social cost, the upside of SE is great enough that it is a core and fundamental psychological construct. Furthermore, though entirely theoretical, we suggest that a critical reason the PFC has evolved so significantly in Homo sapiens is to, in part, sustain SE. We, therefore, elaborate on its proximate and ultimate mechanisms.</p>

	<p>While naturalistic stimuli, such as movies, better represent the complexity of the real world and are perhaps crucial to understanding the dynamics of emotion processing, there is limited research on emotions with naturalistic stimuli. There is a need to understand the temporal dynamics of emotion processing and their relationship to different dimensions of emotion experience. In addition, there is a need to understand the dynamics of functional connectivity underlying different emotional experiences that occur during or prior to such experiences. To address these questions, we recorded the EEG of participants and asked them to mark the temporal location of their emotional experience as they watched a video. We also obtained self-assessment ratings for emotional multimedia stimuli. We calculated dynamic functional the connectivity (DFC) patterns in all the frequency bands, including information about hubs in the network. The change in functional networks was quantified in terms of temporal variability, which was then used in regression analysis to evaluate whether temporal variability in DFC (tvDFC) could predict different dimensions of emotional experience. We observed that the connectivity patterns in the upper beta band could differentiate emotion categories better during or prior to the reported emotional experience. The temporal variability in functional connectivity dynamics is primarily related to emotional arousal followed by dominance. The hubs in the functional networks were found across the right frontal and bilateral parietal lobes, which have been reported to facilitate affect, interoception, action, and memory-related processing. Since our study was performed with naturalistic real-life resembling emotional videos, the study contributes significantly to understanding the dynamics of emotion processing. The results support constructivist theories of emotional experience and show that changes in dynamic functional connectivity can predict aspects of our emotional experience.</p>

	<p>This systematic review&amp;amp;rsquo;s purpose was to evaluate the effectiveness of lower-limb and foot somatosensory stimulation to improve balance and gait post-stroke. PRISMA reporting guidelines were followed. Included studies: randomized controlled trials (RCTs), published in English with ethical approval statement. Studies of conditions other than stroke, functional electrical stimulation, and interventions eliciting muscle contraction, were excluded. AgeLine, AMED, CINAHL PLUS, EMBASE, EMCARE MEDLINE, PEDro, PsycARTICLES, PsycINFO, SPORTDiscus, Web of Science and Cochrane central register of controlled trials were searched from 1 January 2002 to 31 March 2022. Two authors independently screened results, extracted data and assessed study quality using Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 tool; 16 RCTs (n = 638) were included. Four studies showed a medium or large standardized between-group effect size (Cohen&amp;amp;rsquo;s d) in favor of somatosensory stimulation, in relation to: customized insoles (d = 0.527), taping (d = 0.687), and electrical stimulation (two studies: d = 0.690 and d = 1.984). Although limited by study quality and heterogeneity of interventions and outcomes, with only one study&amp;amp;rsquo;s results statistically significant, several interventions showed potential for benefit, exceeding the minimally important difference for gait speed. Further research with larger trials is required. This unfunded systematic review was registered with PROSPERO (number CRD42022321199).</p>

	<p>Visual encoding models based on deep neural networks (DNN) show good performance in predicting brain activity in low-level visual areas. However, due to the amount of neural data limitation, DNN-based visual encoding models are difficult to fit for high-level visual areas, resulting in insufficient encoding performance. The ventral stream suggests that higher visual areas receive information from lower visual areas, which is not fully reflected in the current encoding models. In the present study, we propose a novel visual encoding model framework which uses the hierarchy of representations in the ventral stream to improve the model&amp;amp;rsquo;s performance in high-level visual areas. Under the framework, we propose two categories of hierarchical encoding models from the voxel and the feature perspectives to realize the hierarchical representations. From the voxel perspective, we first constructed an encoding model for the low-level visual area (V1 or V2) and extracted the voxel space predicted by the model. Then we use the extracted voxel space of the low-level visual area to predict the voxel space of the high-level visual area (V4 or LO) via constructing a voxel-to-voxel model. From the feature perspective, the feature space of the first model is extracted to predict the voxel space of the high-level visual area. The experimental results show that two categories of hierarchical encoding models effectively improve the encoding performance in V4 and LO. In addition, the proportion of the best-encoded voxels for different models in V4 and LO show that our proposed models have obvious advantages in prediction accuracy. We find that the hierarchy of representations in the ventral stream has a positive effect on improving the performance of the existing model in high-level visual areas.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Multiscale Computer Modeling of Spreading Depolarization in Brain Slices</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Spreading depolarization (SD) is a slow-moving wave of neuronal depolarization accompanied by a breakdown of ion concentration homeostasis, followed by long periods of neuronal silence (spreading depression), and is associated with several neurologic conditions. We developed multiscale (ions to tissue slice) computer models of SD in brain slices using the NEURON simulator: 36,000 neurons (two voltage-gated ion channels; three leak channels; three ion exchangers/pumps) in the extracellular space (ECS) of a slice (1 mm sides, varying thicknesses) with ion (K<sup>+</sup>, Cl<sup>&ndash;</sup>, Na<sup>+</sup>) and O<SUB>2</SUB> diffusion and equilibration with a surrounding bath. Glia and neurons cleared K<sup>+</sup> from the ECS via Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> pumps. SD propagated through the slices at realistic speeds of 2&ndash;4 mm/min, which increased by as much as 50% in models incorporating the effects of hypoxia or propionate. In both cases, the speedup was mediated principally by ECS shrinkage. Our model allows us to make testable predictions, including the following: (1) SD can be inhibited by enlarging ECS volume; (2) SD velocity will be greater in areas with greater neuronal density, total neuronal volume, or larger/more dendrites; (3) SD is all-or-none: initiating K<sup>+</sup> bolus properties have little impact on SD speed; (4) Slice thickness influences SD because of relative hypoxia in the slice core, exacerbated by SD in a pathologic cycle; and (5) SD and high neuronal spike rates will be observed in the core of the slice. Cells in the periphery of the slice near an oxygenated bath will resist SD.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">TMS Does Not Increase BOLD Activity at the Site of Stimulation: A Review of All Concurrent TMS-fMRI Studies</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is widely used for understanding brain function in neurologically intact subjects and for the treatment of various disorders. However, the precise neurophysiological effects of TMS at the site of stimulation remain poorly understood. The local effects of TMS can be studied using concurrent TMS-functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), a technique where TMS is delivered during fMRI scanning. However, although concurrent TMS-fMRI was developed over 20 years ago and dozens of studies have used this technique, there is still no consensus on whether TMS increases blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) activity at the site of stimulation. To address this question, here we review all previous concurrent TMS-fMRI studies that reported analyses of BOLD activity at the target location. We find evidence that TMS increases local BOLD activity when stimulating the primary motor (M1) and visual (V1) cortices but that these effects are likely driven by the downstream consequences of TMS (finger twitches and phosphenes). However, TMS does not appear to increase BOLD activity at the site of stimulation for areas outside of the M1 and V1 when conducted at rest. We examine the possible reasons for such lack of BOLD signal increase based on recent work in nonhuman animals. We argue that the current evidence points to TMS inducing periods of increased and decreased neuronal firing that mostly cancel each other out and therefore lead to no change in the overall BOLD signal.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">New Subregions of the Mouse Entopeduncular Nucleus Defined by the Complementary Immunoreactivities for Substance P and Cannabinoid Type-1 Receptor Combined with Distributions of Different Neuronal Types</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>The entopeduncular nucleus (EPN) and substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) constitute the output nuclei of the basal ganglia, but studies on the EPN are limited compared with those on the SNr. Both nuclei receive projections from the striatum with axons containing substance P (SP) and cannabinoid type-1 receptor (CB1R), and immunoreactivities for these substances show complementary patterns in the striatum and SNr. In this study, we revealed a similar complementarity in the mouse EPN, combined it with region-specific neuronal distributions, and defined subregions of the EPN. First, the EPN was divided into two areas, one showing low SP and high CB1R (lSP/hCB1R) immunoreactivities, and the other showing high SP and low CB1R (hSP/lCB1R). The former received inputs from the dorsolateral striatum that are innervated by sensorimotor cortices, whereas the latter received inputs from the medial striatum that are innervated by limbic/association cortices. Then, the lSP/hCB1R area was further divided into the dorsolateral subregion in the rostral EPN and the core subregion in the caudal EPN, the latter characterized by the concentration of parvalbumin-positive neurons targeting the ventral anterior&ndash;ventral lateral thalamic nucleus. The hSP/lCB1R area was divided into the ventromedial subregion in the rostral EPN and the shell subregion in the caudal EPN, the former characterized by the concentration of nitric oxide synthase-positive neurons targeting the lateral habenula (LHb). Somatostatin-positive neurons targeting the LHb were located diffusely in three subregions other than the core. These findings illuminate structural organization inside the basal ganglia, suggesting mechanisms for sorting diverse information through parallel loops with differing synaptic modulation by CB1R.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Studies on the ethnopharmacology, antimicrobial activity, and toxicity of Catha edulis (Vahl.) Endl., in Sprague Dawley rats [version 2; peer review: 2 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The Mbeere South community of Embu County consume leaves of Catha edulis for its stimulant and euphoretic actions. Other indigenous uses of the plant are undocumented. Information on the pharmacology and safety of this plant is also scanty. This study aimed to document the ethnopharmacology, antimicrobial properties, and toxicity of C. edulis leaves collected from the Mbeere South community in Kenya. Methods: Ethnopharmacological data was collected from 35 informants using semi-structured questionnaires. Leaf extracts of C. edulis were prepared using acetone, water, and methanol. The antimicrobial properties of these extracts were evaluated against Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Candida albicans. The toxicity of the aqueous extract was determined using hematological, biochemical, and histopathological parameters in male and female Sprague Dawley rats at 250 mg/kg, 500 mg/kg, and 1000 mg/kg doses over 28 days. p<0.05 was considered significant. Results: All informants were male, most were married, >50 years old, with >10 years of experience. The sources, local names, preparation, storage conditions, indications, frequency of use, dosage, and side effects of C. edulis were documented. All extracts were ineffective against E. coli, P. aeruginosa, and C. albicans. They had limited efficacy against B. cereus and S. aureus. Significant differences were observed in the hematological and biochemical parameters of rats at the tested doses. Low, intermediate, and high doses of the aqueous extract of C. edulis produced local congestion of the cardiac and hepatic vessels. Localized interstitial connective tissue proliferation, multifocal kidney interstitial hemorrhage, and localized tubular epithelium necrosis were also observed in female rats. Conclusions: The ethnobotanical uses of C. edulis among the Mbeere South community were documented for the first time. Limited antimicrobial efficacy and toxicity at high doses limit the use of leaves of C. edulis.

                Vaccines have played a central role in dealing with COVID-19 pandemic. Now regulatory agencies in USA and around the world have begun approving vaccination for kids. Long term safety profile of live attenuated viral vaccines, inactivated viral vaccines and peptide-based vaccines are well studied in children, are safe and can play a central role in controlling the spread of COVID19 in children. But the long-term safety profile of viral vector-based vaccines is not studied. In the present correspondence we highlight the possibility of random insertional mutagenesis and potential side effects, which might be evident after long-term.  Regulators must take into consideration the possibility of insertional mutagenesis and conduct long term studies before approving the viral vector vaccines in children, so that the public have trust in the regulatory agencies and are compliant towards vaccinating their children with safe and effective vaccines.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Case Report: A rare presentation of prostate cancer with peritoneal carcinomatosis and malignant ascites complicated by tumor lysis syndrome [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Only 32 cases of prostate cancer with peritoneal carcinomatosis and ascites have currently been reported in the literature. We present the first reported case of prostate cancer with peritoneal carcinomatosis and malignant ascites whose treatment was complicated by tumor lysis syndrome along with a literature review evaluating similar cases. Case: We present a rare case of a 78-year-old retired Caucasian male with recurrent metastatic prostate cancer and malignant ascites. He had previously received definitive radiotherapy for localized prostate cancer but presented with bilateral hydronephrosis and right-sided bladder wall thickening 10 years later. He had imaging evidence of locoregional recurrence with elevated prostate specific antigen (PSA) and was initiated on combined androgen blockade with intramuscular leuprolide and oral bicalutamide. After being transferred to Scripps Clinic, he was found to have a solitary right upper lobe pulmonary lesion for which he completed stereotactic body radiation therapy. Then, 10 months later, he developed new onset malignant ascites and was treated with two cycles of intravenous docetaxel. Treatment resulted in improvement in his ascites and reduction in PSA. Unfortunately, his course was complicated by tumor lysis syndrome, encephalopathy, Escherichia coli bacteremia, and a fatal saddle pulmonary embolism. Conclusions: (1) Occurrence of ascites in prostate cancer patients is associated with worse prognosis than non-ascitic variants. (2) More common etiologies of ascites must be evaluated for. (3) Ascitic fluid prostate specific antigen (PSA) measurement may aid in diagnosis of malignant ascites in cases with diagnostic uncertainty. (4) Patients with advanced disease may benefit from combined hormonal and cytotoxic therapies. (5) Awareness of the occurrence of tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) in patients treated for prostate cancer can help identify patients in whom prophylaxis would be beneficial.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The influence of strategic innovation management on firm innovation performance in the Indonesian mid-size telecommunication industry [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The telecommunication industry was one of the Indonesian government's priorities in the national development plan 2015-2035. “Primary Industry” was the term for the priority industries with the central role as the prime mover in the future national economy. Various natural, human, technological, innovative, and creative resources were imperative in supporting the underlining national industry development plan. Strategic innovation management refers to the entire sequence of innovation practices, including competition mechanism analysis, such as creating an innovative vision, business strategy alignment, disseminating strategy at an entire organizational level, market tendency, technology, and competitor’s action. Firm innovation performance refers to the measurement of innovation efficiency (the number of new products, product novelty, new product development speed, and new product success rate) and innovation profitability (new product revenue proportion, quality enhancement, cost reduction, and value improvement) conducted by the firm. This study investigates the effect of Innovation Strategy, Organizational Structure, Innovation Culture, Technological Capability, and Customer-Supplier Relationship (these were the practice of Strategic Innovation Management mentioned in various literature) on Firm Innovation Performance.  Methods: A quantitative method, from a practical perspective, was employed to investigate the causal relationship between strategic innovation management and firm innovation performance. Data was gathered through a validated and reliable questionnaire disseminated to 90 respondents. It included a representative from the four sub-sectors of the telecommunication industry, namely fixed networks, wireless networks, telecommunication services, and special telecommunication.  Results: The survey found that firms within the telecommunication industry already employed Strategic Innovation Management practices. Moreover, this study also found that Innovation Culture, Technological Capability, and Customer-Suppler Relationship significantly influence Firm Innovation Performance.  Conclusion:   The implementation of Strategic Innovation Management in the mid-size companies within Indonesia's telecommunication industry appears to be relatively high. It indicates that firms within the industry were able to strategically compete by implementing Strategic Innovation Management.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Does online mindfulness-based intervention help college students succeed in their job search during the COVID-19 pandemic? [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Immediately after graduation from university, college students need to make significant decisions about starting their careers or pursuing higher studies. They are also pressured to meet the expectations and demands of self, others, and the environment. Owing to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the aforementioned challenging decisions may become hazardous stressors for college students. Hence, the researchers intended to assist and assess the college students involved in student placements. The research goal was to investigate the impact of mindfulness-based intervention (MBI) on the stress and self-esteem of college students involved in student placements.  Methods: One hundred college students participating in the campus placements were selected using purposive sampling from Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham University in Coimbatore, India. For evaluation purposes, college students were administered the perceived stress, Rosenberg self-esteem, and Kuppuswamy socio-economic scales. Seventy-five college students were selected for the MBI process and were administered with a pre-intervention and post-intervention without a control group research design. Results: Statistical analysis including analysis of variance (ANOVA) and the Bonferroni post hoc test showed a significant increase in self-esteem and a decrease in the stress of the college students involved in placements. Conclusions: Thus, the researchers recommend that policymakers create awareness, include MBI in the curriculum, and allocate funds for training ventures in educational institutions to assist college students in their challenging life journeys

                Background: The prevalence of depression is higher among women in the general population. While previous studies have contributed to demonstrating a higher risk of depression among women, there is a scarcity of studies on depression issues among women who experienced life as a spouse to drug addicts. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the association between parental stress faced in raising children and depression. Moreover, the study intended to examine the impact of parental stress on depression as mediated by resilience. Methods: Using the purposive sampling method, a total of 132 B40 wives of drug addicts were chosen to participate in this study. Data were collected from six states in Malaysia using a structured questionnaire consisting of the Parental Stress Scale (PSS), Brief Resilience Scale (BRS), and Zung’s Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS). SmartPLS software version 3.3.7 was used to analyze the data collected. Results: Path analysis revealed that parental stress was significantly associated with depression through resilience. Specifically, the indirect effect highlighted that resilience was a partial mediator in the association between parental stress and depression. Nevertheless, it is also shown that even after accounting for the mediating role of resilience, parental stress still has a positive impact on depression. Conclusions: The present study proffers additional strategies to drug addicts’ wives, advocates, academicians, practitioners, and policymakers to approach depression issues in this community for better well-being.

Habitat availability determines the distribution of migratory waterfowl along their flyway, which further influences the transmission and spatial spread of avian influenza viruses (AIVs). The extensive habitat loss in the East Asian-Australasian Flyway (EAAF) may have potentially altered the virus spread and transmission, but those consequences are rarely studied. We constructed 6 fall migration networks that differed in their level of habitat loss, wherein an increase in habitat loss resulted in smaller networks with fewer sites and links. We integrated an agent-based model and a susceptible-infected-recovered model to simulate waterfowl migration and AIV transmission. We found that extensive habitat loss in the EAAF can 1) relocate the outbreaks northwards, responding to the distribution changes of wintering waterfowl geese, 2) increase the outbreak risk in remaining sites due to larger goose congregations, and 3) facilitate AIV transmission in the migratory population. In addition, our modeling output was in line with the predictions from the concept of “migratory escape”, i.e., the migration allows the geese to “escape” from the location where infection risk is high, affecting the pattern of infection prevalence in the waterfowl population. Our modeling shed light on the potential consequences of habitat loss in spreading and transmitting AIV at the flyway scale and suggested the driving mechanisms behind these effects, indicating the importance of conservation in changing spatial and temporal patterns of AIV outbreaks.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Network modeling of dynamic brain interactions predicts emergence of neural information that supports human cognitive behavior</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Ravi D. Mill, Julia L. Hamilton, Emily C. Winfield, Nicole Lalta, Richard H. Chen, Michael W. Cole</p>

How cognitive task behavior is generated by brain network interactions is a central question in neuroscience. Answering this question calls for the development of novel analysis tools that can firstly capture neural signatures of task information with high spatial and temporal precision (the “where and when”) and then allow for empirical testing of alternative network models of brain function that link information to behavior (the “how”). We outline a novel network modeling approach suited to this purpose that is applied to noninvasive functional neuroimaging data in humans. We first dynamically decoded the spatiotemporal signatures of task information in the human brain by combining MRI-individualized source electroencephalography (EEG) with multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA). A newly developed network modeling approach—dynamic activity flow modeling—then simulated the flow of task-evoked activity over more causally interpretable (relative to standard functional connectivity [FC] approaches) resting-state functional connections (dynamic, lagged, direct, and directional). We demonstrate the utility of this modeling approach by applying it to elucidate network processes underlying sensory–motor information flow in the brain, revealing accurate predictions of empirical response information dynamics underlying behavior. Extending the model toward simulating network lesions suggested a role for the cognitive control networks (CCNs) as primary drivers of response information flow, transitioning from early dorsal attention network-dominated sensory-to-response transformation to later collaborative CCN engagement during response selection. These results demonstrate the utility of the dynamic activity flow modeling approach in identifying the generative network processes underlying neurocognitive phenomena.

                Background: Widespread adoption of a westernized diet represents a major lifestyle change characterized by substantially higher sodium consumption and lower potassium intake, which is related to cardiovascular morbidity. Methods: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis over published studies in accordance with quantifying the dietary intake of sodium and potassium of the universal population across the world. The PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar databases were used to find research that pronounced 24-hour urinary sodium or potassium excretion (reference period: 2014–2021). The effect size was estimated using the fixed-effect model; sub-group analysis become accomplished to determine urinary sodium and potassium excretion disaggregated by geographical location. Publication bias became evaluated the usage of graphical funnel plot. Data analysis was performed using STATA 16. Results: Forty-three studies (n= 62,940) qualified the selection criteria. The mean urinary excretion of sodium and potassium was 156.73 mmol/24h [95% confidence interval (CI), 148.98–164.47] and 48.89 mmol/24 h (95% CI, 43.61–54.17), respectively; the mean urinary sodium/potassium ratio was 3.68 (95% CI, 2.96–4.40). Conclusions: This updated systematic review highlights excessively high dietary intake of sodium and low intake of potassium at the community level in most parts of the world. The urinary Na/K ratio exceeded the level recommended by the WHO guidelines.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Evidence on associations of lifestyle factors with Alzheimer's pathology and cognition are ambiguous, potentially because they rarely addressed inter-relationships of factors and sex effects. While considering these aspects, we examined the relationships of lifestyle factors with brain amyloid burden and cognition.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We studied 178 cognitively normal individuals (women, 49%; 65.0 [7.6] years) and 54 individuals with mild cognitive impairment (women, 35%; 71.3 [8.3] years) enrolled in a prospective study of volunteers who completed <sup>18</sup>F-Flutemetamol amyloid positron emission tomography. Using structural equation modeling, we examined associations between latent constructs representing metabolic/vascular risk, physical activity, and cognitive activity with global amyloid burden and cognitive performance. Furthermore, we investigated the influence of sex in this model.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Overall, higher cognitive activity was associated with better cognitive performance and higher physical activity was associated with lower amyloid burden. The latter association was weakened to a nonsignificant level after excluding multivariate outliers. Examination of the moderating effect of sex in the model revealed an inverse association of metabolic/vascular risk with cognition in men, whereas in women metabolic/vascular risk trended toward increased amyloid burden. Furthermore, a significant inverse association between physical activity and amyloid burden was found only in men. Inheritance of an APOE4 allele was associated with higher amyloid burden only in women.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Sex modifies effects of certain lifestyle-related factors on amyloid burden and cognition. Notably, our results suggest that the negative impact of metabolic/vascular risk influences the risk of cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease through distinct paths in women and men.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>This study was undertaken to evaluate functional and safety outcomes for endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) versus medical management (MM) in patients with large vessel occlusion (LVO) and mild neurological deficits, stratified by perfusion imaging mismatch.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>The pooled cohort consisted of patients with National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) &lt; 6 and internal carotid artery (ICA), M1, or M2 occlusions from the Extending the Time for Thrombolysis in Emergecy Neurological Deficits - Intra-Arterial (EXTEND-IA) Trial,  Tenecteplase vs Alteplase before Endovascular Thrombectomy in Ischemic Stroke (EXTEND-IA TNK) trials Part I/II and prospective data from 15 EVT centers from October 2010 to April 2020. RAPID software estimated ischemic core and mismatch. Patients receiving primary EVT (EVT<sub>pri</sub>) were compared to those who received primary MM (MM<sub>pri</sub>), including those who deteriorated and received rescue EVT, in overall and propensity score (PS)-matched cohorts. Patients were stratified by target mismatch (mismatch ratio ≥ 1.8 and mismatch volume ≥ 15ml). Primary outcome was functional independence (90-day modified Rankin Scale = 0–2). Secondary outcomes included safety (symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage [sICH], neurological worsening, and mortality).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Of 540 patients, 286 (53%) received EVT<sub>pri</sub> and demonstrated larger critically hypoperfused tissue (Tmax &gt; 6 seconds) volumes (median [IQR]: 64 [26–96] ml vs MM<sub>pri</sub>: 40 [14–76] ml, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and higher presentation NIHSS (median [IQR]: 4 [2–5] vs MM<sub>pri</sub>: 3 [2–4], <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Functional independence was similar (EVT<sub>pri</sub>: 77.4% vs MM<sub>pri</sub>: 75.6%, adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.29, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.82–2.03, <i>p</i> = 0.27). EVT had worse safety regarding sICH (EVT<sub>pri</sub>: 16.3% vs MM<sub>pri</sub>: 1.3%, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and neurological worsening (EVT<sub>pri</sub>: 19.6% vs MM<sub>pri</sub>: 6.7%, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). In 414 subjects (76.7%) with target mismatch, EVT was associated with improved functional independence (EVT<sub>pri</sub>: 77.4% vs MM<sub>pri</sub>: 72.7%, aOR = 1.68, 95% CI = 1.01–2.81, <i>p</i> = 0.048), whereas there was a trend toward less favorable outcomes with primary EVT (EVT<sub>pri</sub>: 77.4% vs MM<sub>pri</sub>: 83.3%, aOR = 0.39, 95% CI = 0.12–1.34, <i>p</i> = 0.13) without target mismatch (<i>p</i>
<sub>interaction</sub> = 0.06). Similar findings were observed in a propensity score-matched subpopulation.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Overall, EVT was not associated with improved clinical outcomes in mild strokes due to LVO, and sICH was increased. However, in patients with target mismatch profile, EVT was associated with increased functional independence. Perfusion imaging may be helpful to select mild stroke patients for EVT.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Conflicting results have been reported on the association between lipids and risk of ischemic stroke. We tested the hypothesis that the burden of ischemic stroke attributable to either elevated apolipoprotein B (apoB) or non-high-density lipoprotein (non-HDL) cholesterol is higher than that attributable to elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We included 104,618 individuals from an ongoing cohort study, the Copenhagen General Population Study. The associations of quintiles of apoB, non-HDL cholesterol, and LDL cholesterol with risk of ischemic stroke were estimated by Cox proportional hazards regressions with 95% confidence intervals. With 1<sup>st</sup> quintile as reference, the proportion of ischemic stroke attributable to the 2<sup>nd</sup>, 3<sup>rd</sup>, 4<sup>th</sup>, and 5<sup>th</sup> quintiles of apoB, non-HDL cholesterol, and LDL cholesterol were estimated by population attributable fractions.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Higher quintiles of apoB and non-HDL cholesterol were associated with increased risk of ischemic stroke (both trends: <i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001), whereas for LDL cholesterol this association was somewhat attenuated (trend: <i>p</i> = 0.0005). A similar pattern was seen for population attributable fraction values. Compared to individuals in the 1<sup>st</sup> quintile, the combined proportion of ischemic stroke attributable to individuals in the 2<sup>nd</sup> to 5<sup>th</sup> quintiles was 16.3% for apoB (levels &gt;82 mg/dL), 14.7% for non-HDL cholesterol (&gt;3.0 mmol/L; &gt;117 mg/dL), and 6.8% for LDL cholesterol (&gt;2.4 mmol/L; &gt;94 mg/dL).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The proportion of ischemic stroke attributable to either elevated apoB or non-HDL cholesterol was double that attributable to elevated LDL cholesterol. ANN NEUROL 2022;92:379–389</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To investigate the causal role of lipid or apolipoprotein traits in intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and determine the effect of lipid-lowering interventions on the disease.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses were conducted to evaluate the associations of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), triglycerides (TG), apolipoprotein (Apo)B and ApoA1 levels with risks for ICH, and those of LDL-C- (<i>HMGCR</i>, <i>PCSK9</i>, and <i>NPC1L1</i>) and TG-lowering targets (<i>LPL</i> and <i>APOC3</i>) with ICH.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Increased levels of ApoB was associated with a decreased risk of overall ICH (OR 0.623, 95% CI 0.413–0.940; <i>p</i> = 0.024) and lobar ICH (OR 0.579, 95% CI 0.342–0.979; <i>p</i> = 0.042). The inverse relationship remained stable in multivariable MR. In addition, elevated TGs showed a causal effect on lobar ICH in multivariable MR (OR 1.600, 95% CI 1.009–2.537; <i>p</i> = 0.046). The LDL-C-reducing genetic variation alleles at or near the <i>HMGCR</i> gene (mimicking the effect of statins) were predicted to increase the overall and deep ICH risk. Additionally, genetic variation at or near the <i>APOC3</i> gene suggested that genetically reducing the activity of <i>APOC3</i> (mimicking antisense anti-apoC3 agents) was predicted to decrease lobar ICH.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Genetically predicted elevated ApoB may have a protective effect on overall ICH and lobar ICH, whereas elevated TG was associated with a higher risk of lobar ICH conditional on LDL-C and ApoB. MR analysis supports the conclusion that statins may increase the risk of overall and deep ICH independent of their lipid-lowering effect. More specific lipid-lowering targets may end up being the future. ANN NEUROL 2022;92:390–399</p>

                <p>Autosomal-dominant, Dutch-type cerebral amyloid angiopathy (D-CAA) offers a unique opportunity to develop biomarkers for pre-symptomatic cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). We hypothesized that neuroimaging measures of white matter injury would be present and progressive in D-CAA prior to hemorrhagic lesions or symptomatic hemorrhage.

                <h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>The amyloid/tau/neurodegeneration (AT[N]) framework has conceptualized the Alzheimer's disease (AD) continuum as a continuum of disease with evidence of amyloid-related pathologies independent of clinical manifestation. Based on this framework, it is necessary to reveal the distribution and risk factors of AD continuum in the cognitively intact population among different cohorts and races, including the northern Chinese Han population.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This study classified cognitively intact Chinese Alzheimer's Biomarker and LifestylE (CABLE) participants through the AT(N) scheme. Gaussian mixture models were used to identify the cutoff values of cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers, which distinguished AD continuum ( A + T−N−, A + T + N−, A + T−N + and A + T + N +) from 1,005 participants (mean age 61 years; 40% female). Multivariable logistic regressions and Cochran–Armitage trend tests were used to test neuropsychological performance and risk factors for AD continuum.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Approximately one-third of individuals (33.7%) belonged to the AD continuum. Four potential modifiable risk factors, including hypertension, thyroid diseases, social isolation, and minimal depression symptoms, were identified for the AD continuum (OR ranging 1.68–6.90). A trend toward higher prevalence of the AD continuum was associated with a larger number of risk factors (<i>p</i> for trend &lt;0.0001). The risk of AD continuum increased by approximately twofold for each additional modifiable risk factor (OR 1.9, 95% CI 1.65–2.24, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This study revealed the distribution and potential risk factors of the AD continuum in a cognitively intact Han population in northern China, which filled the gap in the area about the performance of the AT(N) framework in the Asian population. ANN NEUROL 2022;92:439–450</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">GGC Repeat Expansion of RILPL1 is Associated with Oculopharyngodistal Myopathy</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Oculopharyngodistal myopathy (OPDM) is an adult-onset neuromuscular disease characterized by progressive ptosis, dysarthria, ophthalmoplegia, and distal muscle weakness. Recent studies revealed that GGC repeat expansions in 5′-UTR of <i>LRP12</i>, <i>GIPC1</i>, and <i>NOTCH2NLC</i> are associated with OPDM. Despite these advances, approximately 30% of OPDM patients remain genetically undiagnosed. Herein, we aim to investigate the genetic basis for undiagnosed OPDM patients in two unrelated Chinese Han families.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Parametric linkage analysis was performed. Long-read sequencing followed by repeat-primed polymerase chain reaction and amplicon length polymerase chain reaction were used to determine the genetic cause. Targeted methylation sequencing was implemented to detect epigenetic changes. The possible pathogenesis mechanism was investigated by quantitative polymerase chain reaction, immunoblotting, RNA fluorescence <i>in situ</i> hybridization, and immunofluorescence staining of muscle biopsy samples.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The disease locus was mapped to 12q24.3. Subsequently, GGC repeat expansion in the promoter region of <i>RILPL1</i> was identified in six OPDM patients from two families, findings consistent with a founder effect, designated as OPDM type 4. Targeted methylation sequencing revealed hypermethylation at the <i>RILPL1</i> locus in unaffected individuals with ultralong expansion. Analysis of muscle samples showed no significant differences in <i>RILPL1</i> mRNA or RILPL1 protein levels between patients and controls. Public CAGE-seq data indicated that alternative transcription start sites exist upstream of the RefSeq-annotated <i>RILPL1</i> transcription start site. Strand-specific RNA-seq data revealed bidirectional transcription from the <i>RILPL1</i> locus. Finally, fluorescence <i>in situ</i> hybridization/immunofluorescence staining showed that both sense and antisense transcripts formed RNA foci, and were co-localized with hnRNPA2B1 and p62 in the intranuclear inclusions of OPDM type 4 patients.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our findings implicate abnormal GGC repeat expansions in the promoter region of <i>RILPL1</i> as a novel genetic cause for OPDM, and suggest a methylation mechanism and a potential RNA toxicity mechanism are involved in OPDM type 4 pathogenesis. ANN NEUROL 2022;92:512–526</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Primary age-related tauopathy (PART) refers to tau neurofibrillary tangles restricted largely to the medial temporal lobe in the absence of significant beta-amyloid plaques. PART has been associated with cognitive impairment, but contributions from concomitant limbic age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy neuropathologic change (LATE-NC) are underappreciated.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We compare prevalence of LATE-NC and vascular copathologies in age- and Braak-matched patients with PART (n = 45, Braak stage I–IV, Thal phase 0–2) or early stage Alzheimer disease neuropathologic change (ADNC; n = 51, Braak I–IV, Thal 3–5), and examine their influence on clinical and cognitive decline.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Concomitant LATE-NC and vascular pathology were equally common, and cognition was equally impaired, in PART (Mini-Mental State Examination [MMSE] = 24.8 ± 6.9) and ADNC (MMSE = 24.2 ± 6.0). Patients with LATE-NC were more impaired than those without LATE-NC on the MMSE (by 5.8 points, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 3.0–8.6), Mattis Dementia Rating Scale (DRS; 17.5 points, 95% CI = 7.1–27.9), Clinical Dementia Rating, sum of boxes scale (CDR-sob; 5.2 points, 95% CI = 2.1–8.2), memory composite (0.8 standard deviations [SD], 95% CI = 0.1–1.6), and language composite (1.1 SD, 95% CI = 0.2–2.0), and more likely to receive a dementia diagnosis (odds ratio = 4.8, 95% CI = 1.5–18.0). Those with vascular pathology performed worse than those without on the DRS (by 10.2 points, 95% CI = 0.1–20.3) and executive composite (1.3 SD, 95% CI = 0.3–2.3). Cognition declined similarly in PART and ADNC over the 5 years preceding death; however, LATE-NC was associated with more rapid decline on the MMSE (β = 1.9, 95% CI = 0.9–3.0), DRS (β = 7.8, 95% CI = 3.4–12.7), CDR-sob (β = 1.9, 95% CI = 0.4–3.7), language composite (β = 0.5 SD, 95% CI = 0.1–0.8), and vascular pathology with more rapid decline on the DRS (β = 5.2, 95% CI = 0.6–10.2).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>LATE-NC, and to a lesser extent vascular copathology, exacerbate cognitive impairment and decline in PART and early stage ADNC. ANN NEUROL 2022;92:425–438</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Rehabilitation top-down techniques based on brain stimulation present variable outcomes in unilateral spatial neglect (USN) after stroke. This study aimed to examine the effects of physical therapy after anodal and cathodal transcranial direct current stimulation (A-tDCS and C-tDCS, respectively) to improve visuospatial and functional impairments in individuals with USN after stroke.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This double-blinded, pilot randomized clinical trial enrolled patients with USN after ischemic stroke. Randomization was stratified according to the Behavior Inattention Test–Conventional (BIT-C) and Catherine Bergego Scale (CBS). Outpatient physical therapy was conducted for 7.5 weeks after 20 minutes of tDCS. The primary outcome was the USN degree evaluated by the BIT-C. Secondary outcomes were the difference in CBS score, stroke severity (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale [NIHSS]), disability (modified Rankin Scale), autonomy (Barthel Index, Functional Independence Measure), and quality of life (EuroQol Group 5-Dimension Self-Report Questionnaire). Outcomes were analyzed using an analysis of covariance model corrected by age, baseline NIHSS, and baseline BIT-C. Pairwise post hoc comparisons were performed using Bonferroni correction.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In the primary outcomes, A-tDCS led to greater improvement in BIT-C after intervention (mean difference [MD] = 18.4, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 3.9–32.8, <i>p</i> = 0.008) compared to sham. However, no significant differences were observed between A-tDCS and C-tDCS (MD = 13.9, 95% CI = −0.3 to 28.1, <i>p</i> = 0.057), or C-tDCS and sham (MD = 4.5, 95% CI = −9.7 to 18.8, <i>p</i> = 0.99). There were no significant differences between groups in terms of secondary outcomes.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>A-tDCS associated with physical therapy can decrease the severity of USN after stroke. However, these preliminary findings must be confirmed by collecting additional evidence in a larger phase 3 trial. ANN NEUROL 2022;92:400–410</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Longitudinal Retinal Changes in MOGAD</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Patients with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody (MOG-IgG)-associated disease (MOGAD) suffer from severe optic neuritis (ON) leading to retinal neuro-axonal loss, which can be quantified by optical coherence tomography (OCT). We assessed whether ON-independent retinal atrophy can be detected in MOGAD.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Eighty patients with MOGAD and 139 healthy controls (HCs) were included. OCT data was acquired with (1) Spectralis spectral domain OCT (MOGAD: <i>N</i> = 66 and HCs: <i>N</i> = 103) and (2) Cirrus high-definition OCT (MOGAD: <i>N</i> = 14 and HCs: <i>N</i> = 36). Macular combined ganglion cell and inner plexiform layer (GCIPL) and peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (pRNFL) were quantified.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>At baseline, GCIPL and pRNFL were lower in MOGAD eyes with a history of ON (MOGAD-ON) compared with MOGAD eyes without a history of ON (MOGAD-NON) and HCs (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). MOGAD-NON eyes had lower GCIPL volume compared to HCs (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) in the Spectralis, but not in the Cirrus cohort. Longitudinally (follow-up up to 3 years), MOGAD-ON with ON within the last 6–12 months before baseline exhibited greater pRNFL thinning than MOGAD-ON with an ON greater than 12 months ago (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). The overall MOGAD cohort did not exhibit faster GCIPL thinning compared with the HC cohort.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our study suggests the absence of attack-independent retinal damage in patients with MOGAD. Yet, ongoing neuroaxonal damage or edema resolution seems to occur for up to 12 months after ON, which is longer than what has been reported with other ON forms. These findings support that the pathomechanisms underlying optic nerve involvement and the evolution of OCT retinal changes after ON is distinct in patients with MOGAD.

                <p>In this one-year prospective study, Parkinson's disease (PD) patients with or without mania following STN-DBS were compared to investigate risk and etiological factors, clinical management and consequences. Eighteen (16.2%) out of 111 consecutive PD patients developed mania, of whom 17 were males. No preoperative risk factor was identified. Postoperative mania was related to ventral limbic subthalamic stimulation in 15 (83%) patients, and resolved as stimulation was relocated to the sensorimotor STN, besides discontinuation or reduction of dopamine agonists and use of low-dose clozapine in 12 patients, while motor and nonmotor outcomes were similar. These findings underpin the prominent role of limbic subthalamic stimulation in postoperative mania. ANN NEUROL 2022;92:411–417</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The purpose of this study was to evaluate if focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) co-localization to cortical functional networks is associated with the temporal distribution of epilepsy onset in FCD.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>International (20 center), retrospective cohort from the Multi-Centre Epilepsy Lesion Detection (MELD) project. Patients included if &gt;3 years old, had 3D pre-operative T1 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI; 1.5 or 3 T) with radiologic or histopathologic FCD after surgery. Images processed using the MELD protocol, masked with 3D regions-of-interest (ROI), and co-registered to fsaverage_sym (symmetric template). FCDs were then co-localized to 1 of 7 distributed functional cortical networks. Negative binomial regression evaluated effect of FCD size, network, histology, and sulcal depth on age of epilepsy onset. From this model, predictive age of epilepsy onset was calculated for each network.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Three hundred eighty-eight patients had median age seizure onset 5 years (interquartile range [IQR] = 3–11 years), median age at pre-operative scan 18 years (IQR = 11–28 years). FCDs co-localized to the following networks: limbic (90), default mode (87), somatomotor (65), front parietal control (52), ventral attention (32), dorsal attention (31), and visual (31). Larger lesions were associated with younger age of onset (<i>p</i> = 0.01); age of epilepsy onset was associated with dominant network (<i>p</i> = 0.04) but not sulcal depth or histology. Sensorimotor networks had youngest onset; the limbic network had oldest age of onset (<i>p</i> values &lt;0.05).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>FCD co-localization to distributed functional cortical networks is associated with age of epilepsy onset: sensory neural networks (somatomotor and visual) with earlier onset, and limbic latest onset. These variations may reflect developmental differences in synaptic/white matter maturation or network activation and may provide a biological basis for age-dependent epilepsy onset expression.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Intravenous Thrombolysis with Tenecteplase for the Treatment of Acute Ischemic Stroke</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) with tenecteplase has been associated with better clinical outcomes in acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients with confirmed large vessel occlusions compared to IVT with alteplase. However, the utility of tenecteplase for the treatment of all AIS patients eligible for IVT has not been established.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We compared the safety and efficacy of tenecteplase versus alteplase in AIS patients by analyzing propensity score matched data from 20 centers participating in the Safe Implementation of Treatments in Stroke–International Stroke Thrombolysis Register. Patients receiving IVT with tenecteplase were matched with up to 3 patients receiving alteplase from the same center. The primary outcome of interest was the distribution of 3-month functional outcomes. Secondary outcomes included the rates of patients with symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (SICH) in the first 24 hours, excellent (modified Rankin Scale [mRS] score = 0–1) or good (mRS score = 0–2) functional outcome, and all-cause mortality at 3 months.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 331 tenecteplase-treated AIS patients were matched to 797 patients treated with alteplase (median age = 70 years, 43.9% women, median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score = 11, interquartile range = 6–17). Patients treated with tenecteplase had better 3-month functional outcomes (common odds ratio [OR] = 1.54, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.18–2.00) with higher odds of good functional outcome (OR = 2.00, 95% CI = 1.45–2.77) and a lower likelihood of all-cause mortality (OR = 0.43, 95% CI = 0.27–0.67) at 3 months, compared to alteplase-treated patients. No difference was found in the likelihood of the 3-month excellent functional outcomes (OR = 1.31, 95% CI = 0.96–1.78) and 24-hour SICH (1.0% vs 1.3%, OR = 0.72, 95% CI = 0.20–2.64).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>IVT with tenecteplase was associated with better 3-month clinical outcomes compared to IVT with alteplase in AIS patients, with no increased risk of symptomatic intracranial bleeding. ANN NEUROL 2022;92:349–357</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>In Alzheimer disease (AD) animal models, synaptic dysfunction has recently been linked to a disorder of high-frequency neuronal activity. In patients, a clear relation between AD and oscillatory activity remains elusive. Here, we attempt to shed light on this relation by using a novel approach combining transcranial magnetic stimulation and electroencephalography (TMS-EEG) to probe oscillatory activity in specific hubs of the frontoparietal network in a sample of 60 mild-to-moderate AD patients.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Sixty mild-to-moderate AD patients and 21 age-matched healthy volunteers (HVs) underwent 3 TMS-EEG sessions to assess cortical oscillations over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, the precuneus, and the left posterior parietal cortex. To investigate the relations between oscillatory activity, cortical plasticity, and cognitive decline, AD patients underwent a TMS-based neurophysiological characterization and a cognitive evaluation at baseline. The latter was repeated after 24 weeks to monitor clinical evolution.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>AD patients showed a significant reduction of frontal gamma activity as compared to age-matched HVs. In addition, AD patients with a more prominent decrease of frontal gamma activity showed a stronger impairment of long-term potentiation–like plasticity and a more pronounced cognitive decline at subsequent follow-up evaluation at 24 weeks.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our data provide novel evidence that frontal lobe gamma activity is dampened in AD patients. The current results point to the TMS-EEG approach as a promising technique to measure individual frontal gamma activity in patients with AD. This index could represent a useful biomarker to predict disease progression and to evaluate response to novel pharmacological therapies. ANN NEUROL 2022;92:464–475</p>

                <h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>Neuropathological studies have shown that multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions are heterogeneous in terms of myelin/axon damage and repair as well as iron content. However, it remains a challenge to identify specific chronic lesion types, especially remyelinated lesions, in vivo in patients with MS.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We performed 3 studies: (1) a cross-sectional study in a prospective cohort of 115 patients with MS and 76 healthy controls, who underwent 3 T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM), myelin water fraction (MWF), and neurite density index (NDI) maps. White matter (WM) lesions in QSM were classified into 5 QSM lesion types (iso-intense, hypo-intense, hyperintense, lesions with hypo-intense rims, and lesions with paramagnetic rim legions [PRLs]); (2) a longitudinal study of 40 patients with MS to study the evolution of lesions over 2 years; (3) a postmortem histopathology-QSM validation study in 3 brains of patients with MS to assess the accuracy of QSM classification to identify neuropathological lesion types in 63 WM lesions.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>At baseline, hypo- and isointense lesions showed higher mean MWF and NDI values compared to other QSM lesion types (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001). Further, at 2-year follow-up, hypo-/iso-intense lesions showed an increase in MWF. Postmortem analyses revealed that QSM highly accurately identifies (1) fully remyelinated areas as hypo-/iso-intense (sensitivity = 88.89% and specificity = 100%), (2) chronic inactive lesions as hyperintense (sensitivity = 71.43% and specificity = 92.00%), and (3) chronic active/smoldering lesions as PRLs (sensitivity = 92.86% and specificity = 86.36%).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>These results provide the first evidence that it is possible to distinguish chronic MS lesions in a clinical setting, hereby supporting with new biomarkers to develop and assess remyelinating treatments. ANN NEUROL 2022;92:486–502</p>

                <p>A total of 15 individuals with cervical dystonia and good outcome after pallidal deep brain stimulation underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging under three conditions: stimulation using a priori clinically determined optimal settings (ON-Op), non-optimal settings (ON-NOp), and stimulation off (OFF). ON-Op &gt; OFF and ON-Op &gt; ON-NOp were both associated with significant deactivation within sensorimotor cortex (changes not seen with ON-NOp &gt; OFF). Brain responses to stimulation were related to individual long-term clinical improvement (<i>R</i> = 0.73, <i>R</i>
<sup>2</sup> = 0.53, <i>p</i> = 0.001). The relationship was consistent when this model included four additional patients with generalized or truncal dystonia.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">An Overview of Monkeypox Virus and Its Neuroinvasive Potential</a></h4>

              
                <p>Monkeypox virus (MPV) is an orthopox virus in the <i>Poxviridae</i> family that is currently of international concern. It is endemic to Central and Western Africa with two known viral clades. Various African rodents and primates are likely the natural reservoirs. Zoonotic transmission occurs by direct contact with infected animals (e.g., bites, scratches, slaughtering). Human to human transmission occurs through close contact with infected persons (e.g., respiratory droplets, skin-on-skin, or sexual contact) or fomites. Classically, human MPV disease first has a febrile prodrome with lymphadenopathy followed by a diffuse maculopapular to vesiculopustular skin/mucosal lesion eruption. In the current 2022 outbreak, which is primarily affecting men who have sex with men (MSM) currently, the febrile prodrome may be absent and skin/mucosal lesions may be isolated to the genital and anal regions. Rarely, MPV likely has the potential to be neuroinvasive based on animal models, previous case series, and preliminary reports currently under investigation. Even though neurologic manifestations of human MPV infection are rare, given the sheer numbers of increasing cases throughout the world, neurologists should be prepared to recognize, diagnose, and treat potential neuroinvasive disease or other neurologic symptoms.

                Background: A pharmacometrics (PMx) workflow usually requires several software tools to cover all the steps from data analysis to model evaluation and simulations. However, these tools do not always communicate well together, compromising the efficiency of the whole process. Highly inspired by the markdown/pandoc system, we developed Peccary, an R package and its dedicated Shiny Application with the objective to accelerate the use of previously released R packages through various translation and metaprogramming processes.  Methods: Peccary was developed with an agile method, progressively aggregating snippets of R code produced during real-life pharmacometrics works.  Its first subpackage, PeccAnalysis, can be used to produce and evaluate various R code for population description (using table1 package), plot exploration (ggplot) and non-compartment analysis (pknca). The second subpackage, PeccaReverse, allows writing a structural model using a minimalist (simplified deSolve) syntax, before metaprogramming model simulations (using either deSolve or RxODE) and design evaluation (through PopED), along with performing various model syntax translations (e.g., into NONMEM, Monolix or nlmixr files). Finally, the third subpackage, PeccaResult, standardizes run outputs of several PMx software (NONMEM, Monolix, Adapt, nlmixr) to perform various diagnostic evaluation tasks.  Results: The metaprogramming system used in PeccAnalysis and PeccaReverse has many advantages. First, it simplifies the use of previously mentioned packages (by reducing the required knowledge and the time needed to program the output creation). Second, it creates links between independent tools (for instance using the same inputs for several tasks). Third, the produced R code can be reviewed for eventual manual modification, verification (quality control) or traceable report integration.  Conclusion: Overall, Peccary was successful in improving PMx efficiency by providing a Shiny R platform that can produce various outputs during live meetings while keeping the possibility to extract Peccary-independent R source code for further in-depth control.

                Background: Betel habit is a hereditary tradition from the ancestors of the Batak-Karo tribe, Indonesia. Karo people believe that betel habit is their unifier. The betel process begins with concocting a mixture of ingredients such as betel leaf, lime, gambier, areca nut, and with/ without tobacco addition, then chewed slowly. Our previous study showed that gambier extracts (Uncaria gambier Roxb), can reduce blood glucose levels(BGL) in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM)patients. This study aimed to analyze whether the habit of chewing betel can affect BGL in the Karo ethnic community in the Karo district. Methods: In total, 48 participants from the Karo community were divided into 4 groups (n=12 per group), namely: I. non-T2DM participants without betel habits; II. non-T2DM participants with betel habit; III. T2DM participants without betel habit and IV. T2DM participants with betel habit. The sampling technique was consecutive sampling. Data were collected by interviews and blood sampling (fasting and 2 hours postprandial (2hPP)). The collected data analyzed by paired t-test, Independent sample t-test, Wilcoxon, and Mann-Whitney with a significance level of p-value <0.05. Results: This study showed that fasting BGL condition in group-I compared to group II (84.33±12.32 vs 81.00±4.84) mg/dl and group-III compared to group-IV (196.25±104.81 vs 150.00±42.45) mg/dl had no significant difference. Also, the BGL of 2hPP condition in group-I compared to group-II (111.25 ±22.62 vs 108.33±18.99) mg/dl, and group-III compared to group-IV (314.92±128.97 vs 229.25±58.26) mg/dl, in statistically there was no difference (p>0.05). Although the data showed that group-III was higher than group-IV. Conclusions: This study concludes that with/without betel habits affect blood sugar levels in type 2 diabetes subjects (Groups III and IV).

                Up to 25% of patients with long COVID experience persistent night sweats. However, in most cases they remain untreated until they disappear on their own. Since SARS-CoV-2 is known to disrupt glucose homeostasis, we hypothesized that impaired mitochondria would result in faster glycogen depletion at night due to reduced ATP production yield, inducing adrenaline production ultimately leading to the onset of persistent night sweats. To test our hypothesis we investigated whether incorporating carbohydrates into the diet of three non-diabetic patients with long COVID before bedtime would have any effect decreasing their night sweats. Remarkably, after one week with the dietary intervention, the patients reported that their night sweats had completely disappeared. Therefore, we propose carbohydrate supplementation as an affordable solution for night sweats in long COVID patients.

                Background: Tuberculosis (TB) and diabetes mellitus (DM) co-morbidity is one of the rising public health problems. There is growing evidence that DM is an important risk factor for TB. This study was carried out to know the prevalence of DM among newly detected sputum positive pulmonary TB patients registered in District Tuberculosis Centre and to assess the risk factors of DM among TB patients. Methods: In a cross-sectional study, newly detected sputum positive pulmonary TB patients were screened for DM (those having symptoms of DM). Furthermore, they were diagnosed by detecting blood glucose levels (≥200 mg/dL). Mean, standard deviation (SD), Chi-squared and Fisher-Freeman-Halton exact tests were used to determine the significant associations. P-values less than 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant. Results: A total of 215 TB patients were included in this study. The prevalence of DM among TB patients was found to be 23.7% (2.8% known and 97.8% new cases). Significant associations were found between age (>46 years old), educational status, smoking habits, alcohol consumption, physical activity, presence of DM symptoms and family history of DM. Conclusions: Routine screening for DM is mandatory due to its increasing prevalence, which may help in early diagnosis and to reduce complications by proper management that in turn helps in the successful outcome of TB treatment.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">How mission-driven policies challenge traditional research funding systems [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                For decades, public research funding systems have operated with the dual objectives of fostering research excellence on the one side and research contributing to innovation and growth on the other. These two objectives have to a large extent been pursued and institutionalized separately. Recently, a third objective has become increasingly prominent: to orient public research towards societal challenges through missions. This paper stresses that a precondition for achieving this new objective is successful coordination across the whole value chain of research and a more integrated and holistic approach to the design and implementation of funding policies. So far, limited attention has been paid to the risk that such coordination may be in conflict with dominant rationales underlying the current design of funding systems. In this study, we examine the challenges associated with the institutionalization of this emerging objective from both a theoretical and an empirical perspective. The theoretical analysis builds on historical institutionalism and argues that a partial conversion of the funding system as a whole is necessary for the new rationale to succeed. The empirical analysis focuses on two different national settings, the Danish and the Norwegian, and highlights challenges and tensions experienced by funding bodies responsible for operationalizing mission-driven research funding instruments, based on interviews with experts and key funding actors. We conclude that the key institutions in both national systems are attempting to adjust to the increasing political focus on missions through layering rather than processes of conversion, which we argue is necessary for funding organizations to successfully implement mission-driven policies. Finally, implications for the success of mission-driven policies are discussed.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Hippocampal dentate gyrus integrity revealed with ultrahigh resolution diffusion imaging predicts memory performance in older adults</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Medial temporal lobe (MTL) atrophy is a core feature of age-related cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease (AD). While regional volumes and thickness are often used as a proxy for neurodegeneration, they lack the sensitivity to serve as an accurate diagnostic test and indicate advanced neurodegeneration. Here, we used a submillimeter resolution diffusion weighted MRI sequence (ZOOMit) to quantify microstructural properties of hippocampal subfields in older adults (63–98 years old) using tensor derived measures: fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD). We demonstrate that the high-resolution sequence, and not a standard resolution sequence, identifies dissociable profiles for CA1, dentate gyrus (DG), and the collateral sulcus. Using ZOOMit, we show that advanced age is associated with increased MD of the CA1 and DG as well as decreased FA of the DG. Increased MD of the DG, reflecting decreased cellular density, mediated the relationship between age and word list recall. Further, increased MD in the DG, but not DG volume, was linked to worse spatial pattern separation. Our results demonstrate that ultrahigh-resolution diffusion imaging enables the detection of microstructural differences in hippocampal subfield integrity and will lead to novel insights into the mechanisms of age-related memory loss.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">The fibro‐ and cyto‐architecture demarcating the border between the dentate gyrus and CA3 in sheep (Ovis aries) and domestic pig (Sus scrofa domesticus)</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The hippocampal formation is essential for spatial navigation and episodic memory. The anatomical structure is largely similar across mammalian species, apart from the deep polymorphic layer of the dentate gyrus and the adjacent part of cornu ammonis 3 (CA3) which feature substantial variations. In rodents, the polymorphic layer has a triangular cross-section abutting on the end of the CA3 pyramidal layer, while in primates it is long and band-shaped capping the expanded CA3 end, which here lacks a distinct pyramidal layer. This structural variation has resulted in a confusing nomenclature and unclear anatomical criteria for the definition of the dentate-ammonic border. Seeking to clarify the border, we present here a light microscopic investigation based on Golgi-impregnated and Timm–thionin-stained sections of the Artiodactyla sheep and domestic pig, in which the dentate gyrus and CA3 end have some topographical features in common with primates. In short, the band-shaped polymorphic layer coincides with the Timm-positive mossy fiber collateral plexus and the Timm-negative subgranular zone. While the soma and excrescence-covered proximal dendrites of the mossy cells are localized within the plexus, the peripheral mossy cell dendrites extend outside the plexus, both into the granular and molecular layers, and the CA3. The main mossy fibers leave the collateral plexus in a scattered formation to converge gradually through the CA3 end in between the dispersed pyramidal cells, which are of three subtypes, as in monkey, with the classical apical subtype dominating near the hidden blade, the nonapical subtype near the exposed blade, and the dentate subtype being the only pyramidal cells that extend dendrites into the dentate gyrus. In agreement with our previous study in mink, the findings show that the border between the dentate gyrus and the CA3 end can be more accurately localized by the mossy fiber system than by cyto-architecture alone.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Learning shifts the preferred theta phase of gamma oscillations in CA1</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Hippocampal neuronal oscillations reflect different cognitive processes and can therefore be used to dissect the role of hippocampal subfields in learning and memory. In particular, it has been suggested that encoding and retrieval is associated with slow gamma (25–55 Hz) and fast gamma (60–100 Hz) oscillations, respectively, which appear in a nested manner at specific phases of the ongoing theta oscillations (4–12 Hz). However, the relationship between memory demand and the theta phase of gamma oscillations remains unclear. Here, we assessed the theta phase preference of gamma oscillations in the CA1 region, at the starting and junction zones of a T-maze, while rats were learning an appetitive task. We found that the theta phase preference of slow gamma showed a ~180° phase shift when animals switched from novice to skilled performance during task acquisition. This phase-shift was not present at the junction zone, where animals chose a right or left turn within the T-maze, suggesting that a recall/decision process had already taken place at the starting zone. Our findings indicate that slow gamma oscillations support both encoding and retrieval, depending on the theta phase at which they occur. These properties are particularly evident prior to cognitive engagement in an acquired spatial task.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Assessing mild cognitive impairment using object‐location memory in immersive virtual environments</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Pathological changes in the medial temporal lobe (MTL) are found in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and aging. The earliest pathological accumulation of tau colocalizes with the areas of the MTL involved in object processing as part of a wider anterolateral network. Here, we sought to assess the diagnostic potential of memory for object locations in iVR environments in individuals at high risk of AD dementia (amnestic mild cognitive impairment [aMCI] <i>n</i> = 23) as compared to age-related cognitive decline. Consistent with our primary hypothesis that early AD would be associated with impaired object location, aMCI patients exhibited impaired spatial feature binding. Compared to both older (<i>n</i> = 24) and younger (<i>n</i> = 53) controls, aMCI patients, recalled object locations with significantly less accuracy (<i>p</i> &lt; .001), with a trend toward an impaired identification of the object's correct context (<i>p</i> = .05). Importantly, these findings were not explained by deficits in object recognition (<i>p</i> = .6). These deficits differentiated aMCI from controls with greater accuracy (AUC = 0.89) than the standard neuropsychological tests. Within the aMCI group, 16 had CSF biomarkers indicative of their likely AD status (MCI+ <i>n</i> = 9 vs. MCI− <i>n</i> = 7). MCI+ showed lower accuracy in the object-context association than MCI− (<i>p</i> = .03) suggesting a selective deficit in object-context binding postulated to be associated with anterior-temporal areas. MRI volumetric analysis across healthy older participants and aMCI revealed that test performance positively correlates with lateral entorhinal cortex volumes (<i>p</i> &lt; .05) and hippocampus volumes (<i>p</i> &lt; .01), consistent with their hypothesized role in binding contextual and spatial information with object identity. Our results indicate that tests relying on the anterolateral object processing stream, and in particular requiring successful binding of an object with spatial information, may aid detection of pre-dementia AD due to the underlying early spread of tau pathology.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Prefrontal and hippocampal theta rhythm show anxiolytic‐like changes during periaqueductal‐elicited “panic” in rats</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Anxiety and panic are both elicited by threat and co-occur clinically. But, at the neural level, anxiety appears to inhibit the generation of panic; and vice versa. Anxiety and panic are thought to engage more anterior (a) and mid-posterior (m) parts of the periaqueductal gray (PAG), respectively. Anxiety also engages the hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex. Here, we tested if mPAG but not aPAG stimulation would suppress prefrontal and hippocampal theta rhythm as do anxiolytic drugs. Twelve male rats with implanted electrodes were stimulated alternately (30 s interval) in the left PAG or right reticular formation (reticularis pontis oralis [RPO]—as a positive control) with recording in the left prelimbic cortex and left and right hippocampus. PAG stimulation was set to produce freezing and RPO to produce 7–8 Hz theta rhythm before tests lasting 10 min on each of 5 days. mPAG stimulation decreased, and aPAG increased, theta power at all sites during elicited freezing. mPAG, but not aPAG, stimulation decreased prefrontal theta frequency. Stimulation did not substantially change circuit dynamics (pairwise phase consistency and partial directed coherence). Together with previous reports, our data suggest that panic- and anxiety-control systems are mutually inhibitory, and neural separation of anxiety and panic extends down to the aPAG and mPAG, respectively. Our findings are consistent with recent proposals that fear and anxiety are controlled by parallel neural hierarchies extending from PAG to the prefrontal cortex.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Parenchymal hemorrhage rate is associated with time to reperfusion and outcome</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Despite a 90% reperfusion rate, only 50% of patients with anterior circulation large vessel occlusion-related acute ischemic stroke (LVO-AIS) have a functional recovery at three months. Parenchymal hematoma (PH) is a predictor of poor outcome after endovascular treatment (EVT). We aim to investigate the relationship between the delay from onset to reperfusion, the occurrence of PH, and functional outcome.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>The Endovascular Treatment in Ischemic Stroke (ETIS) registry is an ongoing prospective observational study. Data were analyzed from the subgroup of patients who underwent a successful EVT defined by a modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction (mTICI) score 2b-3 . We assessed the factors associated with PH, (ie PH1 or PH2 grade according to the European Collaborative Acute Stroke Study 2 (ECASS) classification of hemorrhagic transformation), then evaluated the relationships between PH, delay from onset to reperfusion, and functional recovery defined by a modified Rankin Scale (mRS) of 0-2.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We analyzed 2919 patients with an LVO-related AIS who underwent a successful EVT. Overall, 13.3% of the participant experienced a PH. The rate of PH increased by 2.5% (95%CI 1.5%-3.6%, P&lt;0.001) for every additional hour of onset to reperfusion delay and was, by comparison with the other study patients, consistently associated with a lower rate of functional recovery 19.7% (95%CI 11.6%-27.7%, P&lt;0.001) irrespective of time from onset to reperfusion.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our results demonstrate that PH rate is associated with the delay from onset to reperfusion and participates in the relationship between time to reperfusion and outcome. Time is Bleeding.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/inpress.rss">Glycine-bound NMDA receptors are stretch-activated</a></h4>

              
                In a recent study, Belin et al. demonstrated that glycine-bound NMDA receptors can be activated by mechanical forces in the absence of the neurotransmitter glutamate. The stretch-gated receptor exhibits biophysical properties similar to those of glutamate-gated receptors. These findings reveal that glycine-bound NMDA receptors could behave as mechanosensors in central nervous system (CNS) physiology.

                This review by Zeinelden et al. discusses the origin of neuroblastoma from the developing sympathoadrenal lineage. The authors argue that neuroblastoma is a disease of arrested differentiation and describe how tumor cell heterogeneity reflects underlying developmental mechanisms.
