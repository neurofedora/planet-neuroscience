              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13638">State Space Models Naturally Produce Traveling Waves, Time Cells, and Scale to Abstract Cognitive Functions</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2507.13638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A grand challenge in modern neuroscience is to bridge the gap between the detailed mapping of microscale neural circuits and a mechanistic understanding of cognitive functions. While extensive knowledge exists about neuronal connectivity and biophysics, a significant gap remains in how these elements combine to produce flexible, learned behaviors. Here, we propose that a framework based on State-Space Models (SSMs), an emerging class of deep learning architectures, can bridge this gap. We argue that the differential equations governing elements in an SSM are conceptually consistent with the biophysical dynamics of neurons, while the combined dynamics in the model lead to emergent behaviors observed in experimental neuroscience. We test this framework by training an S5 model--a specific SSM variant employing a diagonal state transition matrix--on temporal discrimination tasks with reinforcement learning (RL). We demonstrate that the model spontaneously develops neural representations that strikingly mimic biological 'time cells'. We reveal that these cells emerge from a simple generative principle: learned rotational dynamics of hidden state vectors in the complex plane. This single mechanism unifies the emergence of time cells, ramping activity, and oscillations/traveling waves observed in numerous experiments. Furthermore, we show that this rotational dynamics generalizes beyond interval discriminative tasks to abstract event-counting tasks that were considered foundational for performing complex cognitive tasks. Our findings position SSMs as a compelling framework that connects single-neuron dynamics to cognitive phenomena, offering a unifying and computationally tractable theoretical ground for temporal learning in the brain.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13941">Convergent transformations of visual representation in brains and models</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2507.13941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fundamental question in cognitive neuroscience is what shapes visual perception: the external world's structure or the brain's internal architecture. Although some perceptual variability can be traced to individual differences, brain responses to naturalistic stimuli evoke similar activity patterns across individuals, suggesting a convergent representational principle. Here, we test if this stimulus-driven convergence follows a common trajectory across people and deep neural networks (DNNs) during its transformation from sensory to high-level internal representations. We introduce a unified framework that traces representational flow by combining inter-subject similarity with alignment to model hierarchies. Applying this framework to three independent fMRI datasets of visual scene perception, we reveal a cortex-wide network, conserved across individuals, organized into two pathways: a medial-ventral stream for scene structure and a lateral-dorsal stream tuned for social and biological content. This functional organization is captured by the hierarchies of vision DNNs but not language models, reinforcing the specificity of the visual-to-semantic transformation. These findings show a convergent computational solution for visual encoding in both human and artificial vision, driven by the structure of the external world.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13501">Encoding syntactic objects and Merge operations in function spaces</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2507.13501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a mathematical argument showing that, given a representation of lexical items as functions (wavelets, for instance) in some function space, it is possible to construct a faithful representation of arbitrary syntactic objects in the same function space. This space can be endowed with a commutative non-associative semiring structure built using the second Renyi entropy. The resulting representation of syntactic objects is compatible with the magma structure. The resulting set of functions is an algebra over an operad, where the operations in the operad model circuits that transform the input wave forms into a combined output that encodes the syntactic structure. The action of Merge on workspaces is faithfully implemented as action on these circuits, through a coproduct and a Hopf algebra Markov chain. The results obtained here provide a constructive argument showing the theoretical possibility of a neurocomputational realization of the core computational structure of syntax. We also present a particular case of this general construction where this type of realization of Merge is implemented as a cross frequency phase synchronization on sinusoidal waves. This also shows that Merge can be expressed in terms of the successor function of a semiring, thus clarifying the well known observation of its similarities with the successor function of arithmetic.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14056">Noradrenergic-inspired gain modulation attenuates the stability gap in joint training</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2507.14056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies in continual learning have identified a transient drop in performance on mastered tasks when assimilating new ones, known as the stability gap. Such dynamics contradict the objectives of continual learning, revealing a lack of robustness in mitigating forgetting, and notably, persisting even under an ideal joint-loss regime. Examining this gap within this idealized joint training context is critical to isolate it from other sources of forgetting. We argue that it reflects an imbalance between rapid adaptation and robust retention at task boundaries, underscoring the need to investigate mechanisms that reconcile plasticity and stability within continual learning frameworks. Biological brains navigate a similar dilemma by operating concurrently on multiple timescales, leveraging neuromodulatory signals to modulate synaptic plasticity. However, artificial networks lack native multitimescale dynamics, and although optimizers like momentum-SGD and Adam introduce implicit timescale regularization, they still exhibit stability gaps. Inspired by locus coeruleus mediated noradrenergic bursts, which transiently enhance neuronal gain under uncertainty to facilitate sensory assimilation, we propose uncertainty-modulated gain dynamics - an adaptive mechanism that approximates a two-timescale optimizer and dynamically balances integration of knowledge with minimal interference on previously consolidated information. We evaluate our mechanism on domain-incremental and class-incremental variants of the MNIST and CIFAR benchmarks under joint training, demonstrating that uncertainty-modulated gain dynamics effectively attenuate the stability gap. Finally, our analysis elucidates how gain modulation replicates noradrenergic functions in cortical circuits, offering mechanistic insights into reducing stability gaps and enhance performance in continual learning tasks.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13485">Neural Architecture Search with Mixed Bio-inspired Learning Rules</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2507.13485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bio-inspired neural networks are attractive for their adversarial robustness, energy frugality, and closer alignment with cortical physiology, yet they often lag behind back-propagation (BP) based models in accuracy and ability to scale. We show that allowing the use of different bio-inspired learning rules in different layers, discovered automatically by a tailored neural-architecture-search (NAS) procedure, bridges this gap. Starting from standard NAS baselines, we enlarge the search space to include bio-inspired learning rules and use NAS to find the best architecture and learning rule to use in each layer. We show that neural networks that use different bio-inspired learning rules for different layers have better accuracy than those that use a single rule across all the layers. The resulting NN that uses a mix of bio-inspired learning rules sets new records for bio-inspired models: 95.16% on CIFAR-10, 76.48% on CIFAR-100, 43.42% on ImageNet16-120, and 60.51% top-1 on ImageNet. In some regimes, they even surpass comparable BP-based networks while retaining their robustness advantages. Our results suggest that layer-wise diversity in learning rules allows better scalability and accuracy, and motivates further research on mixing multiple bio-inspired learning rules in the same network.

                arXiv:2507.13549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the development of high-performance racing controllers for a newly implemented racing mode within the Xpilot-AI platform, utilizing the Neuro Evolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) algorithm. By leveraging NEAT's capability to evolve both the structure and weights of neural networks, we develop adaptive controllers that can navigate complex circuits under the challenging space simulation physics of Xpilot-AI, which includes elements such as inertia, friction, and gravity. The racing mode we introduce supports flexible circuit designs and allows for the evaluation of multiple agents in parallel, enabling efficient controller optimization across generations. Experimental results demonstrate that our evolved controllers achieve up to 32% improvement in lap time compared to the controller's initial performance and develop effective racing strategies, such as optimal cornering and speed modulation, comparable to human-like techniques. This work illustrates NEAT's effectiveness in producing robust control strategies within demanding game environments and highlights Xpilot-AI's potential as a rigorous testbed for competitive AI controller evolution.

                arXiv:2507.13785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While biological neural networks develop from compact genomes using relatively simple rules, modern artificial neural architecture search methods mostly involve explicit and routine manual work. In this paper, we introduce MorphoNAS (Morphogenetic Neural Architecture Search), a system able to deterministically grow neural networks through morphogenetic self-organization inspired by the Free Energy Principle, reaction-diffusion systems, and gene regulatory networks. In MorphoNAS, simple genomes encode just morphogens dynamics and threshold-based rules of cellular development. Nevertheless, this leads to self-organization of a single progenitor cell into complex neural networks, while the entire process is built on local chemical interactions. Our evolutionary experiments focused on two different domains: structural targeting, in which MorphoNAS system was able to find fully successful genomes able to generate predefined random graph configurations (8-31 nodes); and functional performance on the CartPole control task achieving low complexity 6-7 neuron solutions when target network size minimization evolutionary pressure was applied. The evolutionary process successfully balanced between quality of of the final solutions and neural architecture search effectiveness. Overall, our findings suggest that the proposed MorphoNAS method is able to grow complex specific neural architectures, using simple developmental rules, which suggests a feasible biological route to adaptive and efficient neural architecture search.

Abstract: This article proposes a method to formalise models of cognitive processes grounded in experience, considering experience from the perspective of a living system and not from that of an observer of the living system. The perspective of a living system is defined by the need of the system to preserve the vital equilibria. The method is based on an algorithmic schema that we call Environment Generative Operator (EGO) and uses a self-referential language developed for this purpose which we call E-language. EGO simulates cognitive processes as operations on neuron assemblies as understood by Hebb. In this article we present an EGO prototype (EGO-P) which has already been implemented and tested.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13539">SCOPE for Hexapod Gait Generation</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2507.13539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Evolutionary methods have previously been shown to be an effective learning method for walking gaits on hexapod robots. However, the ability of these algorithms to evolve an effective policy rapidly degrades as the input space becomes more complex. This degradation is due to the exponential growth of the solution space, resulting from an increasing parameter count to handle a more complex input. In order to address this challenge, we introduce Sparse Cosine Optimized Policy Evolution (SCOPE). SCOPE utilizes the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) to learn directly from the feature coefficients of an input matrix. By truncating the coefficient matrix returned by the DCT, we can reduce the dimensionality of an input while retaining the highest energy features of the original input. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method by using SCOPE to learn the gait of a hexapod robot. The hexapod controller is given a matrix input containing time-series information of previous poses, which are then transformed to gait parameters by an evolved policy. In this task, the addition of SCOPE to a reference algorithm achieves a 20% increase in efficacy. SCOPE achieves this result by reducing the total input size of the time-series pose data from 2700 to 54, a 98% decrease. Additionally, SCOPE is capable of compressing an input to any output shape, provided that each output dimension is no greater than the corresponding input dimension. This paper demonstrates that SCOPE is capable of significantly compressing the size of an input to an evolved controller, resulting in a statistically significant gain in efficacy.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13659">When Person Re-Identification Meets Event Camera: A Benchmark Dataset and An Attribute-guided Re-Identification Framework</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2507.13659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent researchers have proposed using event cameras for person re-identification (ReID) due to their promising performance and better balance in terms of privacy protection, event camera-based person ReID has attracted significant attention. Currently, mainstream event-based person ReID algorithms primarily focus on fusing visible light and event stream, as well as preserving privacy. Although significant progress has been made, these methods are typically trained and evaluated on small-scale or simulated event camera datasets, making it difficult to assess their real identification performance and generalization ability. To address the issue of data scarcity, this paper introduces a large-scale RGB-event based person ReID dataset, called EvReID. The dataset contains 118,988 image pairs and covers 1200 pedestrian identities, with data collected across multiple seasons, scenes, and lighting conditions. We also evaluate 15 state-of-the-art person ReID algorithms, laying a solid foundation for future research in terms of both data and benchmarking. Based on our newly constructed dataset, this paper further proposes a pedestrian attribute-guided contrastive learning framework to enhance feature learning for person re-identification, termed TriPro-ReID. This framework not only effectively explores the visual features from both RGB frames and event streams, but also fully utilizes pedestrian attributes as mid-level semantic features. Extensive experiments on the EvReID dataset and MARS datasets fully validated the effectiveness of our proposed RGB-Event person ReID framework. The benchmark dataset and source code will be released on https://github.com/Event-AHU/Neuromorphic_ReID

                arXiv:2507.14069v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The convergence of artificial intelligence and edge computing has spurred growing interest in enabling intelligent services directly on resource-constrained devices. While traditional deep learning models require significant computational resources and centralized data management, the resulting latency, bandwidth consumption, and privacy concerns have exposed critical limitations in cloud-centric paradigms. Brain-inspired computing, particularly Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), offers a promising alternative by emulating biological neuronal dynamics to achieve low-power, event-driven computation. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of Edge Intelligence based on SNNs (EdgeSNNs), examining their potential to address the challenges of on-device learning, inference, and security in edge scenarios. We present a systematic taxonomy of EdgeSNN foundations, encompassing neuron models, learning algorithms, and supporting hardware platforms. Three representative practical considerations of EdgeSNN are discussed in depth: on-device inference using lightweight SNN models, resource-aware training and updating under non-stationary data conditions, and secure and privacy-preserving issues. Furthermore, we highlight the limitations of evaluating EdgeSNNs on conventional hardware and introduce a dual-track benchmarking strategy to support fair comparisons and hardware-aware optimization. Through this study, we aim to bridge the gap between brain-inspired learning and practical edge deployment, offering insights into current advancements, open challenges, and future research directions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first dedicated and comprehensive survey on EdgeSNNs, providing an essential reference for researchers and practitioners working at the intersection of neuromorphic computing and edge intelligence.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Social status, as a prominent social characteristic, exerts a significant influence on various aspects of life. However, there is only limited behavioral and neural evidence regarding the relationship between social status and the construction of trust. In this study, we used computational modeling and functional magnetic resonance imaging to unveil the trajectory of trust-related processing by using a repeated trust game. Human participants assumed the role of trustor and engaged in interactions with fictitious partners (trustees) who varied in social status. Participants were more inclined to trust Superiors than Inferiors and gradually modified their trust decisions based on their partners’ reciprocity. Furthermore, we unveiled the neurocomputational mechanisms of two cognitive processes: (i) prior-based static modulation supported by the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), amygdala, and their neural coupling, and (ii) the reward network engaged in feedback-based dynamic modulation. We also found that prior bias in the social value of social status can reduce the reliance on the feedback-based dynamic modulation rooted in the vmPFC and ventral striatum. The present findings enhance the understanding of the neural representations of how social status modulates trust-related processing and trustworthiness updating.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Social learning, a critical mechanism for human adaptation to complex societal environments, hinges not only on learners’ cognitive and emotional processes but also on modes and contexts of social interaction. However, the exact mechanisms by which these factors impact social learning, and how gender differences modulate this process, remain unclear. This study employed a dual-player version of the Iowa Gambling Task, where participants alternated selecting decks under cooperative or competitive conditions. Neural signals from the right prefrontal cortex and right temporoparietal junction were captured using functional near-infrared spectroscopy equipment. Results indicated more safe decks but less frequent switching between decks in the cooperative than the competitive context. Participants reported more positive learning experiences in cooperation condition. We found higher intra-brain activation during observation than during direct reaction. Additionally, as an observer, the loss of a competitor triggered greater activation. Stage changes were observed in intra-brain activation and inter-brain synchronization (IBS), revealing gender differences in the stage effect on activation, and opposite effects on time-aligned and time-lagged IBS. Furthermore, gender-specific trends emerged, with males exhibiting higher IBS in competition and females showing higher IBS in cooperation. This study reveals dynamic neuroadaptive reconfigurations in cross-brain connectivity throughout the learning trajectory.</span>

">Maturation of Dorsal Association Tracts during Preadolescence Links to Concurrent and Future Cognitive Performance and Transdiagnostic Psychopathology</a></h4>

              
                Many psychiatric disorders begin during adolescence, coinciding with the rapid development of brain white matter (WM). However, it remains unclear whether deviations from normal WM maturation during this age period contribute to the development of psychopathology. In this study, we developed and validated normative models of brain age based on specific WM tracts using three large-scale developmental datasets (a total of ~10,000 subjects). We found that tract-specific deviations in WM development of association and limbic/subcortical systems were linked to concurrent cognition and psychopathology. The spatial pattern of the association system aligned closely with distributions of high-order brain networks, and with mitochondrial content and respiratory capacity. The maturation of the association system contributed significantly to better cognitive performance assessed two or three years later. Importantly, delayed WM development especially in dorsal association tracts predicted psychiatric disorders across diagnoses and disorder onset over a 2-year follow-up. By identifying tract-specific WM development during preadolescence as a predictor of cognitive capacity and psychiatric disorder risks, this study provides a valuable framework for tracking individualized brain maturation and understanding the neurobiological underpinnings of cognitive performance and transdiagnostic psychopathology.

">Deformed Probability Estimation in Goal-Directed reinforcement learning model explains anxious-depression dimensions of psychiatric disorders</a></h4>

              
                Psychiatric disorders are complex, multi-dimensional pathologies rooted in diverse cognitive processes. Computational psychiatry aims to reveal distortions in these processes through behavior modeling, providing a deeper understanding of psychiatric disorders. Previous studies, using Daws two-stage task, had linked the imbalance between habitual/model-free and goal-directed/model-based behaviors to disorders with compulsive behaviors and intrusive thoughts. The model-based component relies on the estimation of environmental probabilities. Therefore, we added a well-known deformation in subjective probability estimation to the model and this improved the model fitting. More importantly, the fitted deformation explains some variance of the anxious-depression dimension of psychiatric symptoms. The deformation parameter is aligned with the description-experience gap in decision-making literature. Our results point to subjective possibly distortion as the probable underlying cognitive process of anxiety, apathy, and depression. This study also shows that the inclusion of cognitive biases in modeling can extract the hidden aspects of behavior possibility linked to disorders. Our approach enhances the precision of computational psychiatry and provides deeper insights into the cognitive processes underlying psychiatric symptoms, paving the way for more effective, personalized therapeutic strategies.

">Barcoded Rabies In Situ Connectomics for high-throughput reconstruction of neural circuits</a></h4>

              
                Sequencing of oligonucleotide barcodes holds promise as a high-throughput approach for reconstructing synaptic connectivity at scale. Rabies viruses can act as a vehicle for barcode transmission, thanks to their ability to spread between synaptically connected cells. However, applying barcoded rabies viruses to map synaptic connections in vivo has proved challenging. Here, we develop Barcoded Rabies In Situ Connectomics (BRISC) for high-throughput connectivity mapping in the mouse brain. To ensure that the majority of post-synaptic "starter" neurons are uniquely labeled with distinct barcode sequences, we first generated libraries of rabies viruses with sufficient diversity to label >1000 neurons uniquely. To minimize the probability of barcode transmission between starter neurons, we developed a strategy to tightly control their density. We then applied BRISC to map inputs of single neurons in the primary visual cortex (V1). Using in situ sequencing, we read out the expression of viral barcodes in rabies-infected neurons, while preserving spatial information. We then matched barcode sequences between starter and presynaptic neurons, mapping the inputs of 385 neurons and identifying 7,814 putative synaptic connections. The resulting connectivity matrix revealed layer- and cell-type-specific local connectivity rules and topographic organization of long-range inputs to V1. These results show that BRISC can simultaneously resolve the synaptic connectivity of hundreds of neurons while preserving spatial information, enabling reconstruction of neural circuits at an unprecedented scale.

">A positive feedback loop between sensory and octopaminergic neurons underlies nociceptive plasticity in Drosophila larvae</a></h4>

              
                Adaptive modulation of nociceptive behaviour based on prior experience is essential for responding effectively to environmental threats. In Drosophila larvae, nociceptive escape behaviours are robust and stereotyped, yet emerging evidence suggests this can be modulated by experience and internal state. Here, we demonstrate that repeated activation of nociceptive sensory neurons enhances both the likelihood and intensity of nocifensive rolling, reflecting a form of behavioural sensitization. This heightened responsiveness is accompanied by a sustained increase in activity within nociceptive sensory neurons, suggesting that plasticity arises, at least in part, within the sensory compartment. We identified the neuromodulator octopamine as a critical regulator of the sensitization: signalling through the octopamine receptor OAMB is required to sustain elevated nociceptive gain, and feedback from one of octopaminergic neurons class, the ventral unpaired median (VUM) neurons, amplifies sensory neuron output. Together, these findings reveal an experience-dependent positive feedback loop in the nociceptive system, where neuromodulatory circuits tune behavioural output.

">Synaptic and intrinsic membrane defects disrupt early neural network dynamics in Down syndrome</a></h4>

              
                Down syndrome, caused by trisomy 21, affects around six million people worldwide and features learning, memory and language deficits. However, the mechanisms underlying trisomy 21 neurophenotypes involving human cortical circuitry are unknown. By characterising developing neural network dynamics and single cell excitability profiles, with synaptic and voltage-dependent ion channel behaviour, using an isogenic induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neuronal model, we show that trisomy 21 impairs the activity and development of cortical circuitry. This is caused by deficient glutamatergic synaptic connectivity and by aberrant intrinsic membrane properties involving K+ and Na+ channels culminating in spike firing defects that weaken neural network activity and disrupt the synchrony of developing neurons. We also identify transiently activated A-type K+ channels, specifically Kv4.3 channels, as a key orchestrator for Down syndrome during neurodevelopment. Overall, these excitability changes will significantly contribute towards the aberrant neurophenotypes observed later on in life.

">Concerted remodelling of the postsynaptic spine and RNA granule by cLTP</a></h4>

              
                Synaptic plasticity is the cellular foundation of learning and memory and, for these plastic changes to be stabilised into long-term memory, proteins must be synthesised at the synapse1,2. RNA granules ensure that specific mRNAs are delivered and translated at the right time and place3,4, but the signalling mechanisms linking synaptic activation to local translation are still largely unknown. Here, to investigate how postsynaptic signals modulate the RNA granule, we employed a spatially-restricted biotinylation approach to quantify protein accessibility and proximity in the postsynaptic and RNA granule subproteomes. Upon chemical long-term potentiation (cLTP), we observed a sharp increase in the accessibility of ribosomes, translation factors and RNA binding proteins belonging to the RNA granule. Similarly, strong alterations were observed in proteins of the postsynaptic density, but mostly in those involved in signalling. Specific proximity to DBN1 and IGF2BP1 as postsynaptic and RNA granule reporters unveiled a shift of the translation machinery towards the postsynaptic compartment, whereas specific translation initiation factors and RNA helicases displayed marked changes in their proximity to DBN1 and/or IGF2BP1. Finally, alteration of synapse development and signalling by DBN1 downregulation caused a highly significant decrease in the proximity of RNA granule proteins to IGF2BP1 after synaptic stimulation, establishing a causal link between postsynaptic events and RNA granule dynamics.

">Inhibition of the Microglial Phagocytic Receptor MerTK Underlies ELA-induced Changes in Synapses and Behavior in Male Mice</a></h4>

              
                Background: Early-life adversity (ELA) is a significant risk factor for emotional disorders like depression, likely by provoking changes in stress-related circuit development. We have previously shown that ELA increases the number of excitatory synapses onto corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH)-expressing neurons in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) by decreasing microglial synapse engulfment. Here, we hypothesize that ELA induces microglial dysfunction via inhibition of the microglial phagocytic receptor, MerTK, thus resulting in the observed changes in synapses and stress-related behavior. Methods: To determine whether deleting MerTK in microglia phenocopies the effects of ELA, microglia-specific (m)MerTK-KO (CX3CR1-Cre+::MerTKfl/fl) mice were crossed with "wild-type" (CX3CR1-Cre-::MerTKfl/fl) mice and their litters were reared in either a control or ELA (induced by limited bedding and nesting paradigm) environment, from postnatal days (P)2-10. Excitatory synapses in the PVN were assessed at P10, and adult offspring were tested in a behavioral battery to measure threat-response (known to be dependent on PVN-CRH+neurons) and anxiety-like behavior, followed by acute restraint stress to measure the neuroendocrine stress response. Results: Following ELA at P10, excitatory, but not inhibitory, synapses in the PVN were increased in males, which was mimicked by mMerTK-KO in control males, but caused no further increase in ELA males. However, females already had higher numbers of excitatory synapses at baseline, and showed no further increase with ELA or mMerTK-KO. Remarkably, the pattern of threat-response behavior in males closely matched the excitatory synapses, with mMerTK-KO control males escaping more from the simulated predator threat in the looming-shadow threat task, similar to ELA males. Again, females did not show any significant changes due to ELA or mMerTK-KO in the threat-response, although they did show ELA-induced changes in anxiety-like behavior. ELA provoked a greater corticosterone response to acute stress in males, but not females, although females were again higher at baseline. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that ELA provokes increased excitatory synapses in the PVN, leading to an increased active response to threat in the looming-shadow test in males only. Deleting MerTK specifically from microglia recapitulates both the synaptic and behavioral effects in control males, but does not have an effect in ELA males or control females, suggesting that the MerTK pathway is already inhibited by ELA in males and less active in females at baseline. Our work is the first to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the male-biased microglial dysfunction caused by ELA, with promise for the development of better preventative and therapeutic strategies for at-risk children.

">A C. elegans model of familial Alzheimer's disease shows age-dependent synaptic degeneration independent of amyloid β-peptide</a></h4>

              
                The membrane-embedded {gamma}-secretase complex is involved in the intramembrane cleavage of ~ 150 substrates. Cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP)-derived substrate C99 generates 38-43-residue secreted amyloid {beta}-peptides (A{beta}), with the aggregation-prone 42-residue form (A{beta}42) particularly implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). However, whether A{beta}42 is the primary driver of neurodegeneration in AD remains unclear. Dominant mutations in APP or presenilin--the catalytic component of {gamma}-secretase--cause early-onset familial AD (FAD) and reduce one or more steps in the multi-step processive proteolysis of C99 to A{beta} peptides, apparently through stabilization of {gamma}-secretase enzyme-substrate (E-S) complexes. To investigate mechanisms of neurodegeneration in FAD, we developed new C. elegans models co-expressing wild-type or FAD-mutant C99 substrate and presenilin-1 (PSEN1) variants in neurons, allowing intramembrane processing of C99 to A{beta} in vivo. We demonstrate that while FAD-mutation of either C99 or PSEN1 leads to age-dependent synaptic loss, proteolytically inactive PSEN1 did not. Designed mutations that allow stable E-S complex formation without A{beta}42 or A{beta} production likewise result in synaptic degeneration. Moreover, replacement of C99 with variants of a Notch1-based substrate revealed that disrupted processing of another {gamma}-secretase substrate can similarly lead to synaptic degeneration. These results support a model in which synaptic loss can be triggered by toxic, stalled {gamma}-secretase E-S complexes in the absence of A{beta} production and not by simple loss of proteolytic function. This new C. elegans system provides a powerful platform to study the role of dysfunctional {gamma}-secretase substrate processing in FAD pathogenesis.

">Selective life-long suppression of an odor processing channel in response to critical period experience</a></h4>

              
                Sensory circuits undergo experience-dependent plasticity during early-life critical periods, attuning the nervous system to levels of key environmental stimuli. During a critical period in the Drosophila olfactory system, we found that exposure to ethyl butyrate (EB) induces glial phagocytosis of odorant receptor Or42a-positive olfactory sensory neuron (OSN) axon terminals which terminate in the VM7 glomerulus (Leier and Foden et al., 2025). Here, we extend these findings by establishing functional significance and circuit selectivity in this critical period paradigm. First, using a combination of two-photon Ca2+ imaging and the genetically-encoded voltage indicator ASAP5, we find that Or42a OSN odor-evoked responses are permanently suppressed in animals with critical period odor exposure. Thus, critical period odor exposure results in long-term changes to odor sensitivity in Or42a OSNs. Second, to establish the selectivity of glial pruning for Or42a axon terminals, we examined projection neurons (PNs) postsynaptic to Or42a OSNs as well as a second population of highly EB-responsive OSNs, called Or43b OSNs. We find that (1) within VM7, glial pruning is selective for Or42a terminals, and (2) while Or43b OSNs appear modestly pruned, they maintain their sensitivity to EB. To elucidate this difference, we turned to the Drosophila connectome. We identify striking differences in the scale of inhibitory connectivity to Or42a and Or43b OSNs, suggesting that Or42a OSNs may play a particularly central role in EB odor processing. This study expands our understanding of this critical period plasticity paradigm by demonstrating life-long suppression of pruned Or42a OSNs and establishing its specificity within and between sensory circuits.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>While previous studies have found rhythms in gene expression in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), the contribution of different cell types and potential variation by sex has not been determined. Of interest are excitatory pyramidal cells and inhibitory parvalbumin (PV) interneurons, as the interaction between these cells is thought to underlie gamma oscillations and play a role in schizophrenia. We identify cell-type-specific rhythms in ribosome-associated transcripts from PV and pyramidal cells in the mouse PFC and assess rhythms in PV cell electrophysiology. We find that while core molecular clock genes are synchronized between cell types, pyramidal cells have nearly twice as many rhythmic transcripts as PV cells (35% vs. 18%). Moreover, in contrast to PV cells, rhythmic transcripts in pyramidal cells show substantial overlap between sexes. Additionally, there is a sex-specific reduction in action potential amplitude and spike frequency adaptation during the dark phase in PV cells from females. This study demonstrates that rhythms in gene expression and electrophysiological properties in the PFC vary by cell type and by sex. Moreover, the biological processes associated with rhythmic transcripts may provide insight into the unique functions of rhythms in these cells, as well as their selective vulnerabilities to circadian disruption.</span>

">Phosphorylation and DNA Damage Resolution Coordinate SOX2-Mediated Reprogramming in vivo</a></h4>

              
                The stem cell factor SOX2 can reprogram resident glial cells into neurons in the adult mammalian central nervous system (CNS), but the molecular mechanisms underlying this process remain poorly understood. Here, we show that both SOX2 phosphorylation and the PRKDC-dependent non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway are essential for SOX2-mediated in vivo glia-to-neuron reprogramming. A phospho-mimetic SOX2 mutant significantly enhances reprogramming efficiency without altering neuronal fate. Conversely, loss of PRKDC or knockdown of core NHEJ components KU80 and LIG4 abolishes reprogramming. Notably, p53 knockdown restores reprogramming in PRKDC-deficient mice. These findings demonstrate that SOX2-driven glial reprogramming requires both precise posttranslational regulation and effective DNA damage repair, and suggest that targeting these pathways could enhance regenerative strategies in the CNS.

">Simulated Language Acquisition in a Biologically Realistic Model of the Brain</a></h4>

              
                Despite tremendous progress in neuroscience, we do not have a compelling narrative for the precise way whereby the spiking of neurons in our brain results in high-level cognitive phenomena such as planning and language. We introduce a simple mathematical formulation of six basic and broadly accepted principles of neuroscience: excitatory neurons, brain areas, random synapses, Hebbian plasticity, local inhibition, and inter-area inhibition. We implement a simulated neuromorphic system based on this formalism, which is capable of basic language acquisition: Starting from a tabula rasa, the system learns, in any language, the semantics of words, their syntactic role (verb versus noun), and the word order of the language, including the ability to generate novel sentences, through the exposure to a modest number of grounded sentences in the same language. We discuss several possible extensions and implications of this result.

">A novel cost-benefit decision-making task involving cued punishment; effects of sex and psychostimulant administration</a></h4>

              
                Chronic substance use is associated with alterations in multiple forms of cost-benefit decision making, which may prolong and exacerbate continued use. Cues that predict reward can cause substantial shifts in a variety of reward-directed behavior, including decision making. In contrast, how decision making is modulated by cues predictive of punishment is much less well understood. To begin to address these issues, male and female Long-Evans rats were tested in a novel decision-making task in which they chose between a small, safe reward and a large reward that was punished by a mild footshock when it was preceded by a probabilistically delivered cue prior to the choice. Rats of both sexes were sensitive to the cue, preferring the large reward in the absence of the cue but the small reward in the presence of the cue. Acute systemic amphetamine reduced choice of the large reward and diminished the efficacy of the cue in guiding choice behavior. Chronic cocaine led to divergent patterns of cue insensitivity in males and females; males increased choice of the large reward on cued trials, whereas females increased avoidance of the large reward on uncued trials. Similar to acute amphetamine, acute systemic administration of the D2/3 dopamine receptor agonist bromocriptine reduced preference for the large reward across all groups. These findings highlight the contributions of punishment cues to decision making, as well as the importance of sex as a biological variable in investigating cognitive alterations caused by chronic substance use.

">MEG3 Enhances Survival of Developing Human Neurons with CLCN4-Linked Autophagy Impairment</a></h4>

              
                Genetic variations in CLCN4, encoding the H+/Cl- exchanger CLC-4, are associated with human neurodevelopmental disorders with highly variable phenotypes. A lack of physiologically relevant models has hampered molecular understanding of pathogenic mechanisms. We now establish engineered brain organoid and neuronal cell systems to examine impacts of patient-relevant CLCN4 genetic variations. We find that CLCN4 variants reduced excitatory neuron numbers due to early-stage cell death, accompanied by altered endo-lysosomal dynamics and disrupted autophagic flux. Transcriptomic profiling showed significant downregulation of long non-coding RNA MEG3 in CLCN4-variant neurons. Restoring MEG3 expression is sufficient to rescue cellular defects and improve survival of CLCN4-variant neurons. These findings link CLCN4 dysfunction with impaired autophagy and neuronal cell death, highlighting MEG3 as a potential therapeutic target for neurodevelopmental disorders involving autophagic dysfunction.

">Distinct Synaptic Mechanisms Drive NRXN1 Variant-Mediated Pathogenesis in iPSC-Derived Neuronal Models of Autism and Schizophrenia</a></h4>

              
                Copy number deletions in the 2p16.3/NRXN1 locus confer genome wide risk for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and schizophrenia (SCZ). Prior work demonstrated that heterozygous NRXN1 deletions decreases synaptic strength and neurotransmitter release probability in human-iPSC derived cortical glutamatergic induced neurons and this synaptic phenotype is replicated in SCZ patient iPSCs with varying NRXN1 genomic deletions. What is unknown, however, is whether similar synaptic impairment exists in ASD patients carrying NRXN1 deletions. Answering this question is important to determine whether all NRXN1 deletion carriers should be treated similarly or individually, based on their genetic backgrounds and deletion breakpoints. Here, using previously uncharacterized ASD patient iPSC lines, we show that ASD-NRXN1 deletions impact cortical synaptic function and plasticity in unique ways compared to SCZ-NRXN1 deletions. Specifically, at a single neuronal level, ASD-NRXN1 deletions alter basal spontaneous synaptic transmission by selectively enhancing excitatory synaptic signaling with no changes at inhibitory synapses while SCZ-NRXN1 deletions reduce both excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission. At the neuronal network level, there exists enhanced transmission probability and irregular firing patterns in ASD-NRXN1 deletions. Such changes at the synaptic and network level connectivity patterns influence a critical form of developmental cortical plasticity, synaptic scaling, as ASD-NRXN1 deletions uniquely fail to upscale their synaptic strength in response to chronic neuronal silencing. Together, these findings highlight the disorder-specific consequences of NRXN1 deletions on synaptic function and connectivity, offering mechanistic insights with implications for therapeutic targeting and refinement strategies for NRXN1-associated synaptopathies.

">Dynamical independence reveals anaesthetic specific fragmentation of emergent structure in neural dynamics</a></h4>

              
                Conscious experience depends on the coordinated activity of neural processes that span multiple scales--from synapses to whole-brain dynamics. A recently introduced measure, dynamical independence, identifies, characterises and quantifies these multi-scale relationships using an information-theoretic dimensionality-reduction approach. Here, we use DI to examine changes in emergent dynamical structure in the human brain under three pharmacologically-distinct anaesthetic interventions (propofol, xenon, ketamine). Applied to source-reconstructed EEG, our analysis reveals that propofol and xenon, anaesthetics that abolish conscious report, exhibit more emergent but highly variable dynamic structure, indicating fragmented macroscopic dynamical organisation. By contrast, ketamine, which preserves dream-like phenomenology, shows the opposite pattern: reduced overall emergence yet a partial preservation of the macroscopic structure, mirroring wake. Further exploratory analyses revealed spatially localised source-level contributions to emergent dynamical structure, highlighting regional variations. Together, our results highlight drug-specific reconfigurations of emergent dynamical structure under anaesthesia, dissociate the amount of emergence from the organisation of emergent dynamics, and caution against equating emergence with level of consciousness.

">Neural signatures of engagement and event segmentation during story listening in background noise</a></h4>

              
                Speech in everyday life is often masked by background noise, making comprehension effortful. Characterizing brain activity patterns when individuals listen to masked speech can help clarify the mechanisms underlying such effort. However, most previous research has focused on neural activity related to short, disconnected sentences that little resemble the more continuous, story-like spoken speech individuals typically encounter. In the current study, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in humans (both sexes) to investigate how neural signatures of story listening change in the presence of masking by 12-talker babble noise. We show that, as speech masking increases, spatial and temporal activation patterns in auditory regions become more idiosyncratic to each listener. In contrast, spatial (and to some extent temporal) activity patterns in brain networks linked to effort (e.g. cinguloopercular network involving the anterior insula and anterior cingulate) are more similar across listeners when speech is highly masked and less intelligible, suggesting shared neural processes. Moreover, at times during stories when one meaningful event ended and another began, neural activation increased over extensive regions in frontal, parietal, and medial cortices. This event-boundary response appeared little affected by background noise, suggesting that listeners process meaningful units and, in turn, the gist in naturalistic, continuous speech even when it is masked somewhat by background noise. Overall, the current data may indicate that people stay engaged and cognitive processes associated with naturalistic speech processing remain intact under moderate levels of background noise, whereas auditory processing becomes more idiosyncratic to each listener.

">Hierarchical Neural Circuit Theory of Normalization and Inter-areal Communication</a></h4>

              
                The primate brain exhibits a hierarchical, modular architecture with conserved microcircuits executing canonical computations across reciprocally connected cortical areas. Though feedback connections are ubiquitous, their functions remain largely unknown. To investigate the role of feedback, we present a hierarchical neural circuit theory with feedback connections that dynamically implements divisive normalization across its hierarchy. In a two-stage instantiation (V1 - V2), increasing feedback from V2 to V1 amplifies responses in both areas, more so in the higher cortical area, consistent with experiments. We analytically derive power spectra (V1) and coherence spectra (V1-V2), and validate them against experimental observations: peaks in both spectra shift to higher frequencies with increased stimulus contrast, and power decays as 1/f4 at high frequencies (f). The theory further predicts distinctive spectral signatures of feedback and input gain modulation. Crucially, the theory offers a unified view of inter-areal communication, with emergent features commensurate with empirical observations of both communication subspaces and inter-areal coherence. It admits a low-dimensional communication subspace, where inter-areal communication is lower-dimensional than within-area communication, and frequency bands characterized by high inter-areal coherence. It further predicts that: i) increasing feedback strength enhances inter-areal communication and diminishes within-area communication, without altering the subspace dimensionality; ii) high-coherence frequencies are characterized by stronger communication (ability to estimate neural activity in one brain area from neural activity in another brain area) and reduced subspace dimensionality. Finally, a three-area (V1 - V4 and V1 - V5) instantiation of the theory demonstrates that differential feedback from higher to lower cortical areas dictates their dynamic functional connectivity. Altogether, our theory provides a robust and analytically tractable framework for generating experimentally-testable predictions about normalization, inter-areal communication, and functional connectivity.

Natural selection occurs at multiple levels of organization in cancer. At an organismal level, natural selection has led to the evolution of diverse tumor suppression mechanisms, while at a cellular level, it favors traits that promote cellular proliferation, survival and cancer. Natural selection also occurs at a subcellular level, among collections of cells and even among collections of organisms; selection at these levels could influence the evolution of cancer and cancer suppression mechanisms, affecting cancer risk and treatment strategies. There may also be cancer-like processes happening at different levels of organization, in which uncontrolled proliferation at lower levels may disrupt a higher level of organization. This Essay examines how selection operates across levels, highlighting how we might leverage this understanding to improve cancer research, prevention and treatment.

                Jain et al. profiled 41 classical psychedelics across 318 GPCRs, revealing activity at serotonin, dopamine, and adrenergic receptors. All compounds activated multiple 5-HT2AR signal transduction pathways which are linked to their in vivo effects. These findings demonstrate the polypharmacology underlying psychedelic actions and their engagement with diverse molecular signaling pathways.

                Martínez et al. identify a set of ccRCC tumors with high levels of intron retention (IR) and poison exon (PE) inclusion, producing transcripts normally targeted by the NMD pathway. These tumors have altered mTOR signaling, are associated with poor prognosis, and have unique signatures of immune cell infiltration.

                Potiri et al. uncover how the splicing factor SRRM3 drives tumor progression in pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PanNETs) via neural microexon inclusion. Aberrant splicing disrupts insulin secretion and calcium signaling, revealing a novel link between neuroendocrine dysfunction and cancer. Therapeutic redirection using splice-switching ASOs can effectively impair tumor growth in preclinical models.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100574">Effective population size does not explain long-term variation in genome size and transposable element content in animals</a></h4>

              
                Animal genomes exhibit a remarkable variation in size, but the evolutionary forces responsible for such variation are still debated. As the effective population size (Ne<sub>e</sub>) reflects the intensity of genetic drift, it is expected to be a key determinant of the fixation rate of nearly-neutral mutations. Accordingly, the Mutational Hazard Hypothesis postulates lineages with low Ne<sub>e</sub> to have bigger genome sizes due to the accumulation of slightly deleterious transposable elements (TEs), and those with high Ne<sub>e</sub> to maintain streamlined genomes as a consequence of a more effective selection against TEs. However, the existence of both empirical confirmation and refutation using different methods and different scales precludes its general validation. Using high-quality public data, we estimated genome size, TE content, and rate of non-synonymous to synonymous substitutions (dN/dS) as Ne<sub>e</sub> proxy for 807 species including vertebrates, molluscs, and insects. After collecting available life-history traits, we tested the associations among population size proxies, TE content, and genome size, while accounting for phylogenetic non-independence. Our results confirm TEs as major drivers of genome size variation, and endorse life-history traits and dN/dS as reliable proxies for Ne<sub>e</sub>. However, we do not find any evidence for increased drift to result in an accumulation of TEs across animals. Within more closely related clades, only a few isolated and weak associations emerge in fishes and birds. Our results outline a scenario where TE dynamics vary according to lineage-specific patterns, lending no support for genetic drift as the predominant force driving long-term genome size evolution in animals.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93200">Mediodorsal thalamic nucleus mediates resistance to ethanol through Cav3.1 T-type Ca2+ regulation of neural activity</a></h4>

              
                Thalamocortical activity is known to orchestrate sensory gating and consciousness switching. The precise thalamic regions involved, or the firing patterns related to the unconsciousness, remain unclear. Interestingly, the highly -expressed thalamic T-type calcium currents have been considered as a candidate for the ionic mechanism for the generation of thalamocortically driven change in conscious state. Here, we tested the hypothesis that Ca<sub>v</sub>3.1 T-type channels in the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus (MD) might control neuronal firing during unconsciousness using Ca<sub>v</sub>3.1 T-type channel knockout (KO) and knockdown (KD) mice under natural sleep and ethanol-induced unconsciousness. During natural sleep, the MD neurons in KO mice showed general characteristics of sustained firing across sleep stages. We found that KO and MD-specific KD mice showed enhanced resistance to ethanol. During the ethanol-induced unconscious state, wild-type (WT) MD neurons showed a significant reduction in neuronal firing from baseline with increased burst firing, whereas Ca<sub>v</sub>3.1 KO neurons showed well-sustained neural firing, within the level of wakefulness, and no burst firing. Further, 20 Hz optogenetic and electrical activation of MD neurons mimicked the ethanol resistance behavior in WT mice. These results suggest that maintaining MD neural firing at a wakeful level is sufficient to induce resistance to ethanol-induced hypnosis in WT mice. This work has important implications for the design of treatments for consciousness disorders using thalamic stimulation of deeper nuclei, including the targeting of the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus.

">Cortex-wide laminar dynamics diverge during learning</a></h4>

              
                Learning to link sensory information to motor actions involves dynamic coordination across cortical layers and regions. However, the involvement of a particular layer in learning, especially from a cortex-wide perspective, is relatively unknown. Using wide-field calcium imaging in mice as they learn a whisker-based go/no-go task, we tracked activity in layers 2/3 or 5 (L2/3 or L5) across 25 cortical areas. A surprising initial effect of learning was that activity in L5 but not in L2/3 was globally suppressed at auditory cue onset. As the texture comes into touch, we found that L2/3 displayed learning-related enhancements in higher order association areas rostrolateral (RL) and secondary somatosensory (S2), whereas L5 in these areas oppositely decreased. During texture touch, the barrel cortex (BC) displayed similar learning-related enhancement in both layers. As sensory information is transformed into a motor action, there was a frontal/posterior divergence that emerges after learning, in which L5 was enhanced in the frontal cortex and L2/3 was suppressed in the posterior cortex. In general, learning related correlations were often stronger between distant cortical layers than within the same column, suggesting that learning drives laminar interactions that transcend traditional columnar organization. Together, these results reveal that learning orchestrates a dynamic interplay of activity across space, time and cortical layers. Our findings emphasize the critical role of laminar architecture in shaping cortical plasticity and support the view that layer-specific circuits are fundamental to sensorimotor learning.

">Multiple Routes to Metacognitive Judgments of Working Memory in the Macaque Prefrontal Cortex</a></h4>

              
                The ability to evaluate one' s own memory is known as metamemory. Whether metamemory is inherent to memory strength or requires additional computation in the brain remains largely unknown. We investigated the metacognitive mechanism of working memory (WM) using two-photon calcium imaging in the prefrontal cortex of macaque monkeys, who were trained to memorize spatial sequences of varying difficulties. In some trials, after viewing the sequence, monkeys could opt out of retrieval for a smaller reward, reflecting their confidence in WM (meta-WM). We discovered that PFC neurons encoded WM strength by jointly representing the remembered locations through population coding and their associated uncertainties. This WM strength faithfully predicted the monkeys' recall performance and opt-out decisions. In addition to memory strength, other factors--trial history and arousal--encoded in baseline activity predicted opt-out decisions, serving as cues for meta-WM. We identified a code of meta-WM itself that integrated WM strength and these cues. Importantly, WM strength, cues, and meta-WM were represented in different subspaces within the same PFC population. The dynamics and geometry of PFC activity implement metacognitive computations, integrating WM strength with cues into a meta-WM signal that guides behavior.

">Optogenetic inhibition reveals distinct contributions of medial prefrontal cortex to intertemporal choice in young and aged rats</a></h4>

              
                The ability to choose adaptively between rewards differing in magnitude and delay (intertemporal choice) is critical for numerous life outcomes. Compared to younger adults, older adults tend to exhibit greater preference for large, delayed over small, immediate rewards (i.e., less delay discounting), which could lead to missed opportunities to obtain resources necessary for quality of life. Intertemporal choice is mediated by the prefrontal cortex, but how this is impacted by advanced age is not well understood. We used optogenetic inactivation to investigate contributions of medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) during distinct components of an intertemporal choice task in young and aged rats. mPFC inactivation during deliberation (during decisions between small, immediate vs. large, delayed rewards) increased preference for large, delayed rewards in both age groups. In contrast, inactivation during delays prior to large reward delivery increased preference for large, delayed rewards only in aged rats. Choices were unaffected by inactivation during other task phases. Results suggest that mPFC integrates information regarding anticipated outcomes into the decision process across the whole lifespan, but that only in aging is mPFC critical for consolidating information regarding reward delays into the decision structure in order to modulate choice behavior.

">Impaired Spatiotemporal Encoding of Social Behavior and Anxiety in the Prefrontal Cortex of Mice Lacking ASD-Risk Gene Shank3.</a></h4>

              
                The prefrontal cortex is a central regulator of complex behaviors, including social interaction and anxiety-related behaviors. The prefrontal cortex encodes these behaviors using heterogeneous groups of neurons, or ensembles, which collectively process inputs and communicate with distributed brain regions. We examined whether loss of the Autism-risk gene Shank3 alters the recruitment of neurons encoding socioemotional behavior collectively, or if abnormal activity during specific behaviors might affect functionally or anatomically defined populations of neurons. To do this, we combined spatially-resolved microendoscopic calcium imaging across the prefrontal microcircuit with functionally defined labeling of neurons as control and mutant mice engaged in social interaction or anxiety-provoking behaviors. We then utilized a non-biased transcriptomic method to identify neurons activated by social interactions. We show that the recruitment of heterogeneous neuronal populations are altered in a cell type and spatially dependent manner by loss of Shank3, with impaired recruitment of behavior-specific activity patterns within superficial, but not deeper aspects of the prefrontal cortex.

">Benchmarking the Impact of Anatomical Segmentation on In Vivo Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy</a></h4>

              
                Purpose: Estimation of metabolite concentrations in brain magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) requires correction for differences in tissue water content, relaxation properties, and the proportions of gray matter (GM), white matter (WM), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Accurate knowledge of the relative proportions of these tissue classes within the volume of interest is therefore essential for reliable quantification. Commonly used brain segmentation tools differ in their algorithms, priors, and implementation, potentially introducing variability in MRS-derived concentration estimates. This study investigates the impact of segmentation software on estimated absolute concentrations. Methods: Three segmentation software tools, ANTs, FSL, and SPM, were evaluated. Segmentations were applied to an in vivo test-retest MR dataset to assess (1) differences in estimated tissue fractions, and (2) how these differences propagate into tissue-corrected metabolite concentrations. As an additional validity check and biological benchmark of segmentation performance, age-related associations with GM and total creatine (tCr) were examined. Results: Significant differences (p < 0.0001) were observed in tissue fraction estimates between segmentation tools, leading to differences in metabolite concentration estimates of up to 9% under identical acquisition and modeling conditions. Although the strength of the correlation varied between segmentation methods, no statistically significant differences were found. Conclusion: The choice of segmentation methodology contributed substantially to variability in MRS 'absolute' metabolite concentration estimates. These results underscore the need for transparent segmentation reporting to ensure reproducibility and cross-study comparability in MRS research. Quantifying the segmentation-driven variability allows researchers to contextualize cross-study differences, helping determine whether observed effects are methodological or biologically meaningful.

">AAV delivery of RNA editing machinery rescues SUDEP and seizure phenotype in a mouse model of Dravet Syndrome</a></h4>

              
                Dravet syndrome (DS) is a severe childhood genetic epilepsy, caused by de novo heterozygous mutations in the SCN1A gene, resulting in a loss of function of the voltage-gated sodium ion channel, Nav1.1. Nav1.1 is expressed in the brain and at a lower level, in the heart. The disease manifests in the first year of life. Patients exhibit tonic-clonic seizures, febrile seizures, cognitive decline, development delays, ataxia, and in some cases sudden unexpected death from epilepsy (SUDEP). Here we have developed a novel AAV-F mediated CRISPR-Cas-inspired RNA targeting system (CIRTS) pre-clinical treatment to increase endogenous Scn1a to ameliorate the disease phenotype in a clinically relevant heterozygous loss of function mouse model of DS. We designed novel guide RNAs (gRNAs) to target the long non-coding RNA, (or natural antisense transcript) of Scn1a to increase the expression of Scn1a mRNA in DS mice. We show that intracerebroventricular and intravenous administration of AAV-F-CIRTS-gRNA9 to target the brain and the heart to neonatal Scn1a+/- mice resulted significant increase in survival and a reduction in SUDEP and spontaneous seizures. Furthermore, we have shown increased expression of endogenous Scn1a in treated AAV-F-CIRTS-gRNA9 Scn1a+/- mice. These findings provide proof of concept evidence that an AAV-F-CIRTS mediated therapy hold promise as a potential long-term treatment for DS.

">Genotype-Phenotype Distinctions in Spastic Paraplegia 4 Reveal HDAC6 as a Therapeutic Target</a></h4>

              
                Spastic Paraplegia 4 (SPG4) is the most prevalent form of Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia (HSP), a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive lower limb spasticity and debilitating gait impairment, primarily driven by axonal degeneration of corticospinal motor neurons (CSMNs). Caused by mutations in the SPAST gene encoding spastin, an AAA-ATPase involved in microtubule severing and intracellular organelle function, SPG4 accounts for 40-50% of autosomal dominant HSP cases, yet without effective treatments. Although reduced microtubule acetylation has emerged as a key pathological mechanism, whether and how distinct mutations lead to microtubule deacetylation and subsequent neurodegeneration remains unclear. To address this, we generated isogenic human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) lines with two distinct heterozygous SPAST mutations - SPASTWT/C448Y (missense) and SPASTWT/S245X (truncation). Employing an innovative differentiation protocol, we created human motor cortical organoids enriched in CSMNs, providing a robust platform to study SPG4 pathophysiology. These organoids revealed striking genotype-phenotype distinctions, with mutation-specific variations in CSMN loss, axonal degeneration and neuronal activities, mirroring clinical heterogeneity. Mechanistic studies identified aberrant activation of histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6), a major neuronal microtubule deacetylase, as a key driver of SPG4 pathology. This dysregulation was specifically attributed to mutant M1-spastin, the longer isoform of spastin. Remarkably, pharmacological inhibition of HDAC6 with Tubastatin A restored microtubule acetylation status and mitigated axonal degeneration in both SPAST-mutant organoids, with corresponding improvements in corticospinal tract integrity and gait deficits validated in SPG4-transgenic mice. Collectively, our study establishes isogenic hiPSC-derived motor cortical organoids as a robust human model for corticospinal motor neuron degeneration and identifies HDAC6 hyperactivation as a central pathogenic mechanism and viable therapeutic target in SPG4.

">Situation Models in the Brain are Used to Resolve Word References</a></h4>

              
                Resolving the meaning of a pronoun requires retrieving information about a unique individual (a referent) from many remembered experiences and inferences throughout sensory and cognitive modalities, from vision and audition to episodic memory and social cognition. Here, we hypothesize that the functional neuroanatomy of pronoun interpretation involves interaction across distributed neural networks, during which each referent activates its own unique sensorimotor neural fingerprint associated with these experiences. To test this hypothesis, we collected fMRI data from 20 people watching a full-length movie, and developed a 3D branched convolutional neural network to distinguish movie characters from the fMRI signal across distributed sensorimotor regions. The same model distinguished the characters referenced by pronouns, using these same sensorimotor regions, supplemented by the hippocampus, precuneus, and medial prefrontal cortices. This work has far-reaching implications for understanding the relations among the many domains and modalities of neural representation required for ecological language comprehension. In particular, the demonstration that situation models, implemented in distributed sensory-motor and association cortices, are involved in resolving reference, suggests a whole brain distribution for language processing.

">Impaired BDNF-TrkB trafficking and signalling in Down syndrome basal forebrain neurons</a></h4>

              
                Brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its receptor tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB) play crucial roles in neuronal development, synaptic transmission, and neuroplasticity. Deficits in BDNF/TrkB signalling and trafficking have been identified in several neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Individuals with Down syndrome (DS) are at an increased risk of developing AD compared to the general population. Basal forebrain neurons (BFNs) are among the first to degenerate in AD and DS, but the mechanisms underlying their vulnerability remain unclear. Using BFNs derived from the Dp1Tyb mouse model of DS, we investigated neurotrophic signalling and trafficking deficits in AD-DS. We found enlarged early endosomes and elevated levels of active Rab5, a GTPase critical for early endosome formation, in Dp1Tyb BFNs. These abnormalities were associated with impaired transport of internalised TrkB from axon terminals to the soma. Using microfluidic devices, we demonstrated that axonal BDNF stimulation enhanced signalling endosome dynamics in wild-type but not Dp1Tyb BFNs, which is likely due to impaired axonal ERK1/2 signalling. Our findings establish a link between Rab5 hyperactivation, endosomal dysfunction, and impaired ERK1/2 signalling, highlighting the interplay between trafficking and neurotrophic signalling, and underscore the importance of targeting endolysosomal and signalling pathways to mitigate neuronal dysfunction in AD-DS.

">Compatibility of a competition model for explaining eyefixation durations during free viewing</a></h4>

              
                Intersaccadic times or eye fixation durations (EFD) are relatively stable at around 250ms, equivalent to 4 saccades by second. However, the mean and standard deviation are not sufficient to describe the frequency histogram distribution of EFD. The exgaussian has been proposed for fitting the EFD histograms. Present report tries to adjust a competition model (C model) between the saccadic and the fixation network to the EFD histograms. This model is at a rather conceptual level (computational level in Marr classification). Both models were adjusted to EFD from an open database with data of 179473 eye fixations. The C model showed to be able, along with exgaussian model, to be compatible for explaining the EFD distributions. The two parameters of the C model can be ascribed to (i) a refractory period for new saccades modeled by a sigmoid equation (A parameter), while (ii) the ps parameter would be related to the continuous competition between the saccadic network related to the saliency map and the eye fixation network, and would be modeled through a geometric probability density function. The model suggests that competition between neural networks would be an organizational property of brain neural networks to facilitate the decision process for action and perception. In the visual scene scanning the C model dynamic justifies the early post-saccadic stability of the foveated image, and the subsequent exploration of a broad space in the observed image.

">Context-Dependent Modulation of Astrocytic Ca2+ Signals by Mitochondria - A Computational Study</a></h4>

              
                Mitochondria are one of the major regulators of intracellular Ca2+ in the cells, uptaking this ion through the mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter (MCU) and releasing by the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP). Astrocytes respond to neurotransmitters and other stimuli by increasing the intracellular Ca2+ concentration, a process called 2+ signaling. However, it is not clear how mitochondria interact with the neurotransmitter-triggered Ca2+ responses in astrocytes. To explore this mechanisms, we expanded a previous compartmental model of astrocytes developed by our group including the mitochondrial MCU and mPTP mechanisms controlling the Ca2+ response. We simulate glutamatergic and dopaminergic inputs, modeled as Poisson processes, that promote the synthesis of IP3 through the PLC pathway. Here, we used a unipolar and a bifurcated-terminal morphology models and, with exception for the distal compartments, every other compartment have mitochondria. Simulations revealed that mitochondria modulate the Ca2+ response in a context-dependent manner. For weak glutamatergic input, they reduce the frequency of Ca2+ oscillations and the distance these signals propagate from the terminal regions. However, for strong glutamatergic input and in the presence of dopamine, mitochondria enhance the Ca2+ response by reducing the Ca2+-dependent IP3 degradation. Our findings provide computational evidence that mitochondria have a critical role in shaping the spatial organization of Ca2+ singling in astrocytes.

                Optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) offer a promising advancement in noninvasive neuroimaging via magnetoencephalography (MEG), but establishing their reliability and comparability to existing methods remains an ongoing endeavor. Here, we evaluated OPM recordings by assessing their test-retest reliability and comparing them to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) recordings in a repeated movie viewing paradigm. In 7 frequency bands ({delta}: 0.5-4 Hz, {theta}: 4-8 Hz, : 8-12 Hz, {beta}: 12-28 Hz, {gamma}1: 28-46 Hz, {gamma}2: 55-70 Hz, and HF: 64-116 Hz) we quantified the signal consistency (1) within individuals, (2) across subjects, and (3) across modalities. OPM exhibited widespread reliability, particularly in lower frequency bands; spatial patterns resembled those of fMRI and iEEG in visual and auditory regions. Cross-modal analyses revealed robust OPM-fMRI correspondence, including inverse correlations at low frequencies and positive correlations at higher frequencies, consistent with known relationships between oscillatory power and BOLD responses. Comparisons of signal-to-noise (SNR) estimates further revealed that in some regions, the SNR of cross-modal alignment exceeded within-modality reliability, suggesting that bridging between modalities can sometimes enhance SNR by attenuating reliably shared noise. Our findings demonstrate that OPM consistently captures stimulus-locked neural dynamics that converge with established modalities.

">Transcriptomic and pathological analysis of the hnRNP network reveals glial involvement in FTLD pathological subtypes</a></h4>

              
                Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a neurodegenerative disorder with a strong heritable component. Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) refers to the pathological changes seen in FTD, characterised by atrophy of the frontal and temporal lobes and the presence of abnormal protein inclusions. In the case of FTLD with hyperphosphorylated TDP-43 positive inclusions (FTLD-TDP), five pathological subtypes (A, B, C, D, and E) are observed based on the types and distribution of inclusions found in the brain. In all subtypes, there tends to be a large variability in the number of pathological inclusions observed between cases, with limited correlation to clinical manifestations. TDP-43 is an RNA binding protein belonging to the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) family which along with other hnRNPs modulates multiple aspects of RNA processing. HnRNPs other than TDP-43 have been implicated in several neurological diseases, including ALS, FTLD-TDP, FTLD-FUS and Alzheimer's disease. Multiple hnRNPs have been found in pathological inclusions in specific subtypes of FTLD-TDP, suggesting potential roles in the disease process. The role of the hnRNP network in FTLD disease pathogenesis, however, has not yet been investigated. This study aimed to comprehensively evaluate the presence and expression of hnRNP proteins in two pathological subtypes of sporadic FTLD-TDP (A and C) as well as the genetic form FTLD-TDP A C9orf72 using immunohistochemistry and gene expression analysis by single-nuclei RNA-sequencing. We found that there was great variability in frequency of TDP-43 pathology across and within FTLD-TDP pathological subtypes. Finally, our findings suggest that distinct global transcriptomic profiles may underlie the different pathological subtypes of FTLD-TDP. The most prominent transcriptomic changes were observed in oligodendrocytes and astrocytes, involving multiple hnRNPs across FTLD subtypes compared to controls. Transcriptomic co-expression analysis further revealed that glial clusters were more strongly associated with RNA processing dysfunction and contribute to disease classification. Together, these findings highlight the involvement of the hnRNP network and glial-specific RNA processing alterations in FTLD-TDP pathophysiology, offering new insight into the molecular distinctions between pathological subtypes and potential targets for future investigation.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Currently, bipolar disorder diagnosis is primarily based on clinical interviews. Magnetoencephalography signals reflect changes in the brain’s magnetic field induced by neuronal activity. As a result, the combination of magnetoencephalography and network science holds great promise for identifying bipolar disorder biomarkers. However, the existing methods remain limited in capturing the complexity of nodes and their connections within resting-state brain networks, making it difficult to fully reveal underlying pathological mechanisms. In this work, we measured the uncertainty associated with a subgraph, an information-theoretic metric called “subgraph entropy,” and used it to identify individuals with bipolar disorder. This method enabled a more accurate characterization of brain network complexity, facilitating the identification of regions closely associated with disease states. The results showed that subgraph entropy features significantly contributed to the classification of bipolar disorder, particularly within the beta frequency band. In addition, two special forms of subgraph entropy, namely node entropy and edge entropy, were examined to identify important brain regions and functional connectivity in bipolar disorder patients across multiple frequency bands. Notably, in the beta frequency band, the method based on edge entropy achieved 0.8462 accuracy, 0.7308 specificity, and 0.9231 sensitivity through leave-one-out cross-validation, effectively distinguishing individuals with bipolar disorder from healthy controls.</span>

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Rett syndrome, a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by loss-of-function mutations in the <i>MECP2</i> gene, is characterized by severe motor, cognitive, and emotional impairments. Some of the deficits may result from changes in cortical connections, especially downstream projections of the prefrontal cortex (PFC), which may also be targets of restoration following rearing conditions such as environmental enrichment that alleviate specific symptoms. Here, using a heterozygous <i>Mecp2<sup>+/−</sup>
</i> female mouse model closely analogous to human Rett syndrome, we investigated the impact of early environmental enrichment on behavioral deficits and PFC connectivity. Behavioral analyses revealed that enriched housing rescued fine motor deficits and reduced anxiety, with enrichment-housed <i>Mecp2<sup>+/−</sup>
</i> mice performing comparably to wild-type (WT) controls in rotarod and open field assays. Anatomical mapping of top-down anterior cingulate cortex (ACA) projections demonstrated altered PFC connectivity in <i>Mecp2<sup>+/−</sup>
</i> mice, with increased axonal density in the somatosensory cortex and decreased density in the motor cortex compared to WT controls. ACA axons revealed shifts in hemispheric distribution, particularly in the medial network regions, with <i>Mecp2<sup>+/−</sup>
</i> mice exhibiting reduced ipsilateral dominance. These changes were unaffected by enriched housing, suggesting that structural abnormalities in PFC connectivity persist despite behavioral improvements. Enriched housing rescued brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels in the hippocampus but failed to restore BDNF levels in the PFC, consistent with the persistent deficits observed in prefrontal axonal projections. These findings highlight the focal nature of changes induced by reduction of MeCP2 and by exposure to environmental enrichment and suggest that environmental enrichment starting in adolescence can alleviate behavioral deficits in <i>Mecp2<sup>+/−</sup>
</i> mice without reversing abnormalities in large-scale cortical connectivity.</p>

                <p>by Rose Hartman, K. Joy Payton, Rose Franzen, Meredith Lee, Elizabeth Drellich, Ali Shokoufandeh, Jeffrey Pennington</p>

The increasing availability of big data and adoption of sophisticated computational techniques in biomedical research has exciting implications for our scientific understanding of human health. However, researchers report struggling to find data science education that meets their needs, despite the fact that many training programs and online resources exist. There is a lack of evidence on the strengths and weaknesses of various training options, making selecting an educational path daunting. We created a new data science training program focused on rigorous, reproducible methods for biomedical research, making use of tightly scoped modular content that can be flexibly arranged to provide a curriculum tailored to a researcher’s specific needs and skill level. Moreover, we ran a study testing the program’s effectiveness, providing not only another option for data science training but also a model for collecting and sharing relevant data on data science education programs. We ran two waves of research participants, adjusting our materials in between to improve both the training program and our research design. For both waves, we pre-registered hypotheses that learners’ self-reported data science ability and level of agreement with important tenets of open science would increase over the course of the program. Indeed, learners showed significant improvement in data science ability (Wave 1: <i>t</i>(47) = 10.18, <i>p</i> < .001, Wave 2: <i>t</i>(238) = 17.12, <i>p</i> < .001) and grea<i>t</i>er agreement with open science values (Wave 1: <i>t</i>(47) = 3.56, <i>p</i> < .001, Wave 2: <i>t</i>(238) = 7.95, <i>p</i> < .001). Follow up analyses underscore <i>t</i>he robustness of improvemen<i>t</i> in data science ability. The improvement in open science values was more moderate and was significant only in some of our pre-registered hypothesis tests, likely due to a ceiling effect as most learners reported high agreement with open science values at pretest.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3002981">Penguins exploit tidal currents for efficient navigation and opportunistic foraging</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Richard M. Gunner, Flavio Quintana, Mariano H. Tonini, Mark D. Holton, Ken Yoda, Margaret C. Crofoot, Rory P. Wilson</p>

Animals navigating in fluid environments often face forces from wind or water currents that challenge travel efficiency and route accuracy. We investigated how 27 Magellanic penguins (<i>Spheniscus magellanicus</i>) adapt their navigation strategies to return to their colony amid regional tidal ocean currents. Using GPS-enhanced dead-reckoning loggers and high-resolution ocean current data, we reconstructed penguin travel vectors during foraging trips to assess their responses to variable currents during their colony-bound movements. By integrating estimates of energy costs and prey pursuits, we found that birds balanced direct navigation with current-driven drift: in calm currents, they maintained precise line-of-sight headings to their colony. In stronger currents, they aligned their return with lateral flows, which increased travel distance, but at reduced energy costs, and provided them with increased foraging opportunities. Since the lateral tidal currents always reversed direction over the course of return paths, the penguins’ return paths were consistently S-shaped but still resulted in the birds returning efficiently to their colonies. These findings suggest that Magellanic penguins can sense current drift and use it to enhance energy efficiency by maintaining overall directional accuracy while capitalizing on foraging opportunities.

<p><b>Serotonin receptors in areas of the emotion regulation network in human and rat brains a comparative autoradiographic study</b>. Our systematic comparative analysis revealed significant differences of 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> and 5-HT<sub>2</sub> receptor distributions and of their balance within and across components of the human emotion regulation network and homolog areas in rats. The data contribute to validate the rat as an appropriate model in the translational research of human mood disorders and provide reference data for comparisons to disorder related alterations.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Serotonergic neurotransmission is crucial for emotion processing and is dysregulated in mood disorders. To analyze the pathophysiology of disease and develop effective pharmacological treatments, the suitability of the rat as a model for translational research must be continuously validated. In vitro receptor autoradiography was used to characterize (dis)similarities of regional and laminar serotonergic 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> and 5-HT<sub>2</sub> receptor distributions between components of the human emotion regulation network and homologous rat areas, including areas of the lateral prefrontal, orbitofrontal anterior and midcingulate cortices, hippocampal cornu Ammonis (CA) and dentate gyrus (DG), and the accumbens, central amygdaloid, and mediodorsal thalamic nuclei. In both species, mean 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> densities were highest in cingulate area 25/infralimbic cortex and the hippocampus, and lowest in the accumbens. Whereas human CA presented significantly higher 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> density than DG, the opposite was found in rats. Across the cortical depth, in humans, layers I–III and V contained the highest and lowest 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> densities, respectively. In rats, layers I–II contained the lowest and layers V–VI the highest 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> values. Mean 5-HT<sub>2</sub> densities were lower than 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> densities in all areas of both species, whereby layers III and VI contained the highest and lowest 5-HT<sub>2</sub> densities, respectively. Rats presented a more widespread range of significant differences concerning the ratio between 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> and 5-HT<sub>2</sub> receptors across examined areas than did humans. Concluding, this comparative study reveals species differences in 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> and 5-HT<sub>2</sub> receptor densities in components of the emotion regulation network, which should be considered when using the rat as a model in the translational research of mood disorders.</p>

                Morillo et al. generated a single-nucleus RNA sequencing atlas of adult Caenorhabditis elegans male neurons. Compared with hermaphrodite neurons, they identified neuronal markers, sex-biased features, and regulators of male-specific behavior. These data expand the transcriptional landscape of the C. elegans nervous system, providing a foundation for studies on sex differences.

                Wei et al. demonstrate that a ketogenic diet induces oxidative stress and cellular senescence in an estrogen-dependent manner, with effects seen in male, but not female, mice. A similar response was observed with a high-fat diet, suggesting that elevated fatty acid oxidation may contribute to senescence under specific metabolic conditions.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/102701">A whole-organism landscape of X-inactivation in humans</a></h4>

              
                As females are mosaic for X-inactivation, direct determination of X-linked allelic expression in bulk tissues is typically unfeasible. Using females that are non-mosaic (completely skewed) for X-inactivation (nmXCI) has proven a powerful and natural genetic system for profiling X-inactivation in humans. By combining allele-resolution data for one previously reported and two newly identified nmXCI females, we directly determined X-inactivation status of 380 X-linked genes across 30 normal tissues, including 198 genes for which XCI status is directly determined for the first time. Our findings represent a substantial advance in our understanding of human X-inactivation and will serve as a reference for dissecting the genetic origin of sex bias in human traits. In addition, our study reveals nmXCI as a common feature of the human female population, with profound consequences for the penetrance and expressivity of X-linked traits in humans.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/105788">Pu.1/Spi1 dosage controls the turnover and maintenance of microglia in zebrafish and mammals</a></h4>

              
                Microglia are brain-resident macrophages playing pivotal roles in central nervous system (CNS) development and homeostasis. Yet, the cellular and molecular basis governing microglia maintenance remains largely unknown. Here, by utilizing a visible conditional knockout allele of <i>pu.1/spi1b</i> gene (the master regulator for microglia/macrophage lineage development) to generate mosaic microglia populations in adult zebrafish, we show that while <i>pu.1</i>-deficient microglia are immediately viable, they are less competitive, and chronically eliminated through Tp53-mediated cell competition. Interestingly, when conditionally inactivating Pu.1 in adult <i>spi-b</i> (the orthologue of mouse <i>Spi-b</i>) null mutants, microglia are rapidly depleted via apoptosis, suggesting that Pu.1 and Spi-b regulate microglia maintenance in a dosage-dependent manner. The dosage-dependent regulation of microglia maintenance by PU.1/SPI1 is evolutionarily conserved in mice, as shown by conditionally inactivating single and both <i>Spi1</i> alleles in microglia, respectively. Collectively, our study reveals the conserved cellular and molecular mechanisms controlling microglia turnover and maintenance in teleosts and mammals.

                Sequence-specific DNA recognition underlies essential processes in gene regulation, yet methods for simultaneous predictions of genomic DNA recognition sites and their binding affinity remain lacking. Here, we present the Interpretable protein-DNA Energy Associative (IDEA) model, a residue-level, interpretable biophysical model capable of predicting binding sites and affinities of DNA-binding proteins. By fusing structures and sequences of known protein-DNA complexes into an optimized energy model, IDEA enables direct interpretation of physicochemical interactions among individual amino acids and nucleotides. We demonstrate that this energy model can accurately predict DNA recognition sites and their binding strengths across various protein families. Additionally, the IDEA model is integrated into a coarse-grained simulation framework that quantitatively captures the absolute protein-DNA binding free energies. Overall, IDEA provides an integrated computational platform that alleviates experimental costs and biases in assessing DNA recognition and can be utilized for mechanistic studies of various DNA-recognition processes.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/104118">Integration of parallel pathways for flight control in a hawkmoth reflects prevalence and relevance of natural visual cues</a></h4>

              
                An animal’s behaviour is the result of multiple neural pathways acting in parallel, receiving information across and within sensory modalities at the same time. How these pathways are integrated, particularly when their individual outputs are in conflict, is key to understanding complex natural behaviours. We investigated this question in the visually guided flight of the hummingbird hawkmoth <i>Macroglossum stellatarum</i>. These insects were recently shown to partition their visual field, using ventrolateral optic flow cues to guide their flight like most insects, while the same stimuli in the dorsal visual field evoke a novel directional response. Using behavioural experiments which set the two pathways into conflict, we tested whether and how the ventrolateral and dorsal pathway integrate to guide hawkmoth flight. Combined with environmental imaging, we demonstrate that the partitioning of the visual field followed the prevalence of visual cues in the hawkmoths’ natural habitats, while the integration hierarchy of the two pathways matched the relevance of these cues for the animals’ flight safety, rather than their magnitude in the experimental setup or in natural habitats. These results provide new mechanistic insights into the vision-based flight control of insects and link these to their natural context. We anticipate our findings to be the starting point for comparative investigations into parallel pathways for flight guidance in insects from differently structured natural habitats.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/104255">Decoding protein phosphorylation during oocyte meiotic divisions using phosphoproteomics</a></h4>

              
                Oocyte meiotic divisions represent a critical process in sexual reproduction, as a diploid non-dividing oocyte is transformed into a haploid fertilizable egg, as a prelude for the subsequent embryonic divisions and differentiation. Although cell differentiation and proliferation are governed by transcription, oocyte maturation and early embryonic divisions depend entirely on changes in protein abundance and post-translational modifications. Here, we analyze the abundance and phosphorylation of proteins during <i>Xenopus</i> oocyte meiotic maturation. We reveal significant shifts in protein stability, related to spindle assembly, DNA replication, and RNA-binding. Our analysis pinpoints broad changes in phosphorylation correlating with key cytological meiotic milestones, noteworthy changes in membrane trafficking, nuclear envelope disassembly, and modifications in microtubule dynamics. Additionally, specific phosphorylation events target regulators of protein translation, Cdk1 and the Mos/MAPK pathway, thereby providing insight into the dynamics of Cdk1 activity, as related to the meiotic cell cycle. This study sheds light on the orchestration of protein dynamics and phosphorylation events during oocyte meiotic divisions, providing a rich resource for understanding the molecular pathways orchestrating meiotic progression in the frog, and most likely applicable to other vertebrate species.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100722">POMC neurons control fertility through differential signaling of MC4R in kisspeptin neurons</a></h4>

              
                Inactivating mutations in the melanocortin 4 receptor (<i>MC4R</i>) gene cause monogenic obesity. Interestingly, female patients also display various degrees of reproductive disorders, in line with the subfertile phenotype of Mc4r KO female mice. However, the cellular mechanisms by which MC4R regulates reproduction are unknown. Kiss1 neurons directly stimulate gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) release through two distinct populations: the Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons, controlling GnRH pulses, and the sexually dimorphic Kiss1<sup>AVPV/PeN</sup> neurons controlling the preovulatory luteinizing hormone (LH) surge. Here, we show that <i>Mc4r</i> expressed in Kiss1 neurons regulates fertility in females. In vivo, deletion of <i>Mc4r</i> from Kiss1 neurons in female mice replicates the reproductive impairments of Mc4r KO mice without inducing obesity. Conversely, re-insertion of <i>Mc4r</i> in Kiss1 neurons of Mc4r null mice restores estrous cyclicity and LH pulsatility without reducing their obese phenotype. In vitro, we dissect the specific action of Mc4r on Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> versus Kiss1<sup>AVPV/PeN</sup> neurons and show that Mc4r activation excites Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons through direct synaptic actions. In contrast, Kiss1<sup>AVPV/PeN</sup> neurons are normally inhibited by MC4R activation except under elevated estradiol levels, thus facilitating the activation of Kiss1<sup>AVPV/PeN</sup> neurons to induce the LH surge driving ovulation in females. Our findings demonstrate that POMC<sup>ARH</sup> neurons acting through MC4R directly regulate reproductive function in females by stimulating the ‘pulse generator’ activity of Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons and restricting the activation of Kiss1<sup>AVPV/PeN</sup> neurons to the time of the estradiol-dependent LH surge, and thus unveil a novel pathway of the metabolic regulation of fertility by the melanocortin system.

                <p>Crows, renowned for advanced cognitive abilities and vocal communication, rely on intricate auditory systems. While the neuroanatomy of corvid auditory pathways is partially explored, the underlying neurophysiological mechanisms are largely unknown. This study used functional ultrasound imaging (fUSi) to investigate sound-induced cerebral blood volume (CBV) changes in the Field L complex of the auditory telencephalon in two female crows. fUSi revealed frequency-specific CBV responses, showing a tonotopic organization within the Field L complex, with low frequencies in the posterior dorsal region and high frequencies in the anterior ventral region. Machine learning analyses showed fUSi signals could be used to classify sound types accurately, in both awake and anesthetized states. Variable CBV responses to longer sound stimuli suggest a delineation of subregions within the Field L complex. Together, these findings highlight the potential of fUSi for providing high-resolution insights into functional systems in corvids, enabling future exploration of experimental task-related cognitive dynamics.</p>

                <p>Evidence suggests that the neurotransmitter norepinephrine may play an important role in Parkinson disease (PD). The norepinephrine transporter (NET) regulates noradrenergic signaling and can serve as an index of noradrenergic innervation in neuroimaging studies. The <I>Pink1-/-</I> rat model, which exhibits many signs similar to PD, notably in the nonmotor domain, exhibits abnormal noradrenergic markers. Here, we sought to (1) implement reference region pharmacokinetic modeling of positron emission tomography (PET) imaging with the novel NET ligand [<sup>18</sup>F]NS12137, (2) validate the resulting indices of NET concentration, and (3) characterize NET in the <I>Pink1-/-</I> model. Long&ndash;Evans <I>Pink1-/-</I> male rats were imaged by PET with [<sup>18</sup>F]NS12137 at 9 and 11&nbsp;months and compared with wild-type (WT) controls. An additional group of WT rats of both sexes were imaged with [<sup>18</sup>F]NS12137 PET after pretreatment with the specific and selective NET ligand nisoxetine. Binding in locus coeruleus (LC), thalamus (Thal), and prelimbic area (PrL), regions rich in NET, was analyzed by a two-tissue compartment reversible binding model using a cerebellar reference region. [<sup>18</sup>F]NS12137 binding exhibited moderate test&ndash;retest reproducibility in LC, Thal, and PrL. Nisoxetine blockade yielded substantial reductions of [<sup>18</sup>F]NS12137 binding in LC. Compared with WT controls, <I>Pink1-/-</I> rats exhibited reduced binding in Thal and PrL. Pharmacokinetic analysis of [<sup>18</sup>F]NS12137 PET provides a reproducible and specific measure of NET binding and indicates reduced NET in PD-related brain regions in <I>Pink1-/-</I> rats. Noninvasive in vivo [<sup>18</sup>F]NS12137 PET imaging is therefore a promising method for the study of potential therapies in the <I>Pink1-/-</I> rat.</p>

                <p>Chronic neuropathic pain is a persistent and debilitating outcome of traumatic central nervous system injury, affecting up to 80% of individuals. Postinjury pain is refractory to treatments due to the limited understanding of the brain&ndash;spinal cord circuits that underlie pain signal processing. The corticospinal tract (CST) plays critical roles in sensory modulation during skilled movements and tactile sensation; however, a direct role for the CST in injury-associated neuropathic pain is unclear. Here we show that complete, selective CST transection at the medullary pyramids leads to hyperexcitability within lumbar deep dorsal horn and hindlimb allodynia-like behavior in chronically injured adult male and female mice. Chemogenetic regulation of CST-targeted lumbar spinal interneurons demonstrates that dysregulation of activity in this circuit underlies the development of tactile allodynia in chronic injury. Our findings shed light on an unrecognized circuit mechanism implicated in CNS injury-induced neuropathic pain and provide a novel target for therapeutic intervention.</p>
