	<p>Approximately 30% of epileptic patients develop Drug-Resistant Epilepsy. Based on evidence that shows a loss of efficacy in some sodium channel blocker antiseizure drugs in epilepsy, we focus our study on assessing the anticonvulsant efficacy of different sodium channel blockers on carbamazepine (CBZ)-resistant seizures generated using the window-pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) kindling model to verify whether one of these drugs presents some anticonvulsant effect that could have potential therapeutic use. Wistar rats were treated with a subthreshold dose of PTZ (35 mg/kg) three times/week. Fully kindled rats were then treated with a single dose of CBZ (40 mg/kg i.p.) at 2, 9 and 16 days after their last kindling stimulation to obtain CBZ-resistant rats. Right after, sodium channel blockers were tested for anticonvulsant action (lamotrigine, 30 mg/kg i.p.; eslicarbazepine, 150 or 300 mg/kg i.p.; ranolazine, 10, 20 or 40 mg/kg i.p.). Behavioral parameters included severity, latency or duration of convulsions. Our data showed for the first time directly that eslicarbazepine does have an anticonvulsant effect over CBZ-resistant seizures, while lamotrigine shows drug resistance and ranolazine demonstrates severe seizure worsening. It is of potential therapeutic relevance that eslicarbazepine could be useful to control seizures resistant to common sodium channel blockers such as CBZ.</p>

                EMBL-EBI, Europe's biomolecular data hub, is a world leader in managing and analysing big data in biology and making it freely available to scientists worldwide. Research infrastructures (RI) like EMBL-EBI rely extensively on information technology (IT) services to conduct research and support the delivery of scientific services. These IT services are complex and diverse and IT service management (ITSM) has been shown in other domains to help to improve efficiency and productivity. ITSM is a collection of standards that help organisations develop a process-based approach for managing the full lifecycle of IT services, while keeping their users' needs at the forefront and promoting continuous improvement. However, many organisations struggle with the design and implementation of an ITSM system as it involves the need for organisational change, and because the process approach can seem rigid and bureaucratic on the surface. This article aims to share the experience of the EMBL-EBI IT department in designing and implementing an ITSM system. ITSM implementation steps, benefits, challenges, opportunities, and practices are highlighted, critically analysed, and discussed.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Pattern changes of cutaneous dermatoses among Iraqi women preceding and during the COVID-19 pandemic [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: We compared the pattern of cutaneous dermatoses among Iraqi females of all ages between 4 months preceding the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, and the same months 1 year later within the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study, that targeted all female patients attending an outpatient clinic for dermatology and venereology in Al-Kindy teaching hospital, Baghdad between October 2019 to the end of January 2020, and the same 4-month duration 1 year later (October 2020 to the end of January 2021) after the COVID-19 peak period had passed and there was no or partial curfew to exclude seasonal impact. Results: A total of 2657 female-patients of all ages were enrolled in this study with 1314 females during the 4 months pre COVID-19, and 1343 females during the pandemic. The mean age of patients presented before the pandemic was 27.2±16.6 years, while the mean age of patients during the pandemic was 28.1±15.6 years with no statistically significant difference in mean ages (P >0.05). Hair loss in general with telogen effluvium specifically increased significantly. Cutaneous contagious viral infections were reduced significantly and specifically of these molluscum contagiosum and condylomata accuminata. Other forms of infections including bacterial and parasitic were also reduced while dermatophytosis was increased but not to a significant level. Acne vulgaris, rosacea, lichen planus, urticaria, pityriasis rosea, seborrheic dermatitis, and vitiligo were increased, but psoriasis, alopecia areata, other types of dermatitis, and melasma were reduced but none to a significant level. Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in changes in the pattern of diseases presented to an out-patient clinic for dermatology and venereology. This could be either related to COVID-19 infection or stress associated with the pandemic, because of curfew, or wearing facemasks which may cause a decrease or increase in certain diseases.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Superinfection exclusion: A viral strategy with short-term benefits and long-term drawbacks</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Michael Hunter, Diana Fusco</p>

Viral superinfection occurs when multiple viral particles subsequently infect the same host. In nature, several viral species are found to have evolved diverse mechanisms to prevent superinfection (superinfection exclusion) but how this strategic choice impacts the fate of mutations in the viral population remains unclear. Using stochastic simulations, we find that genetic drift is suppressed when superinfection occurs, thus facilitating the fixation of beneficial mutations and the removal of deleterious ones. Interestingly, we also find that the competitive (dis)advantage associated with variations in life history parameters is not necessarily captured by the viral growth rate for either infection strategy. Putting these together, we then show that a mutant with superinfection exclusion will easily overtake a superinfecting population even if the latter has a much higher growth rate. Our findings suggest that while superinfection exclusion can negatively impact the long-term adaptation of a viral population, in the short-term it is ultimately a winning strategy.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Reestablishment of spermatogenesis after more than 20 years of cryopreservation of rat spermatogonial stem cells reveals an important impact in differentiation capacity</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Eoin C. Whelan, Fan Yang, Mary R. Avarbock, Megan C. Sullivan, Daniel P. Beiting, Ralph L. Brinster</p>

Treatment of cancer in children is increasingly successful but leaves many prepubertal boys suffering from infertility or subfertility later in life. A current strategy to preserve fertility in these boys is to cryopreserve a testicular biopsy prior to treatment with the expectation of future technologies allowing for the reintroduction of stem cells and restoration of spermatogenesis. Spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) form the basis of male reproduction, differentiating into all germ cell types, including mature spermatozoa and can regenerate spermatogenesis following transplantation into an infertile testis. Here, we demonstrate that rat SSCs frozen for more than 20 years can be transplanted into recipient mice and produce all differentiating germ cell types. However, compared with freshly isolated cells or those frozen for a short period of time, long-frozen cells do not colonize efficiently and showed reduced production of spermatids. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed similar profiles of gene expression changes between short- and long-frozen cells as compared with fresh immediately after thawing. Conversely, following transplantation, long-frozen samples showed enhanced stem cell signaling in the undifferentiated spermatogonia compartment, consistent with self-renewal and a lack of differentiation. In addition, long-frozen samples showed fewer round spermatids with detectable protamine expression, suggesting a partial block of spermatogenesis after meiosis resulting in a lack of elongating spermatids. These findings strongly suggest that prolonged cryopreservation can impact the success of transplantation to produce spermatogenesis, which may not be revealed by analysis of the cells immediately after thawing. Our analysis uncovered persistent effects of long-term freezing not found in other cryopreservation studies that lacked functional regeneration of the tissue and this phenomenon must be accounted for any future therapeutic application.

<p>We examined the developing brain of the beetle <i>Tribolium castaneum</i>. We determined tracts, fascicles, and compartments (a) by combining tubulin and synapsin stainings (b) in three developing stages (b’). The result is a comprehensive anatomical atlas (c) that was compared with the fruitfly and is provided for user-friendly interaction (d).

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Insect brains are formed by conserved sets of neural lineages whose fibers form cohesive bundles with characteristic projection patterns. Within the brain neuropil, these bundles establish a system of fascicles constituting the macrocircuitry of the brain. The overall architecture of the neuropils and the macrocircuitry appear to be conserved. However, variation is observed, for example, in size, shape, and timing of development. Unfortunately, the developmental and genetic basis of this variation is poorly understood, although the rise of new genetically tractable model organisms such as the red flour beetle <i>Tribolium castaneum</i> allows the possibility to gain mechanistic insights. To facilitate such work, we present an atlas of the developing brain of <i>T. castaneum</i>, covering the first larval instar, the prepupal stage, and the adult, by combining wholemount immunohistochemical labeling of fiber bundles (acetylated tubulin) and neuropils (synapsin) with digital 3D reconstruction using the TrakEM2 software package. Upon comparing this anatomical dataset with the published work in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>, we confirm an overall high degree of conservation. Fiber tracts and neuropil fascicles, which can be visualized by global neuronal antibodies like antiacetylated tubulin in all invertebrate brains, create a rich anatomical framework to which individual neurons or other regions of interest can be referred to. The framework of a largely conserved pattern allowed us to describe differences between the two species with respect to parameters such as timing of neuron proliferation and maturation. These features likely reflect adaptive changes in developmental timing that govern the change from larval to adult brain.</p>

                <p>We sought to determine whether racial and socioeconomic disparities in the utilization of deep brain stimulation (DBS) for Parkinson's disease (PD) have improved over time. We examined DBS utilization and analyzed factors associated with placement of DBS. The odds of DBS placement increased across the study period, whereas White patients with PD were 5 times more likely than Black patients to undergo DBS. Individuals, regardless of racial background, with 2 or more comorbidities were 14 times less likely to undergo DBS. Privately insured patients were 1.6 times more likely to undergo DBS. Despite increasing DBS utilization, significant disparities persist in access to DBS. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">A Role for Insulin‐like Growth Factor 1 in the Generation of Epileptic Spasms</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Infantile spasms are associated with a wide variety of clinical conditions, including perinatal brain injuries. We have created a model in which prolonged infusion of tetrodotoxin (TTX) into the neocortex, beginning in infancy, produces a localized lesion and reproduces the behavioral spasms, electroencephalogram (EEG) abnormalities, and drug responsiveness seen clinically. Here, we undertook experiments to explore the possibility that the growth factor IGF-1 plays a role in generating epileptic spasms.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We combined long-term video EEG recordings with quantitative immunohistochemical and biochemical analyses to unravel IGF-1's role in spasm generation. Immunohistochemistry was undertaken in surgically resected tissue from infantile spasms patients. We used viral injections in neonatal conditional IGF-1R knock-out mice to show that an IGF-1-derived tripeptide (1-3)IGF-1, acts through the IGF-1 receptor to abolish spasms.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Immunohistochemical methods revealed widespread loss of IGF-1 from cortical neurons, but an increase in IGF-1 in the reactive astrocytes in the TTX-induced lesion. Very similar changes were observed in the neocortex from patients with spasms. In animals, we observed reduced signaling through the IGF-1 growth pathways in areas remote from the lesion. To show the reduction in IGF-1 expression plays a role in spasm generation, epileptic rats were treated with (1-3)IGF-1. We provide 3 lines of evidence that (1-3)IGF-1 activates the IGF-1 signaling pathway by acting through the receptor for IGF-1. Treatment with (1-3)IGF-1 abolished spasms and hypsarrhythmia-like activity in the majority of animals.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Results implicate IGF-1 in the pathogenesis of infantile spasms and IGF-1 analogues as potential novel therapies for this neurodevelopmental disorder. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

                This dataset is an accumulation of data collected to test Rwandan physics students’ conceptual understanding of light phenomena and to assess instructional tools for active learning of optics. We collected and analysed data from 251 grade 11 (senior 5) students using our Light Phenomena Conceptual Assessment (LPCA) tool and from 136 grade 10 (senior 4) students using Geometric Optics Conceptual Understanding Test (GOCUT) in 2019. Before collecting data, we designed and validated LPCA and GOCUT, and tested their reliability. Data were collected before and after students learnt about the unit of light. Both day and boarding schools in rural and urban areas were included in our sampling. Data collected were test scores from students after performing a 30-item LPCA test or 25-item GOCUT test in 40 minutes. The data may be reused to extend  students' understanding of optics concepts through item analysis, analysis of school characteristics such as location and school type, or by analysing students' characteristics such as subject combinations.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Lipogenesis mediated by OGR1 regulates metabolic adaptation to acid stress in cancer cells via autophagy</a></h4>

              
                Acid sensing is essential for cell survival under acidic growth conditions. Pillai et al. report that in response to extracellular acidosis, cells accumulate lipid droplets that are derived from autophagic breakdown of amino acids. This adaptive mechanism is triggered by the acid-sensing receptor OGR1 in breast cancer cells.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">The lactate-NAD+ axis activates cancer-associated fibroblasts by downregulating p62</a></h4>

              
                Linares et al. describe a molecular mechanism for cancer-associated fibroblast activation. Tumor-secreted lactate downregulates p62 in the stroma by reducing NAD+, which impairs PARP-1 activity, blocking AP-1-mediated p62 transcription. PARP-1 inhibitors mimic lactate to induce stroma activation, suggesting that anti-stromal therapies might enhance their efficacy.

                Congenital ribosomopathies are caused by mutations in genes affecting ribosome biogenesis or function. Rehn et al. find that loss of the splicing regulator, PTBP1, within murine hematopoiesis is associated with reduced protein synthesis, anemia, and reduced stem cell function, thereby mirroring ribosomopathy. These findings identify PTBP1 as a ribosome-integrating factor.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">SETD4-mediated KU70 methylation suppresses apoptosis</a></h4>

              
                Wang et al. identify the methylation of mammalian KU70 by SETD4. This posttranslational modification is critical for KU70 localization to the cytoplasm and subsequent suppression of apoptosis.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">A pan-cancer metabolic atlas of the tumor microenvironment</a></h4>

              
                Rohatgi et al. profile the metabolic phenotypes of cancer and stromal/immune cells across 20 tumor types, identifying cancer- and stromal-cell-specific metabolic pathways. They find recurrent upregulation of oxidative phosphorylation in cancer cells, which suggests that the Warburg effect may be less pronounced in cancer cells in vivo.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Reduced housing density improves statistical power of murine gut microbiota studies</a></h4>

              
                Cage effects are a broad concern in mouse microbiome studies, given close contact and coprophagic behaviors. By comparing housing densities, Russell et al. show that reduced housing density consistently results in reduced cage effects and increased statistical power to detect antibiotic treatment-associated effects in the gut microbiome, despite comparable susceptibilities.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Experimental microevolution of Trypanosoma cruzi reveals hybridization and clonal mechanisms driving rapid diversification of genome sequence and structure</a></h4>

              
                Protozoa and fungi are known to have extraordinarily diverse mechanisms of genetic exchange. However, the presence and epidemiological relevance of genetic exchange in <i>Trypanosoma cruzi</i>, the agent of Chagas disease, has been controversial and debated for many years. Field studies have identified both predominantly clonal and sexually recombining natural populations. Two of six natural <i>T. cruzi</i> lineages (TcV and TcVI) show hybrid mosaicism, using analysis of single-gene locus markers. The formation of hybrid strains <i>in vitro </i>has been achieved and this provides a framework to study the mechanisms and adaptive significance of genetic exchange. Using whole genome sequencing of a set of experimental hybrids strains, we have confirmed that hybrid formation initially results in tetraploid parasites. The hybrid progeny showed novel mutations that were not attributable to either (diploid) parent showing an increase in amino acid changes. In long-term culture, up to 800 generations, there was a variable but gradual erosion of progeny genomes towards triploidy, yet retention of elevated copy number was observed at several core housekeeping loci. Our findings indicate hybrid formation by fusion of diploid <i>T. cruzi</i>, followed by sporadic genome erosion, but with substantial potential for adaptive evolution, as has been described as a genetic feature of other organisms, such as some fungi.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Thermosynechococcus switches the direction of phototaxis by a c-di-GMP-dependent process with high spatial resolution</a></h4>

              
                Many cyanobacteria, which use light as an energy source via photosynthesis, show directional movement towards or away from a light source. However, the molecular and cell biological mechanisms for switching the direction of movement remain unclear. Here, we visualized type IV pilus-dependent cell movement in the rod-shaped thermophilic cyanobacterium <i>Thermosynechococcus vulcanus</i> using optical microscopy at physiological temperature and light conditions. Positive and negative phototaxis were controlled on a short time scale of 1 min. The cells smoothly moved over solid surfaces towards green light, but the direction was switched to backward movement when we applied additional blue light illumination. The switching was mediated by three photoreceptors, SesA, SesB, and SesC, which have cyanobacteriochrome photosensory domains and synthesis/degradation activity of the bacterial second messenger cyclic dimeric GMP (c-di-GMP). Our results suggest that the decision-making process for directional switching in phototaxis involves light-dependent changes in the cellular concentration of c-di-GMP. Direct visualization of type IV pilus filaments revealed that rod-shaped cells can move perpendicular to the light vector, indicating that the polarity can be controlled not only by pole-to-pole regulation but also within-a-pole regulation. This study provides insights into previously undescribed rapid bacterial polarity regulation via second messenger signalling with high spatial resolution.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">SDR enzymes oxidize specific lipidic alkynylcarbinols into cytotoxic protein-reactive species</a></h4>

              
                Hundreds of cytotoxic natural or synthetic lipidic compounds contain chiral alkynylcarbinol motifs, but the mechanism of action of those potential therapeutic agents remains unknown. Using a genetic screen in haploid human cells, we discovered that the enantiospecific cytotoxicity of numerous terminal alkynylcarbinols, including the highly cytotoxic dialkynylcarbinols, involves a bioactivation by HSD17B11, a short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) known to oxidize the C-17 carbinol center of androstan-3-alpha,17-beta-diol to the corresponding ketone. A similar oxidation of dialkynylcarbinols generates dialkynylketones, that we characterize as highly protein-reactive electrophiles. We established that, once bioactivated in cells, the dialkynylcarbinols covalently modify several proteins involved in protein-quality control mechanisms, resulting in their lipoxidation on cysteines and lysines through <i>Michael</i> addition. For some proteins, this triggers their association to cellular membranes and results in endoplasmic reticulum stress, unfolded protein response activation, ubiquitin-proteasome system inhibition and cell death by apoptosis. Finally, as a proof-of-concept, we show that generic lipidic alkynylcarbinols can be devised to be bioactivated by other SDRs, including human RDH11 and HPGD/15-PGDH. Given that the SDR superfamily is one of the largest and most ubiquitous, this unique cytotoxic mechanism-of-action could be widely exploited to treat diseases, in particular cancer, through the design of tailored prodrugs.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">History-dependent physiological adaptation to lethal genetic modification under antibiotic exposure</a></h4>

              
                Genetic modifications, such as gene deletion and mutations, could lead to significant changes in physiological states or even cell death. Bacterial cells can adapt to diverse external stresses, such as antibiotic exposure, but can they also adapt to detrimental genetic modification? To address this issue, we visualized the response of individual <i>Escherichia coli</i> cells to deletion of the antibiotic resistance gene under chloramphenicol (Cp) exposure, combining the light-inducible genetic recombination and microfluidic long-term single-cell tracking. We found that a significant fraction (∼40%) of resistance-gene-deleted cells demonstrated a gradual restoration of growth and stably proliferated under continuous Cp exposure without the resistance gene. Such physiological adaptation to genetic modification was not observed when the deletion was introduced in 10 hr or more advance before Cp exposure. Resistance gene deletion under Cp exposure disrupted the stoichiometric balance of ribosomal large and small subunit proteins (RplS and RpsB). However, the balance was gradually recovered in the cell lineages with restored growth. These results demonstrate that bacterial cells can adapt even to lethal genetic modifications by plastically gaining physiological resistance. However, the access to the resistance states is limited by the environmental histories and the timings of genetic modification.

                Gain-of-function mutations in the protein-tyrosine phosphatase SHP2 are the most                    frequently occurring mutations in sporadic juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia                    (JMML) and JMML-like myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) associated with Noonan                    syndrome (NS). Hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) are the disease                    propagating cells of JMML. Here, we explored transcriptomes of HSPCs with Shp2                    mutations derived from JMML patients and a novel NS zebrafish model. In addition                    to major NS traits, CRISPR/Cas9 knock-in Shp2<i><sup>D61G</sup></i>                    mutant zebrafish recapitulated a JMML-like MPN phenotype, including myeloid                    lineage hyperproliferation, <i>ex vivo</i> growth of myeloid colonies                    and <i>in vivo</i> transplantability of HSPCs. Single cell mRNA                    sequencing of HSPCs from Shp2<i><sup>D61G</sup></i> zebrafish embryos                    and bulk sequencing of HSPCs from JMML patients revealed an overlapping                    inflammatory gene expression pattern. Strikingly, an anti-inflammatory agent                    rescued JMML-like MPN in Shp2<i><sup>D61G</sup></i> zebrafish embryos.                    Our results indicate that a common inflammatory response was triggered in the                    HSPCs from sporadic JMML patients and syndromic NS zebrafish, which potentiated                    MPN and may represent a future target for JMML therapies.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Conformist social learning leads to self-organised prevention against adverse bias in risky decision making</a></h4>

              
                Given the ubiquity of potentially adverse behavioural bias owing to myopic trial-and-error learning, it seems paradoxical that improvements in decision-making performance through conformist social learning, a process widely considered to be bias amplification, still prevail in animal collective behaviour. Here we show, through model analyses and large-scale interactive behavioural experiments with 585 human subjects, that conformist influence can indeed promote favourable risk taking in repeated experience-based decision making, even though many individuals are systematically biased towards adverse risk aversion. Although strong positive feedback conferred by copying the majority’s behaviour could result in unfavourable informational cascades, our differential equation model of collective behavioural dynamics identified a key role for increasing exploration by negative feedback arising when a weak minority influence undermines the inherent behavioural bias. This ‘collective behavioural rescue’, emerging through coordination of positive and negative feedback, highlights a benefit of collective learning in a broader range of environmental conditions than previously assumed and resolves the ostensible paradox of adaptive collective behavioural flexibility under conformist influences.

                Cells steadily adapt their membrane glycerophospholipid (GPL) composition to changing environmental and developmental conditions. While the regulation of membrane homeostasis <i>via</i> GPL synthesis in bacteria has been studied in detail, the mechanisms underlying the controlled degradation of endogenous GPLs remain unknown. Thus far, the function of intracellular phospholipases A (PLAs) in GPL remodeling (Lands cycle) in bacteria is not clearly established. Here, we identified the first cytoplasmic membrane-bound phospholipase A<sub>1</sub> (PlaF) from <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>, which might be involved in the Lands cycle. PlaF is an important virulence factor, as the <i>P. aeruginosa</i> Δ<i>plaF</i> mutant showed strongly attenuated virulence in <i>Galleria mellonella</i> and macrophages. We present a 2.0-Å-resolution crystal structure of PlaF, the first structure that reveals homodimerization of a single-pass transmembrane (TM) full-length protein. PlaF dimerization, mediated solely through the intermolecular interactions of TM and juxtamembrane regions, inhibits its activity. The dimerization site and the catalytic sites are linked by an intricate ligand-mediated interaction network, which might explain the product (fatty acid) feedback inhibition observed with the purified PlaF protein. We used molecular dynamics simulations and configurational free energy computations to suggest a model of PlaF activation through a coupled monomerization and tilting of the monomer in the membrane, which constrains the active site cavity into contact with the GPL substrates. Thus, these data show the importance of the PlaF mediated GPL remodeling pathway for virulence and could pave the way for the development of novel therapeutics targeting PlaF.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Role of anterior insula cortex in context-induced relapse of nicotine-seeking</a></h4>

              
                Tobacco use is the leading cause of preventable death worldwide, and relapse during abstinence remains the critical barrier to successful treatment of tobacco addiction. During abstinence, environmental contexts associated with nicotine use can induce craving and contribute to relapse. The insular cortex (IC) is thought to be a critical substrate of nicotine addiction and relapse. However, its specific role in context-induced relapse of nicotine-seeking is not fully known. In this study, we report a novel rodent model of context-induced relapse to nicotine-seeking after punishment-imposed abstinence, which models self-imposed abstinence through increasing negative consequences of excessive drug use. Using the neuronal activity marker Fos we find that the anterior (aIC), but not the middle or posterior IC, shows increased activity during context-induced relapse. Combining Fos with retrograde labelling of aIC inputs, we show projections to aIC from contralateral aIC and basolateral amygdala exhibit increased activity during context-induced relapse. Next, we used fiber photometry in aIC and observed phasic increases in aIC activity around nicotine-seeking responses during self-administration, punishment, and the context-induced relapse tests. Next, we used chemogenetic inhibition in both male and female rats to determine whether activity in aIC is necessary for context-induced relapse. We found that chemogenetic inhibition of aIC decreased context-induced nicotine-seeking after either punishment- or extinction-imposed abstinence. These findings highlight the critical role nicotine-associated contexts play in promoting relapse, and they show that aIC activity is critical for this context-induced relapse following both punishment and extinction imposed abstinence.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Rescue of behavioral and electrophysiological phenotypes in a Pitt-Hopkins syndrome mouse model by genetic restoration of Tcf4 expression</a></h4>

              
                Pitt-Hopkins syndrome (PTHS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by monoallelic mutation or deletion in the <i>transcription factor 4</i> (<i>TCF4</i>) gene. Individuals with PTHS typically present in the first year of life with developmental delay and exhibit intellectual disability, lack of speech, and motor incoordination. There are no effective treatments available for PTHS, but the root cause of the disorder, <i>TCF4</i> haploinsufficiency, suggests that it could be treated by normalizing <i>TCF4</i> gene expression. Here, we performed proof-of-concept viral gene therapy experiments using a conditional <i>Tcf4</i> mouse model of PTHS and found that postnatally reinstating <i>Tcf4</i> expression in neurons improved anxiety-like behavior, activity levels, innate behaviors, and memory. Postnatal reinstatement also partially corrected EEG abnormalities, which we characterized here for the first time, and the expression of key TCF4-regulated genes. Our results support a genetic normalization approach as a treatment strategy for PTHS, and possibly other TCF4-linked disorders.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">One-shot generalization in humans revealed through a drawing task</a></h4>

              
                Humans have the amazing ability to learn new visual concepts from just a single exemplar. How we achieve this remains mysterious. State-of-the-art theories suggest observers rely on internal ‘generative models’, which not only describe observed objects, but can also synthesize novel variations. However, compelling evidence for generative models in human one-shot learning remains sparse. In most studies, participants merely compare candidate objects created by the experimenters, rather than generating their own ideas. Here, we overcame this key limitation by presenting participants with 2D ‘Exemplar’ shapes and asking them to draw their own ‘Variations’ belonging to the same class. The drawings reveal that participants inferred—and synthesized—genuine novel categories that were far more varied than mere copies. Yet, there was striking agreement between participants about which shape features were most distinctive, and these tended to be preserved in the drawn Variations. Indeed, swapping distinctive parts caused objects to swap apparent category. Our findings suggest that internal generative models are key to how humans generalize from single exemplars. When observers see a novel object for the first time, they identify its most distinctive features and infer a generative model of its shape, allowing them to mentally synthesize plausible variants.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Single-cell profiling reveals periventricular CD56bright NK cell accumulation in multiple sclerosis</a></h4>

              
                Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic demyelinating disease characterised by immune cell infiltration resulting in lesions that preferentially affect periventricular areas of the brain. Despite research efforts to define the role of various immune cells in MS pathogenesis, the focus has been on a few immune cell populations while full-spectrum analysis, encompassing others such as natural killer (NK) cells, has not been performed. Here, we used single-cell mass cytometry (CyTOF) to profile the immune landscape of brain periventricular areas - septum and choroid plexus – and of the circulation from donors with MS, dementia and controls without neurological disease. Using a 37-marker panel, we revealed the infiltration of T cells and antibody-secreting cells in periventricular brain regions and identified a novel NK cell signature specific to MS. CD56<sup>bright</sup> NK cells were accumulated in the septum of MS donors and displayed an activated and migratory phenotype, similar to that of CD56<sup>bright</sup> NK cells in the circulation. We validated this signature by multiplex immunohistochemistry and found that the number of NK cells with high expression of granzyme K, typical of the CD56<sup>bright</sup> subset, was increased in both periventricular lesions and the choroid plexus of donors with MS. Together, our multi-tissue single-cell data shows that CD56<sup>bright</sup> NK cells accumulate in the periventricular brain regions of MS patients, bringing NK cells back to the spotlight of MS pathology.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Repressing PTBP1 fails to convert reactive astrocytes to dopaminergic neurons in a 6-hydroxydopamine mouse model of Parkinson's disease</a></h4>

              
                Lineage reprograming of resident glial cells to dopaminergic neurons (DAns) is an attractive prospect of the cell-replacement therapy for Parkinson's disease (PD). However, it is unclear whether repressing polypyrimidine tract binding protein 1 (PTBP1) could efficiently convert astrocyte to DAns in the substantia nigra and striatum. Although reporter-positive DAns were observed in both groups after delivering the adeno-associated virus (AAV) expressing a reporter with shRNA or CRISPR-CasRx to repress astroglial PTBP1, the possibility of AAV leaking into endogenous DAns could not be excluded without using a reliable lineage-tracing method. By adopting stringent lineage-tracing strategy, two other studies showed that either knockdown or genetic deletion of quiescent astroglial PTBP1 fails to obtain induced DAns under physiological condition. However, the role of reactive astrocytes might be underestimated because upon brain injury, reactive astrocyte can acquire certain stem cell hallmarks that may facilitate the lineage conversion process. Therefore, whether reactive astrocytes could be genuinely converted to DAns after PTBP1 repression in a PD model needs further validation. In this study, we used <i>Aldh1l1-CreERT2</i>-mediated specific astrocyte-lineage-tracing method to investigate whether reactive astrocytes can be converted to DAns in a 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) mouse model of PD. However, we found that no astrocyte-originated DAn was generated after effective and persistent knockdown of astroglial PTBP1 either in the substantia nigra or in striatum, while AAV 'leakage' to nearby neurons was easily observed. Our results confirmed that repressing PTBP1 does not convert astrocytes to DAns, regardless of physiological or PD-related pathological conditions.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Single-cell monitoring of dry mass and dry mass density reveals exocytosis of cellular dry contents in mitosis</a></h4>

              
                Cell mass and composition change with cell cycle progression. Our previous work characterized buoyant mass dynamics in mitosis (Miettinen et al., 2019), but how dry mass and cell composition change in mitosis has remained unclear. To better understand mitotic cell growth and compositional changes, we develop a single-cell approach for monitoring dry mass and the density of that dry mass every ~75 s with 1.3% and 0.3% measurement precision, respectively. We find that suspension grown mammalian cells lose dry mass and increase dry mass density following mitotic entry. These changes display large, non-genetic cell-to-cell variability, and the changes are reversed at metaphase-anaphase transition, after which dry mass continues accumulating. The change in dry mass density causes buoyant and dry mass to differ specifically in early mitosis, thus reconciling existing literature on mitotic cell growth. Mechanistically, cells in early mitosis increase lysosomal exocytosis, and inhibition of lysosomal exocytosis decreases the dry mass loss and dry mass density increase in mitosis. Overall, our work provides a new approach for monitoring single-cell dry mass and dry mass density, and reveals that mitosis is coupled to extensive exocytosis-mediated secretion of cellular contents.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Hyperreactivity to uncertainty is a key feature of subjective cognitive impairment</a></h4>

              
                With an increasingly ageing global population, more people are presenting with concerns about their cognitive function, but not all have an underlying neurodegenerative diagnosis. Subjective cognitive impairment (SCI) is a common condition describing self-reported deficits in cognition without objective evidence of cognitive impairment. Many individuals with SCI suffer from depression and anxiety, which have been hypothesised to account for their cognitive complaints. Despite this association between SCI and affective features, the cognitive and brain mechanisms underlying SCI are poorly understood. Here, we show that people with SCI are hyperreactive to uncertainty and that this might be a key mechanism accounting for their affective burden. Twenty-seven individuals with SCI performed an information sampling task, where they could actively gather information prior to decisions. Across different conditions, SCI participants sampled faster and obtained more information than matched controls to resolve uncertainty. Remarkably, despite their 'urgent' sampling behaviour, SCI participants were able to maintain their efficiency. Hyperreactivity to uncertainty indexed by this sampling behaviour correlated with the severity of affective burden including depression and anxiety. Analysis of MRI resting functional connectivity revealed that SCI participants had stronger insular-hippocampal connectivity compared to controls, which also correlated with faster sampling. These results suggest that altered uncertainty processing is a key mechanism underlying the psycho-cognitive manifestations in SCI and implicate a specific brain network target for future treatment.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">An epithelial signalling centre in sharks supports homology of tooth morphogenesis in vertebrates</a></h4>

              
                Development of tooth shape is regulated by the enamel knot signalling centre, at least in mammals. Fgf signalling regulates differential proliferation between the enamel knot and adjacent dental epithelia during tooth development, leading to formation of the dental cusp. The presence of an enamel knot in non-mammalian vertebrates is debated given differences in signalling. Here we show the conservation and restriction of <i>fgf3, fgf10 and shh</i> to the sites of future dental cusps in the shark (<i>Scyliorhinus canicula</i>), whilst also highlighting striking differences between the shark and mouse. We reveal shifts in tooth size, shape and cusp number following small molecule perturbations of canonical Wnt signalling. Resulting tooth phenotypes mirror observed effects in mammals, where canonical Wnt has been implicated as an upstream regulator of enamel knot signalling. <i>In silico</i> modelling of shark dental morphogenesis demonstrates how subtle changes in activatory and inhibitory signals can alter tooth shape, resembling developmental phenotypes and cusp shapes observed following experimental Wnt perturbation. Our results support the functional conservation of an enamel knot-like signalling centre throughout vertebrates and suggest that varied tooth types from sharks to mammals follow a similar developmental bauplan. Lineage-specific differences in signalling are not sufficient in refuting homology of this signalling centre, which is likely older than teeth themselves.

                Neurons receive information through their synaptic inputs, but the functional significance of how those inputs are mapped on to a cell's dendrites remains unclear. We studied this question in a grasshopper visual neuron that tracks approaching objects and triggers escape behavior before an impending collision. In response to black approaching objects, the neuron receives OFF excitatory inputs that form a retinotopic map of the visual field onto compartmentalized, distal dendrites. Subsequent processing of these OFF inputs by active membrane conductances allows the neuron to discriminate the spatial coherence of such stimuli. In contrast, we show that ON excitatory synaptic inputs activated by white approaching objects map in a random manner onto a more proximal dendritic field of the same neuron. This random synaptic arrangement results in the neuron's inability to discriminate the coherence of white approaching stimuli. Yet, the neuron retains the ability to discriminate stimulus coherence for checkered stimuli of mixed ON/OFF polarity. The coarser mapping and processing of ON stimuli thus has a minimal impact, while reducing the total energetic cost of the circuit. Further, we show that these differences in ON/OFF neuronal processing are behaviorally relevant, being tightly correlated with the animal's escape behavior to light and dark stimuli of variable coherence. Our results show that the synaptic mapping of excitatory inputs affects the fine stimulus discrimination ability of single neurons and document the resulting functional impact on behavior.

                Electroreception through ampullae of Lorenzini in the little skate, Leucoraja erinacea , involves functional coupling between voltage-activated calcium channels (CaV1.3, cacna1d ) and calcium-activated big conductance potassium (BK) channels (BK, kcnma1 ). Whole mount confocal microscopy was used to characterize expression of BK and CaV1.3 in intact ampullae. BK and CaV1.3 are present in electrosensory cell plasma membranes and colocalize with lamin B1 in nuclear envelopes and kinocilia. Predicted nuclear localization signals (NLS) were identified in BK and CaV1.3 by bioinformatic sequence analyses. The BK NLS is bipartite, occurs at an alternative splice site for the mammalian STREX exon and is modified by post-translational phosphorylation. Nuclear localization of skate BK channels was characterized in heterologously-transfected HEK293 cells. Double point mutations in the bipartite NLS (KR to AA, or SVLS to AVLA) independently attenuated BK channel nuclear localization, illustrating that BK trafficking into nuclei and electrosensory cell kinocilia is regulated through a newly identified bipartite NLS.

                Cognitive aging is associated with widespread neural reorganization processes in the human brain. However, the behavioral impact of such reorganization is not well understood. The current neuroimaging study investigated age differences in the functional network architecture during language production. Combining task-based functional connectivity, graph theory and cognitive measures of fluid and crystallized intelligence, our findings show age-accompanied large-scale network reorganization even when older adults have intact word retrieval abilities. In particular, functional networks of older adults were characterized by reduced decoupling between systems, reduced segregation and efficiency, and a larger number of hub regions relative to young adults. Exploring the predictive utility of these age-related changes in network topology revealed high, albeit less efficient, performance for older adults whose brain graphs showed stronger dedifferentiation and reduced distinctiveness. Our results have important implications for theoretical accounts of neurocognitive aging, indicating a successful compensatory network reconfiguration at the cost of efficient wiring.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Experience alters hippocampal and cortical network communication via a KIBRA-dependent mechanism</a></h4>

              
                Synaptic plasticity is hypothesized to underlie replay of salient experience during hippocampal sharp-wave/ripple (SWR)-based ensemble activity and to facilitate systems-level memory consolidation coordinated by SWRs and cortical sleep spindles. However, it remains unclear how molecular changes at synapses contribute to experience-induced modification of network function. The synaptic protein KIBRA regulates plasticity and memory, although its impact on circuit dynamics remains unknown. Here, we recorded in vivo neural activity from WT mice and littermates lacking KIBRA to examine circuit function before, during, and after novel experience. In WT mice, experience altered network dynamics in a manner consistent with incorporation of new information content in replay and enhanced hippocampal-cortical communication. However, while baseline SWR features were normal in KIBRA cKO mice, experience-dependent alterations in SWRs were absent. Furthermore, intra-hippocampal and hippocampal-cortical communication during SWRs was disrupted following KIBRA deletion. These results reveal molecular mechanisms that underlie network-level memory formation and consolidation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Entorhinal-hippocampal circuit integrity is related to mnemonic discrimination and amyloid-β pathology in older adults</a></h4>

              
                Mnemonic discrimination, a cognitive process that relies on hippocampal pattern separation, is one of the first memory domains to decline in aging and preclinical Alzheimer's disease. We tested if functional connectivity (FC) within the entorhinal-hippocampal circuit, measured with high-resolution resting state fMRI, is associated with mnemonic discrimination and A{beta} pathology, measured with PET, in nondemented older adults. Low object mnemonic discrimination performance was specifically associated with increased FC between anterolateral entorhinal cortex (alEC) and dentate gyrus (DG)/CA3, supporting the importance of this connection to object memory. This hyperconnectivity between alEC-DG/CA3 was related to A{beta} pathology and decreased entorhinal cortex volume. In contrast, spatial mnemonic discrimination was not associated with altered FC. A{beta} was further associated with decreased FC and volume within hippocampal subfields. Our findings suggest that A{beta} may indirectly lead to memory impairment through entorhinal-hippocampal circuit dysfunction and neurodegeneration, and provide a mechanism for vulnerability of object mnemonic discrimination.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The statistical power of three monkeys</a></h4>

              
                Neuroscience studies in non-human primates (NHP) often follow the rule of thumb that results observed in one animal must be replicated in at least one other. However, we lack a statistical justification for this rule of thumb, or an analysis of whether including three or more animals is better than including two. Yet, a formal statistical framework for experiments with few subjects would be crucial for experimental design, ethical justification, and data analysis. Also, including three or four animals in a study creates the possibility that the results observed in one animal will differ from those observed in the others: we need a statistically justified rule to resolve such situations. Here, I present a statistical framework to address these issues. This framework assumes that conducting an experiment will produce a similar result for a large proportion of the population (termed 'representative'), but will produce spurious results for a substantial proportion of animals (termed 'outliers'); the fractions of 'representative' and 'outliers' animals being defined by a prior distribution. I propose a procedure in which experimenters collect results from M animals and accept results that are observed in at least N of them ('N-out-of-M' procedure). I show how to compute the risks  (of reaching an incorrect conclusion) and {beta} (of failing to reach a conclusion) for any prior distribution, and as a function of N and M. Strikingly, I find that the N-out-of-M model leads to a similar conclusion across a wide range of prior distributions: recordings from two animals lowers the risk  and therefore ensures reliable result, but leaves a large risk {beta}; and recordings from three animals and accepting results observed in two of them strikes an efficient balance between acceptable risks  and {beta}. This framework gives a formal justification for the rule of thumb of using at least two animals in NHP studies, suggests that recording from three animals when possible markedly improves statistical power, provides a statistical solution for situations where results are not consistent between all animals, and may apply to other types of studies involving few animals.

                Neurodegenerative diseases have been a major threat to public health worldwide nowadays. In particular, Alzheimer's disease is the most common type causing dementia which has remained an incurable disease, despite improvement of the symptoms via some therapies. The pathogenic mechanism of Alzheimer's disease is deemed to be related to the aggregation of beta-amyloid peptide (A{beta}), a major cause for amyloid plaques, resulting in neuronal death via the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Scientists have regarded oxidative stress as a potential treatment target in the development of novel remedies. In the study, human neural cell line SH-SY5Y was used in probing the effect of combining non-invasive high-frequency low-intensity pulsed electric field (H-LIPEF) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in protection against hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced neuron damage. Our result finds that the combination approach has intensified the neuroprotective effect significantly, perhaps due to H-LIPEF and BDNF synergistically increasing the expression level of the phosphorylated epidermal growth factor receptor (p-EGFR), which induces the survival-related mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) proteins. The study confirmed the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), a member of MAPK family, and the downstream pro-survival and antioxidant proteins as the mechanism underlying neuron protection. These findings have highlighted the potential of H-LIPEF combining with BDNF in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. Furthermore, the application of BDNF-mimetic drugs and non-invasive H-LIPEF to patients is a promising approach worthy of further research, and this points to strategies and mechanisms for selecting drugs or compounds to cooperate with electric fields in the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The recruitment of indirect-waves within primary motor cortex during motor imagery: A directional Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation study</a></h4>

              
                Motor imagery (MI) refers to the mental simulation of an action without any overt movement. While numerous transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) studies provided evidence for a modulation of corticospinal excitability and intracortical inhibition during MI, the neural signature within the primary motor cortex is not clearly established. In the current study, we used directional TMS to probe the modulation of the excitability of early and late indirect-waves (I-waves) generating pathways during MI. Corticospinal responses evoked by TMS with posterior-anterior (PA) and anterior-posterior (AP) current flow within primary motor cortex evoke preferentially early and late I-waves, respectively. Seventeen participants were instructed to stay at rest or to imagine isometric maximal contractions of the right flexor carpi radialis. We demonstrated that the increase of corticospinal excitability during MI is greater with PA than AP orientation. By using paired-pulse stimulations, we confirmed that short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) increased during MI in comparison to rest with PA orientation whereas we found that it decreased with AP orientation. Overall, these results indicate that the specific early I-waves generating pathway activated by PA orientation is probably more sensitive to the corticospinal excitability and intracortical inhibition modulations induced by MI.

                Zebrafish have an impressive capacity to regenerate neurons in the central nervous system. However, regeneration of the principal neuron of the evolutionary conserved cerebellum, the Purkinje cell (PC), is believed to be limited to developmental stages based on invasive lesions. In contrast, non-invasive cell type specific ablation by induced apoptosis closer represents processes of neurodegeneration. We demonstrate that the ablated larval PC population entirely recovers in number, quickly reestablishes electrophysiological properties and properly integrates into circuits to regulate cerebellum-controlled behavior. PC progenitors are present in larvae and adults, and PC ablation in adult cerebelli results in an impressive PC regeneration of different PC subtypes able to restore behavioral impairments. Interestingly, caudal PCs are more resistant to ablation and regenerate more efficiently, suggesting a rostro-caudal pattern of de- and regeneration properties. These findings demonstrate that the zebrafish cerebellum is able to regenerate functional PCs during all stages of the animal's life.

                Ribbon synapses of cochlear inner hair cells (IHCs) are specialized to indefatigably transmit sound information at high rates. To understand the underlying mechanisms, structure-function analysis of the active zone (AZ) of these synapses is essential. Previous electron microscopy studies of synaptic vesicle (SV) dynamics at the IHC AZ used potassium stimulation, which limited the temporal resolution to minutes. Here, we established optogenetic IHC stimulation followed by quick freezing within milliseconds and electron tomography to study the ultrastructure of functional synapse states with good temporal resolution. We characterized optogenetic IHC stimulation by patch-clamp recordings from IHCs and postsynaptic boutons revealing robust IHC depolarization and transmitter release. Ultrastructurally, the number of docked SVs increased and distances to the presynaptic density decreased upon short (17-25 ms) and long (48-76 ms) light stimulation paradigms. We did not observe enlarged SVs or other morphological correlates of homotypic fusion events. Our results suggest a rapid replenishment of docked SVs at IHC ribbon synapses and argue against synchronized multiquantal release under our experimental conditions.

                C/D box small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) comprise a class of small noncoding RNAs with important regulatory effects on cellular RNA function. Although it is well established that snoRNAs coordinate the post-transcriptional modification of pre-ribosomal and small nuclear RNAs by 2'-O-methylation, which leads to enhanced RNA stability, whether they are necessary for memory-related processes remains relatively unexplored. Using targeted sequencing, we have identified more than 150 C/D box snoRNAs in the prefrontal cortex of male C57BL/6J mice, 31 of which are differentially expressed in response to fear extinction learning. We have also discovered a subset of snoRNAs, including many orphans, that are enriched in the synaptic compartment, including the orphan snoRNA snord64. An extinction learning-induced increase in synapse-enriched snord64 led to increased 2'-O-methylation within the 3-UTR of the mRNA encoding the ubiquitin ligase RNF146. This effect was blocked by snord64 knockdown and was accompanied by attenuated forgetting of conditioned fear and the enhanced retrieval of fear extinction memory. Localized activity of orphan snoRNAs therefore represents a novel mechanism associated with fear-related learning and memory.

                The brains of all animals are plastic, allowing us to form new memories, adapt to new environments, and to learn new tasks. What is less clear is how much plasticity is required to perform these cognitive functions: does learning require widespread plasticity across the brain, or can learning occur with more rigid networks, in which plasticity is highly localized? Here, we use biologically-inspired recurrent neural network (RNN) models to show that rapid multitask learning can be accomplished with sparse and localized synaptic plasticity. Crucially, only RNNs with highly specific combinations of network properties, such as topology, normalization and reciprocal connection strength, are capable of such learning. Finally, we show that this rapid learning with localized plasticity can be accomplished with purely local error signals, without backpropagation, using a reinforcement learning setup. This work suggests that rapid learning in artificial, and potentially biological agents, can be accomplished with mostly-rigid networks, in which synaptic plasticity is highly constrained.

                Although visual input arrives continuously, sensory information is segmented into discrete events. Here, the neural correlates of spatiotemporal binding in male/female human subjects were investigated with MEG using two tasks where separate flashes were presented on each trial but were perceived, in a bi-stable way, as either a single, or two separate, events. The first task (two-flash fusion: TFF) involved judging one versus two flashes while in the second task (apparent motion: AM) participants judged coherent motion versus two stationary flashes. Results indicate two different functional networks underlying two unique aspects of visual temporal binding. In the TFF task, involving an integration window of ~50 ms, evoked responses differed as a function of perceptual interpretation by ~25 ms after stimuli offset. Multivariate decoding of subjective perception based on prestimulus oscillatory phase was significant for alpha-band activity in the right medial temporal (MT) area, with the strength of pre-stimulus connectivity between early visual areas and MT being predictive of performance. In contrast, the longer integration window (~130 ms) for AM showed evoked field differences only ~250 ms after stimuli offset. Phase decoding of the perceptual outcome in the AM task was strongest for theta-band activity, localized to a right intra-parietal sulcus (IPS) source. Pre-stimulus connectivity between MT and IPS seeds in the theta band best predicted perceptual outcome. Overall, these results show a strong relationship between specific spatiotemporal binding windows and specific oscillations, linked to the information flow between different areas of the "where" and "when" visual processing pathways.

                People solve insight problems that they encounter daily with a sudden sense of 'aha!' to reach a solution. Chunk decomposition, which decomposes the factors of the problem, and constraint relaxation, which manipulates filters to organize the information necessary to solve the problem, are important in insight problem-solving. Although there have been many studies on brain activity during chunk decomposition, few have examined brain activity during constraint relaxation. Particularly, no study has observed the changes over time due to constraint relaxation during insight problem-solving. This study used a slot machine task as an insight problem to measure brain activity using functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS), and eye movements to estimate constraint relaxation. The results showed that the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and right superior temporal gyrus (STG) were activated over time in participants in whom constraint relaxation was induced. The right inferior temporal gyrus (ITG) of participants who were able to solve the insight problem after constraint relaxation was also activated. The analysis of brain activity during constraint relaxation in insight problem-solving may be useful for advancing research on the 'aha!' phenomenon and creativity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Individual Differences in Audio-Visual Binding Can Predict the Varied Severity of Motion Sickness</a></h4>

              
                In neuroscience, research often focuses on the group, while ignoring large individual differences, which are left poorly understood. One such example is the large individual variability in the susceptibility to motion-sickness (MS), the feeling of sickness that typically occurs during travel or movement. Current explanations of MS focus on the sensory conflict in the perception of motion, primarily between the vestibular and the visual systems, e.g., when feeling motion but not seeing it. To account for the large individual differences in MS, we hypothesized that people feel motion sickness only when the conflicting stimuli are perceived as bound together, and their tendency to bind conflicting multi-sensory information is an individual trait. To test this hypothesis, we measured the persistence of audio-visual binding using the McGurk effect in which watching a moving mouth alters the auditory perception of phonemes. We used a temporal audio-visual mismatch to probe the persistence of binding and computed a temporal binding window for each individual (n=21) in 3 tasks: syllable Identification (McGurk), simultaneity judgement, and syllable synchronization judgement. To assess the severity of MS, we used 2 subjective symptom questionnaires. We found that the temporal binding window of the McGurk stimuli in two of the tasks varied across individuals and was positively correlated (R>0.8) with the MS questionnaire severity scores. These results support our hypothesis and shed new light on the enigmatic differences between individuals regarding their susceptibility to motion-sickness. They also highlight the potential strength of studies focusing on individual differences and neurological diversity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Quantifying dynamic facial expressions under naturalistic conditions</a></h4>

              
                Facial affect is expressed dynamically - a giggle, grimace, or an agitated frown. However, the characterization of human affect has relied almost exclusively on static images. This approach cannot capture the nuances of human communication or support the naturalistic assessment of affective disorders. Using the latest in machine vision and systems modelling, we studied dynamic facial expressions of people viewing emotionally salient film clips. We found that the apparent complexity of dynamic facial expressions can be captured by a small number of simple spatiotemporal states - composites of distinct facial actions, each expressed with a unique spectral fingerprint. Sequential expression of these states is common across individuals viewing the same film stimuli but varies in those with the melancholic subtype of major depressive disorder. This approach provides a platform for translational research, capturing dynamic facial expressions under naturalistic conditions and enabling new quantitative tools for the study of affective disorders and related mental illnesses.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Pupil size as a robust marker of attentional capture by nicotine-related stimuli in smokers</a></h4>

              
                Spatial attention can be magnetically attracted by behaviorally salient stimuli. This phenomenon occasionally conflicts with behavioral goals, leading to maladaptive consequences, as in the case of behavioral addictions, in which attentional capture has been often described and linked with clinically meaningful variables such as craving level or dependence intensity. Here, we sought to probe the markers of attentional priority in smokers through eye-tracking measures, by leveraging the established link between eye movements and spatial attention. We were interested, in particular, in potential markers related to pupil dilation, because pupil size reflects a range of autonomic, affective, and cognitive/attentional reactions to behaviorally significant stimuli and is a robust marker of appetitive and aversive learning. We found that, indeed, the pattern of pupil dilation and constriction to nicotine-related visual stimuli could reliably predict, in crossvalidated logistic regression, the smoking status of female and male smokers better than more traditional proxy measures based on response times or eye position. Pupil dilation was more sensitive at lower nicotine dependence levels, supporting previous claims that the incentive strength of conditioned stimuli gradually decreases and leaves space for a more automated, habit-driven processing mode. Additionally, it was more sensitive with increased abstinence time, suggesting that it may reflect craving levels. We conclude that pupillometry can provide a robust marker for attentional priority computation and provide useful indications regarding motivational states and the individual attitudes toward conditioned stimuli.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Application of rapid invisible frequency tagging for brain computer interfaces</a></h4>

              
                Background: Brain-computer interfaces (BCI) based on steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs/SSVEFs) are among the most commonly used BCI systems. They require participants to covertly attend to visual objects flickering at specified frequencies. The attended location is decoded in real-time by analysing the power of neuronal responses at the flicker frequency. New method: We implemented a novel rapid invisible frequency-tagging technique, utilizing a state-of-the-art projector with refresh rates of up to 1440 Hz. We flickered the luminance of visual objects at 56 and 60 Hz, which was invisible to participants but produced strong neuronal responses measurable with magnetoencephalography (MEG). The direction of covert attention, decoded from frequency-tagging responses, was used to control a real-time BCI PONG game. Results: Our results show that seven out of eight participants were able to play the pong game controlled by the frequency-tagging signal, with average accuracies exceeding 60%. Importantly, participants were able to modulate the power of the frequency-tagging response within a 1-second interval, while only seven occipital sensors were required to reliably decode the neuronal response. Comparison with existing methods: In contrast to existing SSVEP-based BCI systems, rapid frequency-tagging does not produce a visible flicker. This extends the time-period participants can use it without fatigue, by avoiding distracting visual input. Furthermore, higher frequencies increase the temporal resolution of decoding, resulting in higher communication rates. Conclusion: Using rapid invisible frequency-tagging opens new avenues for fundamental research and practical applications. In combination with novel optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs), it could facilitate the development of high-speed and mobile next-generation BCI systems.

                The axonal guidance cue netrin-1 serves a critical role in neural circuit development by promoting growth cone motility, axonal branching, and synaptogenesis. Within the adult mouse brain, expression of the gene encoding netrin-1 (Ntn1) is highly enriched in the ventral midbrain where it is expressed in both GABAergic and dopaminergic neurons, but its function in these cell types in the adult system remains largely unknown. To address this, we performed viral-mediated, cell-type specific CRISPR-Cas9 mutagenesis of Ntn1 in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) of adult mice. Ntn1 loss-of-function in either cell type resulted in a significant reduction in excitatory postsynaptic connectivity. In dopamine neurons, reduced excitatory tone had a minimal phenotypic behavioral outcome; however, reduced glutamatergic tone on VTA GABA neurons induced behaviors associated with a hyperdopaminergic phenotype. Loss of Ntn1 function in both cell types simultaneously largely rescued the phenotype observed in the GABA-only mutagenesis. These findings demonstrate an important role for netrin-1 in maintaining excitatory connectivity in the adult midbrain and that a balance in this connectivity within two of the major cell types of the VTA is critical for the proper functioning of the mesolimbic system.

                With the development of optical imaging systems, neuroscientists can now obtain large datasets of morphological structure at a single neuron scale positioned across the whole mouse brain. However, the enormous amount of morphological data challenges the classic approach of neuron classification, indexing, and other analysis tasks. This study proposes MorphoGNN, a single neuron morphological embedding based on the Graph Neural Networks (GNN). This method learns the spatial structure information between the nodes of reconstructed neuron fibers by its nearest neighbors on each layer. It captures the lower-dimensional representation of a single neuron through an end-to-end model. This model comprises densely connected edge convolution (EdgeConv) layers and a double pooling operator, regularized with joint cross-entropy loss and triplet loss. An increasing population of the neighbor nodes meets the need to learn more information with features expanding at the deep layer. We tested the proposed embeddings on the neuron classification and retrieval tasks. Our method achieves competitive performance both on the general point cloud dataset and the neuron morphology dataset.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A combinatorial code of neurexin-3 alternative splicing controls inhibitory synapses via a trans-synaptic dystroglycan signaling loop</a></h4>

              
                Disrupted synaptic inhibition is implicated in most psychiatric disorders, yet the molecular mechanisms that shape and sustain inhibitory synapses are poorly understood. Here, we find that the function of a subset of inhibitory synapses in brain is controlled by binding of presynaptic Neurexin-3 to postsynaptic dystroglycan, adhesion molecules that are associated with cognitive impairments. We found that Neurexin-3 alternative splicing at two sites, SS2 and SS4, acts as an AND/OR logic gate to regulate the release probability, but not the number, of inhibitory synapses in olfactory bulb and prefrontal cortex. The same SS2 and SS4 splice variants that enable inhibitory synapse function also allow binding of Neurexin-3 to dystroglycan. Inactivation of postsynaptic dystroglycan, in turn, produces a similar decrease in release probability as the presynaptic Neurexin-3 deletion. Furthermore, a minimal dystroglycan-binding construct of Neurexin-3 fully sustains inhibitory synaptic function, suggesting that trans-synaptic dystroglycan binding is not only necessary but also sufficient for inhibitory synapse function. Thus, Neurexin-3 enables a normal release probability at inhibitory synapses via a trans-synaptic feedback loop requiring binding of presynaptic Neurexin-3 to postsynaptic dystroglycan.

                Myelin is essential for rapid nerve impulse propagation and axon protection. Accordingly, defects in myelination or myelin maintenance lead to secondary axonal damage and subsequent degeneration. Studies utilizing genetic (CNPase-, MAG-, and PLP-null mice) and naturally occurring neuropathy models suggest that myelinating glia also support axons independently from myelin. Myelin protein zero (MPZ or P0), which is expressed only by Schwann cells, is critical for myelin formation and maintenance in the peripheral nervous system. Many mutations in MPZ are associated with demyelinating neuropathies (Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1B [CMT1B]). Surprisingly, the substitution of threonine by methionine at position 124 of P0 (P0T124M) causes axonal neuropathy (CMT2J) with little to no myelin damage. This disease provides an excellent paradigm to understand how myelinating glia support axons independently from myelin. To study this, we generated targeted knock-in P0T124M mutant mice, a genetically authentic model of T124M-CMT2J neuropathy. Similar to patients, these mice develop axonopathy between 2 and 12 months of age, characterized by impaired motor performance, normal nerve conduction velocities but reduced compound motor action potential amplitudes, and axonal damage with only minor compact myelin modifications. Mechanistically, we detected metabolic changes that could lead to axonal degeneration, and prominent alterations in non-compact myelin domains such as paranodes, Schmidt-Lanterman incisures, and gap junctions, implicated in Schwann cell-axon communication and axonal metabolic support. Finally, we document perturbed mitochondrial size and distribution along P0T124M axons suggesting altered axonal transport. Our data suggest that Schwann cells in P0T124M mutant mice cannot provide axons with sufficient trophic support, leading to reduced ATP biosynthesis and axonopathy. In conclusion, the P0T124M mouse model faithfully reproduces the human neuropathy and represents a unique tool for identifying the molecular basis for glial support of axons.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neuroinflammation plays a critical role in cerebral cavernous malformation disease</a></h4>

              
                Background: Cerebral Cavernous Malformations (CCMs) are neurovascular lesions caused by loss-of-function mutations in one of three genes, including KRIT1 (CCM1), CCM2, and PDCD10 (CCM3). CCMs affect ~1/200 children and adults, and no pharmacologic therapy is available. CCM lesion count, size, and aggressiveness vary widely among patients of similar ages with the same mutation or even within members of the same family. However, what determines the transition from quiescent lesions into mature and active (aggressive) CCM lesions is unknown. Methods: We use genetic, RNA-seq, histology, flow cytometry, and imaging techniques to report the interaction between CCM-endothelium, astrocytes, leukocytes, microglia/macrophages, neutrophils (CALMN interaction) during the pathogenesis of CCMs in the brain tissue. Results: Expression profile of astrocytes in adult mouse brains using translated mRNAs obtained from the purification of EGFP-tagged ribosomes (Aldh1l1-EGFP/Rpl10a) in the presence or absence of CCM lesions (Slco1c1-iCreERT2;Pdcd10fl/fl; Pdcd10BECKO) identifies a novel gene signature for neuroinflammatory astrogliosis. CCM reactive astrocytes have a neuroinflammatory capacity by expressing genes involved in angiogenesis, chemotaxis, hypoxia signaling, and inflammation. RNA-seq analysis on RNA isolated from brain endothelial cells (BECs) in chronic Pdcd10BECKO mice (CCM-endothelium), identified crucial genes involved in recruiting inflammatory cells and thrombus formation through chemotaxis and coagulation pathways. In addition, CCM-endothelium was associated with increased expression of Nlrp3 and Il1b. Pharmacological inhibition of NLRP3 significantly decreased inflammasome activity as assessed by quantification of a fluorescent indicator of caspase-1 activity (FAM-FLICA caspase-1) in BECs from Pdcd10BECKO in the chronic stage. Importantly, our results support the hypothesis of the crosstalk between astrocytes and CCM endothelium can trigger the recruitment of inflammatory cells arising from brain parenchyma (microglia) and the peripheral immune system (leukocytes) into mature active CCM lesions that propagate lesion growth, immunothrombosis, and bleedings. Unexpectedly, partial or total loss of brain endothelial NF-kB activity (using Ikkbfl/fl mice) in chronic Pdcd10BECKO mice does not prevent lesion genesis or neuroinflammation. Instead, this resulted in an elevated number of lesions and immunothrombosis, suggesting that therapeutic approaches designed to target inflammation through endothelial NF-kB inhibition may contribute to detrimental side effects. Conclusions: Our study reveals previously unknown links between neuroinflammatory astrocytes and inflamed CCM endothelium as contributors that trigger leukocyte recruitment and precipitate immunothrombosis in CCM lesions. However, therapeutic approaches targeting brain endothelial NF-kB activity may contribute to detrimental side effects.

                Brain communication, defined as information transmission through white-matter connections, is at the foundation of the brain's computational capacities that virtually subtend all aspects of behavior: from sensory perception shared across mammalian species, to complex cognitive functions in humans. How did communication strategies in macroscale brain networks adapted across evolution to accomplish increasingly complex functions? By applying a novel approach to measure information transmission in mouse, macaque and human brains, we found an evolutionary gradient from selective information processing, where brain regions share information through single polysynaptic pathways, to parallel information processing, where regions communicate through multiple parallel pathways. In humans, parallel processing acts as a major connector between unimodal and transmodal systems. Communication strategies are unique to individuals across different mammalian species, pointing at the individual-level specificity of information routing architecture. Our work provides compelling evidence that different communication strategies are tied to the evolutionary complexity of mammalian brain networks.

                Cajal-Retzius (CR) cells are a transient type of neuron that populate the postnatal hippocampus. The role of transient cell types and circuits have been vastly addressed in neocortical regions, but poorly studied in the hippocampus. To understand how CR cells persistence influences the maturation of hippocampal circuits, we specifically ablated CR cells from the postnatal hippocampus. Our results highlighted layer-specific effects on dendritic spines and synaptic-related genes and revealed a critical role of CR cells in the establishment of the hippocampal network.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The Role of Conjunctive Representations in Prioritizing and Selecting Planned Actions</a></h4>

              
                For flexible goal-directed behavior, prioritizing and selecting a specific action among multiple candidates is often important. Working memory has long been assumed to play a role in prioritization and planning, while bridging cross-temporal contingencies during action selection. However, studies of working memory have mostly focused on memory for single components of an action plan, such as a rule or a stimulus, rather than management of all of these elements during planning. Therefore, it is not known how post-encoding prioritization and selection operate on the entire profile of representations for prospective actions. Here, we assessed how such control processes unfold over action representations, highlighting the role of conjunctive representations that nonlinearly integrate task-relevant features during maintenance and prioritization of action plans. For each trial, participants prepared two independent rule- based actions simultaneously, then they were retro-cued to select one as their response. Prior to the start of the trial, one rule-based action was randomly assigned to be high priority by cueing that it was more likely to be tested. We found that both full action plans were maintained as conjunctive representations during action preparation, regardless of priority. However, during output selection, the conjunctive representation of the high priority action plan was more enhanced and readily selected as an output. Further, the strength of conjunctive representation was related to behavioral interference when the low priority action was tested. Thus, multiple integrated representations were maintained for upcoming actions and served as the target of post-encoding attentional selection mechanisms to prioritize and select an action from those in working memory.

	<p>Populations with a relatively low concentration of melanin, e.g., inhabitants of Europe, North America, and Australia, are the most vulnerable to the harmful effects of UV radiation. Individuals with fair phototype are at greatest risk of developing skin cancer. Several neurological studies present that light skin may modify the risk of Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s and Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s diseases. However, the relationship between migraine and skin pigmentation has not been investigated yet. The objective of this study is to provide evidence of the relationship between skin pigmentation and migraine prevalence in adults. We examined a group of 148 adults (33 men, 115 women) with migraine and a control group of 107 adults (43 men, 64 women). Parameters of skin pigmentation (melanin index, erythema index, CIElab, and RGB scales) were measured using a DSM II Cortex Technology dermospectrophotometer. Risk of migraine in lightly pigmented adults was elevated. Individuals with a low melanin index had over 3-fold increased risk of migraine (women: OR 3.53, men: OR 3.73). Fair phototype, which results from lightly pigmented skin, was associated with migraine prevalence. Migraineurs should take extra care to protect their skin from the negative effects of solar radiation.</p>

	<p>(1) Background: An increasing number of people are living with late-life depression, yet non-pharmacological treatments to help manage symptoms are limited. Two interventions, positive psychology and music therapeutic songwriting, have independently led to decreased depressive symptoms and an improved wellbeing in older people over 65 years old. (2) Methods: This article describes the development of a therapeutic songwriting program for people living with late-life depression. Knowledge from positive psychology and therapeutic songwriting was combined to maximize the potential benefits. (3) Results: The intervention program has ten weekly 45 min sessions that incorporate elements from positive psychology into therapeutic songwriting. Using a three-song approach encompassing ongoing musical practices, different positive psychology interventions were incorporated to support the experiences associated with a flourishing life. The intervention protocol for older people presented here is distinct from previous deficit-orientated approaches in that it shifts the focus to positive experiences, resources, and the individual&amp;amp;rsquo;s ability to decrease their own depressive symptoms and improve their wellbeing. (4) Discussion: This protocol presenting a therapeutic songwriting program meets the need to develop new non-pharmacological treatment options. However, further studies are needed to examine the feasibility and impact of the intervention program on late-life depression and wellbeing in older people.</p>

	<p>Brain tumours are the most common cause of death among children with solid tumours, and high-grade gliomas (HGG) are among the most devastating forms with very poor outcomes. In the search for more effective treatments for paediatric HGG, there is a need for better experimental models. To date, there are no xenograft zebrafish models developed for human paediatric HGG; existing models rely on adult cells. The use of paediatric models is of great importance since it is well known that the genetic and epigenetic mechanisms behind adult and paediatric disease differ greatly. In this study, we present a clinically relevant in vivo model based on paediatric primary glioma stem cell (GSC) cultures, which after orthotopic injection into the zebrafish larvae, can be monitored using confocal imaging over time. We show that cells invade the brain tissue and can be followed up to 8 days post-injection while they establish in the fore/mid brain. This model offers an in vivo system where tumour invasion can be monitored and drug treatments quickly be evaluated. The possibility to monitor patient-specific cells has the potential to contribute to a better understanding of cellular behaviour and personalised treatments in the future.</p>

	<p>Conditioned pain modulation (CPM) describes the decrease in pain perception of a test stimulus (TS) when presented together with a heterotopic painful conditioning stimulus (CS). Inter-individual differences in CPM are large and have been suggested to reflect differences in endogenous pain modulation. In a previous analysis, we demonstrated that in young, healthy participants, inter-individual differences account for about one-third of CPM variance, with age and sex together explaining only 1%. Here, we investigated if psychological factors explain significant amounts of inter-individual variance in CPM. Using the same dataset as before, we performed both cross-sectional (n = 126) and repeated measures (n = 52, 118 observations) analysis and the corresponding variance decompositions, using results of psychological questionnaires assessing depression, trait anxiety and pain catastrophizing. Psychological factors did not significantly predict CPM magnitude, neither directly nor when interactions with the CPM paradigm were assessed; however, the interaction between depression and the paradigm approached significance. Variance decomposition showed that the interaction between depression and the CPM paradigm explained an appreciable amount of variance (3.0%), but this proportion seems small when compared to the residual inter-individual differences (35.4%). The main effects of the psychological factors and the interactions of anxiety or catastrophizing with the CPM paradigm are explained at &amp;amp;lt;0.1% each. These results show that the contribution of psychological factors to inter-individual CPM differences in healthy participants is limited and that the large inter-individual variability in the CPM effect remains largely unexplained.</p>

	<p>Musical interventions in therapy have become increasingly relevant for rehabilitation in many clinics. What was long known for physiotherapy training&amp;amp;mdash;that the agency of the participant is crucial and moving is much more efficient for rehabilitation success than being moved&amp;amp;mdash;has over recent years also been shown to be true for music therapy. Accumulating evidence suggests that active musical interventions are especially efficient at helping rehabilitation success. Here, we review various approaches to active music therapy. Furthermore, we present several components that allow for manipulating musical expressiveness and physical engagement during active musical interventions, applying a technology-based music feedback paradigm. This paper will allow for a transfer of insights to other domains of music-based therapeutic interventions.</p>

	<p>Involvement of the dopaminergic (DA) and hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) systems in suicidal behavior is still poorly understood. We assessed multihormonal responses to apomorphine (APO; a short acting DA receptor agonist) and 8 AM and 11 PM protirelin (TRH) tests in 30 medication-free DSM-5 euthyroid major depressed inpatients with suicidal behavior disorder (SBD) (current, n = 14; in early remission, n = 16) and 18 healthy hospitalized control subjects (HCs). Compared to HCs, responses to APO and TRH tests were unaltered in SBDs in early remission. However, current SBDs exhibited increased APO-induced growth hormone (GH) and adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) stimulation, and reduced 11 PM thyrotropin (TSH) and &amp;amp;#8710;&amp;amp;#8710;TSH values (difference between 11 PM and 8 AM TRH-TSH responses). In current SBDs, the association between high APO-GH concentrations and low &amp;amp;#8710;&amp;amp;#8710;TSH values was more common in recent suicide attempters than in past suicide attempters. These preliminary results suggest that co-occurring alterations in the DA and HPT systems (i.e., DA receptor hyperresponsiveness associated with decreased hypothalamic TRH drive) may contribute to the pathophysiology of suicidal behavior. Conversely, normalization of DA and TRH functions might reflect a process of recovery from suicidality. Thus, our findings suggest that drugs targeting the DAergic and TRH systems could be relevant in suicide prevention.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Type 3 vesicular glutamate transporter (VGLUT3) represents a unique modulator of glutamate release from both nonglutamatergic and glutamatergic varicosities within the brain. Despite its limited abundance, VGLUT3 is vital for the regulation of glutamate signaling and, therefore, modulates the activity of various brain microcircuits. However, little is known about how glutamate receptors are regulated by VGLUT3 across different brain regions. Here, we used VGLUT3 constitutive knock-out (VGLUT3<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup>) mice and explored how VGLUT3 deletion influences total and cell surface expression of different ionotropic and metabotropic glutamate receptors. VGLUT3 deletion upregulated the overall expression of metabotropic glutamate receptors mGluR5 and mGluR2/3 in the cerebral cortex. In contrast, no change in the total expression of ionotropic NMDAR glutamate receptors were observed in the cerebral cortex of VGLUT3<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> mice. We noted significant reduction in cell surface levels of mGluR5, NMDAR2A, NMDAR2B, as well as reductions in dopaminergic D<SUB>1</SUB> receptors and muscarinic M1 acetylcholine receptors in the hippocampus of VGLUT3<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> mice. Furthermore, mGluR2/3 total expression and mGluR5 cell surface levels were elevated in the striatum of VGLUT3<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> mice. Last, AMPAR subunit GluA1 was significantly upregulated throughout cortical, hippocampal, and striatal brain regions of VGLUT3<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> mice. Together, these findings complement and further support the evidence that VGLUT3 dynamically regulates glutamate receptor densities in several brain regions. These results suggest that VGLUT3 may play an intricate role in shaping glutamatergic signaling and plasticity in several brain areas.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Conditions for Synaptic Specificity during the Maintenance Phase of Synaptic Plasticity</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Activity-dependent modifications of synaptic efficacies are a cellular substrate of learning and memory. Experimental evidence shows that these modifications are synapse specific and that the long-lasting effects are associated with the sustained increase in concentration of specific proteins like PKM<I></I>. However, such proteins are likely to diffuse away from their initial synaptic location and spread out to neighboring synapses, potentially compromising synapse specificity. In this article, we address the issue of synapse specificity during memory maintenance. Assuming that the long-term maintenance of synaptic plasticity is accomplished by a molecular switch, we carry out analytical calculations and perform simulations using the reaction-diffusion package in NEURON to determine the limits of synapse specificity during maintenance. Moreover, we explore the effects of the diffusion and degradation rates of proteins and of the geometrical characteristics of dendritic spines on synapse specificity. We conclude that the necessary conditions for synaptic specificity during maintenance require that molecular switches reside in dendritic spines. The requirement for synaptic specificity when the molecular switch resides in spines still imposes strong limits on the diffusion and turnover of rates of maintenance molecules, as well as on the morphologic properties of synaptic spines. These constraints are quite general and apply to most existing models suggested for maintenance. The parameter values can be experimentally evaluated, and if they do not fit the appropriate predicted range, the validity of this class of maintenance models would be challenged.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Multimodal, Multiscale Insights into Hippocampal Seizures Enabled by Transparent, Graphene-Based Microelectrode Arrays</a></h4>

              
                <p>Hippocampal seizures are a defining feature of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE). Area CA1 of the hippocampus is commonly implicated in the generation of seizures, which may occur because of the activity of endogenous cell populations or of inputs from other regions within the hippocampal formation. Simultaneously observing activity at the cellular and network scales <I>in vivo</I> remains challenging. Here, we present a novel technology for simultaneous electrophysiology and multicellular calcium imaging of CA1 pyramidal cells (PCs) in mice enabled by a transparent graphene-based microelectrode array (Gr MEA). We examine PC firing at seizure onset, oscillatory coupling, and the dynamics of the seizure traveling wave as seizures evolve. Finally, we couple features derived from both modalities to predict the speed of the traveling wave using bootstrap aggregated regression trees. Analysis of the most important features in the regression trees suggests a transition among states in the evolution of hippocampal seizures.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">A generalized Flory-Stockmayer kinetic theory of connectivity percolation and rigidity percolation of cytoskeletal networks</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Carlos Bueno, James Liman, Nicholas P. Schafer, Margaret S. Cheung, Peter G. Wolynes</p>

Actin networks are essential for living cells to move, reproduce, and sense their environments. The dynamic and rheological behavior of actin networks is modulated by actin-binding proteins such as α-actinin, Arp2/3, and myosin. There is experimental evidence that actin-binding proteins modulate the cooperation of myosin motors by connecting the actin network. In this work, we present an analytical mean field model, using the Flory-Stockmayer theory of gelation, to understand how different actin-binding proteins change the connectivity of the actin filaments as the networks are formed. We follow the kinetics of the networks and estimate the concentrations of actin-binding proteins that are needed to reach connectivity percolation as well as to reach rigidity percolation. We find that Arp2/3 increases the actomyosin connectivity in the network in a non-monotonic way. We also describe how changing the connectivity of actomyosin networks modulates the ability of motors to exert forces, leading to three possible phases of the networks with distinctive dynamical characteristics: a sol phase, a gel phase, and an active phase. Thus, changes in the concentration and activity of actin-binding proteins in cells lead to a phase transition of the actin network, allowing the cells to perform active contraction and change their rheological properties.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Modelling the acclimation capacity of coral reefs to a warming ocean</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Nomenjanahary Alexia Raharinirina, Esteban Acevedo-Trejos, Agostino Merico</p>

The symbiotic relationship between corals and photosynthetic algae is the foundation of coral reef ecosystems. This relationship breaks down, leading to coral death, when sea temperature exceeds the thermal tolerance of the coral-algae complex. While acclimation via phenotypic plasticity at the organismal level is an important mechanism for corals to cope with global warming, community-based shifts in response to acclimating capacities may give valuable indications about the future of corals at a regional scale. Reliable regional-scale predictions, however, are hampered by uncertainties on the speed with which coral communities will be able to acclimate. Here we present a trait-based, acclimation dynamics model, which we use in combination with observational data, to provide a first, crude estimate of the speed of coral acclimation at the community level and to investigate the effects of different global warming scenarios on three iconic reef ecosystems of the tropics: Great Barrier Reef, South East Asia, and Caribbean. The model predicts that coral acclimation may confer some level of protection by delaying the decline of some reefs such as the Great Barrier Reef. However, the current rates of acclimation will not be sufficient to rescue corals from global warming. Based on our estimates of coral acclimation capacities, the model results suggest substantial declines in coral abundances in all three regions, ranging from 12% to 55%, depending on the region and on the climate change scenario considered. Our results highlight the importance and urgency of precise assessments and quantitative estimates, for example through laboratory experiments, of the natural acclimation capacity of corals and of the speed with which corals may be able to acclimate to global warming.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Noradrenergic deficits contribute to apathy in Parkinson’s disease through the precision of expected outcomes</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Frank H. Hezemans, Noham Wolpe, Claire O’Callaghan, Rong Ye, Catarina Rua, P. Simon Jones, Alexander G. Murley, Negin Holland, Ralf Regenthal, Kamen A. Tsvetanov, Roger A. Barker, Caroline H. Williams-Gray, Trevor W. Robbins, Luca Passamonti, James B. Rowe</p>

Apathy is a debilitating feature of many neuropsychiatric diseases, that is typically described as a reduction of goal-directed behaviour. Despite its prevalence and prognostic importance, the mechanisms underlying apathy remain controversial. Degeneration of the locus coeruleus-noradrenaline system is known to contribute to motivational deficits, including apathy. In healthy people, noradrenaline has been implicated in signalling the uncertainty of expectations about the environment. We proposed that noradrenergic deficits contribute to apathy by modulating the relative weighting of prior beliefs about action outcomes. We tested this hypothesis in the clinical context of Parkinson’s disease, given its associations with apathy and noradrenergic dysfunction. Participants with mild-to-moderate Parkinson’s disease (<i>N</i> = 17) completed a randomised double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study with 40 mg of the noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor atomoxetine. Prior weighting was inferred from psychophysical analysis of performance in an effort-based visuomotor task, and was confirmed as negatively correlated with apathy. Locus coeruleus integrity was assessed <i>in vivo</i> using magnetisation transfer imaging at ultra-high field 7T. The effect of atomoxetine depended on locus coeruleus integrity: participants with a more degenerate locus coeruleus showed a greater increase in prior weighting on atomoxetine <i>versus</i> placebo. The results indicate a contribution of the noradrenergic system to apathy and potential benefit from noradrenergic treatment of people with Parkinson’s disease, subject to stratification according to locus coeruleus integrity. More broadly, these results reconcile emerging predictive processing accounts of the role of noradrenaline in goal-directed behaviour with the clinical symptom of apathy and its potential pharmacological treatment.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Multiscale modeling of presynaptic dynamics from molecular to mesoscale</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jonathan W. Garcia, Thomas M. Bartol, Terrence J. Sejnowski</p>

Chemical synapses exhibit a diverse array of internal mechanisms that affect the dynamics of transmission efficacy. Many of these processes, such as release of neurotransmitter and vesicle recycling, depend strongly on activity-dependent influx and accumulation of Ca<sup>2+</sup>. To model how each of these processes may affect the processing of information in neural circuits, and how their dysfunction may lead to disease states, requires a computationally efficient modelling framework, capable of generating accurate phenomenology without incurring a heavy computational cost per synapse. Constructing a phenomenologically realistic model requires the precise characterization of the timing and probability of neurotransmitter release. Difficulties arise in that functional forms of instantaneous release rate can be difficult to extract from noisy data without running many thousands of trials, and in biophysical synapses, facilitation of per-vesicle release probability is confounded by depletion. To overcome this, we obtained traces of free Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration in response to various action potential stimulus trains from a molecular MCell model of a hippocampal Schaffer collateral axon. Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensors were placed at varying distance from a voltage-dependent calcium channel (VDCC) cluster, and Ca<sup>2+</sup> was buffered by calbindin. Then, using the calcium traces to drive deterministic state vector models of synaptotagmin 1 and 7 (Syt-1/7), which respectively mediate synchronous and asynchronous release in excitatory hippocampal synapses, we obtained high-resolution profiles of instantaneous release rate, to which we applied functional fits. Synchronous vesicle release occurred predominantly within half a micron of the source of spike-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, while asynchronous release occurred more consistently at all distances. Both fast and slow mechanisms exhibited multi-exponential release rate curves, whose magnitudes decayed exponentially with distance from the Ca<sup>2+</sup> source. Profile parameters facilitate on different time scales according to a single, general facilitation function. These functional descriptions lay the groundwork for efficient mesoscale modelling of vesicular release dynamics.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Role of non-specific interactions in the phase-separation and maturation of macromolecules</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Rakesh Krishnan, Srivastav Ranganathan, Samir K. Maji, Ranjith Padinhateeri</p>

Phase separation of biomolecules could be mediated by both specific and non-specific interactions. How the interplay between non-specific and specific interactions along with polymer entropy influences phase separation is an open question. We address this question by simulating self-associating molecules as polymer chains with a short core stretch that forms the specifically interacting functional interface and longer non-core regions that participate in non-specific/promiscuous interactions. Our results show that the interplay of specific (strength, <i>ϵ</i><sub>sp</sub>) and non-specific interactions (strength, <i>ϵ</i><sub>ns</sub>) could result in phase separation of polymers and its transition to solid-like aggregates (mature state). In the absence of <i>ϵ</i><sub>ns</sub>, the polymer chains do not dwell long enough in the vicinity of each other to undergo phase separation and transition into a mature state. On the other hand, in the limit of strong <i>ϵ</i><sub>ns</sub>, the assemblies cannot transition into the mature state and form a non-specific assembly, suggesting an optimal range of interactions favoring mature multimers. In the scenario where only a fraction (N<sub>frac</sub>) of the non-core regions participate in attractive interactions, we find that slight modifications to either <i>ϵ</i><sub>ns</sub> or N<sub>frac</sub> can result in dramatically altered self-assembled states. Using a combination of heterogeneous and homogeneous mix of polymers, we establish how this interplay between interaction energies dictates the propensity of biomolecules to find the correct binding partner at dilute concentrations in crowded environments.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Influence of confinement on the spreading of bacterial populations</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Daniel B. Amchin, Jenna A. Ott, Tapomoy Bhattacharjee, Sujit S. Datta</p>

The spreading of bacterial populations is central to processes in agriculture, the environment, and medicine. However, existing models of spreading typically focus on cells in unconfined settings—despite the fact that many bacteria inhabit complex and crowded environments, such as soils, sediments, and biological tissues/gels, in which solid obstacles confine the cells and thereby strongly regulate population spreading. Here, we develop an extended version of the classic Keller-Segel model of bacterial spreading via motility that also incorporates cellular growth and division, and explicitly considers the influence of confinement in promoting both cell-solid and cell-cell collisions. Numerical simulations of this extended model demonstrate how confinement fundamentally alters the dynamics and morphology of spreading bacterial populations, in good agreement with recent experimental results. In particular, with increasing confinement, we find that cell-cell collisions increasingly hinder the initial formation and the long-time propagation speed of chemotactic pulses. Moreover, also with increasing confinement, we find that cellular growth and division plays an increasingly dominant role in driving population spreading—eventually leading to a transition from chemotactic spreading to growth-driven spreading via a slower, jammed front. This work thus provides a theoretical foundation for further investigations of the influence of confinement on bacterial spreading. More broadly, these results help to provide a framework to predict and control the dynamics of bacterial populations in complex and crowded environments.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">A randomization-based causal inference framework for uncovering environmental exposure effects on human gut microbiota</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Alice J. Sommer, Annette Peters, Martina Rommel, Josef Cyrys, Harald Grallert, Dirk Haller, Christian L. Müller, Marie-Abèle C. Bind</p>

Statistical analysis of microbial genomic data within epidemiological cohort studies holds the promise to assess the influence of environmental exposures on both the host and the host-associated microbiome. However, the observational character of prospective cohort data and the intricate characteristics of microbiome data make it challenging to discover causal associations between environment and microbiome. Here, we introduce a causal inference framework based on the Rubin Causal Model that can help scientists to investigate such environment-host microbiome relationships, to capitalize on existing, possibly powerful, test statistics, and test plausible sharp null hypotheses. Using data from the German KORA cohort study, we illustrate our framework by designing two hypothetical randomized experiments with interventions of (i) air pollution reduction and (ii) smoking prevention. We study the effects of these interventions on the human gut microbiome by testing shifts in microbial diversity, changes in individual microbial abundances, and microbial network wiring between groups of matched subjects via randomization-based inference. In the smoking prevention scenario, we identify a small interconnected group of taxa worth further scrutiny, including <i>Christensenellaceae</i> and <i>Ruminococcaceae</i> genera, that have been previously associated with blood metabolite changes. These findings demonstrate that our framework may uncover potentially causal links between environmental exposure and the gut microbiome from observational data. We anticipate the present statistical framework to be a good starting point for further discoveries on the role of the gut microbiome in environmental health.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Effect of Antigravity Treadmill Training on Gait and Balance in Patients with Diabetic Polyneuropathy: A Randomized Controlled Trial [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Diabetic polyneuropathy (DPN) is the most prevalent consequence of diabetes mellitus, and it has a significant impact on the patient's health. This study aims to evaluate effects of antigravity treadmill training on gait and balance in patients with DPN. Methods: The study included 45 males with type 2 diabetes who were randomly assigned to one of two groups: the experimental group (n=23) or the control group (n=22). For a period of 12 weeks, the experimental group received antigravity treadmill training (75% weight bearing, 30 min per session, three times per week) combined with traditional physical therapy. During the same time period, the control group received only traditional physical therapy. The Biodex Balance System was used to assess postural stability indices, while the GAITRite Walkway System was used to assess spatiotemporal gait parameters. All measurements were obtained before and at the end of the study after 12 weeks of treatment. Results: The mean values of all measured variables improved significantly in both groups (P<0.05), with the experimental group showing significantly greater improvements than the control group. The post-treatment gait parameters (i.e., step length, step time, double support time, velocity, and cadence) were 61.3 cm, 0.49 sec, 0.25 sec, 83.09 cm/sec, and 99.78 steps/min as well as 56.14 cm, 0.55 sec, 0.29 sec, 75.73 cm/sec, and 88.14 steps/min for the experimental and control group, respectively. The post-treatment overall stability index was 0.32 and 0.70 for the experimental and control group, respectively. Conclusions: Antigravity treadmill training in combination with traditional physical therapy appears to be superior to traditional physical therapy alone in terms of gait and balance training. As a result, the antigravity treadmill has been found to be an effective device for the rehabilitation of DPN patients.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Analysis of contact tracing surveillance for COVID-19 among healthcare workers in secondary referral hospital, Indonesia [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Healthcare workers (HCWs) are more vulnerable to COVID-19 infection. Tracing and screening cases among healthcare workers are essential to overcome the spread of COVID-19. We held surveillance at the second-referral hospital in Surabaya, Indonesia, to inspect the associating factors of infected HCWs. Methods: From 776 HCWs, we conducted a structured retrospective review of all COVID-19-confirmed HCWs and ones having contact with COVID-19 patients between February-July 2021. We associated general characteristics (i.e age, gender, working sites, etc) of the sample with the positive cases, analyzed the vaccination status, then did bivariate and multivariate regression logistic analyses to determine related factors putting HCWs at risk for COVID-19 infection.   Results: Bivariate analysis significantly revealed that 72.86% patients had a close contact (OR = 2.61; p<0.05), with medical staffs as the most frequent source (85.71%; OR = 2.19; p=0.033), for > 15 minutes contact duration (90%; OR = 1.1; p<0.05). Healthcare workers wearing proper PPE (N-95 and face shields) were significantly less exposed to COVID-19 (OR = 0.47; p<0.05; and OR = 0.46; p<0.05). Even fully-vaccinated samples were still prone to infection. (OR=1.25; p= 0.042). Common symptoms consisted of fever, rhinorrhea, sore throat, and vomiting (p=0.025l p=0.002; p<0.05; p=0.002). Multivariate regression logistic analysis disclosed that the use of N95 masks, contact duration >15 minutes, and the vaccine were the most influential factors (aOR = 1.72. 95% CI (1.029-2.88); aOR = 3.92. 95% CI (1.75-8.78); aOR = 0.39. 95% CI (0.13-0.82 )) Conclusions: Close contact, lack of compliance in wearing N95 masks, and unvaccinated status are risk factors for COVID-19 exposure to HCWs; thus, to achieve maximum prevention of intra-hospital transmission, the use of N-95 masks, contact avoidance, and vaccination, along with immediate tracing and strict health-protocols are all compulsory.

                Background: Prosthetic restorations are made to adapt or attach missing human parts in order to restore function and appearance. Maxillofacial defects connote a greater impact on patients, since the face cannot be concealed, and all the senses of the human body are expressed in it. Therefore, in order to restore the patient’s quality of life, they are the ones that require the best possible adaptation to the characteristics of the patients. Methods: For the maxillofacial prostheses to fit patients, they must be personalized for each patient. The NGO “Mais Identidade” is a multidisciplinary team that specializes in the rehabilitation of patients with maxillofacial trauma. They use digital manufacturing as a tool to manufacture personalized maxillofacial prostheses for patients. With the help of the NGO, the following research is conducted with the purpose of evaluating different methods of additive manufacturing, 3D printing, in order to select the equipment that suits the needs of the method used in the manufacture of maxillofacial prostheses. To this end, eyelid models will be manufactured in different additive manufacturing equipment, and these will be evaluated according to their economic, physical, and aesthetic characteristics.

                Background: Cisplatin (CP) is one of the chemotherapeutic drugs widely utilized in the treatment of several malignancies. However, recently; its use has been limited because of its hazardous health drawbacks. Previous researches confirmed that CP has severe deleterious side effects on pregnant mothers and their fetuses. Garlic (Allium sativum) extract has been claimed to exhibit potent antioxidative and free radical scavenging abilities. Aim: This work is mainly designed to evaluate the potential therapeutic role of garlic extract against CP-induced nephrotoxicity in pregnant rats and their offspring. Methods: 24 pregnant rats were used in the current study. They were randomly allocated into four groups (n=6):  control, garlic, CP, and CP + garlic group. At the end of the weaning period, the mothers and the offsprings of all groups were sacrificed, the kidneys were immediately excised, and processed for histological and biochemical investigations. Also, blood samples were withdrawn and processed for estimation of the assigned biochemical parameters.   Results: The renal histological sections from CP-treated mother rats displayed pronounced histopathological lesions however, their offspring showed mild renal histopathological lesions if compared with those of their mothers. The levels of renal tissue Superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase enzymes were significantly decreased. On the contrary, the levels of malondialdehyde, serum urea, and creatinine were significantly increased in CP-treated mother rats and their offspring as compared with control. The percentage value of caspase 3 activity was markedly elevated in the renal tissues of CP-treated mother rats and their offspring compared to the control group. Supplementation of garlic extract to the CP treated rats; the overall histological lesions, as well as biochemical parameters, were restored nearly to the control ones. It is concluded that garlic (Allium sativum) extract has a powerful ameliorative role against CP-induced nephrotoxicity in pregnant rats and their offspring.

                Background: Sexual dysfunction is common among patients with mental disorders but receives less clinical attention, especially in Thailand and other Asian countries. The Arizona Sexual Experiences Scale-the Thai Translation (ASEX-Thai), a self-rated, brief, questionnaire is a potential tool for screening for sexual dysfunction in this population. Our study aimed to assess the reliability and validity of ASEX-Thai in Thai patients with mental disorders. Methods: We enrolled 202 patients from an outpatient psychiatric department at a tertiary hospital in Bangkok, Thailand. Demographic data, clinical data, and diagnosis of sexual dysfunction were assessed. ASEX-Thai was done, and we analyzed the test’s psychometric properties.  Results: Most participants were diagnosed with major depressive disorder (48%). A score of ≥ 17 points of the ASEX-Thai was the most suitable for sexual dysfunction screening (sensitivity 77.23 %, and specificity 58.42 %). For reliability, the Cronbach’s alpha coefficient (0.831) showed good internal consistency. Conclusions: The ASEX-Thai is a valid and reliable self-rated questionnaire for screening for sexual dysfunction among Thai patients with mental disorders. The test could help clinicians to evaluate this undetected condition and deliver proper interventions.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">ASEAN and the Frankenstein dilemma: Will ASEAN become a monster? [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: International organizations are pivotal as actors in international relations. Although its establishment represents a state, they have their objectives separate from their creators. The Association of Southeast Asian Nations [ASEAN] was created to handle cooperation and maintain peace and security in Southeast Asia. Although ASEAN was equipped with institutional organs to fulfil its purposes, member states' influence is unavoidable. This situation raises the Frankenstein dilemma in which creators cannot fully control its creature. This research aims to elaborate on ASEAN as a separate institution with independent objectives and how far member states can manage ASEAN as its creation. Methods: This study uses descriptive-analytical legal research as a method to examine ASEAN constitutional instruments and its first legal text to elaborate on its capacity as a legal person and its role in distinguishing interests between member states. The two ASEAN constitutional instruments are the Bangkok Declaration, 1967, and The ASEAN Charter, 2007, while the first legal instrument is the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation. All of the resources were gathered from ASEAN legal instruments database.  Results: After carefully examining the documents, since its establishment ASEAN has kept member states at arms-length to realize their interests; the ASEAN position is only to legalize what its member state wants. Even after 40 years, this situation has not changed. While ASEAN has independent objectives and structures, its member states always made institutional designs to control ASEAN's capacity to act in the international forum. In this case, ASEAN is always under the authority of its member states and has never evolved like Frankenstein's creature. Conclusions: ASEAN will never turn into a monster as ASEAN never has sole interests that contradict its members. ASEAN member states always design ASEAN constitutional and legal instruments to restrict its role as an independent legal person in international forums.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The structures of neurons, such as dendrites and axonal projections, are closely related to their response properties and their specific functions in neural circuits. Identified neurons, having genetically determined morphological features and pre- and postsynaptic partners, play significant roles in specific behaviors. Giant interneurons (GIs) are identified in the terminal abdominal ganglion of the cricket as mechanosensory projection neurons and are sensitive to airflow stimulation of the cerci. GIs are classified into ventral GIs (vGIs) or dorsal GIs (dGIs) depending on the location of their axons running within the connective nerve cord. Based on their response properties to airflow, vGIs are presumed to be involved in triggering the wind-elicited escape response, whereas dGIs are thought to be airflow direction-encoding neurons. The previous findings regarding airflow sensitivity point to possible differences in the morphology of the central projections that may correspond to their neural functions. However, the detailed morphologies of the GIs in the cephalic and thoracic ganglia of adult crickets remain unclear. In this study, we stained six GIs, namely, GI 8-1 (medial giant interneuron, MGI), 9-1 (lateral giant interneuron, LGI), 9-2, 9-3, 10-2, and 10-3, using intracellular iontophoretic or pressure injection of dyes. Staining revealed remarkable differences in the axonal branching patterns between vGIs and dGIs. The dGIs were further divided into subgroups based on the profiles of their axon collaterals and projection sites in the brain. The anatomical differences between the GIs’ central projections seemed to be related to their information encodement and behavioral functions.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/inpress.rss">Neurofeedback through the lens of reinforcement learning</a></h4>

              
                Despite decades of experimental and clinical practice, the neuropsychological mechanisms underlying neurofeedback (NF) training remain obscure. NF is a unique form of reinforcement learning (RL) task, during which participants are provided with rewarding feedback regarding desired changes in neural patterns. However, key RL considerations – including choices during practice, prediction errors, credit-assignment problems, or the exploration–exploitation tradeoff – have infrequently been considered in the context of NF.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Complex fitness landscape shapes variation in a hyperpolymorphic species</a></h4>

              
                It is natural to assume that patterns of genetic variation in hyperpolymorphic species can reveal large-scale properties of the fitness landscape that are hard to detect by studying species with ordinary levels of genetic variation. Here, we study such patterns in a fungus <i>Schizophyllum commune</i>, the most polymorphic species known. Throughout the genome, short-range linkage disequilibrium (LD) caused by attraction of minor alleles is higher between pairs of nonsynonymous than of synonymous variants. This effect is especially pronounced for pairs of sites that are located within the same gene, especially if a large fraction of the gene is covered by haploblocks, genome segments where the gene pool consists of two highly divergent haplotypes, which is a signature of balancing selection. Haploblocks are usually shorter than 1000 nucleotides, and collectively cover about 10% of the <i>S. commune</i> genome. LD tends to be substantially higher for pairs of nonsynonymous variants encoding amino acids that interact within the protein. There is a substantial correlation between LDs at the same pairs of nonsynonymous mutations in the USA and the Russian populations. These patterns indicate that selection in <i>S. commune</i> involves positive epistasis due to compensatory interactions between nonsynonymous alleles. When less polymorphic species are studied, analogous patterns can be detected only through interspecific comparisons.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Human visual gamma for color stimuli</a></h4>

              
                Strong gamma-band oscillations in primate early visual cortex can be induced by homogeneous color surfaces (Peter et al., 2019; Shirhatti and Ray, 2018). Compared to other hues, particularly strong gamma oscillations have been reported for red stimuli. However, precortical color processing and the resultant strength of input to V1 has often not been fully controlled for. Therefore, stronger responses to red might be due to differences in V1 input strength. We presented stimuli that had equal luminance and cone contrast levels in a color coordinate system based on responses of the lateral geniculate nucleus, the main input source for area V1. With these stimuli, we recorded magnetoencephalography in 30 human participants. We found gamma oscillations in early visual cortex which, contrary to previous reports, did not differ between red and green stimuli of equal L-M cone contrast. Notably, blue stimuli with contrast exclusively on the S‑cone axis induced very weak gamma responses, as well as smaller event-related fields and poorer change-detection performance. The strength of human color gamma responses for stimuli on the L-M axis could be well explained by L-M cone contrast and did not show a clear red bias when L-M cone contrast was properly equalized.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A novel lineage-tracing mouse model for studying early MmuPV1 infections</a></h4>

              
                Human papillomaviruses are DNA viruses that ubiquitously infect humans and have been associated with hyperproliferative lesions. The recently discovered mouse specific papillomavirus (MmuPV1) provides the opportunity to study papillomavirus infections in vivo in the context of a common laboratory mouse model (<i>Mus musculus</i>). To date, a major challenge in the field has been the lack of tools to identify, observe, and characterize individually the papillomavirus hosting cells and also trace the progeny of these cells over time. Here, we present the successful generation of an in vivo lineage-tracing model of MmuPV1-harboring cells and their progeny by means of genetic reporter activation. Following the validation of the system both in vitro and in vivo, we used it to provide a proof-of-concept of its utility. Using flow-cytometry analysis, we observed increased proliferation dynamics and decreased MHC-I cell surface expression in MmuPV1-treated tissues which could have implications in tissue regenerative capacity and ability to clear the virus. This model is a novel tool to study the biology of the MmuPV1 host-pathogen interactions.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">MDGAs are fast-diffusing molecules that delay excitatory synapse development by altering neuroligin behavior</a></h4>

              
                MDGA molecules can bind neuroligins and interfere with trans-synaptic interactions to neurexins, thereby impairing synapse development. However, the subcellular localization and dynamics of MDGAs, or their specific action mode in neurons remain unclear. Here, surface immunostaining of endogenous MDGAs and single molecule tracking of recombinant MDGAs in dissociated hippocampal neurons reveal that MDGAs are homogeneously distributed and exhibit fast membrane diffusion, with a small reduction in mobility across neuronal maturation. Knocking-down/out MDGAs using shRNAs and CRISPR/Cas9 strategies increases the density of excitatory synapses, the membrane confinement of neuroligin-1, and the phosphotyrosine level of neuroligins associated with excitatory post-synaptic differentiation. Finally, MDGA silencing reduces the mobility of AMPA receptors, increases the frequency of miniature EPSCs (but not IPSCs), and selectively enhances evoked AMPA-receptor-mediated EPSCs in CA1 pyramidal neurons. Overall, our results support a mechanism by which interactions between MDGAs and neuroligin-1 delays the assembly of functional excitatory synapses containing AMPA receptors.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Proximal CA1 20-40 Hz power dynamics reflect trial-specific information processing supporting nonspatial sequence memory</a></h4>

              
                The hippocampus is known to play a critical role in processing information about temporal context. However, it remains unclear how hippocampal oscillations are involved, and how their functional organization is influenced by connectivity gradients. We examined local field potential activity in CA1 as rats performed a nonspatial odor sequence memory task. We found that odor sequence processing epochs were characterized by distinct spectral profiles and proximo-distal CA1 gradients of theta and 20-40 Hz power than track running epochs. We also discovered that 20-40 Hz power was predictive of sequence memory performance, particularly in proximal CA1 and during the plateau of high power observed on trials in which animals had to maintain their decision until instructed to respond. Altogether, these results provide evidence that dynamics of 20-40 Hz power along the CA1 axis are linked to trial-specific processing of nonspatial information critical to order judgements and are consistent with a role for 20-40 Hz power in gating information processing.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A LAMP sequencing approach for high-throughput co-detection of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus in human saliva</a></h4>

              
                The COVID-19 pandemic has created an urgent need for rapid, effective, and low-cost SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic testing. Here, we describe COV-ID, an approach that combines RT-LAMP with deep sequencing to detect SARS-CoV-2 in unprocessed human saliva with a low limit of detection (5–10 virions). Based on a multi-dimensional barcoding strategy, COV-ID can be used to test thousands of samples overnight in a single sequencing run with limited labor and laboratory equipment. The sequencing-based readout allows COV-ID to detect multiple amplicons simultaneously, including key controls such as host transcripts and artificial spike-ins, as well as multiple pathogens. Here, we demonstrate this flexibility by simultaneous detection of 4 amplicons in contrived saliva samples: SARS-CoV-2, influenza A, human <i>STATHERIN</i>, and an artificial SARS calibration standard. The approach was validated on clinical saliva samples, where it showed excellent agreement with RT-qPCR. COV-ID can also be performed directly on saliva absorbed on filter paper, simplifying collection logistics and sample handling.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Von Willebrand factor A1 domain stability and affinity for GPIbα are differentially regulated by its O-glycosylated N- and C-linker</a></h4>

              
                Hemostasis in the arterial circulation is mediated by binding of the A1 domain of the ultralong protein von Willebrand factor (VWF) to GPIbα on platelets to form a platelet plug. A1 is activated by tensile force on VWF concatemers imparted by hydrodynamic drag force. The A1 core is protected from force-induced unfolding by a long-range disulfide that links cysteines near its N- and C-termini. The <i>O</i>-glycosylated linkers between A1 and its neighboring domains, which transmit tensile force to A1, are reported to regulate A1 activation for binding to GPIb, but the mechanism is controversial and incompletely defined. Here, we study how these linkers, and their polypeptide and <i>O</i>-glycan moieties, regulate A1 affinity by measuring affinity, kinetics, thermodynamics, hydrogen deuterium exchange (HDX), and unfolding by temperature and urea. The N-linker lowers A1 affinity 40-fold with a stronger contribution from its <i>O</i>-glycan than polypeptide moiety. The N-linker also decreases HDX in specific regions of A1 and increases thermal stability and the energy gap between its native state and an intermediate state, which is observed in urea-induced unfolding. The C-linker also decreases affinity of A1 for GPIbα, but in contrast to the N-linker, has no significant effect on HDX or A1 stability. Among different models for A1 activation, our data are consistent with the model that the intermediate state has high affinity for GPIbα, which is induced by tensile force physiologically and regulated allosterically by the N-linker.

                Understanding whole-brain-scale electrophysiological recordings will rely on the collective work of multiple labs. Because two labs recording from the same brain area often reach different conclusions, it is critical to quantify and control for features that decrease reproducibility. To address these issues, we formed a multi-lab collaboration using a shared, open-source behavioral task and experimental apparatus. We repeatedly inserted Neuropixels multi-electrode probes targeting the same brain locations (including posterior parietal cortex, hippocampus, and thalamus) in mice performing the behavioral task. We gathered data across 9 labs and developed a common histological and data processing pipeline to analyze the resulting large datasets. After applying stringent behavioral, histological, and electrophysiological quality-control criteria, we found that neuronal yield, firing rates, spike amplitudes, and task-modulated neuronal activity were reproducible across laboratories. To quantify variance in neural activity explained by task variables (e.g., stimulus onset time), behavioral variables (timing of licks/paw movements), and other variables (e.g., spatial location in the brain or the lab ID), we developed a multi-task neural network encoding model that extends common, simpler regression approaches by allowing nonlinear interactions between variables. We found that within-lab random effects captured by this model were comparable to between-lab random effects. Taken together, these results demonstrate that across-lab standardization of electrophysiological procedures can lead to reproducible results across labs. Moreover, our protocols to achieve reproducibility, along with our analyses to evaluate it are openly accessible to the scientific community, along with our extensive electrophysiological dataset with corresponding behavior and open-source analysis code.

                This paper proposes a tool for automatic and optimal tuning of pulse amplitude and width for sequential parameter estimation (SPE) of the membrane time constant and input-output curve in closed-loop electromyography-guided (EMG-guided) controllable transcranial magnetic stimulation (cTMS). A normalized depolarization factor is defined which separates the optimization of the pulse amplitude and width. Then, the pulse amplitude is chosen by the maximization of the Fisher information matrix (FIM), while the pulse width is chosen by the maximization of the normalized depolarization factor. The simulation results confirm satisfactory estimation. The results show that the normalized depolarization factor maximization can identify the critical pulse width, which is an important parameter in the identifiability analysis, without any prior neurophysiological or anatomical knowledge of the neural membrane.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Comparative brain structure and the neural network features of cuttlefish and squid</a></h4>

              
                Cuttlefishes, like their octopus cousins, are masters of camouflage by control of body pattern and skin texture to blend in with their surroundings for prey ambush and threat avoidance. Aside from significant progress on the cuttlefish visual perception and communication, a growing number of studies have focused on their behavioural neurobiology and the remarkably rapid and apparently cognitively complex reactions to novel challenges such as spatial learning to solve maze tasks and vertebrate-like cognitive capabilities (e.g. object recognition, number sense and episodic-like memory). Despite intense interest of cuttlefish, much of our knowledge of its neuroanatomy and links to behaviour and ecology comes from one temperate species, the European common cuttlefish, Sepia officinalis. Here we present the first detailed comparison of neuroanatomical features between the tropical cuttlefish and squid and describe differences in basic brain and wiring anatomy using MRI-based techniques and conventional histology. Furthermore, comparisons amongst nocturnal and diurnal cuttlefish species suggest that the characteristic neuroanatomical features infer interspecific variation in visual capabilities, the importance of vision relative to the less utilised chemosensory system and clear links with life modes (e.g. diurnal vs nocturnal), ecological factors (e.g. living depth and ambient light condition) as well as to an extent, phylogeny. These findings link brain heterogeneity to ecological niches and lifestyle, feeding hypotheses around evolutionary history and provide a timely, new technology update to older literature.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Multi-policy models of interregional communication in the human connectome</a></h4>

              
                Network models of communication, e.g. shortest paths, diffusion, navigation, have become useful tools for studying structure-function relationships in the brain. These models generate estimates of communication efficiency between all pairs of brain regions, which can then be linked to the correlation structure of recorded activity, i.e. functional connectivity (FC). At present, however, communication models have a number of limitations, including difficulty adjudicating between models and the absence of a generic framework for modeling multiple interacting communication policies at the regional level. Here, we present a framework that allows us to incorporate multiple region-specific policies and fit them to empirical estimates of FC. Briefly, we show many communication policies, including shortest paths and greedy navigation, can be modeled as biased random walks, enabling these policies to be incorporated into the same multi-policy communication model alongside unbiased processes, e.g. diffusion. We show that these multi-policy models outperform existing communication measures while yielding neurobiologically interpretable regional preferences. Further, we show that these models explain the majority of variance in time-varying patterns of FC. Collectively, our framework represents an advance in network-based communication models and establishes a strong link between these patterns and FC. Our findings open up many new avenues for future inquiries and present a flexible framework for modeling anatomically-constrained communication.

	<p>Background: Stroke is a high burden illness and the second leading cause of worldwide disability with generally poor recovery rates. Robust benefits of hippotherapy, a novel neurorehabilitation approach, in functional recovery following various severe neurological disabling conditions has been shown. In the present study, we will analyze the effect of a hippotherapy program on the outcome of post-stroke patients in the first year post-stroke. Method: A randomized controlled clinical trial on the effectiveness of hippotherapy (4 weeks/18 weeks hippotherapy/conventional neurorehabilitation) versus conventional neurorehabilitation alone (22 weeks) will be conducted over 48 weeks. In the treated group, one-hour daily hippotherapy sessions will be exclusively conducted during the hippotherapy&amp;amp;rsquo;s cycles, alternated with periods of conventional neurorehabilitation. A test battery will measure both the functional and psychological outcomes. The primary endpoint will be the patient&amp;amp;rsquo;s functional independence. The secondary endpoints will measure the sensorimotor function, autonomy, and quality of life, as well as the caregivers&amp;amp;rsquo; quality of life. Results and conclusion: Individual brain connectome, life history and personality construct influence the brain&amp;amp;rsquo;s functional connectivity and are central to developing optimal tailored neurorehabilitation strategies. According to our current practice, hippotherapy allows the enhancement of substantial neuroplastic changes in the injured brain with significant neurological recovery. The protocol aims to confirm those issues. Trial registration in ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04759326 accessed on 19 February 2021.</p>

	<p>Background: There are a number of medications prescribed to address comorbid challenging behaviors in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), including risperidone and aripiprazole. This retrospective case series reports the use of these drugs in children aged 2 to 13 years. Methodology: A total of 82 children (mean age, 5 years; 79% male) with ASD treated at the Kids Neuro Clinic and Rehab Center in Dubai between January 2020 and September 2021 were included in this retrospective case series. All patients had comorbid challenging behaviors that were resistant to standard supportive therapies alone and warranted pharmacological intervention. The Childhood Autism Rating Scale&amp;amp;mdash;2nd Edition Standard form (CARS2-ST) and the Clinical Global Impression (CGI)&amp;amp;mdash;Severity (CGI-S) and CGI&amp;amp;mdash;Improvement (CGI-I) scales were used to assess the severity of ASD at baseline and to monitor response to treatment with risperidone or aripiprazole. Results: Besides the expected improvement in comorbid challenging behaviors, 79/82 patients (96%) attained a CGI-I score of 2 or 1 following treatment, and 35/82 patients (43%) achieved both a CGI-I score of 1 and minimal-to-no symptoms as per the CARS2-ST test, with complete resolution of their ASD signs and symptoms. The differences in the overall mean CARS2-ST and CGI-S scores pre- and post-treatment were statistically significant (Z = &amp;amp;minus;7.86, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001 for both), with pre- and post-treatment mean values of 42 and 23 for CARS2-ST, respectively, and 6 and 2 for CGI-S, respectively. The main side effects were asymptomatic elevated prolactin (n = 12) and excessive weight gain (n = 2). Conclusions: ASD core symptoms and comorbid behaviors in young children improved following chronic treatment with antipsychotic medications, either with or without medications for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, when combined with standard supportive therapies. Double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials are needed to verify these findings.</p>

	<p>Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is characterized by the progressive degeneration of upper or lower motor neurons, leading to muscle wasting and paralysis, resulting in respiratory failure and death. The precise ALS aetiology is poorly understood, mainly due to clinical and genetic heterogeneity. Thus, the identification of reliable biomarkers of disease could be helpful in clinical practice. In this study, we investigated whether the levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its precursor Pro-BDNF in serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) may reflect the pathological changes related to ALS. We found higher BDNF and lower Pro-BDNF levels in ALS sera compared to healthy controls. BDNF/Pro-BDNF ratio turned out to be accurate in distinguishing ALS patients from controls. Then, the correlations of these markers with several ALS clinical variables were evaluated. This analysis revealed three statistically significant associations: (1) Patients carrying the C9orf72 expansion significantly differed from non-carrier patients and showed serum BDNF levels comparable to control subjects; (2) BDNF levels in CSF were significantly higher in ALS patients with faster disease progression; (3) lower serum levels of Pro-BDNF were associated with a shorter survival. Therefore, we suggest that BDNF and Pro-BDNF, alone or in combination, might be used as ALS prognostic biomarkers.</p>

	<p>Previous work has provided contrasting evidence on syntax acquisition. Syntax-internal factors, i.e., instinctive knowledge of the universals of grammar (UG) for finite-state grammar (FSG) and phrase-structure grammar (PSG) but also syntax-external factors such as language competence, working memory (WM) and demographic factors may affect syntax acquisition. This study employed an artificial grammar paradigm to identify which factors predicted syntax acquisition. Thirty-seven healthy individuals and forty-nine left-hemispheric stroke patients (fourteen with aphasia) read syllable sequences adhering to or violating FSG and PSG. They performed preference classifications followed by grammatical classifications (after training). Results showed the best classification accuracy for sequences adhering to UG, with performance predicted by syntactic competence and spatial WM. Classification of ungrammatical sequences improved after training and was predicted by verbal WM. Although accuracy on FSG was better than on PSG, generalization was fully possible only for PSG. Education was the best predictor of syntax acquisition, while aphasia and lesion volume were not predictors. This study shows a clear preference for UG, which is influenced by spatial and linguistic knowledge, but not by the presence of aphasia. Verbal WM supported the identification of rule violations. Moreover, the acquisition of FSG and PSG was related to partially different mechanisms, but both depended on education.</p>

	<p>Schizophrenia is a severe neuropsychiatric disease whose diagnosis, unfortunately, lacks an objective diagnostic tool supporting a thorough psychiatric examination of the patient. We took advantage of today&amp;amp;rsquo;s computational abilities, structural magnetic resonance imaging, and modern machine learning methods, such as stacked autoencoders (SAE) and 3D convolutional neural networks (3D CNN), to teach them to classify 52 patients with schizophrenia and 52 healthy controls. The main aim of this study was to explore whether complex feature extraction methods can help improve the accuracy of deep learning-based classifiers compared to minimally preprocessed data. Our experiments employed three commonly used preprocessing steps to extract three different feature types. They included voxel-based morphometry, deformation-based morphometry, and simple spatial normalization of brain tissue. In addition to classifier models, features and their combination, other model parameters such as network depth, number of neurons, number of convolutional filters, and input data size were also investigated. Autoencoders were trained on feature pools of 1000 and 5000 voxels selected by Mann-Whitney tests, and 3D CNNs were trained on whole images. The most successful model architecture (autoencoders) achieved the highest average accuracy of 69.62% (sensitivity 68.85%, specificity 70.38%). The results of all experiments were statistically compared (the Mann-Whitney test). In conclusion, SAE outperformed 3D CNN, while preprocessing using VBM helped SAE improve the results.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A task-general connectivity model reveals variation in convergence of cortical inputs to functional regions of the cerebellum</a></h4>

              
                While resting-state fMRI studies have provided a broad picture of the connectivity between human neocortex and cerebellum, the degree of convergence of cortical inputs onto cerebellar circuits remains unknown: Does each cerebellar region receive input from a single cortical area or convergent inputs from multiple cortical areas? Here we use task-based fMRI data to build a range of cortico-cerebellar connectivity models, each allowing for a different degree of convergence. We compared these models by their ability to predict cerebellar activity patterns for novel task sets. Models that allow some degree of convergence provided the best predictions, arguing for convergence of multiple cortical inputs onto single cerebellar voxels. Importantly, the degree of convergence varied across the cerebellum with the highest convergence observed in areas linked to language, working memory, and social cognition. These findings suggest important differences in the way that functional subdivisions of the cerebellum support motor and cognitive function.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Characteristics and Impact of the rNST GABA Network on Neural and Behavioral Taste Responses</a></h4>

              
                The rostral nucleus of the solitary tract (rNST), the initial CNS site for processing gustatory information, is comprised of two major cell types, glutamatergic excitatory and GABAergic inhibitory neurons. Many investigators have described taste responses of rNST neurons, but the phenotypes of these cells were unknown. The current investigation used mice expressing ChR2 under the control of GAD65, a synthetic enzyme for GABA. In vivo single-unit recording of rNST cells during optogenetic stimulation allowed us to address two important questions: (1) what are the gustatory response characteristics of 'optotagged', putative GABAergic (G+TASTE) neurons? and (2) how does optogenetic activation of the rNST GABA network impact taste responses in non-GABAergic (G-TASTE) neurons? We observed that chemosensitive profiles of G+TASTE neurons were similar to non-GABA taste neurons but had much lower response rates. We further observed that there was a population of GABA cells unresponsive to taste stimulation (G+UNR) and located more ventrally in the nucleus. Activating rNST inhibitory circuitry suppressed gustatory responses of G-TASTE neurons across all qualities and types of chemosensitive neurons. Tuning curves were modestly sharpened but the overall shape of response profiles and the ensemble pattern remained highly stable. These neurophysiological effects were consistent with the behavioral consequences of activating GAD65-expressing inhibitory neurons using DREADDs. In a brief-access licking task, concentration-response curves to both palatable (sucrose, maltrin) and unpalatable (quinine) stimuli were shifted to the right when GABA neurons were activated. Thus, the rNST GABAergic network is poised to modulate taste intensity across the qualitative and hedonic spectrum.

                Background: Accumulating evidence suggests brain structural and functional alterations in Internet Use Disorder (IUD). However, conclusions are strongly limited due to the retrospective case-control design of the studies, small samples, and the focus on general rather than symptom-specific approaches. Methods: We here employed a dimensional multi-methodical MRI-neuroimaging design in a final sample of n = 203 subjects to examine associations between levels of IUD and its symptom-dimensions (loss of control/time management, craving/social problems) with brain structure, resting state and task-based (pain empathy, affective go/no-go) brain function. Results: Although the present sample covered the entire range of IUD, including normal, problematic as well as pathological levels, general IUD symptom load was not associated with brain structural or functional alterations. However, the symptom-dimensions exhibited opposing associations with the intrinsic and structural organization of the brain, such that loss of control/time management exhibited negative associations with intrinsic striatal networks and hippocampal volume, while craving/social problems exhibited a positive association with intrinsic striatal networks and caudate volume. Conclusions: Our findings provided the first evidence for IUD symptom-domain specific associations with progressive alterations in the intrinsic structural and functional organization of the brain, particularly of striatal systems involved in reward, habitual and cognitive control processes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A sequential two-step priming scheme reproduces diversity in synaptic strength and short-term plasticity</a></h4>

              
                Glutamatergic synapses display variable strength and diverse short-term plasticity (STP), even for a given type of connection. Using non-negative tensor factorization (NTF) and conventional state modelling, we demonstrate that a kinetic scheme consisting of two sequential and reversible steps of release-machinery assembly and a final step of synaptic vesicle (SV) fusion reproduces STP and its diversity among synapses. Analyzing transmission at calyx of Held synapses reveals that differences in synaptic strength and STP are not primarily caused by variable fusion probability (pfusion) but determined by the fraction of docked synaptic vesicles equipped with a mature release machinery. Our simulations show, that traditional quantal analysis methods do not necessarily report pfusion of SVs with a mature release machinery but reflect both pfusion and the distribution between mature and immature priming states at rest. Thus, the approach holds promise for a better mechanistic dissection of the roles of presynaptic proteins in the sequence of SV docking, two-step priming and fusion and suggests a mechanism for activity-induced redistribution of synaptic efficacy.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Predicting Working Memory performance based on specific individual EEG spatiotemporal features</a></h4>

              
                Working Memory (WM) is a limited capacity system for storing and processing information, which varies from subject to subject. Several works show the ability to predict the performance of WM with machine learning (ML) methods, and although good prediction results are obtained in these works, ignoring the intersubject variability and the temporal and spatial characterization in a WM task to improve the prediction in each subject. In this paper, we take advantage of the spectral properties of WM to characterize the individual differences in visual WM capacity and predict the subject's performance. Feature selection was implemented through the selection of electrodes making use of methods to treat unbalanced classes. The results show a correlation between the accuracy achieved with an Regularized Linear Discriminant Analysis (RLDA) classifier using the power spectrum of the EEG signal and the accuracy achieved by each subject in the behavioral experiment response of a WM task with retro-cue. The proposed methodology allows identifying spatial and temporal characteristics in the WM performance in each subject. Our methodology shows that it is possible to predict the WM performance in each subject. Finally, our results showed that by knowing the spatiotemporal characteristics that predict WM performance, it is possible to customize a WM task and optimize the use of electrodes for agile processing adapted to a specific subject. Thus, we pave the way for implementing neurofeedback through a Brain-Computer Interface.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Dynamic emergence of relational structure network in human brains</a></h4>

              
                Reasoning the hidden relational structure from sequences of events is a crucial ability humans possess, which help them to predict the future and make inferences. Besides simple statistical properties, humans also excel in learning more complex relational networks. Several brain regions are engaged in the process, yet the time-resolved neural implementation of relational structure learning and its behavioral relevance remains unknown. Here human subjects performed a probabilistic sequential prediction task on image sequences generated from a transition graph-like network, with their brain activities recorded using electroencephalography (EEG). We demonstrate the emergence of two key aspects of relational knowledge - lower-order transition probability and higher-order community structure, which arise around 840 msec after image onset and well predict behavioral performance. Furthermore, computational modeling suggests that the formed higher-order community structure, i.e., compressed clusters in the network, could be well characterized by a successor representation operation. Overall, human brains are constantly computing the temporal statistical relationship among discrete inputs, based on which new abstract knowledge could be inferred.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Nitric oxide-induced tyrosine nitration of TrkB impairs BDNF signaling and restrains neuronal plasticity</a></h4>

              
                Nitric oxide has been long recognized as an important modulator of neural plasticity, but characterization of the molecular mechanisms involved - specially the guanylyl cyclase-independent ones - has been challenging. There is evidence that NO could modify BDNF-TRKB signaling, a key mediator of neuronal plasticity. However, the mechanism underlying the interplay of NO and TRKB remains unclear. Here we show that nitric oxide induces nitration of the tyrosine 816 in the TRKB receptor in vivo and in vitro, and that post-translational modification inhibits TRKB phosphorylation and binding of phospholipase C{gamma}1 (PLC{gamma}1) to this same tyrosine residue. Additionally, nitration triggers clathrin-dependent endocytosis of TRKB through the adaptor protein AP2M and ubiquitination, thereby increasing translocation of TRKB away from the neuronal surface and directing it towards lysosomal degradation. Accordingly, inhibition of nitric oxide increases TRKB phosphorylation and TRKB-dependent neurite branching in neuronal cultures. In vivo, chronic inhibition of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) dramatically reduced TRKB nitration and facilitated TRKB signaling in the primary visual cortex, and promoted a shift in ocular dominance upon monocular deprivation in the visual cortex - an indicator of increased plasticity. Altogether, our data describe and characterize a new molecular brake on plasticity, namely nitration of TRKB receptors.

Significance statementWe described the nitration of TRKB receptors at the tyrosine residue 816 as a new post-translational modification (PTM) that restrains the signaling of the neurotrophic factor BDNF in neurons. This new PTM leads to endocytosis and degradation of the TRKB receptors. Intriguingly, this mechanism is tonically active under physiological conditions in vivo, and it is important for restricting ocular dominance plasticity in the visual cortex. This mechanism directly links two major systems involved in brain plasticity, BDNF/TRKB and nitric oxide. Our data provides a model for how NO production from nNOS can compromise TRKB function, and for the effects of nNOS inhibitors promoting plasticity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Multi-tasking Deep Network for Tinnitus Classification and Severity Prediction from Multimodal Structural Images</a></h4>

              
                Subjective tinnitus is an auditory phantom perceptual disorder without an objective biomarker. Fast and efficient diagnostic tools will advance clinical practice by detecting or confirming the condition, tracking change in severity, and monitoring treatment response. Motivated by evidence of subtle anatomical or functional morphological information in magnetic resonance images (MRI) of the brain, we examined data-driven machine learning methods for joint tinnitus classification (tinnitus or no tinnitus) and tinnitus severity prediction. We propose a deep multi-task multi-modal framework for joint functionalities using structural MRI (sMRI) data. To leverage cross-information multimodal neuroimaging data, we integrated two modalities of 3-dimensional sMRI - T1 weighted (T1w) and T2 weighted (T2w) images. To explore the key components in the MR images that drove task performance, we segmented both T1w and T2w images into three different components - cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), grey matter (GM) and white matter (WM), and examined performance of each segmented image. Results demonstrate that our multimodal framework capitalizes on the information across both modalities (T1w and T2w) for the joint task of tinnitus classification and severity prediction. Our model outperforms existing learning-based and conventional methods in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and negative predictive value.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Hemodynamic transient and functional connectivity follow structural connectivity and cell type over the brain hierarch</a></h4>

              
                The neural circuit of the brain is organized as a hierarchy of functional units with wide-ranging connections that support the information flow and functional connectivity. Studies using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) indicate a moderate coupling between structural and functional connectivity at the system level. However, how do connections of different directions (feedforward and feedback) and regions with different excitatory and inhibitory (E/I) neurons shape the hemodynamic activity and functional connectivity over the hierarchy are unknown. Here, we used functional MRI to detect optogenetic-evoked and resting-state activities over a somatosensory pathway in the mouse brain and compared with axonal projection and E/I distribution. With a highly sensitive ultrafast imaging, we identified extensive activation in regions up to the third order of axonal projections following optogenetic excitation of the ventral posteriomedial nucleus of the thalamus. The evoked response and functional connectivity correlated with feedforward projections but less with the feedback and weakened with the hierarchy. The hemodynamic signal exhibited regional and hierarchical differences, with slower and more variable responses in high-order areas and bipolar responses predominantly in the contralateral cortex. Importantly, the positive and negative parts of hemodynamics correlated with E/I neuronal densities, respectively. Furthermore, resting-state functional connectivity more associated with E/I distribution whereas stimulus-evoked effective connectivity followed structural wiring. These findings indicate that structure-function relationship is projection-, cell-type- and hierarchy-dependent. Hemodynamic transients could reflect E/I activity and the increased complexity of hierarchical processing.

Significance statementThe neural circuit of the brain is organized as a hierarchy of functional units with complicated feedforward and feedback connections to selectively enhance (excitation) or suppress (inhibit) information from massive sensory inputs. How brain activity is shaped by the structural wiring and excitatory and inhibitory neurons are still unclear. We characterize how brain-wide hemodynamic responses reflect these structural constituents over the hierarchy of a somatosensory pathway. We find that functional activation and connectivity correlate with feedforward connection strengths and neuronal distributions. This association subsides with hierarchy due to slower and more variable hemodynamic responses, reflecting increased complexity of processing and neuronal compositions in high-order areas. Our findings indicate that hemodynamics follow the hierarchy of structural wiring and neuronal distribution.

                The incorporation of novel information into the hippocampal network is likely be constrained by its innate architecture and internally generated activity patterns. However, the origin, organization, and consequences of such patterns remain poorly understood. Here, we show that hippocampal network dynamics are affected by sequential neurogenesis. We birthdated CA1 pyramidal neurons with in-utero electroporation over 4 embryonic days encompassing the peak of hippocampal neurogenesis, and compared their functional features in freely moving, adult mice. Neurons of the same birthdate displayed distinct connectivity, coactivity across brain states, and assembly dynamics. Same birthdate hippocampal neurons were topographically organized, in that anatomically clustered (<500{micro}m) neurons exhibited overlapping spatial representations. Overall, the wiring and functional features of CA1 pyramidal neurons reflected a combination of birthdate and the rate of neurogenesis. These observations demonstrate that sequential neurogenesis in embryonic development shapes the preconfigured forms of adult network dynamics.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Phase separation of competing memories along the human hippocampal theta rhythm.</a></h4>

              
                Competition between overlapping memories is considered one of the major causes of forgetting and it is still unknown how the human brain resolves such mnemonic conflict. In the present MEG study, we empirically tested a computational model that leverages an oscillating inhibition algorithm to minimise overlap between memories. We used a proactive interference task, where a reminder word could be associated with either a single image (non-competitive condition) or two competing images, and participants were asked to always recall the most recently learned word-image association. Time-resolved pattern classifiers were trained to detect the reactivated content of target and competitor memories from MEG sensor patterns, and the timing of these neural reactivations was analysed relative to the phase of the dominant hippocampal 3Hz theta oscillation. In line with our preregistered hypotheses, target and competitor reactivations locked to different phases of the hippocampal theta rhythm after several repeated recalls. Participants who behaviourally experienced lower levels of interference also showed larger phase separation between the two overlapping memories. The findings provide evidence that the temporal segregation of memories, orchestrated by slow oscillations, plays a functional role in resolving mnemonic competition by separating and prioritising relevant memories under conditions of high interference.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Alone in a crowd: Effect of a nonfunctional lateral line on expression of the social hormone parathyroid hormone 2.</a></h4>

              
                Parathyroid hormone 2 (Pth2) is a vertebrate-specific neuropeptide whose thalamic expression is upregulated by social contact with conspecifics. However, social interactions fail to stimulate pth2 expression in isolated zebrafish whose lateral line hair cells have been chemically ablated. These results suggest that modulation of pth2 by social context is acutely dependent on mechanosensory information from the lateral line. However, it is unclear how a congenital loss of lateral line function influences the ability of zebrafish to interpret their social environment. In this study, we measure pth2 levels in zebrafish mutants lacking hair cell function in either the lateral line only, or in both the inner ear and lateral line. Socially-raised lateral line mutants express lower levels of pth2 relative to wild type siblings, but there is no further reduction when all sensory hair cells are nonfunctional. However, social isolation of hair cell mutants causes a further reduction in pth2 expression, pointing to additional unidentified sensory cues that influence pth2 production. Lastly, we report that social context modulates fluorescent transgenes driven by the pth2 promoter. Altogether, these data suggest that lateral line mutants experience a chronic sense of isolation, even when raised in a social environment.

SUMMARY STATEMENTExpression of the pro-social neuropeptide pth2 is downregulated in larval zebrafish with a congenital loss of lateral line function. Thus, even in social environments, fish with compromised lateral lines may experience chronic loneliness.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">ATXN2 is a target of N-terminal proteolysis</a></h4>

              
                Spinocerebellar ataxia 2 (SCA2) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by the expansion of the poly-glutamine (polyQ) tract of Ataxin-2 (ATXN2). Other polyQ-containing proteins such as ATXN7 and huntingtin are associated with the development of neurodegenerative diseases when their N-terminal polyQ domains are expanded. Furthermore, they undergo proteolytic processing events that produce N-terminal fragments that include the polyQ stretch, which are implicated in pathogenesis. Interestingly, N-terminal ATXN2 fragments were reported in a brain extract from a SCA2 patient, but it is currently unknown whether an expanded polyQ domain contributes to ATXN2 proteolytic susceptibility. Here, we used transient expression in HEK293 cells to determine whether ATXN2 is a target for specific N-terminal proteolysis. We found that ATXN2 proteins with either normal or expanded polyQ stretches undergo proteolytic cleavage releasing an N-terminal polyQ-containing fragment. We identified a short amino acid sequence downstream of the polyQ domain that is necessary for N-terminal cleavage of full-length ATXN2 and sufficient to induce proteolysis of a heterologous protein. However, this sequence is not required for cleavage of a short ATXN2 isoform produced from an alternative start codon located just upstream of the CAG repeats encoding the polyQ domain. Our study extends our understanding of ATXN2 posttranslational regulation by revealing that this protein can be the target of specific proteolytic cleavage events releasing polyQ-containing products that are modulated by the N-terminal domain of ATXN2. N-terminal ATXN2 proteolysis of expanded polyQ domains might contribute to SCA2 pathology, as observed in other neurodegenerative disorders caused by polyQ domain expansion.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Oxytocin attenuates microglial activation and restores social and non-social memory in the APP/PS1 mouse model of Alzheimer's disease</a></h4>

              
                Alzheimers disease (AD) is the main cause of dementia in the elderly and is characterized by memory loss, social withdrawal and neurodegeneration, eventually leading to death. Brain inflammation has emerged as a key pathogenic mechanism in AD. We hypothesized that oxytocin, a pro-social hypothalamic neuropeptide with anti-inflammatory properties, could have therapeutic actions in AD. We investigated oxytocin production in mouse models of AD, and evaluated the therapeutic potential of intranasal oxytocin. We observed lower levels of hypothalamic oxytocin in wild-type mice following brain infusion of amyloid-{beta} oligomers (A{beta}Os), as well as in APP/PS1 AD model mice. Treatment of APP/PS1 mice with intranasal oxytocin reduced microglial activation and favored deposition of A{beta} in dense core plaques, a potentially neuroprotective mechanism. Oxytocin further alleviated social and non-social memory impairments in APP/PS1 mice. Our findings point to oxytocin as a potential therapeutic target to reduce brain inflammation and correct memory deficits in AD.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Reinstatement of Pavlovian responses to alcohol cues by stress</a></h4>

              
                Stress may contribute to relapse to alcohol use in part by enhancing reactivity to cues previously paired with alcohol. Yet, standard models of stress-induced reinstatement generally use contingent presentations of alcohol-paired cues to reinforce instrumental behaviors, making it difficult to isolate the ability of cues to invigorate alcohol-seeking. Here we sought to test the impact of stress on behavioral responses to alcohol-paired cues, using a model of stress-induced reinstatement of Pavlovian conditioned approach, inspired by Nadia Chaudhri's work on context-induced reinstatement. Long Evans rats were trained to associate one auditory cue with delivery of alcohol or sucrose and an alternative auditory cue with no reward. Following extinction training, rats were exposed to a stressor prior to being re-exposed to the cues under extinction conditions. We assessed the effects of yohimbine, intermittent footshock and olfactory cues paired with social defeat on responses to alcohol-paired cues, and the effects of yohimbine on responses to sucrose-paired cues. The pharmacological stressor, yohimbine, enhanced Pavlovian responses to both alcohol and sucrose cues, but intermittent footshock and social defeat cues did not. While yohimbine elicited reinstatement of Pavlovian conditioned responses, these effects may be unrelated to activation of stress systems.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Pattern dynamics and stochasticity of the brain rhythms</a></h4>

              
                Our current understanding of brain rhythms is based on quantifying their instantaneous or time-averaged characteristics. What remains unexplored, is the actual structure of the waves--their shapes and patterns over finite timescales. To address this, we used two independent approaches to link wave forms to their physiological functions: the first is based on quantifying their consistency with the underlying mean behavior, and the second assesses "orderliness" of the waves features. The corresponding measures capture the waves characteristic and abnormal behaviors, such as atypical periodicity or excessive clustering, and demonstrate coupling between the patterns dynamics and the animals location, speed and acceleration. Specifically, we studied patterns of{theta} and{gamma} waves, and Sharp Wave Ripples, and observed speed-modulated changes of the waves cadence, an antiphase relationship between orderliness and acceleration, as well as spatial selectiveness of patterns. Further-more, we found an interdependence between orderliness and regularity: larger deviations from steady oscillatory behavior tend to accompany disarrayed temporal cluttering of peaks and troughs. Taken together, our results offer a complementary--mesoscale--perspective on brain wave structure, dynamics, and functionality.

	<p>Horizontal gaze palsy with progressive scoliosis (HGPPS) is a rare congenital disease characterized by the absence of horizontal gaze movements, progressive scoliosis, and typical brain, cerebellum, and medullary malformations. Here we describe a pediatric HGPPS case with overlapping epilepsy and learning difficulties. A 6-year-old girl was admitted to the University Hospital of Bari for the onset of a tonic&amp;amp;ndash;clonic seizure. Electroencephalogram showed slow and sharp waves on the right side with the tendency to diffuse. Brain magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated malformations compatible with HGPPS. Ophthalmological and orthopedic evaluations confirmed conjugate horizontal gaze palsy and mild thoracolumbar scoliosis. Neuropsychological assessment attested normal intelligence but serious difficulties in reading and writing. In spite of neuroradiological malformations, visual difficulties, and spinal deformities, literature data are limited about any coexisting neurocognitive HGPPS symptoms. Literature data regarding such topics are very limited. If, on the one hand, the coexistence of such symptoms can be interpreted as occasional, it could support the idea that they could fall within a spectrum of HGPPS anomalies.

	<p>It is known that the trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1) receptor is involved in limbic brain functions by regulating dopamine transmission and putative reward circuitry. Moreover, other TAARs are expressed in the olfactory system of all studied vertebrate species, sensing innate socially-relevant odors, including pheromones. Therefore, one can assume that TAARs may play a role in rodent social and sexual behavior. A comparative behavioral and biochemical analysis of TAAR1 knockout (TAAR1-KO) and wild-type mice is also important for the preliminary evaluation of the potential side effects of future TAAR1-based therapies. In our studies, we adapted a sexual incentive motivation test for mice to evaluate the sexual behavior of TAAR1-KO and wild-type mice. Previously, similar methods were primarily applied to rats. Furthermore, we measured testosterone and other biochemical parameters in the blood. As a result, we found only minimal alterations in all of the studied parameters. Thus, the lack of TAAR1 does not significantly affect sexual motivation and routine lipid and metabolic blood biochemical parameters, suggesting that future TAAR1-based therapies should have a favorable safety profile.</p>

                <p>Nodding syndrome (NS) is a poorly understood form of childhood-onset epilepsy that is characterized by the pathognomonic ictal phenomenon of repetitive vertical head drops. To evaluate the underlying ictal neurophysiology, ictal EEG features were evaluated in nine participants with confirmed NS from South Sudan, Tanzania, and Uganda and ictal presence of high frequency gamma oscillations on scalp EEG were assessed. Ictal EEG during the head nodding episode predominantly showed generalized slow waves or sharp-and-slow wave complexes followed by electrodecrement. Augmentation of gamma activity (30–70 Hz) was seen during the head nodding episode in all the participants. We confirm that head nodding episodes in persons with NS from the three geographically distinct regions in sub-Saharan Africa share the common features of slow waves with electrodecrement and superimposed gamma activity.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Heterozygous PNPT1 Variants Cause Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 25</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Dominant spinocerebellar ataxias (SCA) are characterized by genetic heterogeneity. Some mapped and named <i>loci</i> remain without a causal gene identified. Here we applied next generation sequencing (NGS) to uncover the genetic etiology of the <i>SCA25 locus</i>.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing were performed in families linked to <i>SCA25</i>, including the French family in which the <i>SCA25 locus</i> was originally mapped. Whole exome sequence data were interrogated in a cohort of 796 ataxia patients of unknown etiology.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The SCA25 phenotype spans a slowly evolving sensory and cerebellar ataxia, in most cases attributed to ganglionopathy. A pathogenic variant causing exon skipping was identified in the gene encoding Polyribonucleotide Nucleotidyltransferase PNPase 1 (<i>PNPT1)</i> located in the <i>SCA25</i> linkage interval. A second splice variant in <i>PNPT1</i> was detected in a large Australian family with a dominant ataxia also mapping to <i>SCA25</i>. An additional nonsense variant was detected in an unrelated individual with ataxia. Both nonsense and splice heterozygous variants result in premature stop codons, all located in the S1-domain of PNPase. In addition, an elevated type I interferon response was observed in blood from all affected heterozygous carriers tested. PNPase notably prevents the abnormal accumulation of double-stranded mtRNAs in the mitochondria and leakage into the cytoplasm, associated with triggering a type I interferon response.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This study identifies <i>PNPT1</i> as a new SCA gene, responsible for SCA25, and highlights biological links between alterations of mtRNA trafficking, interferonopathies and ataxia. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Tregs Attenuate Peripheral Oxidative Stress and Acute Phase Proteins in ALS</a></h4>

              
                <p>Oxidative stress (OS) induces inflammation, which in turn exacerbates OS and the expression of acute phase proteins (APPs). Regulatory T lymphocyte (Treg) therapy was assessed for suppression of OS and APP responses in longitudinal serum samples from subjects with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) enrolled in a phase I clinical trial. The first round of Treg therapy suppressed levels of oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL). During a 6-month washout period, ox-LDL levels increased. A second round of therapy again suppressed ox-LDL levels and then rose following the cessation of treatment. Serum levels of APPs, soluble CD14, lipopolysaccharide binding protein, and C-reactive protein, were stabilized during Treg administrations, but rose during the washout period and again after therapy was discontinued. Treg therapy potentially suppresses peripheral OS and the accompanying circulating pro-inflammatory induced APPs, both of which may serve as peripheral candidates for monitoring efficacies of immunomodulating therapies.

	<p>Traumatic brain injury (TBI) remains a critical public health challenge. Although studies have found several prognostic factors for TBI, a useful early predictive tool for mortality has yet to be developed in the triage of the emergency room. This study aimed to use machine learning algorithms of artificial intelligence (AI) to develop predictive models for TBI patients in the emergency room triage. We retrospectively enrolled 18,249 adult TBI patients in the electronic medical records of three hospitals of Chi Mei Medical Group from January 2010 to December 2019, and undertook the 12 potentially predictive feature variables for predicting mortality during hospitalization. Six machine learning algorithms including logistical regression (LR) random forest (RF), support vector machines (SVM), LightGBM, XGBoost, and multilayer perceptron (MLP) were used to build the predictive model. The results showed that all six predictive models had high AUC from 0.851 to 0.925. Among these models, the LR-based model was the best model for mortality risk prediction with the highest AUC of 0.925; thus, we integrated the best model into the existed hospital information system for assisting clinical decision-making. These results revealed that the LR-based model was the best model to predict the mortality risk in patients with TBI in the emergency room. Since the developed prediction system can easily obtain the 12 feature variables during the initial triage, it can provide quick and early mortality prediction to clinicians for guiding deciding further treatment as well as helping explain the patient&amp;amp;rsquo;s condition to family members.</p>

	<p>Low-intensity transcranial ultrasound stimulation (TUS) is a novel non-invasive brain stimulation technique that uses acoustic energy to induce changes in neuronal activity. However, although low-intensity TUS is a promising neuromodulation tool, it has been poorly studied as compared to other methods, i.e., transcranial magnetic and electrical stimulation. In this article, we first focus on experimental studies in animals and humans aimed at explaining its mechanisms of action. We then highlight possible applications of TUS in movement disorders, particularly in patients with parkinsonism, dystonia, and tremor. Finally, we highlight the knowledge gaps and possible limitations that currently limit potential TUS applications in movement disorders. Clarifying the potential role of TUS in movement disorders may further promote studies with therapeutic perspectives in this field.</p>

	<p>Conventional transcranial electric stimulation(tES) using standard anatomical positions for the electrodes and standard stimulation currents is frequently not sufficiently selective in targeting and reaching specific brain locations, leading to suboptimal application of electric fields. Recent advancements in in vivo electric field characterization may enable clinical researchers to derive better relationships between the electric field strength and the clinical results. Subject-specific electric field simulations could lead to improved electrode placement and more efficient treatments. Through this narrative review, we present a processing workflow to personalize tES for focal epilepsy, for which there is a clear cortical target to stimulate. The workflow utilizes clinical imaging and electroencephalography data and enables us to relate the simulated fields to clinical outcomes. We review and analyze the relevant literature for the processing steps in the workflow, which are the following: tissue segmentation, source localization, and stimulation optimization. In addition, we identify shortcomings and ongoing trends with regard to, for example, segmentation quality and tissue conductivity measurements. The presented processing steps result in personalized tES based on metrics like focality and field strength, which allow for correlation with clinical outcomes.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Developmental Differences in Neuromagnetic Cortical Activation and Phase Synchrony Elicited by Scenes with Faces during Movie Watching</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>The neural underpinnings of humans&rsquo; ability to process faces and how it changes over typical development have been extensively studied using paradigms where face stimuli are oversimplified, isolated, and decontextualized. The prevalence of this approach, however, has resulted in limited knowledge of face processing in ecologically valid situations, in which faces are accompanied by contextual information at multiple time scales. In the present study, we use a naturalistic movie paradigm to investigate how neuromagnetic activation and phase synchronization elicited by faces from movie scenes in humans differ between children and adults. We used MEG data from 22 adults (6 females, 3 left handed; mean age, 27.7 &plusmn; 5.28 years) and 20 children (7 females, 1 left handed; mean age, 9.5 &plusmn; 1.52 years) collected during movie viewing. We investigated neuromagnetic time-locked activation and phase synchronization elicited by movie scenes containing faces in contrast to other movie scenes. Statistical differences between groups were tested using a multivariate data-driven approach. Our results revealed lower face-elicited activation and theta/alpha phase synchrony between 120 and 330 ms in children compared with adults. Reduced connectivity in children was observed between the primary visual areas as well as their connections with higher-order frontal and parietal cortical areas. This is the first study to map neuromagnetic developmental changes in face processing in a time-locked manner using a naturalistic movie paradigm. It supports and extends the existing evidence of core face-processing network maturation accompanied by the development of an extended system of higher-order cortical areas engaged in face processing.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The nucleus reuniens of the thalamus (RE) is an important node between the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and the hippocampus (HPC). Previously, we have shown that its mode of activity and its influence in mPFC–HPC communication is dependent upon brain state. During slow-wave states, RE units are closely and rhythmically coupled to the ongoing mPFC-slow oscillation (SO), while during activated (theta) states, RE neurons fire in an arrhythmic and tonically active manner. Inactivating the RE selectively impoverishes coordination of the SO between mPFC and HPC and interestingly, both mPFC and RE stimulation during the SO cause larger responses in the HPC than during theta. It is unclear if the activity patterns within the RE across states may play a role in both phenomena. Here, we optogenetically excited RE neurons in a tonic fashion to assess the impact on mPFC-HPC coupling. This stimulation decreased the influence of mPFC stimulation in the HPC during SO states, in a manner similar to what is observed across state changes into theta. Importantly, this type of stimulation had no effect on evoked responses during theta. Perhaps more interestingly, tonic optogenetic excitation of the RE also decreased mPFC-HPC SO coherence. Thus, it may not be the integrity of the RE per se that is responsible for efficient communication between mPFC and HPC, but rather the particular state in which RE neurons find themselves. Our results have direct implications for how distant brain regions can communicate most effectively, an issue that is ultimately important for activity-dependent processes occurring during slow-wave sleep-dependent memory consolidation.</p>

Poor controls on corruption (CoC), high uncertainty avoidance (UA) and performance vs. cooperation orientation (POCO) of societies have been found to explain much of this higher consumption in Southern European countries.  We hypothesized that these predictors were in turn influenced by the Protestant Reformation in the 16th century onwards. Methods: We used structural equation modelling (SEM) to assess the relationships between country-level proportions being Protestant, CoC, UA, POCO and four markers of antimicrobial consumption in the community (all antibacterials, cephalosporin, macrolides and fluoroquinolones). Results: The proportion of a country that was Protestant was negatively correlated with the consumption of all antibacterials. SEM revealed that UA predicted all antibacterial consumption (direct effect coef. 0.15, 95% Confidence Interval [CI] 0.04-0.26). The proportion Protestant exerted an indirect effect on consumption (coef. -0.13, 95% CI -0.21- -0.05). This effect was mediated predominantly via its effect on UA (direct effect coef. 0.15, 95% CI 0.04-0.26). The model explained 37% of the variation in consumption.  Similar results were obtained for each of the other three classes of antimicrobials investigated. Conclusions: Our results are compatible with the theory that contemporary differences in antimicrobial consumption in Europe stem in part from cultural differences that emerged in the Reformation. These findings may explain the differential efficacy of similar antibiotic stewardship campaigns in Northern and Southern European populations.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Gene regulation by a protein translation factor at the single-cell level</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Roswitha Dolcemascolo, Lucas Goiriz, Roser Montagud-Martínez, Guillermo Rodrigo</p>

Gene expression is inherently stochastic and pervasively regulated. While substantial work combining theory and experiments has been carried out to study how noise propagates through transcriptional regulations, the stochastic behavior of genes regulated at the level of translation is poorly understood. Here, we engineered a synthetic genetic system in which a target gene is down-regulated by a protein translation factor, which in turn is regulated transcriptionally. By monitoring both the expression of the regulator and the regulated gene at the single-cell level, we quantified the stochasticity of the system. We found that with a protein translation factor a tight repression can be achieved in single cells, noise propagation from gene to gene is buffered, and the regulated gene is sensitive in a nonlinear way to global perturbations in translation. A suitable mathematical model was instrumental to predict the transfer functions of the system. We also showed that a Gamma distribution parameterized with mesoscopic parameters, such as the mean expression and coefficient of variation, provides a deep analytical explanation about the system, displaying enough versatility to capture the cell-to-cell variability in genes regulated both transcriptionally and translationally. Overall, these results contribute to enlarge our understanding on stochastic gene expression, at the same time they provide design principles for synthetic biology.
