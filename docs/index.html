                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.03588">Controlling seizure propagation in large-scale brain networks. (arXiv:1804.03588v1 [q-bio.NC])</a></h4>

<p>Information transmission in the human brain is a fundamentally dynamic
network process. In partial epilepsy, this process is perturbed and highly
synchronous seizures originate in a local network, the so-called epileptogenic
zone (EZ), before recruiting other close or distant brain regions. We studied
patient-specific brain network models of 15 drug-resistant epilepsy patients
with implanted stereotactic electroencephalography (SEEG) electrodes. Each
personalized brain model was derived from structural data of magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) and diffusion tensor weighted imaging (DTI), comprising 88 nodes
equipped with region specific neural mass models capable of demonstrating a
range of epileptiform discharges. Each patients virtual brain was further
personalized through the integration of the clinically hypothesized EZ.
Subsequent simulations and connectivity modulations were performed and
uncovered a finite repertoire of seizure propagation patterns. Across patients,
we found that (i) patient-specific network connectivity is predictive for the
subsequent seizure propagation pattern; (ii)seizure propagation is
characterized by a systematic sequence of brain states; (iii) propagation can
be controlled by an optimal intervention on the connectivity matrix; (iv) the
degree of invasiveness can be significantly reduced via the here proposed
seizure control as compared to traditional resective surgery. To stop seizures,
neurosurgeons typically resect the EZ completely. We showed that stability
analysis of the network dynamics using graph theoretical metrics estimates
reliably the spatiotemporal properties of seizure propagation. This suggests
novel less invasive paradigms of surgical interventions to treat and manage

<p>Efficient brain simulation is a scientific grand challenge, a
parallel/distributed coding challenge and a source of requirements and
suggestions for future computing architectures. Indeed, the human brain
includes about 10^15 synapses and 10^11 neurons activated at a mean rate of
several Hz. Full brain simulation poses Exascale challenges even if simulated
at the highest abstraction level. The WaveScalES experiment in the Human Brain
Project (HBP) has the goal of matching experimental measures and simulations of
slow waves during deep-sleep and anesthesia and the transition to other brain
states. The focus is the development of dedicated large-scale
parallel/distributed simulation technologies. The ExaNeSt project designs an
ARM-based, low-power HPC architecture scalable to million of cores, developing
a dedicated scalable interconnect system, and SWA/AW simulations are included
among the driving benchmarks. At the joint between both projects is the INFN
proprietary Distributed and Plastic Spiking Neural Networks (DPSNN) simulation
engine. DPSNN can be configured to stress either the networking or the
computation features available on the execution platforms. The simulation
stresses the networking component when the neural net - composed by a
relatively low number of neurons, each one projecting thousands of synapses -
is distributed over a large number of hardware cores. When growing the number
of neurons per core, the computation starts to be the dominating component for
short range connections. This paper reports about preliminary performance
results obtained on an ARM-based HPC prototype developed in the framework of
the ExaNeSt project. Furthermore, a comparison is given of instantaneous power,
total energy consumption, execution time and energetic cost per synaptic event
of SWA/AW DPSNN simulations when executed on either ARM- or Intel-based server
platforms.

<p>This paper presents the results of our recent work on studying the effects of
deep brain stimulation (DBS) and medication on the dynamics of brain local
field potential (LFP) signals used for behavior analysis of patients with
Parkinson s disease (PD). DBS is a technique used to alleviate the severe
symptoms of PD when pharmacotherapy is not very effective. Behavior recognition
from the LFP signals recorded from the subthalamic nucleus (STN) has
application in developing closed-loop DBS systems, where the stimulation pulse
is adaptively generated according to subjects performing behavior. Most of the
existing studies on behavior recognition that use STN-LFPs are based on the DBS
being off. This paper discovers how the performance and accuracy of automated
behavior recognition from the LFP signals are affected under different
paradigms of stimulation on/off. We first study the notion of beta power
suppression in LFP signals under different scenarios (stimulation on/off and
medication on/off). Afterward, we explore the accuracy of support vector
machines in predicting human actions (button press and reach) using the
spectrogram of STN-LFP signals. Our experiments on the recorded LFP signals of
three subjects confirm that the beta power is suppressed significantly when the
patients take medication (p-value&lt;0.002) or stimulation (p-value&lt;0.0003). The
results also show that we can classify different behaviors with a reasonable
accuracy of 85% even when the high-amplitude stimulation is applied.

<p>Quantifying behavior is crucial for many applications in neuroscience.
Videography provides easy methods for the observation and recording of animal
behavior in diverse settings, yet extracting particular aspects of a behavior
for further analysis can be highly time consuming. In motor control studies,
humans or other animals are often marked with reflective markers to assist with
computer-based tracking, yet markers are intrusive (especially for smaller
animals), and the number and location of the markers must be determined a
priori. Here, we present a highly efficient method for markerless tracking
based on transfer learning with deep neural networks that achieves excellent
results with minimal training data. We demonstrate the versatility of this
framework by tracking various body parts in a broad collection of experimental
settings: mice odor trail-tracking, egg-laying behavior in drosophila, and
mouse hand articulation in a skilled forelimb task. For example, during the
skilled reaching behavior, individual joints can be automatically tracked (and
a confidence score is reported). Remarkably, even when a small number of frames
are labeled ($\approx 200$), the algorithm achieves excellent tracking
performance on test frames that is comparable to human accuracy.

Brain structure has been proposed to facilitate as well as constrain functional interactions within brain networks. Simulation models suggest that integrity of white matter (WM) microstructure should be positively related to the complexity of BOLD signal-a measure of network interactions. Using 121 young adults from the Human Connectome Project, we empirically tested whether greater WM integrity would be associated with greater complexity of the BOLD signal during rest via multiscale entropy. Multiscale entropy measures the lack of predictability within a given time series across varying time scales, thus being able to estimate fluctuating signal dynamics within brain networks. Using multivariate analysis techniques (Partial Least Squares), we found that greater WM integrity was associated with greater network complexity at fast time scales, but less network complexity at slower time scales. These findings implicate two separate pathways through which WM integrity affects brain function in the prefrontal cortex-an executive-prefrontal pathway and a perceptuo-occipital pathway. In two additional samples, the main patterns of WM and network complexity were replicated. These findings support simulation models of WM integrity and network complexity and provide new insights into brain structure-function relationships.

Mapping brain functions to their underlying neural substrates is a central goal of cognitive neuroscience. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has proven indispensable in this endeavour. Recently, there has been growing interest in tackling this problem by mapping semantic concepts onto brain regions using repositories of images and text from the neuroimaging literature. However, no study has thus far approached this problem using (dense) vector representations of words. Using data from the Neurosynth database, we sought to develop a model that could (A) capture local correlations between words in text, as well as topics, (B) capture representation of distributed brain networks in relation to word embeddings, and (C) generate synthetic images given word inputs. We show that jointly embedding words and brain imaging data on a vector space can yield semantic representations that sensibly relate concepts across biological, psychological, and observational levels of analysis. Moreover, our proposed model makes no assumption about spatial orientation of fMRI voxels, which allows for embedding of distributed brain networks onto the semantic space. We demonstrate this capability by generating synthetic brain activation vectors from word inputs. Our model has the potential to advance neuroimaging meta-analysis as well as contextual word-embedding methods more broadly.

The brain transforms nociceptive input into a complex pain experience comprised of sensory, affective, motivational, and cognitive components. However, it is still unclear how pain arises from nociceptive input, and which brain networks coordinate to generate pain experiences. We introduce a new high-dimensional mediation analysis technique to estimate distributed, network-level patterns mediating the relationship between stimulus intensity and pain. In a large-scale analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging data (N=284), we identify both traditional mediators in somatosensory brain regions and additional mediators located in prefrontal, midbrain, striatal, and default-mode regions unrelated to nociception in standard analyses. The whole brain mediators are specific for pain vs. aversive sounds and are organized in five functional networks. Brain mediators explain 32% more within-subject variance of single-trial pain ratings than previous brain-based models. Our results provide a new, broader view of the networks underlying pain experience, as well as distinct targets for interventions.

Previous studies have shown that the pupils dilate more in anticipation of larger rewards. This finding raises the possibility of a more general association between reward amount and pupil size. We tested this idea by characterizing macaque pupil responses to offered rewards during evaluation and comparison in a binary choice task. To control attention, we made use of a design in which offers occurred in sequence. By looking at pupil responses after choice but before reward, we confirmed the previously observed positive association between pupil size and anticipated reward values. Surprisingly, however, we find that pupil size is negatively correlated with the value of offered gambles before choice, during both evaluation and comparison stages of the task. These results demonstrate a functional distinction between offered and anticipated rewards, and present evidence against a narrow version of the simulation hypothesis, the idea that we represent offers by reactivating states associated with anticipating them. They also suggest that pupil size is correlated with relative, not absolute, values of offers, suggestive of an accept-reject model of comparison.

In accordance with the concept of topographic organization of neuroanatomical structures, there is an increased interest in estimating and delineating continuous changes in the functional connectivity pattern of neighboring voxels across a region using resting-state fMRI data. Fundamental to this topographic connectivity estimation is the assumption that the organizational gradient is stable across the region of interest. If, however, the region of investigation is actually comprised of multiple subdivisions with different gradients, these estimations would be misleading. Here, we present a model testing procedure to arbitrate between overlapping, shifted, or different topographic connectivity gradients across subdivisions of a structure. We found that this model selection procedure performed well in control conditions of checkerboard subdivisions, which are spatially overlapping subsamples of a region, demonstrating support for overlapping gradients. We then applied the procedure to the striatum, a subcortical structure consisting of the caudate nucleus and putamen, in which an extensive literature suggest to have a shared topographic organization of a diagonal gradient. We found, across multiple resting state fMRI data samples of different spatial resolutions in humans, and one macaque resting state fMRI data sample, that the model with different connectivity gradients across the caudate and putamen was preferred across all data samples. More specifically, within the caudate, we replicated the diagonal organization, but also revealed a medial-lateral organization. Clustering of the putamen only revealed the diagonal gradient. These findings demonstrate the importance of testing basic assumptions even in the case of strong literature support. Indeed, preforming the same analysis assuming a unitary gradient obfuscates the medial-lateral organization of the caudate. Further studies are needed to determine the importance of differential connection gradients across the putamen and caudate and the medial-lateral gradient of the caudate in humans.

Spike-and-wave discharges (SpW) are seen in absence-type epilepsies. They are heterogeneous in terms of their clinical burden and their electrographic signature, which is used to classify different types of absence seizures; typical absence, in which SpW frequency is 3-4Hz and atypical absence, which shows a slower 1-2Hz frequency. Treatment of SpW varies dependent upon the syndrome, but both Valproic Acid (VPA) and Ethosuximide (ESM) are shown to be effective in controlling typical absence seizures. Other anti-epileptic's (AED's), Levetiracetam (LEV) and Rufinamide (RUF), have shown promise in treating absence epilepsies and their associated syndromes. Here we examine the efficacy of these AED's on an in vitro model of SpW. Both LEV and RUF show an effective reduction in both the number of SpW events and the spike component amplitude; VPA shows no effect, whilst ESM enhances the spike amplitude. Phenytoin exacerbates the SpW activity, increasing both the number of SpW, amplitude of the SpW and the number of spikes within each event. These data suggest that both LEV and RUF could be effective in the treatment of absence-type epilepsies. They also suggest this model could be an effective tool to test other AED's aimed at treating atypical absence syndromes.

Transient neural activity pervades hippocampal electrophysiological activity. During more quiescent states, brief {approx}100 ms periods comprising large {approx}150-250 Hz oscillations known as sharp-wave ripples (SWR) which co-occur with ensemble bursts of spiking activity, are regularly found in local field potentials recorded from area CA1. SWRs and their concomitant neural activity are thought to be important for memory consolidation, recall, and memory-guided decision making. Temporally-selective manipulations of hippocampal neural activity upon online hippocampal SWR detection have been used as causal evidence of the importance of SWR for mnemonic process as evinced by behavioral and/or physiological changes. However, though this approach is becoming more wide spread, the performance trade-offs involved in building a SWR detection and disruption system have not been explored, limiting the design and interpretation of SWR detection experiments. We present an open source, plug-and-play, online ripple detection system with a detailed performance characterization. Our system has been constructed to interface with an open source software platform, Trodes, and two hardware acquisition platforms, Open Ephys and SpikeGadgets. We show that our in vivo results -- approximately 80% detection latencies falling in between {approx}20-66 ms with {approx}2 ms closed-loop latencies while maintaining &lt;10 false detections per minute -- are dependent upon both algorithmic trade-offs and acquisition hardware. We discuss strategies to improve detection accuracy and potential limitations of online ripple disruptions. By characterizing this system in detail, we present a template for analyzing other closed-loop neural detection and perturbation systems. Thus, we anticipate our modular, open source, realtime system will facilitate a wide range of carefully-designed causal closed-loop neuroscience experiments.

There has recently been a large increase in the number of children placed in foster care in the United States and Europe. While this is the least worst scenario for those with a lack of appropriate biological care, it is recognised that these children are exposed to major stressors correlated with behavioural changes, particularly in the realm of social cognition into adulthood. Here we model foster care in rodents: rat pups are removed from their biological mother and placed with a non-genetically related dam. This prevented the entorhinal cortex from generating patterns of gamma rhythms required for normal parahippocampal function relevant to social interaction. These changes correlate with a reduction in NMDA receptor-mediated excitation, and changes in parvalbumin expression in interneurons. These data suggest that early life care delivered by a non-biological parent may disrupt social behaviour but, in contrast, generate neurobiological changes antagonistic to those currently associated with psychosis.

The Piwi pathway is a conserved gene regulatory mechanism comprised of Piwi-like proteins and Piwi-interacting RNAs, which modulates gene expression via RNA interference and epigenetic mechanisms. The mammalian Piwi pathway has been defined by its role in transposon control during spermatogenesis, and despite an increasing number of studies demonstrating its expression in the nervous system, relatively little is known about its function in neurons or potential contribution to gene regulation in the brain. We have discovered that all three Piwi-like genes are expressed in several regions of the mouse brain, and that simultaneous knockdown of Piwil1 and Piwil2 in the adult mouse hippocampus enhances contextual fear memory without affecting generalised anxiety. Our results implicate the Piwi pathway in control of plasticity-related gene expression in the adult mammalian brain.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/296764v1?rss=1">First in-human PET study of 3 novel tau radiopharmaceuticals: RO6958948</a></h4>

Background: [11C]RO-963, [11C]RO-643 and [18F]RO-948 (previously referred as [11C]RO6924963, [11C]RO6931643, and [18F]RO6958948, respectively) have been reported as promising PET tracers for tau imaging based on in vitro and preclinical PET data (1,2). Here we describe the first human evaluation of these novel radiotracers. Methods: Amyloid PET positive Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and young healthy subjects (YC) each received two different tau tracers. Dynamic 90 min scans were obtained after bolus injection of [11C]RO-963, [11C]RO-643 or [18F]RO-948. Arterial blood sampling was performed in 11 healthy controls (HC) and 11 AD. Regions were defined on MRI, and PET data were quantified by plasma reference graphical analysis (for VT) and target cerebellum ratio (SUVR60-90). SUVR images were also analyzed voxelwise. Five older healthy subjects (OC) each received two scans with [18F]RO-948 for evaluation of test-retest variability. Four AD subjects received a repeat [18F]RO-948 scan over about 1 year. Six additional HC (3M: 3F; 41-67y) each received one whole body dosimetry scan with [18F]RO-948. Results: In YC, peak SUV values were observed in the temporal lobe with values of approximately 3.0 for [11C]RO-963, 1.5 for [11C]RO-643 and 3.5 for [18F]RO-948. Over all brain regions and subjects, the trend was that [18F]RO-948 had the highest peak SUV value, followed by [11C]RO-963, and then [11C]RO-643. Regional analysis of SUVR and VT for [11C]RO-643 and [18F]RO-948 clearly discriminated AD and HC groups. Compartmental modeling confirmed that [11C]RO-643 had lower brain entry than both [18F]RO-963 and [18F]RO-948, and [18F]RO-948 showed a better contrast between (predicted) areas of high vs low tau accumulation. Thus, our subsequent analysis focused on [18F]RO-948. Both voxelwise and region-based analysis of [18F]RO-948 binding in HC vs AD revealed multiple areas where AD and HC significantly differed. Of 22 high-binding regions, 13 showed significant group difference (following ANOVA, F=45, p&lt;10-5). Voxelwise analysis also revealed a set of symmetrical clusters where AD&gt;HC (threshold of p&lt;0.001, cluster size k&gt;50). Conclusions: [18F]RO-948 demonstrates superior characteristics to [11C]RO-643 and [18F]RO-963 for characterization of tau pathology in AD. Regional binding data and kinetic properties of RO-948 compare favorably with existing other tau PET tracers.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/296061v1?rss=1">Word selectivity in high-level visual cortex and reading skill</a></h4>

Word-selective neural responses in human ventral occipito-temporal cortex (VOTC) emerge as children learn to read, creating a visual word form area (VWFA) in the literate brain. It has been suggested that the VWFA arises through competition between pre-existing selectivity for other stimulus categories, changing the topography of VOTC to support rapid word recognition. Here, we hypothesized that competition between words and objects would be resolved as children acquire reading skill. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we examined the relationship between responses to words and objects in VOTC in two ways. First, we defined the VWFA using a words &gt; objects contrast and found that only skilled readers had this region. Second, we defined the VWFA using a words &gt; faces contrast and examined selectivity for words over objects in this region. We found that word selectivity strongly correlated with reading skill, suggesting reading skill-dependent tuning for words. Furthermore, we found that low word selectivity in struggling readers was not due to a lack of response to words, but due to a high response to objects. Our results suggest that the fine-tuning of word-selective responses in VOTC is a critical component of skilled reading.

Motor action is prepared in the human brain for rapid initiation at the appropriate time. Recent non-invasive decoding techniques have shown that brain activity for action preparation represents various parameters of an upcoming action. In the present study, we demonstrated that a freely chosen effector can be predicted from brain activity measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) before initiation of the action. Furthermore, the activity was related to response time (RT). We measured brain activity with fMRI while 12 participants performed a finger-tapping task using either the left or right hand, which was freely chosen by them. Using fMRI decoding, we identified brain regions in which activity during the preparatory period could predict the hand used for the upcoming action. We subsequently evaluated the relationship between brain activity and the RT of the upcoming action to determine whether correct decoding was associated with short RT. We observed that activity in the supplementary motor area, dorsal premotor cortex, and primary motor cortex measured before action execution predicted the hand used to perform the action with significantly above-chance accuracy (approximately 70%). Furthermore, in most participants, the RT was shorter in trials for which the used hand was correctly predicted. The present study showed that preparatory activity in cortical motor areas represents information about the effector used for an upcoming action, and that well-formed motor representations in these regions are associated with reduced response times.

Serial electron microscopic analysis shows that the Drosophila brain at hatching possesses a large fraction of developmentally arrested neurons with a small soma, heterochromatin-rich nucleus, and unbranched axon lacking synapses. We digitally reconstructed all 812 small undifferentiated (SU) neurons and assigned them to the known brain lineages. 54 SU neurons belonging to the DM1-4 lineages, which generate all columnar neurons of the central complex, form an embryonic nucleus of the fan-shaped body (FB). These FB pioneers develop into a specific class of bi-columnar elements, the pontine neurons. Even though later born, unicolumnar DM1-4 neurons fasciculate with the FB pioneers, selective ablation of these cells did not result in gross abnormalities of the trajectories of unicolumnar neurons, indicating that axonal pathfinding of the two systems is controlled independently. Our comprehensive spatial and developmental analysis of the SU neuron adds to our understanding of the establishment of neuronal circuitry.

<p>by Travers Ching, Xun Zhu, Lana X. Garmire</p>

Artificial neural networks (ANN) are computing architectures with many interconnections of simple neural-inspired computing elements, and have been applied to biomedical fields such as imaging analysis and diagnosis. We have developed a new ANN framework called Cox-nnet to predict patient prognosis from high throughput transcriptomics data. In 10 TCGA RNA-Seq data sets, Cox-nnet achieves the same or better predictive accuracy compared to other methods, including Cox-proportional hazards regression (with LASSO, ridge, and mimimax concave penalty), Random Forests Survival and CoxBoost. Cox-nnet also reveals richer biological information, at both the pathway and gene levels. The outputs from the hidden layer node provide an alternative approach for survival-sensitive dimension reduction. In summary, we have developed a new method for accurate and efficient prognosis prediction on high throughput data, with functional biological insights.

Publication date: August 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 51<br />     Author(s): Ngang Heok   Tang, Yishi   Jin<br /> Development of a neuron critically depends on the organization of its cytoskeleton. Cytoskeletal components, such as tubulins and actins, have the remarkable ability to organize themselves into filaments and networks to support specialized and compartmentalized functions. Alterations in cytoskeletal proteins have long been associated with a variety of neurodevelopmental disorders. This review focuses on recent findings, primarily from forward genetic screens in Caenorhabditis elegans that illustrate how different tubulin protein isotypes can play distinct roles in neuronal development and function. Additionally, we discuss studies revealing new regulators of the actin cytoskeleton, and highlight recent technological advances in in vivo imaging and functional dissection of the neuronal cytoskeleton. <br /><br />

Molecular-level functional magnetic resonance imaging (molecular fMRI) is a new technology that can help bridge these scales by mapping defined microscopic phenomena over large, optically inaccessible regions of the living brain. In this review, we explain how MRI-detectable imaging probes can be used to sensitize noninvasive imaging to mechanistically significant components of neural processing. We discuss how a combination of innovative probe design, advanced imaging methods, and strategies for brain delivery can make molecular fMRI an increasingly successful approach for spatiotemporally resolved studies of diverse neural phenomena, perhaps eventually in people. <br /><br />

Publication date: June 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 50<br />     Author(s): Guosong   Hong, Xiao   Yang, Tao   Zhou, Charles M   Lieber<br /> Existing implantable neurotechnologies for understanding the brain and treating neurological diseases have intrinsic properties that have limited their capability to achieve chronically-stable brain interfaces with single-neuron spatiotemporal resolution. These limitations reflect what has been dichotomy between the structure and mechanical properties of living brain tissue and non-living neural probes. To bridge the gap between neural and electronic networks, we have introduced the new concept of mesh electronics probes designed with structural and mechanical properties such that the implant begins to ‘look and behave’ like neural tissue. Syringe-implanted mesh electronics have led to the realization of probes that are neuro-attractive and free of the chronic immune response, as well as capable of stable long-term mapping and modulation of brain activity at the single-neuron level. This review provides a historical overview of a 10-year development of mesh electronics by highlighting the tissue-like design, syringe-assisted delivery, seamless neural tissue integration, and single-neuron level chronic recording stability of mesh electronics. We also offer insights on unique near-term opportunities and future directions for neuroscience and neurology that now are available or expected for mesh electronics neurotechnologies. <br /><br />

Publication date: August 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 51<br />     Author(s): Anne   Bertolotti<br /> Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's, Huntington's, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and prion disorders are devastating neurodegenerative diseases of increasing prevalence in aging populations. Although clinically different, they share similar molecular features: the accumulation of one or two proteins in abnormal conformations inside or outside neurons. Enhancing protein quality control systems could be a useful strategy to neutralize the abnormal proteins causing neurodegenerative diseases. This review emphasizes the subcellular location of protein deposits in neurodegenerative diseases and the need to tailor strategies aimed at boosting protein quality control systems to the affected subcellular compartment. Inhibition of a protein phosphatase terminating the unfolded protein response will be discussed as a strategy to protect from diseases associated with misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum. <br /><br />

Human neuroimaging studies consistently show a hunger-dependent, selective enhancement of responses to images of food in association cortex and amygdala. More recently, cellular-resolution imaging combined with circuit mapping experiments in behaving mice have revealed underlying neuronal population dynamics and enabled tracing of pathways by which hunger circuits influence the assignment of value to visual objects in visual association cortex, insular cortex, and amygdala. These experiments begin to provide a mechanistic understanding of motivation-specific neural processing of need-relevant cues in healthy humans and in disease states such as obesity and other eating disorders. <br /><br />

Publication date: June 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 50<br />     Author(s): Jian   Ma, Zhongfu   Shen, Yong-Chun   Yu, Song-Hai   Shi<br /> Delineating the lineage of neural cells that captures the progressive steps in their specification is fundamental to understanding brain development, organization, and function. Since the earliest days of embryology, lineage questions have been addressed with methods of increasing specificity, capacity, and resolution. Yet, a full realization of individual cell lineages remains challenging for complex systems. A recent explosion of technical advances in genome-editing and single-cell sequencing has enabled lineage analysis in an unprecedented scale, speed, and depth across different species. In this review, we discuss the application of available as well as future genetic labeling techniques for tracking neural lineages in vivo in the mammalian nervous system. <br /><br />

Publication date: August 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 51<br />     Author(s): Sylvain   Rama, Mickaël   Zbili, Dominique   Debanne<br /> Axons link distant brain regions and are usually considered as simple transmission cables in which reliable propagation occurs once an action potential has been generated. Safe propagation of action potentials relies on specific ion channel expression at strategic points of the axon such as nodes of Ranvier or axonal branch points. However, while action potentials are generally considered as the quantum of neuronal information, their signaling is not entirely digital. In fact, both their shape and their conduction speed have been shown to be modulated by activity, leading to regulations of synaptic latency and synaptic strength. We report here newly identified mechanisms of (1) safe spike propagation along the axon, (2) compartmentalization of action potential shape in the axon, (3) analog modulation of spike-evoked synaptic transmission and (4) alteration in conduction time after persistent regulation of axon morphology in central neurons. We discuss the contribution of these regulations in information processing. <br /><br />

Publication date: April 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 49<br />     Author(s): Karel   Svoboda, Nuo   Li<br /> Neurons in motor cortex and connected brain regions fire in anticipation of specific movements, long before movement occurs. This neural activity reflects internal processes by which the brain plans and executes volitional movements. The study of motor planning offers an opportunity to understand how the structure and dynamics of neural circuits support persistent internal states and how these states influence behavior. Recent advances in large-scale neural recordings are beginning to decipher the relationship of the dynamics of populations of neurons during motor planning and movements. New behavioral tasks in rodents, together with quantified perturbations, link dynamics in specific nodes of neural circuits to behavior. These studies reveal a neural network distributed across multiple brain regions that collectively supports motor planning. We review recent advances and highlight areas where further work is needed to achieve a deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying motor planning and related cognitive processes. <br /><br />

Publication date: June 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 50<br />     Author(s): Andy   Zhou, Benjamin C   Johnson, Rikky   Muller<br /> Closed-loop and responsive neuromodulation systems improve open-loop neurostimulation by responding directly to measured neural activity and providing adaptive, on-demand therapy. To be effective, these systems must be able to simultaneously record and stimulate neural activity, a task made difficult by persistent stimulation artifacts that distort and obscure underlying biomarkers. To enable simultaneous stimulation and recording, several techniques have been proposed. These techniques involve artifact-preventing system configurations, resilient recording front-ends, and back-end signal processing for removing recorded artifacts. Co-designing and integrating these artifact cancellation techniques will be key to enabling neuromodulation systems to stimulate and record at the same time. Here, we review the state-of-the-art for these techniques and their role in achieving artifact-free neuromodulation. <br /><br />

Publication date: June 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 50<br />     Author(s): Gilles C   .Vanwalleghem, Misha B   Ahrens, Ethan K   Scott<br /> Due to their small size and transparency, zebrafish larvae are amenable to a range of fluorescence microscopy techniques. With the development of sensitive genetically encoded calcium indicators, this has extended to the whole-brain imaging of neural activity with cellular resolution. This technique has been used to study brain-wide population dynamics accompanying sensory processing and sensorimotor transformations, and has spurred the development of innovative closed-loop behavioral paradigms in which stimulus–response relationships can be studied. More recently, microscopes have been developed that allow whole-brain calcium imaging in freely swimming and behaving larvae. In this review, we highlight the technologies underlying whole-brain functional imaging in zebrafish, provide examples of the sensory and motor processes that have been studied with this technique, and discuss the need to merge data from whole-brain functional imaging studies with neurochemical and anatomical information to develop holistic models of functional neural circuits. <br /><br />

Publication date: June 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 50<br />     Author(s): Huan   Wang, Miao   Jing, Yulong   Li<br /> Measuring the precise dynamics of specific neurotransmitters and neuromodulators in the brain is essential for understanding how information is transmitted and processed. Thanks to the development and optimization of various genetically encoded sensors, we are approaching the stage in which a few key neurotransmitters/neuromodulators can be imaged with high cell specificity and good signal-to-noise ratio. Here, we summarize recent progress regarding these sensors, focusing on their design principles, properties, potential applications, and current limitations. We also highlight the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) scaffold as a promising platform that may enable the scalable development of the next generation of sensors, enabling the rapid, sensitive, and specific detection of a large repertoire of neurotransmitters/neuromodulators in vivo at cellular or even subcellular resolution. <br /> <h3 class="h3">Graphical abstract</h3> <img alt="image" height="165" src="http://origin-ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0959438817301915-fx1.jpg" width="301" /><br />

Microelectrode arrays based on complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology, such as Neuropixels probes, look set to transform these methods. Neuropixels probes provide ∼1000 recording sites on an extremely narrow shank, with on-board amplification, digitization, and multiplexing. They deliver low-noise recordings from hundreds of neurons, providing a step change in the type of data available to neuroscientists. Here we discuss the opportunities afforded by these probes for large-scale electrophysiology, the challenges associated with data processing and anatomical localization, and avenues for further improvements of the technology. <br /><br />

Publication date: June 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 50<br />     Author(s): Miao   He, Z Josh   Huang<br /> Understanding brain circuit organization and function requires systematic dissection of its cellular components. With vast cell number and diversity, mammalian nervous systems present a daunting challenge for achieving specific and comprehensive cell type access—prerequisite to circuit analysis. Genetic approaches in the mouse have relied on germline engineering to access marker-defined cell populations. Combinatorial strategies that engage marker intersection, anatomy and projection pattern (e.g. antero-grade and retro-grade viral vectors), and developmental lineage substantially increase the specificity of cell type targeting. While increasing number of mouse cell types are becoming experimentally accessible, comprehensive coverage requires larger coordinated efforts with strategic infrastructural and fiscal planning. CRISPR-based genome editing may enable cell type access in other species, but issues of time, cost and ethics remain, especially for primates. Novel approaches that bypass the germline, such as somatic cell engineering and cell surface-based gene delivery, may reduce the barrier of genetic access to mammalian cell types. <br /><br />

Publication date: June 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 50<br />     Author(s): I-Wen   Chen, Eirini   Papagiakoumou, Valentina   Emiliani<br /> Optogenetics neuronal targeting combined with single-photon wide-field illumination has already proved its enormous potential in neuroscience, enabling the optical control of entire neuronal networks and disentangling their role in the control of specific behaviors. However, establishing how a single or a sub-set of neurons controls a specific behavior, or how functionally identical neurons are connected in a particular task, or yet how behaviors can be modified in real-time by the complex wiring diagram of neuronal connections requires more sophisticated approaches enabling to drive neuronal circuits activity with single-cell precision and millisecond temporal resolution. This has motivated on one side the development of flexible optical methods for two-photon (2P) optogenetic activation using either, or a hybrid of two approaches: scanning and parallel illumination. On the other side, it has stimulated the engineering of new opsins with modified spectral characteristics, channel kinetics and spatial distribution of expression, offering the necessary flexibility of choosing the appropriate opsin for each application. The need for optical manipulation of multiple targets with millisecond temporal resolution has imposed three-dimension (3D) parallel holographic illumination as the technique of choice for optical control of neuronal circuits organized in 3D. Today 3D parallel illumination exists in several complementary variants, each with a different degree of simplicity, light uniformity, temporal precision and axial resolution. In parallel, the possibility to reach hundreds of targets in 3D volumes has prompted the development of low-repetition rate amplified laser sources enabling high peak power, while keeping low average power for stimulating each cell. All together those progresses open the way for a precise optical manipulation of neuronal circuits with unprecedented precision and flexibility. <br /> <h3 class="h3">Graphical abstract</h3> <img alt="image" height="245" src="http://origin-ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0959438817302477-fx1.jpg" width="249" /><br />

Publication date: August 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 51<br />     Author(s): Kelsey A   Herrmann, Heather T   Broihier<br /> Although retrograde neurotrophin signaling has provided an immensely influential paradigm for understanding growth factor signaling in the nervous system, recent studies indicate that growth factors also signal via cell-autonomous, or autocrine, mechanisms. Autocrine signals have been discovered in many neuronal contexts, providing insights into their regulation and function. The growing realization of the importance of cell-autonomous signaling stems from advances in both conditional genetic approaches and in sophisticated analyses of growth factor dynamics, which combine to enable rigorous in vivo dissection of signaling pathways. Here we review recent studies defining autocrine roles for growth factors such as BDNF, and classical morphogens, including Wnts and BMPs, in regulating neuronal development and plasticity. Collectively, these studies highlight an intimate relationship between activity-dependent autocrine signaling and synaptic plasticity, and further suggest a common principle for coordinating paracrine and autocrine signaling in the nervous system. <br /><br />

Publication date: April 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 49<br />     Author(s): Ashley L   Juavinett, Jeffrey C   Erlich, Anne K   Churchland<br /> Rodent decision-making research aims to uncover the neural circuitry underlying the ability to evaluate alternatives and select appropriate actions. Designing behavioral paradigms that provide a solid foundation to ask questions about decision-making computations and mechanisms is a difficult and often underestimated challenge. Here, we propose three dimensions on which we can consider rodent decision-making tasks: ethological validity, task complexity, and stimulus-response compatibility. We review recent research through this lens, and provide practical guidance for researchers in the decision-making field. <br /><br />

Publication date: June 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 50<br />     Author(s): Philipp   Gutruf, John A   Rogers<br /> Recently developed classes of ultraminiaturized wireless devices provide powerful capabilities in neuroscience research, as implantable light sources for simulation/inhibition via optogenetics, as integrated microfluidic systems for programmed pharmacological delivery and as multimodal sensors for physiological measurements. These platforms leverage basic advances in biocompatible materials, semiconductor device designs and systems engineering concepts to afford modes of operation that are qualitatively distinct from those of conventional approaches that tether animals to external hardware by means of optical fibers, electrical cables and/or fluidic tubing. Neuroscience studies that exploit the unique features of these technologies enable insights into neural function through targeted stimulation, inhibition and recording, with spatially and genetically precise manipulation of neural circuit activity. Experimental possibilities include studies in naturalistic, three dimensional environments, investigations of pair-wise or group related social interactions and many other scenarios of interest that cannot be addressed using traditional hardware. <br /><br />

Publication date: August 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 51<br />     Author(s): Patrick   Lüningschrör, Michael   Sendtner<br /> Regulated release of neurotransmitter depends on the orchestrated function of a large number of proteins in the presynaptic compartment. When synaptic vesicles fuse with the plasma membrane, these membranes and the attached proteins are endocytosed and either recycled or degraded. This turnover needs to be tightly regulated in a timely and spatially confined manner. Increasing evidence suggests that these mechanisms do not only serve for the removal of defective synaptic vesicles or structural proteins of the active zone but also contribute to pathways regulating synaptic strength. The corresponding presynaptic autophagy system thus appears also important for synaptic maintenance and plasticity. Exciting new studies provide evidence how the autophagy machinery recognizes and degrades synaptic components and lay the ground to understand how autophagy in the presynaptic compartment contributes to modulation and maintenance of synaptic function. <br /><br />

Publication date: August 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 51<br />     Author(s): Natali L   Chanaday, Ege T   Kavalali<br /> Presynaptic nerve terminals release neurotransmitter synchronously, asynchronously or spontaneously. During synchronous neurotransmission release is precisely coupled to action potentials, in contrast, asynchronous release events show only loose temporal coupling to presynaptic activity whereas spontaneous neurotransmission occurs independent of presynaptic activity. The mechanisms that give rise to this diversity in neurotransmitter release modes are poorly understood. Recent studies have described several presynaptic molecular pathways controlling synaptic vesicle pool segregation and recycling, which in turn may dictate distinct modes of neurotransmitter release. In this article, we review this recent work regarding neurotransmitter release modes and their relationship to synaptic vesicle pool dynamics as well as the molecular machinery that establishes synaptic vesicle pool identity. <br /><br />

Huntington’s disease is caused by the expansion of a polyglutamine (polyQ) tract in the N-terminal exon of huntingtin (HttEx1), but the cellular mechanisms leading to neurodegeneration remain poorly understood. Here we present in situ structural studies by cryo-electron tomography of an established yeast model system of polyQ toxicity.

                <h4><a href="http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0058-18.2018v1?rss=1">A Transient Dopamine Signal Represents Avoidance Value and Causally Influences the Demand to Avoid</a></h4>

Abstract<p>While an extensive literature supports the notion that mesocorticolimbic dopamine plays a role in negative reinforcement, recent evidence suggests that dopamine exclusively encodes the value of positive reinforcement. In the present study, we employed a behavioral economics approach to investigate whether dopamine plays a role in the valuation of negative reinforcement. Using rats as subjects, we first applied fast-scan cyclic voltammetry to determine that dopamine concentration decreases with the number of lever presses required to avoid electrical footshock (i.e. the economic price of avoidance). Analysis of the rate of decay of avoidance demand curves, which depict an inverse relationship between avoidance and increasing price, allows for inference of the worth an animal places on avoidance outcomes. Rapidly decaying demand curves indicate increased price sensitivity, or low worth placed on avoidance outcomes, while slow rates of decay indicate reduced price sensitivity, or greater worth placed on avoidance outcomes. We therefore used optogenetics to assess how inducing dopamine release causally modifies the demand to avoid electrical footshock in an economic setting. Increasing release at an avoidance predictive cue made animals more sensitive to price, consistent with a negative reward prediction error (i.e., the animal perceives they received a worse outcome than expected). Increasing release at avoidance made animals less sensitive to price, consistent with a positive reward prediction error (i.e., the animal perceives they received a better outcome than expected). These data demonstrate that transient dopamine release events represent the value of avoidance outcomes and can predictably modify the demand to avoid.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Dopamine is thought to play a crucial role in reward learning and directing actions toward beneficial outcomes. While the avoidance of harmful stimuli is similarly pertinent to an organism’s survival, the role of dopamine in avoidance remains controversial. Using <i>in vivo</i> electrochemistry, we observed that dopamine concentration decreased when the effort (lever presses) required to avoid electrical footshock increased. We also found that increasing dopamine at an avoidance predictive cue decreased avoidance, consistent with a negative prediction error. In contrast, increasing release at successful avoidance increased avoidance, consistent with a positive prediction error. These data demonstrate that transient dopamine release events represent the value of avoidance outcomes and capably modify avoidance.</p>

<p>The most enigmatic aspect of consciousness is the fact that it is felt, as a
subjective sensation. This particular aspect is explained by the theory
proposed here. The theory encompasses both the computation that is presumably
involved and the way in which that computation may be realized in the brain's
neurobiology. It is assumed that the brain makes an internal estimate of an
individual's own evolutionary fitness, which can be shown to produce an
irreducible, distinct cause. Communicating components of the fitness estimate
(either for external or internal use) requires inverting them. Such inversion
can be performed by the thalamocortical feedback loop in the mammalian brain,
if that loop is operating in a switched, dual-stage mode. A first
(nonconscious) stage produces forward estimates, whereas the second (conscious)
stage inverts those estimates. It is argued that inversion produces
irreducible, distinct, and spatially localized causes, which are plausibly
sensed as the feeling of consciousness.

<p>Human visual perception is a complex, dynamic and fluctuating process. In
addition to the incoming visual stimulus, it is affected by many other factors
including temporal context, both external and internal to the observer. In this
study we investigate the dynamic properties of psychophysical responses to a
continuous stream of visual near-threshold detection tasks. We manipulate the
incoming signals to have temporal structures with various characteristic
timescales. Responses of human observers to these signals are analyzed using
tools that highlight their dynamical features as well.
</p>
<p>We find that two opposing biases shape perception, and operate over distinct
timescales. Positive recency appears over short times, e.g. consecutive trials.
Adaptation, entailing an increased probability of changed response, reflects
trends over longer times. Analysis of psychometric curves conditioned on
various temporal events reveals that the balance between the two biases can
shift depending on their interplay with the temporal properties of the input
signal. A simple mathematical model reproduces the experimental data in all
stimulus regimes. Taken together, our results support the view that visual
response fluctuations reflect complex internal dynamics, possibly related to
higher cognitive processes.

The mammalian brain is composed of diverse, specialized cell populations, few of which we fully understand. To more systematically ascertain and learn from cellular specializations in the brain, we used Drop-seq to perform single-cell RNA sequencing of 690,000 cells sampled from nine regions of the adult mouse brain: frontal and posterior cortex (156,000 and 99,000 cells, respectively), hippocampus (113,000), thalamus (89,000), cerebellum (26,000), and all of the basal ganglia - the striatum (77,000), globus pallidus externus/nucleus basalis (66,000), entopeduncular/subthalamic nuclei (19,000), and the substantia nigra/ventral tegmental area (44,000). We developed computational approaches to distinguish biological from technical signals in single-cell data, then identified 565 transcriptionally distinct groups of cells, which we annotate and present through interactive online software we developed for visualizing and re-analyzing these data (DropViz). Comparison of cell classes and types across regions revealed features of brain organization. These included a neuronal gene-expression module for synthesizing axonal and presynaptic components; widely shared patterns in the combinatorial co-deployment of voltage-gated ion channels by diverse neuronal populations; functional distinctions among cells of the brain vasculature; and specialization of glutamatergic neurons across cortical regions to a degree not observed in other neuronal or non-neuronal populations. We describe systematic neuronal classifications for two complex, understudied regions of the basal ganglia, the globus pallidus externus and substantia nigra reticulata. In the striatum, where neuron types have been intensely researched, our data reveal a previously undescribed population of striatal spiny projection neurons (SPNs) comprising 4% of SPNs. The adult mouse brain cell atlas can serve as a reference for analyses of development, disease, and evolution.

Refractory focal neocortical epilepsy is a devastating disease for which there is frequently no effective treatment. Gene therapy represents a promising alternative, but treating epilepsy in this way involves irreversible changes to brain tissue, so vector design must be carefully optimized to guarantee safety without compromising efficacy. We set out to develop an epilepsy gene therapy vector optimized for clinical translation. The gene encoding the voltage-gated potassium channel Kv1.1, KCNA1, was codon-optimized for human expression and mutated to accelerate the channels' recovery from inactivation. For improved safety, this engineered potassium channel (EKC) gene was packaged into a non-integrating lentiviral vector under the control of a cell type-specific CAMK2A promoter. In a blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled pre-clinical trial, the EKC lentivector robustly reduced seizure frequency in a rat model of focal neocortical epilepsy characterized by discrete spontaneous seizures. This demonstration of efficacy in a clinically relevant setting, combined with the improved safety conferred by cell type-specific expression and integration-deficient delivery, identify EKC gene therapy as ready for clinical translation in the treatment of refractory focal epilepsy.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/298406v1?rss=1">Hard decisions shape the neural coding of preferences</a></h4>

Hard decisions between equally valued alternatives can result in preference changes, meaning that subsequent valuations for chosen items increase and decrease for rejected items. Previous research suggests that this phenomenon is a consequence of cognitive dissonance reduction after the decision, induced by the mismatch between initial preferences and decision outcomes. In contrast, this functional magnetic resonance imaging and eye-tracking study tested whether preferences are already updated online while making decisions. Preference changes could be predicted from activity in left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and precuneus during decision-making. Furthermore, fixation durations predicted both choice outcomes and subsequent preference changes. These preference adjustments became behaviourally relevant at re-evaluation, but only for choices that were remembered and were associated with hippocampus activity. Our findings refute classical explanations of post-choice dissonance reduction and instead suggest that preferences evolve dynamically as decisions arise, potentially as a mechanism to prevent stalemate situations in underdetermined decision scenarios.

Dementia is characterised by its progressive degeneration of cognitive abilities. In research cohorts, detailed neuropsychological test batteries are often administered to better understand how cognition changes over time. Understanding cognitive changes in dementia is of great importance, particularly in determining how structural changes in the brain may affect cognition and in facilitating earlier detection of symptomatic changes. Disease progression models are often applied to these data to understand how a disease changes over time from cross-sectional data or to disease trajectories from large numbers of individuals. Previous disease progression models used to build longitudinal models from cross-sectional data have focused on brain imaging data; however, these models are not directly applicable to cognitive data. Here we use the novel, non-parametric, Kernel Density Estimation Mixture Modelling (KDEMM) approach and demonstrate accurate modelling of the progression of cognitive test data. We found that using KDEMM resulted in more accurate models of disease progression in simulated data compared to Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) for the majority of parameters used to simulate the data. When comparing KDEMM and GMM to cognitive data collected in different Alzheimer's Disease subtypes, we found the KDEMM resulted in a model much more in line with clinical phenotype. We anticipate that the KDEMM will be used to integrate cognitive test data, and other non-normally distributed datasets into complex disease progression models.

We present a computational model of spatial navigation comprising different learning mechanisms in mammals, i.e., associative, cognitive mapping and parallel systems. This model is able to reproduce a large number of experimental results in different variants of the Morris water maze task, including standard associative phenomena (spatial generalization gradient and blocking), as well as navigation based on cognitive mapping. Furthermore, we show that competitive and cooperative patterns between different navigation strategies in the model allow to explain previous apparently contradictory results supporting either associative or cognitive mechanisms for spatial learning. The key computational mechanism to reconcile experimental results showing different influences of distal and proximal cues on the behavior, different learning times, and different abilities of individuals to alternatively perform spatial and response strategies, relies in the dynamic coordination of navigation strategies, whose performance is evaluated online with a common currency through a modular approach. We provide a set of concrete experimental predictions to further test the computational model. Overall, this computational work sheds new light on inter-individual differences in navigation learning, and provides a formal and mechanistic approach to test various theories of spatial cognition in mammals.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ErL2lgBM7O0" width="1" />

<p>by Arnaud Messé, Marc-Thorsten Hütt, Claus C. Hilgetag</p>

The relationship between the structural connectivity (SC) and functional connectivity (FC) of neural systems is of central importance in brain network science. It is an open question, however, how the SC-FC relationship depends on specific topological features of brain networks or the models used for describing neural dynamics. Using a basic but general model of discrete excitable units that follow a susceptible—excited—refractory activity cycle (SER model), we here analyze how the network activity patterns underlying functional connectivity are shaped by the characteristic topological features of the network. We develop an analytical framework for describing the contribution of essential topological elements, such as common inputs and pacemakers, to the coactivation of nodes, and demonstrate the validity of the approach by comparison of the analytical predictions with numerical simulations of various exemplar networks. The present analytic framework may serve as an initial step for the mechanistic understanding of the contributions of brain network topology to brain dynamics.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/-BJLyjXZ7qg" width="1" />

<p>by Wolfgang Giese, Gregor Milicic, Andreas Schröder, Edda Klipp</p>

The spatial architecture of signaling pathways and the interaction with cell size and morphology are complex, but little understood. With the advances of single cell imaging and single cell biology, it becomes crucial to understand intracellular processes in time and space. Activation of cell surface receptors often triggers a signaling cascade including the activation of membrane-attached and cytosolic signaling components, which eventually transmit the signal to the cell nucleus. Signaling proteins can form steep gradients in the cytosol, which cause strong cell size dependence. We show that the kinetics at the membrane-cytosolic interface and the ratio of cell membrane area to the enclosed cytosolic volume change the behavior of signaling cascades significantly. We suggest an estimate of average concentration for arbitrary cell shapes depending on the cell volume and cell surface area. The normalized variance, known from image analysis, is suggested as an alternative measure to quantify the deviation from the average concentration. A mathematical analysis of signal transduction in time and space is presented, providing analytical solutions for different spatial arrangements of linear signaling cascades. Quantification of signaling time scales reveals that signal propagation is faster at the membrane than at the nucleus, while this time difference decreases with the number of signaling components in the cytosol. Our investigations are complemented by numerical simulations of non-linear cascades with feedback and asymmetric cell shapes. We conclude that intracellular signal propagation is highly dependent on cell geometry and, thereby, conveys information on cell size and shape to the nucleus.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/dutkoudOSkg" width="1" />

Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has been widely applied to discover new cell types by detecting sub-populations in a heterogeneous group of cells. Since scRNA-seq experiments have lower read coverage/tag counts and introduce more technical biases compared to bulk RNA-seq experiments, the limited number of sampled cells combined with the experimental biases and other dataset specific variations presents a challenge to cross-dataset analysis and discovery of relevant biological variations across multiple cell populations. In this paper, we introduce a method of variance-driven multitask clustering of single-cell RNA-seq data (scVDMC) that utilizes multiple single-cell populations from biological replicates or different samples. scVDMC clusters single cells in multiple scRNA-seq experiments of similar cell types and markers but varying expression patterns such that the scRNA-seq data are better integrated than typical pooled analyses which only increase the sample size. By controlling the variance among the cell clusters within each dataset and across all the datasets, scVDMC detects cell sub-populations in each individual experiment with shared cell-type markers but varying cluster centers among all the experiments. Applied to two real scRNA-seq datasets with several replicates and one large-scale Drop-seq dataset on three patient samples, scVDMC more accurately detected cell populations and known cell markers than pooled clustering and other recently proposed scRNA-seq clustering methods. In the case study applied to in-house Recessive Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa (RDEB) scRNA-seq data, scVDMC revealed several new cell types and unknown markers validated by flow cytometry.

<p>The ability to sense time and anticipate events is critical for survival. Learned responses that allow anticipation of the availability of food or water have been intensively studied. While anticipatory behaviors also occur prior to availability of regularly available rewards, there has been relatively little work on anticipation of drugs of abuse, specifically methamphetamine (MA). In the present study, we used a protocol that avoided possible CNS effects of stresses of handling or surgery by testing anticipation of MA availability in animals living in their home cages, with daily voluntary access to the drug at a fixed time of day. Anticipation was operationalized as the amount of wheel running prior to MA availability. Mice were divided into four groups given access to either nebulized MA or water, in early or late day. Animals with access to MA, but not water controls, showed anticipatory activity, with more anticipation in early compared to late day and significant interaction effects. Next, we explored the neural basis of the MA anticipation, using c-FOS expression, in animals euthanized at the usual time of nebulization access. In the dorsomedial hypothalamus (DMH) and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), the pattern of c-FOS expression paralleled that of anticipatory behavior, with significant main and interaction effects of treatment and time of day. The results for the lateral septum (LS) were significant for main effects and marginally significant for interaction effects. These studies suggest that anticipation of MA is associated with activation of brain regions important in circadian timing, emotional regulation, and decision making.</p>

Abstract
<p>Dopamine has been associated with risky decision-making, as well as with pathological gambling, a behavioral addiction characterized by excessive risk-taking behavior. However, the specific mechanisms through which dopamine might act to foster risk-taking and pathological gambling remain elusive. Here we test the hypothesis that this might be achieved, in part, via modulation of subjective probability weighting during decision making. Human healthy controls (<i>n</i> = 21) and pathological gamblers (<i>n</i> = 16) played a decision-making task involving choices between sure monetary options and risky gambles both in the gain and loss domains. Each participant played the task twice, either under placebo or the dopamine D<sub>2</sub>/D<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonist sulpiride, in a double-blind counterbalanced design. A prospect theory modelling approach was used to estimate subjective probability weighting and sensitivity to monetary outcomes. Consistent with prospect theory, we found that participants presented a distortion in the subjective weighting of probabilities, i.e., they overweighted low probabilities and underweighted moderate to high probabilities, both in the gain and loss domains. Compared with placebo, sulpiride attenuated this distortion in the gain domain. Across drugs, the groups did not differ in their probability weighting, although gamblers consistently underweighted losing probabilities in the placebo condition. Overall, our results reveal that dopamine D<sub>2</sub>/D<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonism modulates the subjective weighting of probabilities in the gain domain, in the direction of more objective, economically rational decision making.</p>

Abstract
<p>Interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC) regulate smooth muscle excitability and motility in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. ICC in the deep muscular plexus (ICC-DMP) of the small intestine are aligned closely with varicosities of enteric motor neurons and thought to transduce neural responses. ICC-DMP generate Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients that activate Ca<sup>2+</sup> activated Cl<sup>-</sup> channels and generate electrophysiological responses. We tested the hypothesis that excitatory neurotransmitters regulate Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in ICC-DMP as a means of regulating intestinal muscles. High-resolution confocal microscopy was used to image Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in ICC-DMP within murine small intestinal muscles with cell-specific expression of GCaMP3. Intrinsic nerves were stimulated by electrical field stimulation (EFS). ICC-DMP exhibited ongoing Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients before stimuli were applied. EFS caused initial suppression of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients, followed by escape during sustained stimulation, and large increases in Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients after cessation of stimulation. Basal Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity and the excitatory phases of Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses to EFS were inhibited by atropine and neurokinin 1 receptor (NK1) antagonists, but not by NK2 receptor antagonists. Exogenous ACh and substance P (SP) increased Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients, atropine and NK1 antagonists decreased Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients. Neurokinins appear to be released spontaneously (tonic excitation) in small intestinal muscles and are the dominant excitatory neurotransmitters. Subcellular regulation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> release events in ICC-DMP may be a means by which excitatory neurotransmission organizes intestinal motility patterns.</p>

Abstract<p>Fragile X premutation disorder is caused by CGG triplet repeat expansions in the 5’ UTR of FMR1 mRNA. The question how expanded CGG repeats cause disease is a subject of continuing debate. Our work indicates that CGG-repeat structures compete with regulatory BC1 RNA for access to RNA transport factor hnRNP A2. As a result, BC1 RNA is mislocalized in vivo as its synapto-dendritic presence is severely diminished in brains of CGG-repeat knock-in animals (a premutation mouse model). Lack of BC1 RNA is known to cause seizure activity and cognitive dysfunction (Zhong et al., 2009; Chung et al., 2017; Iacoangeli et al., 2017). Our working hypothesis thus predicted that absence, or significantly reduced presence, of BC1 RNA in synapto-dendritic domains of premutation animal neurons would engender cognate phenotypic alterations. Testing this prediction, we established epileptogenic susceptibility and cognitive impairments as major phenotypic abnormalities of CGG premutation mice. In CA3 hippocampal neurons of such animals, synaptic release of glutamate elicits neuronal hyperexcitability in the form of mGluR-dependent prolonged epileptiform discharges. CGG-repeat knock-in animals are susceptible to sound-induced seizures and are cognitively impaired as revealed in the Attentional Set Shift Task. These phenotypic disturbances occur in young-adult premutation animals, indicating that a neurodevelopmental deficit is an early-initial manifestation of the disorder. The data are consistent with the notion that RNA mislocalization can contribute to pathogenesis.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> The fragile X premutation finds expression in two distinct disease manifestations. Young premutation carriers may present with seizure activity and cognitive disturbances while advanced-age patients may experience intention tremor and gait ataxia, a condition known as FXTAS. In contrast to FXTAS, the early-onset phase of fragile X premutation disorder remains poorly understood. We discovered that in brains of CGG-repeat knock-in animals (a premutation mouse model), regulatory BC1 RNA is mislocalized as its presence at synapto-dendritic domains is severely diminished. Lack of BC1 RNA is known to cause epileptogenesis and cognitive dysfunction, and we report that such phenotypic alterations are hallmarks of young premutation animals. The data are congruous with a potential role of RNA localization impairments in pathogenesis.</p>

Abstract<p>Many natural sounds can be well described on a statistical level, for example wind, rain or applause. Even though the spectro-temporal profile of these acoustic textures is highly dynamic, changes in their statistics are indicative of relevant changes in the environment. Here, we investigated the neural representation of change detection in natural textures in humans, and specifically addressed whether active task engagement is required for the neural representation of this change in statistics.</p><p>Subjects listened to natural textures whose spectro-temporal statistics were modified at variable times by a variable amount. Subjects were instructed to either report the detection of changes (<i>active</i>) or to passively listen to the stimuli. A subset of passive subjects had performed the active task before (<i>passive-aware</i> vs. <i>passive-naive</i>). Psychophysically, longer exposure to pre-change statistics was correlated with faster reaction times and better discrimination performance. EEG recordings revealed that the build-up rate and size of parieto-occipital potentials reflected change size and change time. Reduced effects were observed in the passive conditions. While P2 responses were comparable across conditions, slope and height of parieto-occipital potentials scaled with task involvement. Neural source localization identified a parietal source as the main contributor of change-specific potentials, in addition to more limited contributions from auditory and frontal sources.</p><p>In summary, the detection of statistical changes in natural acoustic textures is predominantly reflected in parietal locations both on the skull and source level. The scaling in magnitude across different levels of task involvement suggests a context-dependent degree of evidence integration.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> The everyday auditory environment is often complex and highly variable. Separating relevant changes from irrelevant variability is important for auditory processing. Previous research has already shown that sensory evidence is integrated to achieve accurate decisions. In the present study, we extend this research in two ways, first by using more realistic and complex stimuli, and second, by modulating the level of engagement of subjects in the task. We demonstrate that dynamic processing of natural stimuli leads to similar neural responses as for synthetic complex stimuli. Further, neural responses continue to reflect properties of the acoustic stimulus even for reduced task engagement, albeit with much lower amplitudes. We conclude that auditory evidence integration may continue even during passive perception.</p>

Abstract<p>Response inhibition, the ability to refrain from unwanted actions, is an essential component of complex behavior and is often impaired across numerous neuropsychiatric disorders such as addiction, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), schizophrenia, and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Accordingly, much research has been devoted to characterizing brain regions responsible for the regulation of response inhibition. The stop-signal task, a task in which animals are required to inhibit a prepotent response in the presence of a STOP cue, is one of the most well-studied tasks of response inhibition. While pharmacological evidence suggests that dopamine (DA) contributes to the regulation of response inhibition, what is exactly encoded by DA neurons during performance of response inhibition tasks is unknown. To address this issue, we recorded from single units in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) while rats performed a stop-change task. We found that putative DA neurons fired less and higher to cues and reward on STOP trials relative to GO trials, respectively, and that firing was reduced during errors. These results suggest that DA neurons in VTA encode the uncertainty associated with the probability of obtaining reward on difficult trials instead of the saliency associated with STOP cues or the need to resolve conflict between competing responses during response inhibition.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> The ability to refrain from unwanted actions, also known as response inhibition, is an essential component of complex behavior, and is impaired across numerous neuropsychiatric disorders including addiction, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and schizophrenia. Dopamine (DA) is important for reward learning but its role in response inhibition is less clear. For the first time, we characterized the activity of DA neurons in rats performing a response inhibition task, and found that DA neurons primarily signaled information regarding the uncertainty of obtaining reward during cues and reward delivery when behavioral trials were difficult and there was a low probability of success.</p>

<p>Neurons in a micro-circuit connected by chemical synapses can have their
connectivity affected by the prior activity of the cells. The number of
synapses available for releasing neurotransmitter can be decreased by
repetitive activation through depletion of readily releasable neurotransmitter
(NT), or increased through facilitation, where the probability of release of NT
is increased by prior activation. These competing effects can create a
complicated and subtle range of time dependent connectivity. Here we
investigate the probabilistic properties of facilitation and depression (FD)
for a presynaptic neuron that is receiving a Poisson spike train of input. We
use a model of FD that is parameterized with experimental data from a
hippocampal basket cell and pyramidal cell connection, for fixed frequency
input spikes at frequencies in the range of theta and gamma oscillations. Hence
our results will apply to micro-circuits in the hippocampus that are
responsible for the interaction of theta and gamma rhythms associated with
learning and memory. A control situation is compared with one in which a
pharmaceutical neuromodulator (muscarine) is employed. We apply standard
information theoretic measures such as entropy and mutual information, and find
a closed form approximate expression for the probability distribution of
release probability. We also use techniques that measure the dependence of the
response on the exact history of stimulation the synapse has received, which
uncovers some unexpected differences between control and muscarine-added cases.

<p>We develop a general analytical and numerical framework for estimating intra-
and extra-neurite water fractions and diffusion coefficients, as well as
neurite orientational dispersion, in each imaging voxel. By employing a set of
rotational invariants and their expansion in the powers of diffusion weighting,
we analytically uncover the nontrivial topology of the parameter estimation
landscape, showing that multiple branches of parameters describe the
measurement almost equally well, with only one of them corresponding to the
biophysical reality. A comprehensive acquisition shows that the branch choice
varies across the brain. Our framework reveals hidden degeneracies in MRI
parameter estimation for neuronal tissue, provides microstructural and
orientational maps in the whole brain without constraints or priors, and
connects modern biophysical modeling with clinical MRI.

Patch-seq, enabling simultaneous measurement of a transcriptomic, electrophysiological, and morphological features, has recently emerged as a powerful tool for neuronal characterization. However, we show the method is susceptible to technical artifacts, including the presence of mRNA contaminants from multiple cells, that limit the interpretability of the data. We present a straightforward marker gene-based approach for controlling for these artifacts and show that our method improves the correspondence between gene expression and electrophysiological features.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/298067v1?rss=1">A circadian output circuit controls sleep-wake arousal threshold in Drosophila</a></h4>

The Drosophila core circadian circuit contains distinct groups of interacting neurons that give rise to diurnal sleep-wake patterns. Previous work showed that a subset of Dorsal Neurons 1 (DN1s) are sleep-promoting through their inhibition of activity-promoting circadian pacemakers. Here we show that these anterior-projecting DNs (APDNs) also 'exit' the circadian circuitry and communicate with the homeostatic sleep center in higher brain regions to regulate sleep and sleep-wake arousal threshold. These APDNs connect to a small discrete subset of tubercular-bulbar neurons, which are connected in turn to specific sleep-centric Ellipsoid Body (EB)-Ring neurons of the central complex. Remarkably, activation of the APDNs produces sleep-like oscillations in the EB and also raises the arousal threshold, which requires neurotransmission throughout the circuit. The data indicate that this APDN-TuBu(sup)-EB circuit temporally regulates sleep-wake arousal threshold in addition to the previously defined role of the TuBu-EB circuit in vision, navigation and attention.

Neurons are highly dependent on mitochondrial function, and mitochondrial damage has been implicated in many neurological and neurodegenerative diseases. Relatively little is known about how mitochondria regulate neuronal function. Here we show that axonal mitochondria are necessary for neuropeptide secretion in Caenorhabditis elegans, and that oxidative phosphorylation, but not mitochondrial calcium uptake, is required for secretion. Oxidative phosphorylation produces cellular ATP, reactive oxygen species, and consumes oxygen. Disrupting any of these functions could inhibit neuropeptide secretion. We show that blocking mitochondria transport into axons inhibits neuropeptide secretion through activation of the hypoxia inducible factor HIF-1. Our results suggest that axonal mitochondria modulate neuropeptide secretion by regulating transcriptional responses induced by metabolic stress.

<p>by Stefan Sellman, Kimberly Tsao, Michael J. Tildesley, Peter Brommesson, Colleen T. Webb, Uno Wennergren, Matt J. Keeling, Tom Lindström</p>

Numerical models for simulating outbreaks of infectious diseases are powerful tools for informing surveillance and control strategy decisions. However, large-scale spatially explicit models can be limited by the amount of computational resources they require, which poses a problem when multiple scenarios need to be explored to provide policy recommendations. We introduce an easily implemented method that can reduce computation time in a standard Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed (SEIR) model without introducing any further approximations or truncations. It is based on a hierarchical infection process that operates on entire groups of spatially related nodes (cells in a grid) in order to efficiently filter out large volumes of susceptible nodes that would otherwise have required expensive calculations. After the filtering of the cells, only a subset of the nodes that were originally at risk are then evaluated for actual infection. The increase in efficiency is sensitive to the exact configuration of the grid, and we describe a simple method to find an estimate of the optimal configuration of a given landscape as well as a method to partition the landscape into a grid configuration. To investigate its efficiency, we compare the introduced methods to other algorithms and evaluate computation time, focusing on simulated outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) on the farm population of the USA, the UK and Sweden, as well as on three randomly generated populations with varying degree of clustering. The introduced method provided up to 500 times faster calculations than pairwise computation, and consistently performed as well or better than other available methods. This enables large scale, spatially explicit simulations such as for the entire continental USA without sacrificing realism or predictive power.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Oiar5aQKyTU" width="1" />

Abstract<p>The cellular environment of the central nervous system is non-permissive for growth and regeneration. In the retina, transplantation of stem cells has been limited by inefficient survival and integration into existing circuits. In November 2016, as part of the National Eye Institute’s Audacious Goals Initiative (AGI), a diverse collection of investigators gathered for a workshop devoted to articulating the gaps in knowledge, barriers to progress, and ideas for new approaches to understanding cellular environments within the retina and how these environments may be manipulated.  In doing so, the group identified the areas of a) retinal and optic nerve glia, b) microglia and inflammation, and the c) extracellular matrix and retinal vasculature as key to advancing our understanding and manipulation of the retinal microenvironments.  We summarize here the findings of the workshop for the broader scientific community.</p>

<p>INTRODUCTION: Advanced machine learning methods might help to identify
dementia risk from neuroimaging, but their accuracy to date is unclear.
</p>
<p>METHODS: We systematically reviewed the literature, 2006 to late 2016, for
machine learning studies differentiating healthy ageing through to dementia of
various types, assessing study quality, and comparing accuracy at different
disease boundaries.
</p>
<p>RESULTS: Of 111 relevant studies, most assessed Alzheimer's disease (AD) vs
healthy controls, used ADNI data, support vector machines and only T1-weighted
sequences. Accuracy was highest for differentiating AD from healthy controls,
and poor for differentiating healthy controls vs MCI vs AD, or MCI converters
vs non-converters. Accuracy increased using combined data types, but not by
data source, sample size or machine learning method.
</p>
<p>DISCUSSION: Machine learning does not differentiate clinically-relevant
disease categories yet. More diverse datasets, combinations of different types
of data, and close clinical integration of machine learning would help to
advance the field.

<p>Many neurodegenerative diseases are related to the propagation and
accumulation of toxic proteins throughout the brain. The lesions created by
aggregates of these toxic proteins further lead to cell death and accelerated
tissue atrophy. A striking feature of some of these diseases is their
characteristic pattern and evolution, leading to well-codified disease stages
visible to neuropathology and associated with various cognitive deficits and
pathologies. Here, we simulate the anisotropic propagation and accumulation of
toxic proteins in full brain geometry. We show that the same model with
different initial seeding zones reproduces the characteristic evolution of
different prion-like diseases. We also recover the expected evolution of the
total toxic protein load. Finally, we couple our transport model to a
mechanical atrophy model to obtain the typical degeneration patterns found in
neurodegenerative diseases.

<p>Here we present an array of leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neuron circuits
designed for the second-generation BrainScaleS mixed-signal 65-nm CMOS
neuromorphic hardware. The neuronal array is embedded in the analog network
core of a scaled-down prototype HICANN-DLS chip. Designed as continuous-time
circuits, the neurons are highly tunable and reconfigurable elements with
accelerated dynamics. Each neuron integrates input current from a multitude of
incoming synapses and evokes a digital spike event output. The circuit offers a
wide tuning range for synaptic and membrane time constants, as well as for
refractory periods to cover a number of computational models. We elucidate our
design methodology, underlying circuit design, calibration and measurement
results from individual sub-circuits across multiple dies. The circuit dynamics
match with the behavior of the LIF mathematical model. We further demonstrate a
winner-take-all network on the prototype chip as a typical element of cortical
processing.

<p>Here we describe a multi-compartment neuron circuit based on the
Adaptive-Exponential I&amp;F (AdEx) model, developed for the second-generation
BrainScaleS hardware. Based on an existing modular Leaky Integrate-and-Fire
(LIF) architecture designed in 65 nm CMOS, the circuit features exponential
spike generation, neuronal adaptation, inter-compartmental connections as well
as a conductance-based reset. The design reproduces a diverse set of firing
patterns observed in cortical pyramidal neurons. Further, it enables the
emulation of sodium and calcium spikes, as well as N-Methyl-D-Aspartate (NMDA)
plateau potentials known from apical and thin dendrites. We characterize the
AdEx circuit extensions and exemplify how the interplay between passive and
non-linear active signal processing enhances the computational capabilities of
single (but structured) on-chip neurons.

<p>In the middle of the last century, it has been known that neural stem cells
(NSCs) play a key role in regenerative medicine to cure the neurodegenerative
disease. This review article covers about the introduction to neural stem cell
biology and the isolation, differentiation and transplantation
methods/techniques of neural stem cells. The neural stem cells can be
transplanted into the human brain in the future to replace the damaged and dead
neurons. The highly limited access to embryonic stem cells and ethical issues
have escalated the search for other NSC sources. The developing technologies
are indicating that it can be achieved before the end of this century. In
addition, the differentiation and the maturation of NSCs can artificially
accelerate by modern methods.

<p>Artificial neural networks (ANNs), while exceptionally useful for
classification, are vulnerable to misdirection. Small amounts of noise can
significantly affect their ability to correctly complete a task. Instead of
generalizing concepts, ANNs seem to focus on surface statistical regularities
in a given task. Here we compare how recurrent artificial neural networks, long
short-term memory units, and Markov Brains sense and remember their
environments. We show that information in Markov Brains is localized and
sparsely distributed, while the other neural network substrates "smear"
information about the environment across all nodes, which makes them vulnerable
to noise.

<p>In recent years, there is an increased interest in the role of static
properties of and dynamics on signed graphs in physical, biological, and social
networks. In particular, community structures of signed graphs and their
modularity indices have drawn special attention, and there are numerous methods
to identify them. Here we provide the technical details of implementing four
important methods that in their nature are very different from one another; two
spectral methods, one using the adjacency matrix and one using the Laplacian
matrix, a heuristic graph theoretic method using a concept of edge centrality,
and finally, a stochastic combinatorial optimization method. Because of the
novel nature of the methods, we focus on an interesting problem of community
structures in brain network of the CA1 region of the hippocampus of
anesthetized rats to study the pre-ictal and post-ictal states. We use recent
electroenecephalograph (EEG) depth recordings for a period of 117 minutes at a
sampling rate of 1000Hz. Since the electrode used has 16-contact points, we
construct non-overlapping but sliding 100,000 sample-windowed correlation
matrices or functional connectivity (FC) matrices over the recorded time,
yielding signed graphs. Our results from the clustering methods both at the
pre-ictal and post-ictal periods of the depth recording reported here for the
first time yield convincing answers to differing community structures.

<p>by Jana Wäldchen, Michael Rzanny, Marco Seeland, Patrick Mäder</p>

Current rates of species loss triggered numerous attempts to protect and conserve biodiversity. Species conservation, however, requires species identification skills, a competence obtained through intensive training and experience. Field researchers, land managers, educators, civil servants, and the interested public would greatly benefit from accessible, up-to-date tools automating the process of species identification. Currently, relevant technologies, such as digital cameras, mobile devices, and remote access to databases, are ubiquitously available, accompanied by significant advances in image processing and pattern recognition. The idea of automated species identification is approaching reality. We review the technical status quo on computer vision approaches for plant species identification, highlight the main research challenges to overcome in providing applicable tools, and conclude with a discussion of open and future research thrusts.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/bfmDpVYKmqI" width="1" />

<p>Neural network models in neuroscience allow one to study how the connections
between neurons shape the activity of neural circuits in the brain. In this
chapter, we study Combinatorial Threshold-Linear Networks (CTLNs) in order to
understand how the pattern of connectivity, as encoded by a directed graph,
shapes the emergent nonlinear dynamics of the corresponding network. Important
aspects of these dynamics are controlled by the stable and unstable fixed
points of the network, and we show how these fixed points can be determined via
graph-based rules. We also present an algorithm for predicting sequences of
neural activation from the underlying directed graph, and examine the effect of
graph symmetries on a network's set of attractors.

<p>Multivariate regression models for age estimation are a powerful tool for
assessing abnormal brain morphology associated to neuropathology. Age
prediction models are built on cohorts of healthy subjects and are built to
reflect normal aging patterns. The application of these multivariate models to
diseased subjects usually results in high prediction errors, under the
hypothesis that neuropathology presents a similar degenerative pattern as that
of accelerated aging. In this work, we propose an alternative to the idea that
pathology follows a similar trajectory than normal aging. Instead, we propose
the use of metrics which measure deviations from the mean aging trajectory. We
propose to measure these deviations using two different metrics: uncertainty in
a Gaussian process regression model and a newly proposed age weighted
uncertainty measure. Consequently, our approach assumes that pathologic brain
patterns are different to those of normal aging. We present results for
subjects with autism, mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease to
highlight the versatility of the approach to different diseases and age ranges.
We evaluate volume, thickness, and VBM features for quantifying brain
morphology. Our evaluations are performed on a large number of images obtained
from a variety of publicly available neuroimaging databases. Across all
features, our uncertainty based measurements yield a better separation between
diseased subjects and healthy individuals than the prediction error. Finally,
we illustrate differences in the disease pattern to normal aging, supporting
the application of uncertainty as a measure of neuropathology.

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Although neural progenitor proliferation along the ventricular zone is regulated by β-catenin through Wnt signaling, the cytoskeletal mechanisms that regulate expression and localization of these proteins are not well understood. Our prior studies have shown that loss of the actin-binding Filamin A (FlnA) and actin-nucleating protein Formin 2 (Fmn2) impairs endocytosis of low-density-lipoprotein-receptor-related protein 6 (Lrp6), thereby disrupting β-catenin activation, resulting in decreased brain size. Here, we report that activated RhoA-GTPase disengages Fmn2 N- to C-terminal binding to promote Fmn2 activation and redistribution into lysosomal vesicles. Fmn2 colocalizes with β-catenin in lysosomes and promotes its degradation. Further, Fmn2 binds the E3 ligase Smurf2, enhances Smurf2-dependent ubiquitination, and degradation of Dishevelled-2 (Dvl2), thereby initiates β-catenin degradation. Finally, Fmn2 overexpression disrupts neuroepithelial integrity, neuronal migration, and proliferation-phenotypes in E13 mouse embryos, as seen with loss of Fmn2+FlnA function. Conversely, co-expression of Dvl2 with Fmn2 rescues the proliferation defect due to Fmn2 overexpression in mouse embryos. These findings suggest that there is a homeostatic feedback mechanism in the cytoskeletal-dependent regulation of neural proliferation within the cerebral cortex. Upstream, Fmn2 promotes proliferation by stabilizing the Lrp6 receptor, leading to β-catenin activation. Downstream, RhoA-activated Fmn2 promotes lysosomal degradation of Dvl2, leading to β-catenin degradation.</span>

Slow-wave activity (SWA), and its coupling with other sleep features, reorganizes cortical circuitry, supporting cognition. This raises the question: can cognition be improved through SWA enhancement? SWA enhancement techniques range from behavioral interventions (such as exercise), which have high feasibility but low specificity, to laboratory-based techniques (such as transcranial stimulation), which have high specificity but are less feasible for widespread use. In this review we describe the pathways through which SWA is enhanced.

Collins, Anastasiades et al. show that prefrontal cortex (PFC) engages multiple thalamic nuclei. Dorsal and ventral thalamus in turn target distinct networks within the PFC. Finally, local connectivity in the PFC completes a loop connecting thalamic input with cortico-thalamic output.

Abstract
<p>Although it is well established that the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) represents value using a common currency across categories of rewards, it is unknown whether the vmPFC represents value irrespective of the sensory modality in which alternatives are presented. In the current study, male and female human subjects completed a decision-making task while their neural activity was recorded using functional magnetic resonance imaging. On each trial, subjects chose between a safe alternative and a lottery, which was presented visually or aurally. A univariate conjunction analysis revealed that the anterior portion of the vmPFC tracks subjective value (SV) irrespective of the sensory modality. Using a novel cross-modality multivariate classifier, we were able to decode auditory value based on visual trials and vice versa. In addition, we found that the visual and auditory sensory cortices, which were identified using functional localizers, are also sensitive to the value of stimuli, albeit in a modality-specific manner. Whereas both primary and higher-order auditory cortices represented auditory SV (aSV), only a higher-order visual area represented visual SV (vSV). These findings expand our understanding of the common currency network of the brain and shed a new light on the interplay between sensory and value information processing.</p>

<p>Distortions of self-experience are critical symptoms of psychiatric disorders and have detrimental effects on social interactions. In light of the immense need for improved and targeted interventions for social impairments, it is important to better understand the neurochemical substrates of social interaction abilities. We therefore investigated the pharmacological and neural correlates of self- and other-initiated social interaction. In a double-blind, randomized, counterbalanced, crossover study 24 healthy human participants (18 males and 6 females) received either (1) placebo + placebo, (2) placebo + lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD; 100 μg, p.o.), or (3) ketanserin (40 mg, p.o.) + LSD (100 μg, p.o.) on three different occasions. Participants took part in an interactive task using eye-tracking and functional magnetic resonance imaging completing trials of self- and other-initiated joint and non-joint attention. Results demonstrate first, that LSD reduced activity in brain areas important for self-processing, but also social cognition; second, that change in brain activity was linked to subjective experience; and third, that LSD decreased the efficiency of establishing joint attention. Furthermore, LSD-induced effects were blocked by the serotonin 2A receptor (5-HT<sub>2A</sub>R) antagonist ketanserin, indicating that effects of LSD are attributable to 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>R stimulation. The current results demonstrate that activity in areas of the "social brain" can be modulated via the 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>R thereby pointing toward this system as a potential target for the treatment of social impairments associated with psychiatric disorders.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Distortions of self-representation and, potentially related to this, dysfunctional social cognition are central hallmarks of various psychiatric disorders and critically impact disease development, progression, treatment, as well as real-world functioning. However, these deficits are insufficiently targeted by current treatment approaches. The administration of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) in combination with functional magnetic resonance imaging and real-time eye-tracking offers the unique opportunity to study alterations in self-experience, their relation to social cognition, and the underlying neuropharmacology. Results demonstrate that LSD alters self-experience as well as basic social cognition processing in areas of the "social brain". Furthermore, these alterations are attributable to 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptor stimulation, thereby pinpointing toward this receptor system in the development of pharmacotherapies for sociocognitive deficits in psychiatric disorders.</p>

<p>Many daily behaviors rely critically on estimates of our body motion. Such estimates must be computed by combining neck proprioceptive signals with vestibular signals that have been transformed from a head- to a body-centered reference frame. Recent studies showed that deep cerebellar neurons in the rostral fastigial nucleus (rFN) reflect these computations, but whether they explicitly encode estimates of body motion remains unclear. A key limitation in addressing this question is that, to date, cell tuning properties have only been characterized for a restricted set of motions across head-re-body orientations in the horizontal plane. Here we examined, for the first time, how 3D spatiotemporal tuning for translational motion varies with head-re-body orientation in both horizontal and vertical planes in the rFN of male macaques. While vestibular coding was profoundly influenced by head-re-body position in both planes, neurons typically reflected at most a partial transformation. However, their tuning shifts were not random but followed the specific spatial trajectories predicted for a 3D transformation. We show that these properties facilitate the linear decoding of fully body-centered motion representations in 3D with a broad range of temporal characteristics from small groups of 5–7 cells. These results demonstrate that the vestibular reference frame transformation required to compute body motion is indeed encoded by cerebellar neurons. We propose that maintaining partially transformed rFN responses with different spatiotemporal properties facilitates the creation of downstream body motion representations with a range of dynamic characteristics, consistent with the functional requirements for tasks such as postural control and reaching.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Estimates of body motion are essential for many daily activities. Vestibular signals are important contributors to such estimates but must be transformed from a head- to a body-centered reference frame. Here, we provide the first direct demonstration that the cerebellum computes this transformation fully in 3D. We show that the output of these computations is reflected in the tuning properties of deep cerebellar rostral fastigial nucleus neurons in a specific distributed fashion that facilitates the efficient creation of body-centered translation estimates with a broad range of temporal properties (i.e., from acceleration to position). These findings support an important role for the rostral fastigial nucleus as a source of body translation estimates functionally relevant for behaviors ranging from postural control to perception.</p>

<p>Mutations in the <i>cereblon</i> (<i>CRBN</i>) gene cause human intellectual disability, one of the most common cognitive disorders. However, the molecular mechanisms of <i>CRBN</i>-related intellectual disability remain poorly understood. We investigated the role of <i>CRBN</i> in synaptic function and animal behavior using male mouse and <i>Drosophila</i> models. <i>Crbn</i> knock-out (KO) mice showed normal brain and spine morphology as well as intact synaptic plasticity; however, they also exhibited decreases in synaptic transmission and presynaptic release probability exclusively in excitatory synapses. Presynaptic function was impaired not only by loss of CRBN expression, but also by expression of pathogenic CRBN mutants (human R419X mutant and <i>Drosophila</i> G552X mutant). We found that the BK channel blockers paxilline and iberiotoxin reversed this decrease in presynaptic release probability in <i>Crbn</i> KO mice. In addition, paxilline treatment also restored normal cognitive behavior in <i>Crbn</i> KO mice. These results strongly suggest that increased BK channel activity is the pathological mechanism of intellectual disability in <i>CRBN</i> mutations.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> <i>Cereblon</i> (<i>CRBN</i>), a well known target of the immunomodulatory drug thalidomide, was originally identified as a gene that causes human intellectual disability when mutated. However, the molecular mechanisms of CRBN-related intellectual disability remain poorly understood. Based on the idea that synaptic abnormalities are the most common factor in cognitive dysfunction, we monitored the synaptic structure and function of <i>Crbn</i> knock-out (KO) animals to identify the molecular mechanisms of intellectual disability. Here, we found that <i>Crbn</i> KO animals showed cognitive deficits caused by enhanced BK channel activity and reduced presynaptic glutamate release. Our findings suggest a physiological pathomechanism of the intellectual disability-related gene <i>CRBN</i> and will contribute to the development of therapeutic strategies for <i>CRBN</i>-related intellectual disability.</p>

<p>Age-related changes in human functional neuroanatomy are poorly understood. This is partly due to the limits of interpretation of standard fMRI. These limits relate to age-related variation in noise levels in data from different subjects, and the common use of standard adult brain parcellations for developmental studies. Here we used an emerging MRI approach called multiecho (ME)-fMRI to characterize functional brain changes with age. ME-fMRI acquires blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signals while also quantifying susceptibility-weighted transverse relaxation time (T<sub>2</sub>*) signal decay. This approach newly enables reliable detection of BOLD signal components at the subject level as opposed to solely at the group-average level. In turn, it supports more robust characterization of the variability in functional brain organization across individuals. We hypothesized that BOLD components in the resting state are not stable with age, and would decrease in number from adolescence to adulthood. This runs counter to the current assumptions in neurodevelopmental analyses of brain connectivity that the number of BOLD signal components is a random effect. From resting-state ME-fMRI of 51 healthy subjects of both sexes, between 8.3 and 46.2 years of age, we found a highly significant (<i>r</i> = –0.55, <i>p</i> &lt;&lt; 0.001) exponential decrease in the number of BOLD components with age. The number of BOLD components were halved from adolescence to the fifth decade of life, stabilizing in middle adulthood. The regions driving this change were dorsolateral prefrontal cortices, parietal cortex, and cerebellum. The functional network of these regions centered on the cerebellum. We conclude that an age-related decrease in BOLD component number concurs with the hypothesis of neurodevelopmental integration of functional brain activity. We show evidence that the cerebellum may play a key role in this process.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Human brain development is ongoing from childhood to at least 30 years of age. Functional MRI (fMRI) is key for characterizing changes in brain function that accompany development. However, developmental fMRI studies have relied on reference maps of adult brain organization in the analysis of data from younger subjects. This approach may limit the characterization of functional activity patterns that are particular to children and adolescents. Here we used an emerging fMRI approach called multi-echo fMRI that is not susceptible to such biases when analyzing the variation in functional brain organization over development. We hypothesized an integration of the components of brain activity over development, and found that the number of components decreases exponentially, halving from 8 to 35 years of age. The brain regions most affected underlie executive function and coordination. In summary, we show major changes in the organization and integration of functional networks over development into adulthood, with both methodological and neurobiological implications for future lifespan and disease studies on brain connectivity.</p>

<p>The striatum controls food-related actions and consumption and is linked to feeding disorders, including obesity and anorexia nervosa. Two populations of neurons project from the striatum: direct pathway medium spiny neurons and indirect pathway medium spiny neurons. The selective contribution of direct pathway medium spiny neurons and indirect pathway medium spiny neurons to food-related actions and consumption remains unknown. Here, we used <i>in vivo</i> electrophysiology and fiber photometry in mice (of both sexes) to record both spiking activity and pathway-specific calcium activity of dorsal striatal neurons during approach to and consumption of food pellets. While electrophysiology revealed complex task-related dynamics across neurons, population calcium was enhanced during approach and inhibited during consumption in both pathways. We also observed ramping changes in activity that preceded both pellet-directed actions and spontaneous movements. These signals were heterogeneous in the spiking units, with neurons exhibiting either increasing or decreasing ramps. In contrast, the population calcium signals were homogeneous, with both pathways having increasing ramps of activity for several seconds before actions were initiated. An analysis comparing population firing rates to population calcium signals also revealed stronger ramping dynamics in the calcium signals than in the spiking data. In a second experiment, we trained the mice to perform an action sequence to evaluate when the ramping signals terminated. We found that the ramping signals terminated at the beginning of the action sequence, suggesting they may reflect upcoming actions and not preconsumption activity. Plasticity of such mechanisms may underlie disorders that alter action selection, such as drug addiction or obesity.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Alterations in striatal function have been linked to pathological consumption in disorders, such as obesity and drug addiction. We recorded spiking and population calcium activity from the dorsal striatum during <i>ad libitum</i> feeding and an operant task that resulted in mice obtaining food pellets. Dorsal striatal neurons exhibited long ramps in activity that preceded actions by several seconds, and may reflect upcoming actions. Understanding how the striatum controls the preparation and generation of actions may lead to improved therapies for disorders, such as drug addiction or obesity.</p>

<p>Metacognition is the capacity to evaluate the success of one's own cognitive processes in various domains; for example, memory and perception. It remains controversial whether metacognition relies on a domain-general resource that is applied to different tasks or if self-evaluative processes are domain specific. Here, we investigated this issue directly by examining the neural substrates engaged when metacognitive judgments were made by human participants of both sexes during perceptual and memory tasks matched for stimulus and performance characteristics. By comparing patterns of fMRI activity while subjects evaluated their performance, we revealed both domain-specific and domain-general metacognitive representations. Multivoxel activity patterns in anterior prefrontal cortex predicted levels of confidence in a domain-specific fashion, whereas domain-general signals predicting confidence and accuracy were found in a widespread network in the frontal and posterior midline. The demonstration of domain-specific metacognitive representations suggests the presence of a content-rich mechanism available to introspection and cognitive control.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> We used human neuroimaging to investigate processes supporting memory and perceptual metacognition. It remains controversial whether metacognition relies on a global resource that is applied to different tasks or if self-evaluative processes are specific to particular tasks. Using multivariate decoding methods, we provide evidence that perceptual- and memory-specific metacognitive representations coexist with generic confidence signals. Our findings reconcile previously conflicting results on the domain specificity/generality of metacognition and lay the groundwork for a mechanistic understanding of metacognitive judgments.</p>

<p>Chronic cerebral hypoperfusion is a characteristic seen in widespread CNS diseases, including neurodegenerative and mental disorders, and is commonly accompanied by cognitive impairment. Recently, several studies demonstrated that chronic cerebral hypoperfusion can induce the excessive inflammatory responses that precede neuronal dysfunction; however, the precise mechanism of cognitive impairment due to chronic cerebral hypoperfusion remains unknown. Transient receptor potential melastatin 2 (TRPM2) is a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable channel that is abundantly expressed in immune cells and is involved in aggravation of inflammatory responses. Therefore, we investigated the pathophysiological role of TRPM2 in a mouse chronic cerebral hypoperfusion model with bilateral common carotid artery stenosis (BCAS). When male mice were subjected to BCAS, cognitive dysfunction and white matter injury at day 28 were significantly improved in TRPM2 knock-out (TRPM2-KO) mice compared with wild-type (WT) mice, whereas hippocampal damage was not observed. There were no differences in blood–brain barrier breakdown and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production between the two genotypes at 14 and 28 d after BCAS. Cytokine production was significantly suppressed in BCAS-operated TRPM2-KO mice compared with WT mice at day 28. In addition, the number of Iba1-positive cells gradually decreased from day 14. Moreover, daily treatment with minocycline significantly improved cognitive perturbation. Surgical techniques using bone marrow chimeric mice revealed that activated Iba1-positive cells in white matter could be brain-resident microglia, not peripheral macrophages. Together, these findings suggest that microglia contribute to the aggravation of cognitive impairment by chronic cerebral hypoperfusion, and that TRPM2 may be a potential target for chronic cerebral hypoperfusion-related disorders.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Chronic cerebral hypoperfusion is manifested in a wide variety of CNS diseases, including neurodegenerative and mental disorders that are accompanied by cognitive impairment; however, the underlying mechanisms require clarification. Here, we used a chronic cerebral hypoperfusion mouse model to investigate whether TRPM2, a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable cation channel highly expressed in immune cells, plays a destructive role in the development of chronic cerebral hypoperfusion-induced cognitive impairment, and propose a new hypothesis in which TRPM2-mediated activation of microglia, not macrophages, specifically contributes to the pathology through the aggravation of inflammatory responses. These findings shed light on the understanding of the mechanisms of chronic cerebral hypoperfusion-related inflammation, and are expected to provide a novel therapeutic molecule for cognitive impairment in CNS diseases.</p>

<p>Cue-reward associations form distinct memories that can drive appetitive behaviors and are involved in craving for both drugs and natural rewards. Distinct sets of neurons, so-called neuronal ensembles, in the infralimbic area (IL) of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) play a key role in alcohol seeking. Whether this ensemble is specific for alcohol or controls reward seeking in general remains unclear. Here, we compared IL ensembles formed upon recall of drug (alcohol) or natural reward (saccharin) memories in male Wistar rats. Using an experimental framework that allows identification of two distinct reward-associated ensembles within the same animal, we found that cue-induced seeking of either alcohol or saccharin activated ensembles of similar size and organization, whereby these ensembles consist of largely overlapping neuronal populations. Thus, the IL seems to act as a general integration hub for reward seeking behavior, but also contains subsets of neurons that encode for the different rewards.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Cue-reward associations form distinct memories that can act as drivers of appetitive behaviors and are involved in craving for natural rewards as well as for drugs. Distinct sets of neurons, so-called neuronal ensembles, in the infralimbic area of the mPFC play a key role in cue-triggered reward seeking. However, it is unclear whether these ensembles act as broadly tuned controllers of approach behavior or represent the learned associations between specific cues and rewards. Using an experimental framework that allows identification of two distinct reward-associated ensembles within the same animal we find largely overlapping neuronal populations. Repeated activation by two distinct events could reflect the linking of the two memory traces within the same neuron.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/14/3495?rss=1">Can Serial Dependencies in Choices and Neural Activity Explain Choice Probabilities?</a></h4>

<p>During perceptual decisions the activity of sensory neurons covaries with choice, a covariation often quantified as "choice-probability". Moreover, choices are influenced by a subject's previous choice (serial dependence) and neuronal activity often shows temporal correlations on long (seconds) timescales. Here, we test whether these findings are linked. Using generalized linear models, we analyze simultaneous measurements of behavior and V2 neural activity in macaques performing a visual discrimination task. Both, decisions and spiking activity show substantial temporal correlations and cross-correlations but seem to reflect two mostly separate processes. Indeed, removing history effects using semipartial correlation analysis leaves choice probabilities largely unchanged. The serial dependencies in choices and neural activity therefore cannot explain the observed choice probability. Rather, serial dependencies in choices and spiking activity reflect two predominantly separate but parallel processes, which are coupled on each trial by covariations between choices and activity. These findings provide important constraints for computational models of perceptual decision-making that include feedback signals.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Correlations, unexplained by the sensory input, between the activity of sensory neurons and an animal's perceptual choice ("choice probabilities") have received attention from both a systems and computational neuroscience perspective. Conversely, whereas temporal correlations for both spiking activity ("non-stationarities") and for a subject's choices in perceptual tasks ("serial dependencies") have long been established, they have typically been ignored when measuring choice probabilities. Some accounts of choice probabilities incorporating feedback predict that these observations are linked. Here, we explore the extent to which this is the case. We find that, contrasting with these predictions, choice probabilities are largely independent of serial dependencies, which adds new constraints to accounts of choice probabilities that include feedback.</p>

<p>The β-secretase β-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) is deemed a major culprit in Alzheimer's disease, but accumulating evidence indicates that there is more to the enzyme than driving the amyloidogenic processing of the amyloid precursor protein. For example, BACE1 has emerged as an important regulator of neuronal activity through proteolytic and, most unexpectedly, also through nonproteolytic interactions with several ion channels. Here, we identify and characterize the voltage-gated K<sup>+</sup> channel 3.4 (Kv3.4) as a new and functionally relevant interaction partner of BACE1. Kv3.4 gives rise to A-type current with fast activating and inactivating kinetics and serves to repolarize the presynaptic action potential. We found that BACE1 and Kv3.4 are highly enriched and remarkably colocalized in hippocampal mossy fibers (MFs). In BACE1<sup>–/–</sup> mice of either sex, Kv3.4 surface expression was significantly reduced in the hippocampus and, in synaptic fractions thereof, Kv3.4 was specifically diminished, whereas protein levels of other presynaptic K<sup>+</sup> channels such as K<sub>Ca</sub>1.1 and K<sub>Ca</sub>2.3 remained unchanged. The apparent loss of presynaptic Kv3.4 affected the strength of excitatory transmission at the MF–CA3 synapse in hippocampal slices of BACE1<sup>–/–</sup> mice when probed with the Kv3 channel blocker BDS-I. The effect of BACE1 on Kv3.4 expression and function should be bidirectional, as predicted from a heterologous expression system, in which BACE1 cotransfection produced a concomitant upregulation of Kv3.4 surface level and current based on a physical interaction between the two proteins. Our data show that, by targeting Kv3.4 to presynaptic sites, BACE1 endows the terminal with a powerful means to regulate the strength of transmitter release.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The β-secretase β-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) is infamous for its crucial role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, but its physiological functions in the intact nervous system are only gradually being unveiled. Here, we extend previous work implicating BACE1 in the expression and function of voltage-gated Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> channels. Specifically, we characterize voltage-gated K<sup>+</sup> channel 3.4 (Kv3.4), a presynaptic K<sup>+</sup> channel required for action potential repolarization, as a novel interaction partner of BACE1 at the mossy fiber (MF)–CA3 synapse of the hippocampus. BACE1 promotes surface expression of Kv3.4 at MF terminals, most likely by physically associating with the channel protein in a nonenzymatic fashion. We advance the BACE1–Kv3.4 interaction as a mechanism to strengthen the temporal control over transmitter release from MF terminals.</p>

<p>Exposure of the developing brain to toxins, drugs, or deleterious endogenous compounds during the perinatal period can trigger alterations in cell division, migration, differentiation, and synaptogenesis, leading to lifelong neurological impairment. The brain is protected by cellular barriers acting through multiple mechanisms, some of which are still poorly explored. We used a combination of enzymatic assays, live tissue fluorescence microscopy, and an <i>in vitro</i> cellular model of the blood–CSF barrier to investigate an enzymatic detoxification pathway in the developing male and female rat brain. We show that during the early postnatal period the choroid plexus epithelium forming the blood–CSF barrier and the ependymal cell layer bordering the ventricles harbor a high detoxifying capacity that involves glutathione <i>S</i>-transferases. Using a functional knock-down rat model for choroidal glutathione conjugation, we demonstrate that already in neonates, this metabolic pathway efficiently prevents the penetration of blood-borne reactive compounds into CSF. The versatility of the protective mechanism results from the multiplicity of the glutathione <i>S</i>-transferase isoenzymes, which are differently expressed between the choroidal epithelium and the ependyma. The various isoenzymes display differential substrate specificities, which greatly widen the spectrum of molecules that can be inactivated by this pathway. In conclusion, the blood–CSF barrier and the ependyma are identified as key cellular structures in the CNS to protect the brain fluid environment from different chemical classes of potentially toxic compounds during the postnatal period. This metabolic neuroprotective function of brain interfaces ought to compensate for the liver postnatal immaturity.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Brain homeostasis requires a stable and controlled internal environment. Defective brain protection during the perinatal period can lead to lifelong neurological impairment. We demonstrate that the choroid plexus forming the blood–CSF barrier is a key player in the protection of the developing brain. Glutathione-dependent enzymatic metabolism in the choroidal epithelium inactivates a broad spectrum of noxious compounds, efficiently preventing their penetration into the CSF. A second line of detoxification is located in the ependyma separating the CSF from brain tissue. Our study reveals a novel facet of the mechanisms by which the brain is protected at a period of high vulnerability, at a time when the astrocytic network is still immature and liver xenobiotic metabolism is limited.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/14/3453?rss=1">Development of the Mechanisms Governing Midbrain Multisensory Integration</a></h4>

<p>The ability to integrate information across multiple senses enhances the brain's ability to detect, localize, and identify external events. This process has been well documented in single neurons in the superior colliculus (SC), which synthesize concordant combinations of visual, auditory, and/or somatosensory signals to enhance the vigor of their responses. This increases the physiological salience of crossmodal events and, in turn, the speed and accuracy of SC-mediated behavioral responses to them. However, this capability is not an innate feature of the circuit and only develops postnatally after the animal acquires sufficient experience with covariant crossmodal events to form links between their modality-specific components. Of critical importance in this process are tectopetal influences from association cortex. Recent findings suggest that, despite its intuitive appeal, a simple generic associative rule cannot explain how this circuit develops its ability to integrate those crossmodal inputs to produce enhanced multisensory responses. The present neurocomputational model explains how this development can be understood as a transition from a default state in which crossmodal SC inputs interact competitively to one in which they interact cooperatively. Crucial to this transition is the operation of a learning rule requiring coactivation among tectopetal afferents for engagement. The model successfully replicates findings of multisensory development in normal cats and cats of either sex reared with special experience. In doing so, it explains how the cortico–SC projections can use crossmodal experience to craft the multisensory integration capabilities of the SC and adapt them to the environment in which they will be used.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The brain's remarkable ability to integrate information across the senses is not present at birth, but typically develops in early life as experience with crossmodal cues is acquired. Recent empirical findings suggest that the mechanisms supporting this development must be more complex than previously believed. The present work integrates these data with what is already known about the underlying circuit in the midbrain to create and test a mechanistic model of multisensory development. This model represents a novel and comprehensive framework that explains how midbrain circuits acquire multisensory experience and reveals how disruptions in this neurotypic developmental trajectory yield divergent outcomes that will affect the multisensory processing capabilities of the mature brain.</p>

<p>Selective attention allows focusing on only part of the incoming sensory information. Neurons in the extrastriate visual cortex reflect such selective processing when different stimuli are simultaneously present in their large receptive fields. Their spiking response then resembles the response to the attended stimulus when presented in isolation. Unclear is where in the neuronal pathway attention intervenes to achieve such selective signal routing and processing. To investigate this question, we tagged two equivalent visual stimuli by independent broadband luminance noise and used the spectral coherence of these behaviorally irrelevant signals with the field potential of a local neuronal population in male macaque monkeys' area V4 as a measure for their respective causal influences. This new experimental paradigm revealed that signal transmission was considerably weaker for the not-attended stimulus. Furthermore, our results show that attention does not need to modulate responses in the input populations sending signals to V4 to selectively represent a stimulus, nor do they suggest a change of the V4 neurons' output gain depending on their feature similarity with the stimuli. Our results rather imply that selective attention uses a gating mechanism comprising the synaptic "inputs" that transmit signals from upstream areas into the V4 neurons. A minimal model implementing attention-dependent routing by gamma-band synchrony replicated the attentional gating effect and the signals' spectral transfer characteristics. It supports the proposal that selective interareal gamma-band synchrony subserves signal routing and explains our experimental finding that attention selectively gates signals already at the level of afferent synaptic input.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Depending on the behavioral context, the brain needs to channel the flow of information through its networks of massively interconnected neurons. We designed an experiment that allows to causally assess routing of information originating from an attended object. We found that attention "gates" signals at the interplay between afferent fibers and the local neurons. A minimal model demonstrated that coherent gamma-rhythmic activity (~60 Hz) between local neurons and their afferent-providing input neurons can realize the gating. Importantly, the attended signals did not need to be amplified already in an earlier processing stage, nor did they get amplified by a simple output response modulation. The method provides a useful tool to study mechanisms of dynamic network configuration underlying cognitive processes.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/14/3428?rss=1">The Sync/deSync Model: How a Synchronized Hippocampus and a Desynchronized Neocortex Code Memories</a></h4>

<p>Neural oscillations are important for memory formation in the brain. The desynchronization of alpha (10 Hz) oscillations in the neocortex has been shown to predict successful memory encoding and retrieval. However, when engaging in learning, it has been found that the hippocampus synchronizes in theta (4 Hz) oscillations, and that learning is dependent on the phase of theta. This inconsistency as to whether synchronization is "good" for memory formation leads to confusion over which oscillations we should expect to see and where during learning paradigm experiments. This paper seeks to respond to this inconsistency by presenting a neural network model of how a well functioning learning system could exhibit both of these phenomena, i.e., desynchronization of alpha and synchronization of theta during successful memory encoding.</p>
<p>We present a spiking neural network (the Sync/deSync model) of the neocortical and hippocampal system. The simulated hippocampus learns through an adapted spike-time dependent plasticity rule, in which weight change is modulated by the phase of an extrinsically generated theta oscillation. Additionally, a global passive weight decay is incorporated, which is also modulated by theta phase. In this way, the Sync/deSync model exhibits theta phase-dependent long-term potentiation and long-term depression. We simulated a learning paradigm experiment and compared the oscillatory dynamics of our model with those observed in single-cell and scalp-EEG studies of the medial temporal lobe. Our Sync/deSync model suggests that both the desynchronization of neocortical alpha and the synchronization of hippocampal theta are necessary for successful memory encoding and retrieval.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> A fundamental question is the role of rhythmic activation of neurons, i.e., how and why their firing oscillates between high and low rates. A particularly important question is how oscillatory dynamics between the neocortex and hippocampus support memory formation. We present a spiking neural-network model of such memory formation, with the central ideas that (1) in neocortex, neurons need to break out of an alpha oscillation to represent a stimulus (i.e., alpha desynchronizes), whereas (2) in hippocampus, the firing of neurons at theta facilitates formation of memories (i.e., theta synchronizes). Accordingly, successful memory formation is marked by reduced neocortical alpha and increased hippocampal theta. This pattern has been observed experimentally and gives our model its name—the Sync/deSync model.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/14/3414?rss=1">Heteromeric KV2/KV8.2 Channels Mediate Delayed Rectifier Potassium Currents in Primate Photoreceptors</a></h4>

<p>Silent voltage-gated potassium channel subunits (K<sub>V</sub>S) interact selectively with members of the K<sub>V</sub>2 channel family to modify their functional properties. The localization and functional roles of these silent subunits remain poorly understood. Mutations in the K<sub>V</sub>S subunit, K<sub>V</sub>8.2 (<i>KCNV2</i>), lead to severe visual impairment in humans, but the basis of these deficits remains unclear. Here, we examined the localization, native interactions, and functional properties of K<sub>V</sub>8.2-containing channels in mouse, macaque, and human photoreceptors of either sex. In human retina, K<sub>V</sub>8.2 colocalized with K<sub>V</sub>2.1 and K<sub>V</sub>2.2 in cone inner segments and with K<sub>V</sub>2.1 in rod inner segments. K<sub>V</sub>2.1 and K<sub>V</sub>2.2 could be coimmunoprecipitated with K<sub>V</sub>8.2 in retinal lysates indicating that these subunits likely interact directly. Retinal K<sub>V</sub>2.1 was less phosphorylated than cortical K<sub>V</sub>2.1, a difference expected to alter the biophysical properties of these channels. Using voltage-clamp recordings and pharmacology, we provide functional evidence for Kv2-containing channels in primate rods and cones. We propose that the presence of K<sub>V</sub>8.2, and low levels of K<sub>V</sub>2.1 phosphorylation shift the activation range of K<sub>V</sub>2 channels to align with the operating range of rod and cone photoreceptors. Our data indicate a role for K<sub>V</sub>2/K<sub>V</sub>8.2 channels in human photoreceptor function and suggest that the visual deficits in patients with <i>KCNV2</i> mutations arise from inadequate resting activation of K<sub>V</sub> channels in rod and cone inner segments.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Mutations in a voltage-gated potassium channel subunit, K<sub>V</sub>8.2, underlie a blinding inherited photoreceptor dystrophy, indicating an important role for these channels in human vision. Here, we have defined the localization and subunit interactions of K<sub>V</sub>8.2 channels in primate photoreceptors. We show that the K<sub>V</sub>8.2 subunit interacts with different Kv2 channels in rods and cones, giving rise to potassium currents with distinct functional properties. Our results provide a molecular basis for retinal dysfunction in patients with mutations in the <i>KCNV2</i> gene encoding K<sub>V</sub>8.2.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/14/3394?rss=1">Swedish Nerve Growth Factor Mutation (NGFR100W) Defines a Role for TrkA and p75NTR in Nociception</a></h4>

<p>Nerve growth factor (NGF) exerts multiple functions on target neurons throughout development. The recent discovery of a point mutation leading to a change from arginine to tryptophan at residue 100 in the mature NGFβ sequence (NGF<sup>R100W</sup>) in patients with hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy type V (HSAN V) made it possible to distinguish the signaling mechanisms that lead to two functionally different outcomes of NGF: trophic versus nociceptive. We performed extensive biochemical, cellular, and live-imaging experiments to examine the binding and signaling properties of NGF<sup>R100W</sup>. Our results show that, similar to the wild-type NGF (wtNGF), the naturally occurring NGF<sup>R100W</sup> mutant was capable of binding to and activating the TrkA receptor and its downstream signaling pathways to support neuronal survival and differentiation. However, NGF<sup>R100W</sup> failed to bind and stimulate the 75 kDa neurotrophic factor receptor (p75<sup>NTR</sup>)-mediated signaling cascades (i.e., the RhoA-Cofilin pathway). Intraplantar injection of NGF<sup>R100W</sup> into adult rats induced neither TrkA-mediated thermal nor mechanical acute hyperalgesia, but retained the ability to induce chronic hyperalgesia based on agonism for TrkA signaling. Together, our studies provide evidence that NGF<sup>R100W</sup> retains trophic support capability through TrkA and one aspect of its nociceptive signaling, but fails to engage p75<sup>NTR</sup> signaling pathways. Our findings suggest that wtNGF acts via TrkA to regulate the delayed priming of nociceptive responses. The integration of both TrkA and p75<sup>NTR</sup> signaling thus appears to regulate neuroplastic effects of NGF in peripheral nociception.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> In the present study, we characterized the naturally occurring nerve growth factor NGF<sup>R100W</sup> mutant that is associated with hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy type V. We have demonstrated for the first time that NGF<sup>R100W</sup> retains trophic support capability through TrkA, but fails to engage p75<sup>NTR</sup> signaling pathways. Furthermore, after intraplantar injection into adult rats, NGF<sup>R100W</sup> induced neither thermal nor mechanical acute hyperalgesia, but retained the ability to induce chronic hyperalgesia. We have also provided evidence that the integration of both TrkA- and p75<sup>NTR</sup>-mediated signaling appears to regulate neuroplastic effects of NGF in peripheral nociception. Our study with NGF<sup>R100W</sup> suggests that it is possible to uncouple trophic effect from nociceptive function, both induced by wild-type NGF.</p>

<p>Steroids play vital roles in animal physiology across species, and the production of specific steroids is associated with particular internal biological functions. The internal functions of steroids are, in most cases, quite clear. However, an important feature of many steroids (their chemical stability) allows these molecules to play secondary, external roles as chemical messengers after their excretion via urine, feces, or other shed substances. The presence of steroids in animal excretions has long been appreciated, but their capacity to serve as chemosignals has not received as much attention. In theory, the blend of steroids excreted by an animal contains a readout of its own biological state. Initial mechanistic evidence for external steroid chemosensation arose from studies of many species of fish. In sea lampreys and ray-finned fishes, bile salts were identified as potent olfactory cues and later found to serve as pheromones. Recently, we and others have discovered that neurons in amphibian and mammalian olfactory systems are also highly sensitive to excreted glucocorticoids, sex steroids, and bile acids, and some of these molecules have been confirmed as mammalian pheromones. Steroid chemosensation in olfactory systems, unlike steroid detection in most tissues, is performed by plasma membrane receptors, but the details remain largely unclear. In this review, we present a broad view of steroid detection by vertebrate olfactory systems, focusing on recent research in fishes, amphibians, and mammals. We review confirmed and hypothesized mechanisms of steroid chemosensation in each group and discuss potential impacts on vertebrate social communication.</p>

<p>Eye movements hold information about human perception, intention and
cognitive state. Various algorithms have been proposed to identify and
distinguish eye movements, particularly fixations, saccades, and smooth
pursuits. A major drawback of existing algorithms is that they rely on accurate
and constant sampling rates, impeding straightforward adaptation to new
movements such as micro saccades. We propose a novel eye movement simulator
that i) probabilistically simulates saccade movements as gamma distributions
considering different peak velocities and ii) models smooth pursuit onsets with
the sigmoid function. This simulator is combined with a machine learning
approach to create detectors for general and specific velocity profiles.
Additionally, our approach is capable of using any sampling rate, even with
fluctuations. The machine learning approach consists of different binary
patterns combined using conditional distributions. The simulation is evaluated
against publicly available real data using a squared error, and the detectors
are evaluated against state-of-the-art algorithms.

The neural code of cortical processing remains uncracked; however, it must necessarily rely on faithful signal propagation between cortical areas. In this issue of Neuron, Joglekar et al.

Hu et al. demonstrate that action potentials in parvalbumin-expressing GABAergic interneuron axons are energetically efficient, which is highly unexpected given their brief duration. High energy efficiency emerges from the combination of fast inactivation of voltage-gated Na+ channels and delayed activation of Kv3 channels in the axon.

Maternal behavior is mediated by a hardwired neural circuit that remains poorly understood. Fang et al. find that medial preoptic Esr1+ cells (MPOAESR1+) are highly active during maternal behaviors. Activation of MPOAESR1+ projection to ventral tegmental area drives immediate pup retrieval.

<p>by Annie M. Westerlund, Lucie Delemotte</p>

Calmodulin (CaM) is a calcium sensing protein that regulates the function of a large number of proteins, thus playing a crucial part in many cell signaling pathways. CaM has the ability to bind more than 300 different target peptides in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent manner, mainly through the exposure of hydrophobic residues. How CaM can bind a large number of targets while retaining some selectivity is a fascinating open question. Here, we explore the mechanism of CaM selective promiscuity for selected target proteins. Analyzing enhanced sampling molecular dynamics simulations of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-bound and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free CaM via spectral clustering has allowed us to identify distinct conformational states, characterized by interhelical angles, secondary structure determinants and the solvent exposure of specific residues. We searched for indicators of conformational selection by mapping solvent exposure of residues in these conformational states to contacts in structures of CaM/target peptide complexes. We thereby identified CaM states involved in various binding classes arranged along a depth binding gradient. Binding Ca<sup>2+</sup> modifies the accessible hydrophobic surface of the two lobes and allows for deeper binding. Apo CaM indeed shows shallow binding involving predominantly polar and charged residues. Furthermore, binding to the C-terminal lobe of CaM appears selective and involves specific conformational states that can facilitate deep binding to target proteins, while binding to the N-terminal lobe appears to happen through a more flexible mechanism. Thus the long-ranged electrostatic interactions of the charged residues of the N-terminal lobe of CaM may initiate binding, while the short-ranged interactions of hydrophobic residues in the C-terminal lobe of CaM may account for selectivity. This work furthers our understanding of the mechanism of CaM binding and selectivity to different target proteins and paves the way towards a comprehensive model of CaM selectivity.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/nnr4XNya7Zs" width="1" />

<p>by Hironori Fujita, Masayoshi Kawaguchi</p>

Phyllotaxis, the arrangement of leaves on a plant stem, is well known because of its beautiful geometric configuration, which is derived from the constant spacing between leaf primordia. This phyllotaxis is established by mutual interaction between a diffusible plant hormone auxin and its efflux carrier PIN1, which cooperatively generate a regular pattern of auxin maxima, small regions with high auxin concentrations, leading to leaf primordia. However, the molecular mechanism of the regular pattern of auxin maxima is still largely unknown. To better understand how the phyllotaxis pattern is controlled, we investigated mathematical models based on the auxin–PIN1 interaction through linear stability analysis and numerical simulations, focusing on the spatial regularity control of auxin maxima. As in previous reports, we first confirmed that this spatial regularity can be reproduced by a highly simplified and abstract model. However, this model lacks the extracellular region and is not appropriate for considering the molecular mechanism. Thus, we investigated how auxin maxima patterns are affected under more realistic conditions. We found that the spatial regularity is eliminated by introducing the extracellular region, even in the presence of direct diffusion between cells or between extracellular spaces, and this strongly suggests the existence of an unknown molecular mechanism. To unravel this mechanism, we assumed a diffusible molecule to verify various feedback interactions with auxin–PIN1 dynamics. We revealed that regular patterns can be restored by a diffusible molecule that mediates the signaling from auxin to PIN1 polarization. Furthermore, as in the one-dimensional case, similar results are observed in the two-dimensional space. These results provide a great insight into the theoretical and molecular basis for understanding the phyllotaxis pattern. Our theoretical analysis strongly predicts a diffusible molecule that is pivotal for the phyllotaxis pattern but is yet to be determined experimentally.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/1PcJThDi81k" width="1" />

<p>by Yoram Zarai, Tamir Tuller</p>

Recent studies have demonstrated how the competition for the finite pool of available gene expression factors has important effect on fundamental gene expression aspects. In this study, based on a whole-cell model simulation of translation in <i>S. cerevisiae</i>, we evaluate for the first time the expected effect of mRNA levels fluctuations on translation due to the finite pool of ribosomes. We show that fluctuations of a single gene or a group of genes mRNA levels induce periodic behavior in all <i>S. cerevisiae</i> translation factors and aspects: the ribosomal densities and the translation rates of all <i>S. cerevisiae</i> mRNAs oscillate. We numerically measure the oscillation amplitudes demonstrating that fluctuations of endogenous and heterologous genes can cause a significant fluctuation of up to 50% in the steady-state translation rates of the rest of the genes. Furthermore, we demonstrate by synonymous mutations that oscillating the levels of mRNAs that experience high ribosomal occupancy (e.g. ribosomal “traffic jam”) induces the largest impact on the translation of the <i>S. cerevisiae</i> genome.
The results reported here should provide novel insights and principles related to the design of synthetic gene expression circuits and related to the evolutionary constraints shaping gene expression of endogenous genes.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/EeyF-2L0x-k" width="1" />

<p>by Javier A. Caballero, Mark D. Humphries, Kevin N. Gurney</p>

Decision formation recruits many brain regions, but the procedure they jointly execute is unknown. Here we characterize its essential composition, using as a framework a novel recursive Bayesian algorithm that makes decisions based on spike-trains with the statistics of those in sensory cortex (MT). Using it to simulate the random-dot-motion task, we demonstrate it quantitatively replicates the choice behaviour of monkeys, whilst predicting losses of otherwise usable information from MT. Its architecture maps to the recurrent cortico-basal-ganglia-thalamo-cortical loops, whose components are all implicated in decision-making. We show that the dynamics of its mapped computations match those of neural activity in the sensorimotor cortex and striatum during decisions, and forecast those of basal ganglia output and thalamus. This also predicts which aspects of neural dynamics are and are not part of inference. Our single-equation algorithm is probabilistic, distributed, recursive, and parallel. Its success at capturing anatomy, behaviour, and electrophysiology suggests that the mechanism implemented by the brain has these same characteristics.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/47MpyGKP0b0" width="1" />

                <h4><a href="http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0024-18.2018v1?rss=1">Frontal Eye Field Inactivation Reduces Saccade Preparation in the Superior Colliculus, but Does Not Alter How Preparatory Activity Relates to Saccades of a Given Latency</a></h4>

Abstract<p>A neural correlate for saccadic reaction times (SRTs) in the gap saccade task is the level of low-frequency activity in the intermediate layers of the superior colliculus (iSC) just before visual target onset: greater levels of such <i>preparatory</i> iSC low-frequency activity precede shorter SRTs. The frontal eye fields (FEF) are one likely source of iSC preparatory activity, since FEF preparatory activity is also inversely related to SRT. To better understand the FEF’s role in saccade preparation, and the way in which such preparation relates to SRT, in two male rhesus monkeys we compared iSC preparatory activity across unilateral reversible cryogenic inactivation of the FEF. FEF inactivation increased contralesional SRTs, and lowered ipsilesional iSC preparatory activity. FEF inactivation also reduced rostral iSC activity during the gap period. Importantly, the distributions of SRTs generated with or without FEF inactivation overlapped, enabling us to conduct a novel population-level analyses examining iSC preparatory activity just before generation of SRT-matched saccades. When matched for SRTs, we observed no change during FEF inactivation in the relationship between iSC preparatory activity and SRT-matched saccades across a range of SRTs, even for the occasional express saccade. Thus, while our results emphasize that the FEF has an overall excitatory influence on preparatory activity in the iSC, the communication between the iSC and downstream oculomotor brainstem is unaltered for SRT-matched saccades.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> How does the brain decide when to move? Here, we investigate the role of two oculomotor structures, the superior colliculus (SC) and frontal eye fields (FEF), in dictating visually-guided saccadic reaction times (SRTs). In both structures, higher levels of pretarget preparatory activity precede shorter SRTs. Here, we show that FEF inactivation increases SRTs and decreases SC preparatory activity. Surprisingly, providing one examines SRT-matched saccades, a population-level analysis of SC preparatory activity showed a negligible impact of FEF inactivation. Thus, while the FEF is one important source of preparatory input to the SC, it does not alter the dynamics of how iSC preparatory activity relates to a given SRT.</p>

Cell transplantation is an ambitious, but arguably realistic, therapy for repair of the nervous system. Cell delivery is a major challenge for clinical translation, especially given the apparently inhibitory astrogliotic environment in degenerated tissue. However, astrogliotic tissue also contains endogenous structural and biochemical cues that can be harnessed for functional repair. Minimizing damage to these cues during cell delivery could enhance cell integration. This theory is supported by studies with an auditory astrocyte scar model, in which cells delivered onto the surface of the damaged nerve were more successfully integrated in the host than those injected into the tissue.

They find wide-scale cortical spatiotemporal trajectories in ISA that are state-dependent and distinct from higher frequency neural activity.

Abstract
<p>Sensorimotor integration, the translation between acoustic signals and motoric programs, may constitute a crucial mechanism for speech. During speech perception, the acoustic-motoric translations include the recruitment of cortical areas for the representation of speech articulatory features, such as place of articulation. Selective attention can shape the processing and performance of speech perception tasks. Whether and where sensorimotor integration takes place during attentive speech perception remains to be explored. Here, we investigate articulatory feature representations of spoken consonant-vowel (CV) syllables during two distinct tasks. Fourteen healthy humans attended to either the vowel or the consonant within a syllable in separate delayed-match-to-sample tasks. Single-trial fMRI blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) responses from perception periods were analyzed using multivariate pattern classification and a searchlight approach to reveal neural activation patterns sensitive to the processing of place of articulation (i.e., bilabial/labiodental vs. alveolar). To isolate place of articulation representation from acoustic covariation, we applied a cross-decoding (generalization) procedure across distinct features of manner of articulation (i.e., stop, fricative, and nasal). We found evidence for the representation of place of articulation across tasks and in both tasks separately: for attention to vowels, generalization maps included bilateral clusters of superior and posterior temporal, insular, and frontal regions; for attention to consonants, generalization maps encompassed clusters in temporoparietal, insular, and frontal regions within the right hemisphere only. Our results specify the cortical representation of place of articulation features generalized across manner of articulation during attentive syllable perception, thus supporting sensorimotor integration during attentive speech perception and demonstrating the value of generalization.</p>

Abstract<p>Synaptic connections between neurons in the brain are dynamic because of continuously ongoing spine dynamics, axonal sprouting, and other processes. In fact, it was recently shown that the spontaneous synapse-autonomous component of spine dynamics is at least as large as the component that depends on the history of pre- and postsynaptic neural activity. These data are inconsistent with common models for network plasticity, and raise the questions how neural circuits can maintain a stable computational function in spite of these continuously ongoing processes, and what functional uses these ongoing processes might have. Here, we present a rigorous theoretical framework for these seemingly stochastic spine dynamics and rewiring processes in the context of reward-based learning tasks. We show that spontaneous synapse-autonomous processes, in combination with reward signals such as dopamine, can explain the capability of networks of neurons in the brain to configure themselves for specific computational tasks, and to compensate automatically for later changes in the network or task. Furthermore we show theoretically and through computer simulations that stable computational performance is compatible with continuously ongoing synapse-autonomous changes. After reaching good computational performance it causes primarily a slow drift of network architecture and dynamics in task-irrelevant dimensions, as observed for neural activity in motor cortex and other areas. On the more abstract level of reinforcement learning the resulting model gives rise to an understanding of reward-driven network plasticity as continuous sampling of network configurations. (240 words)</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Networks of neurons in the brain do not have a fixed connectivity. We address the question how stable computational performance can be achieved by continuously changing neural circuits, and how these networks could even benefit from these changes. We show that the stationary distribution of network configurations provides a level of analysis where these issues can be addressed in a perspicuous manner. In particular, this theoretical framework allows us to address analytically the questions which rules for reward-gated synaptic rewiring and plasticity would work best in this context, and what impact different levels of activity-independent synaptic processes are likely to have. We demonstrate the viability of this approach through computer simulations and links to experimental data. (116 words)</p>

Deafness causes speech to deteriorate, but whether this deterioration reflects an active or passive process is unclear. Birdsong – a learned vocal behavior that resembles speech in its dependence on auditory feedback – also deteriorates following deafening. In their 2000 paper, Brainard and Doupe showed that, following deafening, birdsong deteriorates through an active process mediated by a cortex–basal ganglia (BG) circuit.

In the late 1970s, key discoveries in neurophysiology, psychophysics, computer vision, and image processing had reached a tipping point that would shape visual science for decades to come. David Marr and Ellen Hildreth’s ‘Theory of edge detection’, published in 1980, set out to integrate the newly available wealth of data from behavioral, physiological, and computational approaches in a unifying theory. Although their work had wide and enduring ramifications, their most important contribution may have been to consolidate the foundations of the ongoing dialogue between theoretical and empirical vision science.

Characterizing how network state modulates cortical dynamics and information processing is an important step for understanding the neural code. In 2010, Churchland et al. reported wide experimental evidence showing that spontaneous and stimulus-evoked conditions are two distinct states, as indicated by a marked reduction of neuronal variability after stimulus onset.

<p>by Juan Prada, Manju Sasi, Corinna Martin, Sibylle Jablonka, Thomas Dandekar, Robert Blum</p>

Local and spontaneous calcium signals play important roles in neurons and neuronal networks. Spontaneous or cell-autonomous calcium signals may be difficult to assess because they appear in an unpredictable spatiotemporal pattern and in very small neuronal loci of axons or dendrites. We developed an open source bioinformatics tool for an unbiased assessment of calcium signals in x,y-t imaging series. The tool bases its algorithm on a continuous wavelet transform-guided peak detection to identify calcium signal candidates. The highly sensitive calcium event definition is based on identification of peaks in 1D data through analysis of a 2D wavelet transform surface. For spatial analysis, the tool uses a grid to separate the x,y-image field in independently analyzed grid windows. A document containing a graphical summary of the data is automatically created and displays the loci of activity for a wide range of signal intensities. Furthermore, the number of activity events is summed up to create an estimated total activity value, which can be used to compare different experimental situations, such as calcium activity before or after an experimental treatment. All traces and data of active loci become documented. The tool can also compute the signal variance in a sliding window to visualize activity-dependent signal fluctuations. We applied the calcium signal detector to monitor activity states of cultured mouse neurons. Our data show that both the total activity value and the variance area created by a sliding window can distinguish experimental manipulations of neuronal activity states. Notably, the tool is powerful enough to compute local calcium events and ‘signal-close-to-noise’ activity in small loci of distal neurites of neurons, which remain during pharmacological blockade of neuronal activity with inhibitors such as tetrodotoxin, to block action potential firing, or inhibitors of ionotropic glutamate receptors. The tool can also offer information about local homeostatic calcium activity events in neurites.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/8fH_ykpqpmQ" width="1" />

Abstract<p>Synaptic activity <i>in vivo</i> can potentially alter the integration properties of neurons. Using recordings in awake mice, we targeted somatosensory layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons and compared neuronal properties with those from slices. Pyramidal cells <i>in vivo</i> had lower resistance and gain values, as well as broader spikes and increased spike frequency adaptation compared to the same cells in slices.

<p>by Ivan Dotu, Scott I. Adamson, Benjamin Coleman, Cyril Fournier, Emma Ricart-Altimiras, Eduardo Eyras, Jeffrey H. Chuang</p>

RNA-protein binding is critical to gene regulation, controlling fundamental processes including splicing, translation, localization and stability, and aberrant RNA-protein interactions are known to play a role in a wide variety of diseases. However, molecular understanding of RNA-protein interactions remains limited; in particular, identification of RNA motifs that bind proteins has long been challenging, especially when such motifs depend on both sequence and structure. Moreover, although RNA binding proteins (RBPs) often contain more than one binding domain, algorithms capable of identifying more than one binding motif simultaneously have not been developed. In this paper we present a novel pipeline to determine binding peaks in crosslinking immunoprecipitation (CLIP) data, to discover multiple possible RNA sequence/structure motifs among them, and to experimentally validate such motifs. At the core is a new semi-automatic algorithm SARNAclust, the first unsupervised method to identify and deconvolve multiple sequence/structure motifs simultaneously. SARNAclust computes similarity between sequence/structure objects using a graph kernel, providing the ability to isolate the impact of specific features through the bulge graph formalism. Application of SARNAclust to synthetic data shows its capability of clustering 5 motifs at once with a V-measure value of over 0.95, while GraphClust achieves only a V-measure of 0.083 and RNAcontext cannot detect any of the motifs. When applied to existing eCLIP sets, SARNAclust finds known motifs for SLBP and HNRNPC and novel motifs for several other RBPs such as AGGF1, AKAP8L and ILF3. We demonstrate an experimental validation protocol, a targeted Bind-n-Seq-like high-throughput sequencing approach that relies on RNA inverse folding for oligo pool design, that can validate the components within the SLBP motif. Finally, we use this protocol to experimentally interrogate the SARNAclust motif predictions for protein ILF3. Our results support a newly identified partially double-stranded UUUUUGAGA motif similar to that known for the splicing factor HNRNPC.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Sk4-TYwKrLk" width="1" />

Quantitative reasoning and techniques are increasingly ubiquitous across the life sciences. However, new graduate researchers with a biology background are often not equipped with the skills that are required to utilize such techniques correctly and efficiently. In parallel, there are increasing numbers of engineers, mathematicians, and physical scientists interested in studying problems in biology with only basic knowledge of this field. Students from such varied backgrounds can struggle to engage proactively together to tackle problems in biology. There is therefore a need to establish bridges between those disciplines. It is our proposal that the beginning of graduate school is the appropriate time to initiate those bridges through an interdisciplinary short course. We have instigated an intensive 10-day course that brought together new graduate students in the life sciences from across departments within the National University of Singapore. The course aimed at introducing biological problems as well as some of the quantitative approaches commonly used when tackling those problems. We have run the course for three years with over 100 students attending. Building on this experience, we share 11 quick tips on how to run such an effective, interdisciplinary short course for new graduate students in the biosciences.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/lgYLCd2q9tA" width="1" />

<p>by Brian S. Cole, Jason H. Moore</p>

Cloud computing has revolutionized the development and operations of hardware and software across diverse technological arenas, yet academic biomedical research has lagged behind despite the numerous and weighty advantages that cloud computing offers. Biomedical researchers who embrace cloud computing can reap rewards in cost reduction, decreased development and maintenance workload, increased reproducibility, ease of sharing data and software, enhanced security, horizontal and vertical scalability, high availability, a thriving technology partner ecosystem, and much more. Despite these advantages that cloud-based workflows offer, the majority of scientific software developed in academia does not utilize cloud computing and must be migrated to the cloud by the user. In this article, we present 11 quick tips for architecting biomedical informatics workflows on compute clouds, distilling knowledge gained from experience developing, operating, maintaining, and distributing software and virtualized appliances on the world’s largest cloud. Researchers who follow these tips stand to benefit immediately by migrating their workflows to cloud computing and embracing the paradigm of abstraction.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/C7tl3DiTInM" width="1" />

Abstract<p>Exposure to stress increases the risk of developing affective disorders such as depression and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). However, these disorders only occur in a subset of individuals, those that are more vulnerable to the effects of stress, whereas others remain resilient. The coping style adopted to deal with the stressor, either passive or active coping, is related to vulnerability or resilience, respectively. Important neural substrates that mediate responses to a stressor are the orexins. These neuropeptides are altered in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with stress-related illnesses such as depression and PTSD. The present experiments used a rodent social defeat model that generates actively coping rats and passively coping rats, which we have previously shown exhibit resilient and vulnerable profiles, respectively, to examine if orexins play a role in these stress-induced phenotypes. <i>In situ</i> radiolabeling and qPCR revealed that actively coping rats expressed significantly lower prepro-orexin mRNA compared with passively coping rats. This led to the hypothesis that lower levels of orexins contribute to resilience to repeated social stress. To test this hypothesis, rats first underwent five days of social defeat to establish active and passive coping phenotypes. Then, orexin neurons were inhibited prior to each social defeat for three additional days using Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADDs). Inhibition of orexins increased social interaction behavior and decreased depressive-like behavior in the vulnerable population of rats. Indeed, this suggests that lowering orexins promoted resilience to social defeat, and may be an important target for treatment of stress-related disorders.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Stress-related mental illnesses only occur in a subset of individuals, whereas others are resilient to the effects of stress. Our work used an animal model of social stress to identify a substrate of resilience, the neuropeptides orexins, which are known to be altered in patients with MDD and PTSD. We found that orexins are decreased in rats resilient to social stress. To test whether low orexins contribute to resilience, orexins were inhibited during three days of a social defeat stress paradigm, which increased subsequent social interaction behavior and decreased depressive-like behaviors in a previously vulnerable population of rats. This suggests that lowering orexins is important in promoting resilience to stress, and are an important target for treatments of stress-related illness.</p>

Abstract<p>In real-world environments, humans comprehend speech by actively integrating prior knowledge and expectations with sensory input. Recent studies have revealed effects of prior information in temporal and frontal cortical areas, and have suggested that these effects are underpinned by enhanced encoding of speech-specific features, rather than a broad enhancement or suppression of cortical activity. However, in terms of the specific hierarchical stages of processing involved in speech comprehension, the effects of integrating bottom-up sensory responses and top-down predictions are still unclear. In addition, it is unclear whether the predictability that comes with prior information may differentially affect speech encoding relative to the perceptual enhancement that comes with that prediction. One way to investigate these issues is through examining the impact of prior knowledge on indices of cortical tracking of continuous speech features. Here, we did this by presenting participants with degraded speech sentences that either were or were not preceded by a clear recording of the same sentences while recording non-invasive electroencephalography. We assessed the impact of prior information on an isolated index of cortical tracking that reflected phoneme-level processing. Our findings suggests the possibility that prior information affects the early encoding of natural speech in a dual manner. Firstly, the availability of prior information, as hypothesized, enhanced the perceived clarity of degraded speech, which was positively correlated with changes in phoneme-level encoding across subjects. In addition, prior knowledge induced an overall reduction of this cortical measure, which we interpret as resulting from the increase in predictability.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> The human ability to comprehend speech despite challenges such as loud noise and competing speech derives in large part from the use of prior knowledge of the upcoming speech. Here, we examine the cortical underpinnings of this process by using prior knowledge to modulate the perceived intelligibility of degraded stimuli. We find two distinct effects of prior knowledge: A positive correlation between perceptual enhancement and phoneme-level encoding and an overall suppression of this cortical encoding.</p>

Complement activation products have long been associated with roles in the innate immune system, linking the humoral and cellular responses. However, among their recently described non-inflammatory roles, complement proteins also have multiple emerging novel functions in brain development. Within this context, separate proteins and pathways of complement have carved out physiological niches in the formation, development, and refinement of neurons. They demonstrate actions that are both reminiscent of peripheral immune actions and removed from them.

de Jong et al. demonstrate that the RIM C2B domain is important for neurotransmitter release. RIM C2B binds to the phospholipid PIP2, and this interaction directs synaptic vesicle priming and Ca2+ influx to the PIP2-containing plasma membrane for efficient exocytosis.

<p>by Soroush Samadian, Jeff P. Bruce, Trevor J. Pugh</p>

Somatic copy number variations (CNVs) play a crucial role in development of many human cancers. The broad availability of next-generation sequencing data has enabled the development of algorithms to computationally infer CNV profiles from a variety of data types including exome and targeted sequence data; currently the most prevalent types of cancer genomics data. However, systemic evaluation and comparison of these tools remains challenging due to a lack of ground truth reference sets. To address this need, we have developed Bamgineer, a tool written in Python to introduce user-defined haplotype-phased allele-specific copy number events into an existing Binary Alignment Mapping (BAM) file, with a focus on targeted and exome sequencing experiments. As input, this tool requires a read alignment file (BAM format), lists of non-overlapping genome coordinates for introduction of gains and losses (bed file), and an optional file defining known haplotypes (vcf format). To improve runtime performance, Bamgineer introduces the desired CNVs in parallel using queuing and parallel processing on a local machine or on a high-performance computing cluster. As proof-of-principle, we applied Bamgineer to a single high-coverage (mean: 220X) exome sequence file from a blood sample to simulate copy number profiles of 3 exemplar tumors from each of 10 tumor types at 5 tumor cellularity levels (20–100%, 150 BAM files in total). To demonstrate feasibility beyond exome data, we introduced read alignments to a targeted 5-gene cell-free DNA sequencing library to simulate <i>EGFR</i> amplifications at frequencies consistent with circulating tumor DNA (10, 1, 0.1 and 0.01%) while retaining the multimodal insert size distribution of the original data. We expect Bamgineer to be of use for development and systematic benchmarking of CNV calling algorithms by users using locally-generated data for a variety of applications.

<p>by Aloys Dufour, Emilie Gontran, Christophe Deroulers, Pascale Varlet, Johan Pallud, Basile Grammaticos, Mathilde Badoual</p>

Oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) have remarkable properties: they represent the most abundant cycling cell population in the adult normal brain and they manage to achieve a uniform and constant density throughout the adult brain. This equilibrium is obtained by the interplay of four processes: division, differentiation or death, migration and active self-repulsion. They are also strongly suspected to be at the origin of gliomas, when their equilibrium is disrupted. In this article, we present a model of the dynamics of OPCs, first in a normal tissue. This model is based on a cellular automaton and its rules are mimicking the ones that regulate the dynamics of real OPCs. The model is able to reproduce the homeostasis of the cell population, with the maintenance of a constant and uniform cell density and the healing of a lesion. We show that there exists a fair quantitative agreement between the simulated and experimental parameters, such as the cell velocity, the time taken to close a lesion, and the duration of the cell cycle. We present three possible scenarios of disruption of the equilibrium: the appearance of an over-proliferating cell, of a deadless/non-differentiating cell, or of a cell that lost any contact-inhibition. We show that the appearance of an over-proliferating cell is sufficient to trigger the growth of a tumor that has low-grade glioma features: an invasive behaviour, a linear radial growth of the tumor with a corresponding growth velocity of less than 2 mm per year, as well a cell density at the center which exceeds the one in normal tissue by a factor of less than two. The loss of contact inhibition leads to a more high-grade-like glioma. The results of our model contribute to the body of evidence that identify OPCs as possible cells of origin of gliomas.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/4yhFdqGpIbo" width="1" />

<p>by Mengmeng Du, Jiajia Li, Liang Chen, Yuguo Yu, Ying Wu</p>

Experimental recordings in hippocampal slices indicate that astrocytic dysfunction may cause neuronal hyper-excitation or seizures. Considering that astrocytes play important roles in mediating local uptake and spatial buffering of K<sup>+</sup> in the extracellular space of the cortical circuit, we constructed a novel model of an astrocyte-neuron network module consisting of a single compartment neuron and 4 surrounding connected astrocytes and including extracellular potassium dynamics. Next, we developed a new model function for the astrocyte gap junctions, connecting two astrocyte-neuron network modules. The function form and parameters of the gap junction were based on nonlinear regression fitting of a set of experimental data published in previous studies. Moreover, we have created numerical simulations using the above single astrocyte-neuron network module and the coupled astrocyte-neuron network modules. Our model validates previous experimental observations that both Kir4.1 channels and gap junctions play important roles in regulating the concentration of extracellular potassium. In addition, we also observe that changes in Kir4.1 channel conductance and gap junction strength induce spontaneous epileptic activity in the absence of external stimuli.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/fOtr0tevqZs" width="1" />

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Juvenility represents a critical developmental phase during which exposure to a high fat diet (HFD) can severely modify cognitive and emotional functioning. The purpose of this study was to address how short and acute exposure to a HFD during juvenility affects social memory recognition and prefrontal long-term potentiation (LTP). As LTP and social memory depend on the neuromodulator oxytocin (OXY) and due to its role in metabolism, we also examined the effects of OXY in mediating HFD-induced alterations in social memory and LTP. Our results show that short exposure to a HFD during juvenility impairs social preference memory and prefrontal LTP. Interestingly, whereas systemic injections of OXY reversed the impairments in HFD-fed animals and impaired LTP and memory in control animals; prefrontal injections of the OXY agonist TGOT reversed the effects in HFD animals without affecting control animals. Exposure to HFD was associated with a reduction in the levels of OXY in the prefrontal compared to control animals. Interestingly, the restoration of social memory by TGOT in HFD animals was also associated with normalization of OXY in the prefrontal. These results point to a role that prefrontal OXY has in mediating the effects of HFD on memory and plasticity.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>There is a severe limitation in the number of items that can be held in working memory. However, the neurophysiological limits remain unknown. We asked whether the capacity limit might be explained by differences in neuronal coupling. We developed a theoretical model based on Predictive Coding and used it to analyze Cross Spectral Density data from the prefrontal cortex (PFC), frontal eye fields (FEF), and lateral intraparietal area (LIP). Monkeys performed a change detection task. The number of objects that had to be remembered (memory load) was varied (1–3 objects in the same visual hemifield). Changes in memory load changed the connectivity in the PFC–FEF–LIP network. Feedback (top-down) coupling broke down when the number of objects exceeded cognitive capacity. Thus, impaired behavioral performance coincided with a break-down of Prediction signals. This provides new insights into the neuronal underpinnings of cognitive capacity and how coupling in a distributed working memory network is affected by memory load.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Coordinated activity within and differential activity between large-scale neuronal networks such as the default mode network (DMN) and the control network (CN) is a critical feature of brain organization. The CN usually exhibits activations in response to cognitive tasks while the DMN shows deactivations; in addition, activity between the two networks is anti-correlated at rest. To address this issue, we used functional MRI to measure whole-brain BOLD signal during resting-state and task-evoked conditions, and MR spectroscopy (MRS) to quantify GABA and glutamate concentrations, in nodes within the DMN and CN (MPFC and DLPFC, respectively) in 19 healthy individuals at 3 Tesla. We found that GABA concentrations in the MPFC were significantly associated with DMN deactivation during a working memory task and with anti-correlation between DMN and CN at rest and during task performance, while GABA concentrations in the DLPFC weakly modulated DMN–CN anti-correlation in the opposite direction. Highlighting specificity, glutamate played a less significant role related to brain activity. These findings indicate that GABA in the MPFC is potentially involved in orchestrating between-network brain activity at rest and during task performance.</span>

The physiology of the central nervous system (CNS) is built on a foundation of connection, integration, and the exchange of complex information among brain cells. Emerging evidence indicates that extracellular vesicles (EVs) are key players in the intercellular communication that underlies physiological processes such as synaptic plasticity and the maintenance of myelination. Furthermore, upon injury to the CNS, EVs may propagate inflammation across the blood–brain barrier and beyond, and also appear to mediate neuroprotection and modulate regenerative processes.

A growing body of work is investigating the safety and efficacy of light in Parkinson’s disease (PD). Here we discuss the potential of this emerging therapy to improve both motor and non-motor symptoms of PD. We also highlight directions for future basic, translational, and clinical research that are critical for the development of mechanism-based protocols of light therapy in PD.

The brain is an organ of immense complexity. Next-generation RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) is becoming increasingly popular in the deconstruction of this complexity into distinct classes of ‘cell types’. Notably, in addition to revealing the organization of this distinct cell-type landscape, the technology has also begun to illustrate that continuous variation can be found within narrowly defined cell types. Here we summarize the evidence for graded transcriptomic heterogeneity being present, widespread, and functionally relevant in the nervous system.

<p>Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) secreted by neurons is a significant component of synaptic plasticity. In humans, it is also present in blood platelets where it accumulates following its biosynthesis in megakaryocytes. BDNF levels are thus readily detectable in human serum and it has been abundantly speculated that they may somehow serve as an indicator of brain function. However, there is a great deal of uncertainty with regard to the range of BDNF levels that can be considered normal, how stable these values are over time and even whether BDNF levels can be reliably measured in serum. Using monoclonal antibodies and a sandwich ELISA, this study reports on BDNF levels in the serum of 259 volunteers with a mean value of 32.69 ± 8.33 ng/ml (SD). The mean value for the same cohort after 12 months was not significantly different (<i>N</i> = 226, 32.97 ± 8.36 ng/ml SD, <i>p</i> = 0.19). Power analysis of these values indicates that relatively large cohorts are necessary to identify significant differences, requiring a group size of 60 to detect a 20% change. The levels determined by ELISA could be validated by Western blot analyses using a BDNF monoclonal antibody. While no association was observed with gender, a weak, positive correlation was found with age. The overall conclusions are that BDNF levels can be reliably measured in human serum, that these levels are quite stable over one year, and that comparisons between two populations may only be meaningful if cohorts of sufficient sizes are assembled.</p>

Abstract<p>Diffuse activation of interleukin-1 inflammatory cytokine signaling after traumatic brain injury (TBI) elicits progressive neurodegeneration and neuropsychiatric dysfunction, and thus represents a potential opportunity for therapeutic intervention. Although IL-1α and IL-1β both activate the common type 1 interleukin-1 receptor (IL-1RI), they manifest distinct injury-specific roles in some models of neurodegeneration. Despite its potential relevance to treating patients with TBI, however, the individual contributions of IL-1α and IL-1β to TBI-pathology have not been previously investigated. To address this need, we applied genetic and pharmacologic approaches in mice to dissect the individual contributions of IL-1α, IL-β, and IL-1RI signaling to the pathophysiology of fluid percussion-mediated TBI, a model of mixed focal and diffuse TBI. IL-1RI ablation conferred a greater protective effect on brain cytokine expression and cognitive function after TBI than did individual IL-1α or IL-1β ablation. This protective effect was recapitulated by treatment with the drug anakinra, a recombinant naturally-occurring IL-1RI antagonist. Our data thus suggest that broad targeting of IL-1RI signaling is more likely to reduce neuroinflammation and preserve cognitive function after TBI than are approaches that individually target IL-1α or IL-1β signaling.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Traumatic brain injury is a leading cause of death and disability. Secondary signaling cascades, including neuroinflammation, trigger progressive neuronal injury following TBI. Interleukin-1 (IL-1) is a major driver of the neuroinflammatory response to brain injury, but the impact of individual IL-1α or IL-1β blockade on TBI outcome had not been evaluated. Using genetic and pharmacologic approaches, we dissected the contributions of IL-1α, IL-β, and IL-1RI to the pathophysiology of fluid percussion-mediated TBI. We show that genetic ablation of IL-1RI conferred the greatest benefit after TBI. Moreover, the beneficial effects were recapitulated by treatment with an IL-1RI antagonist. Given the need for the development of effective therapies that mitigate neurodegeneration after TBI, this is a timely, relevant area of study.</p>

Abstract<p>Sensorimotor integration, the translation between acoustic signals and motoric programs, may constitute a crucial mechanism for speech. During speech perception, the acoustic-motoric translations include the recruitment of cortical areas for the representation of speech articulatory features, such as place of articulation. Selective attention can shape the processing and performance of speech perception tasks. Whether and where sensorimotor integration takes place during attentive speech perception remains to be explored. Here, we investigate articulatory feature representations of spoken consonant-vowel syllables during two distinct tasks. Fourteen healthy humans attended to either the vowel or the consonant within a syllable in separate delayed-match-to-sample tasks. Single-trial fMRI BOLD responses from perception periods were analyzed using multivariate pattern classification and a searchlight approach to reveal neural activation patterns sensitive to the processing of place of articulation (i.e., bilabial/labiodental vs. alveolar). To isolate place of articulation representation from acoustic covariation, we applied a cross-decoding (generalization) procedure across distinct features of manner of articulation (i.e., stop, fricative, and nasal). We found evidence for the representation of place of articulation across tasks and in both tasks separately: for attention to vowels, generalization maps included bilateral clusters of superior and posterior temporal, insular, and frontal regions; for attention to consonants, generalization maps encompassed clusters in temporoparietal, insular, and frontal regions within the right hemisphere only. Our results specify the cortical representation of place of articulation features generalized across manner of articulation during attentive syllable perception, thus supporting sensorimotor integration during attentive speech perception and demonstrating the value of generalization.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Speech is supported by sensorimotor integration, a bidirectional translation of its auditory and motoric signals. Whether our brain represents speech as articulatory features during selective attention has not yet been well specified. We focused on the representation of articulatory information of speech during attentive speech perception. For the first time, we applied generalization in classification analysis to counteract the differences in acoustic properties that accompany articulatory information. Participants attended to either the vowels or consonants of syllables, while undergoing fMRI. Our results show that articulatory information is represented in widespread cortical areas during selective attention to the different syllable components, supporting sensorimotor integration during attentive speech perception.</p>

Photoreceptors form synapses on interneurons in the retina. Sarin et al. used RNA-seq and somatic CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis to seek genes required for this process. They show that Wnt5 produced by bipolar interneurons acts on rod photoreceptors to regulate synapse location.

Abstract
<p>Traumatic brain injury (TBI) leads to a deleterious and multifactorial secondary inflammatory response in the brain. Oxidative stress from the inflammation likely contributes to the brain damage although it is unclear to which extent. A largely unexplored approach is to consider phenotypic regulation of oxidative stress levels. Genetic polymorphism influences inflammation in the central nervous system and it is possible that the antioxidative response differs between phenotypes and affects the severity of the secondary injury. We therefore compared the antioxidative response in inbred rat strains dark agouti (DA) to piebald viral glaxo (PVG). DA has high susceptibility to inflammatory challenges and PVG is protected. Primary neuronal cell cultures were exposed to peroxynitrite (ONOO<sup>–</sup>), nitric oxide (NO), superoxide (O<sub>2</sub><sup>–</sup>), and 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE). Our findings demonstrated a phenotypic control of the neuronal antioxidative response, specific to manganese O<sub>2</sub><sup>–</sup> dismutase (MnSOD). DA neurons had increased levels of MnSOD, equal levels of peroxiredoxin 5 (PRDX5), decreased oxidative stress markers 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT) and 4-HNE and decreased neuronal death detected by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release after 24 h, and higher oxidative stress levels by CellROX than PVG after 2 h. It is possible that DA neurons had a phenotypic adaptation to a fiercer inflammatory environment. ONOO<sup>–</sup> was confirmed as the most powerful oxidative damage mediator, while 4-HNE caused few oxidative effects. Inducible NO synthase (iNOS) was not induced, suggesting that inflammatory, while not oxidative stimulation was required. These findings indicate that phenotypic antioxidative regulation affects the secondary inflammation, which should be considered in future individualized treatments and when evaluating antioxidative pharmacological interventions.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0346-17.2018v1?rss=1">Common Sense in Choice: The Effect of Sensory Modality on Neural Value Representations</a></h4>

Abstract<p>Although it is well established that the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) represents value using a common currency across categories of rewards, it is unknown whether the vmPFC represents value irrespective of the sensory modality in which alternatives are presented. In the current study, male and female human subjects completed a decision-making task while their neural activity was recorded using functional magnetic resonance imaging. On each trial, subjects chose between a safe alternative and a lottery, which was presented visually or aurally. A univariate conjunction analysis revealed that the anterior portion of the vmPFC tracks subjective value irrespective of the sensory modality. Using a novel cross-modality multivariate classifier, we were able to decode auditory value based on visual trials and vice versa. In addition, we found that the visual and auditory sensory cortices, which were identified using functional localizers, are also sensitive to the value of stimuli, albeit in a modality-specific manner. Whereas both primary and higher-order auditory cortices represented auditory subjective value, only a higher-order visual area represented visual subjective value. These findings expand our understanding of the Common Currency Network of the brain, and shed a new light on the interplay between sensory and value information processing.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Whether auditory information has the same impact on the value system as visual information is unknown. This is striking, given that we live in a multimodal world, and decision-making relies on evidence from all of our senses. It is well-known that the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) represents value in an abstract and common manner, which allows comparison between different options. We examined whether this representation is sensitive to the sensory modality in which options are presented. Using fMRI and a risk-evaluating task, we show that whereas sensory cortices represent value of options in a modality-specific way, the vmPFC represents value irrespective of sensory modality. This brings our understanding of the neural value system closer to choices in the real world.</p>
