              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14878">Applications of Random Matrix Theory in Machine Learning and Brain Mapping</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2502.14878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brain mapping analyzes the wavelengths of brain signals and outputs them in a map, which is then analyzed by a radiologist. Introducing Machine Learning (ML) into the brain mapping process reduces the variable of human error in reading such maps and increases efficiency. A key area of interest is determining the correlation between the functional areas of the brain on a voxel (3-dimensional pixel) wise basis. This leads to determining how a brain is functioning and can be used to detect diseases, disabilities, and sicknesses. As such, random noise presents a challenge in consistently determining the actual signals from the scan. This paper discusses how an algorithm created by Random Matrix Theory (RMT) can be used as a tool for ML, as it detects the correlation of the functional areas of the brain. Random matrices are simulated to represent the voxel signal intensity strength for each time interval where a stimulus is presented in an fMRI scan. Using the Marchenko-Pastur law for Wishart Matrices, a result of RMT, it was found that no matter what type of noise was added to the random matrices, the observed eigenvalue distribution of the Wishart Matrices would converge to the theoretical distribution. This means that RMT is robust and has a high test-re-test reliability. These results further indicate that a strong correlation exists between the eigenvalues, and hence the functional regions of the brain. Any eigenvalue that differs significantly from those predicted from RMT may indicate the discovery of a new discrete brain network.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15104">Estimating Neural Representation Alignment from Limited Inputs and Features</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2502.15104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In both artificial and biological systems, the centered kernel alignment (CKA) has become a widely used tool for quantifying neural representation similarity. While current CKA estimators typically correct for the effects of finite stimuli sampling, the effects of sampling a subset of neurons are overlooked, introducing notable bias in standard experimental scenarios. Here, we provide a theoretical analysis showing how this bias is affected by the representation geometry. We then introduce a novel estimator that corrects for both input and feature sampling. We use our method for evaluating both brain-to-brain and model-to-brain alignments and show that it delivers reliable comparisons even with very sparsely sampled neurons. We perform within-animal and across-animal comparisons on electrophysiological data from visual cortical areas V1, V4, and IT data, and use these as benchmarks to evaluate model-to-brain alignment. We also apply our method to reveal how object representations become progressively disentangled across layers in both biological and artificial systems. These findings underscore the importance of correcting feature-sampling biases in CKA and demonstrate that our bias-corrected estimator provides a more faithful measure of representation alignment. The improved estimates increase our understanding of how neural activity is structured across both biological and artificial systems.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15440">State-space kinetic Ising model reveals task-dependent entropy flow in sparsely active nonequilibrium neuronal dynamics</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2502.15440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neuronal ensemble activity, including coordinated and oscillatory patterns, exhibits hallmarks of nonequilibrium systems with time-asymmetric trajectories to maintain their organization. However, assessing time asymmetry from neuronal spiking activity remains challenging. The kinetic Ising model provides a framework for studying the causal, nonequilibrium dynamics in spiking recurrent neural networks. Recent theoretical advances in this model have enabled time-asymmetry estimation from large-scale steady-state data. Yet, neuronal activity often exhibits time-varying firing rates and coupling strengths, violating steady-state assumption. To overcome these limitations, we developed a state-space kinetic Ising model that accounts for non-stationary and nonequilibrium properties of neural systems. This approach incorporates a mean-field method for estimating time-varying entropy flow, a key measure for maintaining the system's organization by dissipation. Applying this method to mouse visual cortex data revealed greater variability in causal couplings during task engagement despite the reduced neuronal activity with increased sparsity. Moreover, higher-performing mice exhibited increased entropy flow in higher-firing neurons during task engagement, suggesting that stronger directed activity emerged in a fewer neurons within sparsely active populations. These findings underscore the model's utility in uncovering intricate asymmetric causal dynamics in neuronal ensembles and linking them to behavior through the thermodynamic underpinnings of neural computation.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15503">BAN: Neuroanatomical Aligning in Auditory Recognition between Artificial Neural Network and Human Cortex</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2502.15503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Drawing inspiration from neurosciences, artificial neural networks (ANNs) have evolved from shallow architectures to highly complex, deep structures, yielding exceptional performance in auditory recognition tasks. However, traditional ANNs often struggle to align with brain regions due to their excessive depth and lack of biologically realistic features, like recurrent connection. To address this, a brain-like auditory network (BAN) is introduced, which incorporates four neuroanatomically mapped areas and recurrent connection, guided by a novel metric called the brain-like auditory score (BAS). BAS serves as a benchmark for evaluating the similarity between BAN and human auditory recognition pathway. We further propose that specific areas in the cerebral cortex, mainly the middle and medial superior temporal (T2/T3) areas, correspond to the designed network structure, drawing parallels with the brain's auditory perception pathway. Our findings suggest that the neuroanatomical similarity in the cortex and auditory classification abilities of the ANN are well-aligned. In addition to delivering excellent performance on a music genre classification task, the BAN demonstrates a high BAS score. In conclusion, this study presents BAN as a recurrent, brain-inspired ANN, representing the first model that mirrors the cortical pathway of auditory recognition.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15634">Sparks of cognitive flexibility: self-guided context inference for flexible stimulus-response mapping by attentional routing</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2502.15634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flexible cognition demands discovering hidden rules to quickly adapt stimulus-response mappings. Standard neural networks struggle in tasks requiring rapid, context-driven remapping. Recently, Hummos (2023) introduced a fast-and-slow learning algorithm to mitigate this shortfall, but its scalability to complex, image-computable tasks was unclear. Here, we propose the Wisconsin Neural Network (WiNN), which expands on fast-and-slow learning for real-world tasks demanding flexible rule-based behavior. WiNN employs a pretrained convolutional neural network for vision, coupled with an adjustable "context state" that guides attention to relevant features. If WiNN produces an incorrect response, it first iteratively updates its context state to refocus attention on task-relevant cues, then performs minimal parameter updates to attention and readout layers. This strategy preserves generalizable representations in the sensory network, reducing catastrophic forgetting. We evaluate WiNN on an image-based extension of the Wisconsin Card Sorting Task, revealing several markers of cognitive flexibility: (i) WiNN autonomously infers underlying rules, (ii) requires fewer examples to do so than control models reliant on large-scale parameter updates, (iii) can perform context-based rule inference solely via context-state adjustments-further enhanced by slow updates of attention and readout parameters, and (iv) generalizes to unseen compositional rules through context-state inference alone. By blending fast context inference with targeted attentional guidance, WiNN achieves "sparks" of flexibility. This approach offers a path toward context-sensitive models that retain knowledge while rapidly adapting to complex, rule-based tasks.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15198">Graph-Based Deep Learning on Stereo EEG for Predicting Seizure Freedom in Epilepsy Patients</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2502.15198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting seizure freedom is essential for tailoring epilepsy treatment. But accurate prediction remains challenging with traditional methods, especially with diverse patient populations. This study developed a deep learning-based graph neural network (GNN) model to predict seizure freedom from stereo electroencephalography (sEEG) data in patients with refractory epilepsy. We utilized high-quality sEEG data from 15 pediatric patients to train a deep learning model that can accurately predict seizure freedom outcomes and advance understanding of brain connectivity at the seizure onset zone. Our model integrates local and global connectivity using graph convolutions with multi-scale attention mechanisms to capture connections between difficult-to-study regions such as the thalamus and motor regions. The model achieved an accuracy of 92.4% in binary class analysis, 86.6% in patient-wise analysis, and 81.4% in multi-class analysis. Node and edge-level feature analysis highlighted the anterior cingulate and frontal pole regions as key contributors to seizure freedom outcomes. The nodes identified by our model were also more likely to coincide with seizure onset zones. Our findings underscore the potential of new connectivity-based deep learning models such as GNNs for enhancing the prediction of seizure freedom, predicting seizure onset zones, connectivity analysis of the brain during seizure, as well as informing AI-assisted personalized epilepsy treatment planning.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16123">Spike-timing-dependent plasticity and random inputs shape interspike interval regularity of model STN neurons</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2410.16123v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neuronal oscillations are closely related to the symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD). In this study, we explore how random fluctuations (or "stochastic inputs") affect these oscillations in brain states, which reflect the collective activity of interconnected neurons. These random inputs are modeled in the context of the subthalamic nucleus (STN), a brain region implicated in PD, and their interaction with synaptic dynamics and spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) in both healthy and PD-affected neurons. Specifically, we investigate the effects of random synaptic inputs and their correlations on the membrane potential of STN neurons. Our results show that these random inputs significantly influence the firing patterns of STN neurons, both in healthy cells and in those affected by PD under deep brain stimulation (DBS) treatment. We also find that STDP increases the regularity of the interspike intervals (ISI) in spike trains of output neurons. However, the introduction of random refractory periods and fluctuating input currents can induce greater irregularity in the spike trains. Furthermore, when random inputs and STDP are combined, the correlation between the activity of different neurons increases. These findings suggest that the stochastic dynamics of STN neurons, in conjunction with STDP, could offer insights into the mechanisms underlying PD symptoms and their potential management.

                arXiv:2211.08288v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Addiction is a major public health concern characterized by compulsive reward-seeking behavior. The excitatory glutamatergic signals from the hippocampus (HIP) to the Nucleus accumbens (NAc) mediate learned behavior in addiction. Limited comparative studies have investigated the neural pathways activated by natural and unnatural reward sources. This study has evaluated neural activities in HIP and NAc associated with food (natural) and morphine (drug) reward sources using local field potential (LFP). We developed novel approaches to classify LFP signals into the source of reward and recorded regions by considering the time-domain feature of these signals. Proposed methods included a validation step of the LFP signals using autocorrelation, Lyapunov exponent and Hurst exponent to assess the meaningful stability of these signals (lack of chaos). By utilizing the probability density function (PDF) of LFP signals and applying Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD), data were classified to the source of the reward. Also, HIP and NAc regions were visually separated and classified using the symmetrized dot pattern technique, which can be applied in real-time to ensure the deep brain region of interest is being targeted accurately during LFP recording. We believe our method provides a computationally light and fast, real-time signal analysis approach with real-world implementation.

Abstract: Recent advances in artificial intelligence have given rise to large language models (LLMs) that not only achieve human-like performance but also share computational principles with the brain's language processing mechanisms. While previous research has primarily focused on aligning LLMs' internal representations with neural activity, we introduce a novel approach that leverages explainable AI (XAI) methods to forge deeper connections between the two domains. Using attribution methods, we quantified how preceding words contribute to an LLM's next-word predictions and employed these explanations to predict fMRI recordings from participants listening to the same narratives. Our findings demonstrate that attribution methods robustly predict brain activity across the language network, surpassing traditional internal representations in early language areas. This alignment is hierarchical: early-layer explanations correspond to the initial stages of language processing in the brain, while later layers align with more advanced stages. Moreover, the layers more influential on LLM next-word prediction$\unicode{x2014}$those with higher attribution scores$\unicode{x2014}$exhibited stronger alignment with neural activity. This work establishes a bidirectional bridge between AI and neuroscience. First, we demonstrate that attribution methods offer a powerful lens for investigating the neural mechanisms of language comprehension, revealing how meaning emerges from preceding context. Second, we propose using brain alignment as a metric to evaluate the validity of attribution methods, providing a framework for assessing their biological plausibility.

Abstract: Inverse design in science and engineering involves determining optimal design parameters that achieve desired performance outcomes, a process often hindered by the complexity and high dimensionality of design spaces, leading to significant computational costs. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel hybrid approach that combines active learning with Tandem Neural Networks to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of solving inverse design problems. Active learning allows to selectively sample the most informative data points, reducing the required dataset size without compromising accuracy. We investigate this approach using three benchmark problems: airfoil inverse design, photonic surface inverse design, and scalar boundary condition reconstruction in diffusion partial differential equations. We demonstrate that integrating active learning with Tandem Neural Networks outperforms standard approaches across the benchmark suite, achieving better accuracy with fewer training samples.

                arXiv:2406.02923v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are posited as a computationally efficient and biologically plausible alternative to conventional neural architectures, with their core computational framework primarily using the leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neuron model. However, the limited hidden state representation of LIF neurons, characterized by a scalar membrane potential, and sequential spike generation process, poses challenges for effectively developing scalable spiking models to address long-range dependencies in sequence learning tasks. In this study, we develop a scalable probabilistic spiking learning framework for long-range dependency tasks leveraging the fundamentals of state space models. Unlike LIF neurons that rely on the deterministic Heaviside function for a sequential process of spike generation, we introduce a SpikeSampler layer that samples spikes stochastically based on an SSM-based neuronal model while allowing parallel computations. To address non-differentiability of the spiking operation and enable effective training, we also propose a surrogate function tailored for the stochastic nature of the SpikeSampler layer. To enhance inter-neuron communication, we introduce the SpikeMixer block, which integrates spikes from neuron populations in each layer. This is followed by a ClampFuse layer, incorporating a residual connection to capture complex dependencies, enabling scalability of the model. Our models attain state-of-the-art performance among SNN models across diverse long-range dependency tasks, encompassing the Long Range Arena benchmark, permuted sequential MNIST, and the Speech Command dataset and demonstrate sparse spiking pattern highlighting its computational efficiency.

                arXiv:2412.20694v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Solving NP-hard problems traditionally relies on heuristics, yet manually designing effective heuristics for complex problems remains a significant challenge. While recent advancements like FunSearch have shown that large language models (LLMs) can be integrated into evolutionary algorithms (EAs) for heuristic design, their potential is hindered by limitations in balancing exploitation and exploration. We introduce Quality-Uncertainty Balanced Evolution (QUBE), a novel approach that enhances LLM+EA methods by redefining the priority criterion within the FunSearch framework. QUBE employs the Quality-Uncertainty Trade-off Criterion (QUTC), based on our proposed Uncertainty-Inclusive Quality metric, to evaluate and guide the evolutionary process. Through extensive experiments on challenging NP-complete problems, QUBE demonstrates significant performance improvements over FunSearch and baseline methods. Our code are available at https://github.com/zzjchen/QUBE_code.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10470">MetaDE: Evolving Differential Evolution by Differential Evolution</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2502.10470v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As a cornerstone in the Evolutionary Computation (EC) domain, Differential Evolution (DE) is known for its simplicity and effectiveness in handling challenging black-box optimization problems. While the advantages of DE are well-recognized, achieving peak performance heavily depends on its hyperparameters such as the mutation factor, crossover probability, and the selection of specific DE strategies. Traditional approaches to this hyperparameter dilemma have leaned towards parameter tuning or adaptive mechanisms. However, identifying the optimal settings tailored for specific problems remains a persistent challenge. In response, we introduce MetaDE, an approach that evolves DE's intrinsic hyperparameters and strategies using DE itself at a meta-level. A pivotal aspect of MetaDE is a specialized parameterization technique, which endows it with the capability to dynamically modify DE's parameters and strategies throughout the evolutionary process. To augment computational efficiency, MetaDE incorporates a design that leverages parallel processing through a GPU-accelerated computing framework. Within such a framework, DE is not just a solver but also an optimizer for its own configurations, thus streamlining the process of hyperparameter optimization and problem-solving into a cohesive and automated workflow. Extensive evaluations on the CEC2022 benchmark suite demonstrate MetaDE's promising performance. Moreover, when applied to robot control via evolutionary reinforcement learning, MetaDE also demonstrates promising performance. The source code of MetaDE is publicly accessible at: https://github.com/EMI-Group/metade.

                arXiv:2411.06613v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While machine learning (ML) models are becoming mainstream, especially in sensitive application areas, the risk of data leakage has become a growing concern. Attacks like membership inference (MIA) have shown that trained models can reveal sensitive data, jeopardizing confidentiality. While traditional Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) dominate ML applications, neuromorphic architectures, specifically Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), are emerging as promising alternatives due to their low power consumption and event-driven processing, akin to biological neurons. Privacy in ANNs is well-studied; however, little work has explored the privacy-preserving properties of SNNs. This paper examines whether SNNs inherently offer better privacy. Using MIAs, we assess the privacy resilience of SNNs versus ANNs across diverse datasets. We analyze the impact of learning algorithms (surrogate gradient and evolutionary), frameworks (snnTorch, TENNLab, LAVA), and parameters on SNN privacy. Our findings show that SNNs consistently outperform ANNs in privacy preservation, with evolutionary algorithms offering additional resilience. For instance, on CIFAR-10, SNNs achieve an AUC of 0.59, significantly lower than ANNs' 0.82, and on CIFAR-100, SNNs maintain an AUC of 0.58 compared to ANNs' 0.88. Additionally, we explore the privacy-utility trade-off with Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DPSGD), finding that SNNs sustain less accuracy loss than ANNs under similar privacy constraints.

                arXiv:2412.09800v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Next-generation reservoir computing (NG-RC) has attracted much attention due to its excellent performance in spatio-temporal forecasting of complex systems and its ease of implementation. This paper shows that NG-RC can be encoded as a kernel ridge regression that makes training efficient and feasible even when the space of chosen polynomial features is very large. Additionally, an extension to an infinite number of covariates is possible, which makes the methodology agnostic with respect to the lags into the past that are considered as explanatory factors, as well as with respect to the number of polynomial covariates, an important hyperparameter in traditional NG-RC. We show that this approach has solid theoretical backing and good behavior based on kernel universality properties previously established in the literature. Various numerical illustrations show that these generalizations of NG-RC outperform the traditional approach in several forecasting applications.

">Altered mechanical properties of astrocytes lacking MLC1; implications for the leukodystrophy MLC</a></h4>

              
                Loss of function of the astrocyte protein MLC1 causes Megalencephalic Leukoencephalopathy with subcortical Cysts (MLC), a leukodystrophy characterized by white matter edema and slow neurological deterioration. MLC1 dysfunction leads to swelling of perivascular astrocyte endfeet and an impaired attachment of endfeet to blood vessels. In isolated primary astrocytes, loss of MLC1 hinders recovery of astrocytes from cell swelling, but the cellular function of MLC1 is not completely understood. MLC1 modulates gating of mechanosensitive ion channels involved in volume regulation. The cytoskeleton plays a crucial role in cell volume regulation, and interactions between the cytoskeleton and cell membrane affect the properties of mechanosensitive ion channels. Therefore, we investigated whether primary Mlc1-null mouse astrocytes show a disruption in their mechanical properties. We measured mechanical properties of cultured primary astrocytes with an indentation technique and demonstrated that Mlc1-null astrocytes are softer than wild-type astrocytes. Proteomic analysis confirmed dysregulation of several cytoskeleton-related pathways in Mlc1-null astrocytes. Confocal imaging revealed that organization of the actin cytoskeleton is unaffected. Instead, we observed alterations in focal adhesions, which aid in relaying mechanical forces between the cytoskeleton, cell membrane, and the extracellular matrix (ECM). Together, our findings reveal that the mechanical properties of Mlc1-null astrocytes are altered, and that disrupted cytoskeleton-membrane-ECM interactions potentially play a role in the disease. Modulators of astrocyte mechanobiology might therefore hold promise for MLC therapy development.

By applying temporal decomposition and multivariate pattern analysis, we dissected the neural underpinnings across different levels of signal coding. The study provides neurophysiological evidence for the influence of knowledge adaptiveness on shaping predictive coding, revealing that these are intricately linked and predominantly manifest at the abstract and motor coding levels. These findings challenge the traditional view of a competitive relationship between learning context and knowledge, suggesting instead a hierarchical integration where their properties are processed simultaneously. This integration facilitates the adaptive reuse of existing knowledge in the face of new learning.

	<p>Background: Blast traumatic brain injury (bTBI) can result in depression-like behaviors in the acute and chronic phases. SSRIs have been shown to significantly alleviate depression-like behaviors in animal models of traumatic brain injury (TBI) by increasing serotonin (5-HT) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the hippocampus. However, the therapeutic effects of SSRIs on depression caused by bTBI remain unclear. Objective: Therefore, this study was aimed at investigating the therapeutic effects of SSRIs on depression-like behaviors in bTBI models. Methods: We created a rat model to study mild TBI by subjecting rats to increased blast overpressures (BOP) and injecting fluoxetine and escitalopram SSRIs intraperitoneally for 28 days. Results: On day 14 post-BOP exposure, rats treated with SSRIs showed decreased depression-like behaviors. This finding was accompanied by higher 5-HT levels in the hippocampus and increased numbers of Nestin-positive cells in the dentate gyrus. Furthermore, rats treated with SSRIs exhibited increased pCREB and BDNF protein expression in the hippocampus on days 7, 14, and 28 after bTBI. Conclusions: Overall, our findings indicate that SSRI-induced recovery from depression-like behaviors after mild bTBI is associated with the upregulation of 5-HT levels, pCREB and BDNF expression, and neurogenesis in the hippocampus.</p>

                Liu et al. report that GPNMB expression in microglia is commonly induced by multiple types of pathological factors functionally participating in phagocytosis of pathological particles via interaction with ATP6V1A and anti-inflammation responses. GPNMB depletion does not influence the severity of acute seizures but exacerbates the development of chronic epileptogenesis.

">Block-Champagne: A novel Bayesian framework for Imaging E/MEG Source</a></h4>

              
                Estimating the extents of E/MEG source activities is vital for exploring brain dynamics at high spatiotemporal resolution. However, conventional ESI models exclusively overemphasize on the accurate estimation of the source locations and struggle to reconstruct the extents due to the ill-posed nature of the problem, which requires effective integration of biophysical constraints and proficiency in signal processing methods. In this study, a novel Bayesian framework Block-Champagne is introduced to provide accurate estimation of extended sources (i.e., both locations and extents). Specifically, a block-sparsity constraint is employed to model the local homogeneity of sources, which can be updated automatically to reconstruct source with arbitrary extents. Furthermore, prior constraints from other modalities, such as fMRI maps, can be incorporated to model interactions between remote sources to further enhance source reconstruction. The performance of Block-Champagne is quantitatively evaluated through simulation experiments, demonstrating its overall superiority under various complex scenarios (i.e., SNR, extent size, & number of sources) compared to benchmark algorithms (including LORETA, EBI-Convex, ts-Cham, L21-Sissy, & BESTIES). Moreover, validation results obtained from deep-brain stimulation EEG, epilepsy data, and face-processing multi-modal data further prove the practical feasibility of Block-Champagne. In conclusion, our study reveals the superiority of the proposed Block-Champagne in accurate reconstruction of extended source, positioning Block-Champagne as a highly promising tool for realistic applications where source locations and extents are of equivalent importance.

                The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) is a principal target for repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in the treatment of major depressive disorder, with therapeutic effects hypothesized to be mediated by the connectivity between the DLPFC and the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC). Interestingly, these depression-related hubs are also part of the heart-brain axis, thus potentially rendering the stratification of individual depression targets possible by tapping into short-term heart rate modulation after DLPFC stimulation. Recently, a set of stimulation protocols has been proposed to objectively quantify these downstream effects. While these neuro-cardiac-guided TMS protocols (NCG-TMS) are promising to improve clinical responses, rigorous, third-party assessments of these approaches including replicability, robustness, and the impact of stimulation side-effects are critically missing. Here, we employed a 10 Hz TMS protocol (NCG-TMS 2.0) across three sessions to evaluate the effects of stimulation intensity and DLPFC target specificity on heart-brain coupling (HBC) in a cohort of healthy participants. Our results demonstrate a significant nonlinear increase in HBC with higher stimulation intensity, with the F3 lateral and F3 posterior targets eliciting more robust effects than the sham condition. For the first time, we are able to demonstrate reliable target- and intensity-specific HBC modulation across multiple NCG-TMS 2.0 sessions. Although the repeatability within subjects was limited when including the initial session, subsequent sessions yielded consistent results for the F3 anterior and F3 lateral targets at higher intensities. Although pain and other side effects influenced HBC, they did not fully account for the observed modulation of HBC. These findings underscore the critical role of spatial specificity and stimulation intensity in modulating heart-brain interactions and offer a potential framework for optimizing individualized rTMS treatment protocols for depression.

">Lack of motor defects and ALS-like neuropathology in heterozygous Sptlc1 Exon 2 deletion mice</a></h4>

              
                Mutations in the human SPTLC1 gene have recently been linked to early onset amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), characterized by global atrophy, motor impairments, and symptoms such as tongue fasciculations. All known ALS-linked SPTLC1 mutations cluster within exon 2 and a specific variant, c.58G>T, results in exon 2 skipping. However, it is unclear how the exon 2 deletion affects SPTLC1 function in vivo and contributes to ALS pathogenesis. Leveraging the high genomic sequence similarity between mouse and human SPTLC1, we created a novel mouse model with a CRISPR/Cas9-mediated deletion of exon 2 in the endogenous murine Sptlc1 locus. While heterozygous mice did not develop motor defects or ALS-like neuropathology, homozygous mutants died prematurely. These findings indicate that Sptlc1 {triangleup}Exon2 heterozygous mice do not replicate the disease phenotype but provide valuable insights into SPTLC1 biology and serve as a useful resource for future mechanistic studies.

">Building Multivariate Molecular Imaging Brain Atlases Using the NeuroMark PET Independent Component Analysis Framework</a></h4>

              
                Molecular imaging analyses using positron emission tomography (PET) data often rely on macro-anatomical regions of interest (ROI), which may not align with chemo-architectural boundaries and obscure functional distinctions. While methods such as independent component analysis (ICA) have been useful to address this limitation, the fully data-driven nature can make it challenging to compare results across studies. Here, we introduce the NeuroMark PET approach, utilizing spatially constrained independent component analysis to define overlapping regions that may reflect the brain's molecular architecture. We first generate an ICA template for the PET radiotracer florbetapir (FBP), targeting amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}) accumulation in the brain, using blind ICA on large datasets to identify replicable independent components. Only components that targeted A{beta} were included in this study, defined as A{beta} networks (A{beta}Ns), by omitting components targeting myelin or other non-A{beta} targets. Next, we use the A{beta}Ns as priors for spatially constrained ICA, resulting in a fully automated ICA pipeline called NeuroMark PET. This NeuroMark pipeline, including its A{beta}Ns, was validated against a standard neuroanatomical PET atlas, using data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). The study included 296 cognitively normal participants with FBP PET scans and 173 with florbetaben (FBB) PET scans, an analogue radiotracer also targeting A{beta} accumulation. Our results show that NeuroMark PET captures biologically meaningful, participant-specific features, such as subject specific loading values, consistent across individuals, and also shows higher sensitivity and power for detecting age-related changes compared to traditional atlas-based ROIs. Using this framework, we also highlight some of the advantages of using ICA analysis for PET data. In this study, an A{beta}N consists of weighted voxels and forms a pattern throughout the entire brain. For example, components may have weighted values at every voxel and can overlap with one another, enabling the separation of artifacts which may coincide with the A{beta}Ns of interest. In addition, this approach allows for the differentiation, separating white matter components, which may overlap in complex ways with the A{beta}Ns, mainly residing in the neighboring gray matter. Results also showed that the most age associated A{beta}N (representing the cognitive control network, CC1) exhibited a stronger association with age compared with macro-anatomical regions of interest. This may suggest that each NeuroMark FBP A{beta}N represents a spatial network following chemo-architectural uptake with greater biological relevance compared with anatomical ROIs. In summary, the proposed NeuroMark PET approach offers a fully automated framework, providing accurate and reproducible brain A{beta}Ns. This approach enhances our ability to investigate the molecular underpinnings of brain function and pathology, offering an alternative to traditional ROI-based analyses.

">Reduced plasma hexosylceramides in frontotemporal dementia are a biomarker of white matter integrity</a></h4>

              
                INTRODUCTION: Blood biomarkers are needed to facilitate new therapeutic trials and improve management of behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD). Since altered white matter integrity is characteristic of bvFTD, this study aimed to determine if plasma levels of myelin-enriched glycolipids are altered in bvFTD and correlate with white matter integrity. METHODS: Nineteen glycolipids were quantified in bvFTD (n=31) and control (n=26) plasma samples. White matter integrity was assessed using MRI-derived fibre tract density and cross-section (FDC). RESULTS: Eleven lipids were significantly lower in bvFTD compared to control subjects, seven were inversely correlated with disease duration, and twelve were positively correlated with cognitive performance, with C22:0 hexosylceramide most strongly correlated. FDC was lower in frontotemporal white matter tracts of bvFTD compared to control subjects, and plasma C22:0 hexosylceramide was significantly correlated with FDC in these tracts. DISCUSSION: Circulating glycolipids may be a valuable biomarker of myelin integrity and disease progression in FTD.

">Corticospinal, reticulospinal, and motoneuronal contributions to fatigability during a sustained contraction of the elbow flexors</a></h4>

              
                Synaptic input to the motoneuron pool is altered during fatiguing muscle contractions. In humans, the corticospinal tract is often studied, with equivocal findings regarding its role in the reduction of force. To date, the involvement of the reticulospinal tract during states of fatigue has not been explored. Fourteen participants (28[6] years, nine males) visited the laboratory twice, first for a familiarisation, then an experimental trial. Participants completed a 5-min sustained elbow flexor contraction at an intensity eliciting 40% of the EMG recorded during a maximal isometric voluntary contraction (MVC). Before, during, and after the contraction, transcranial magnetic stimulation and electrical cervicomedullary stimulation were used to elicit motor evoked potentials (MEPs) and cervicomedullary evoked potentials during the silent period (SP-CMEPs) respectively, with CMEPs also being evoked in combination with a startling acoustic sound (CMEPcon). Electrical stimulation of the brachial plexus was used to evoke maximal compound action potentials of the elbow flexors (Mmax). The 5-min contraction induced a 53% loss of force (p<0.001), with no change in background EMG (~4% Mmax, p=0.293). Neither MEP amplitude (p=0.246) nor CMEPcon ratio (p=0.489) were altered during the contraction. Whereas CMEP and SP-CMEP amplitudes were reduced by ~20 and 50%, respectively (p<0.001) and remained depressed post-task. The results suggest that neither corticospinal nor reticulospinal tract excitability was altered during a 5-min constant-EMG task at 40% maximal EMG. Instead, the aetiology of the neural contribution to fatigability appeared to be primarily related to the loss of motoneuron excitability.

">Alterations in retinal tau phosphorylation in Alzheimer's disease patients identified by mass spectrometry</a></h4>

              
                Background: Most neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and multiple sclerosis (MS), are associated with abnormal post-translational phosphorylation of tau (p-tau) in the brain. Studies using immunostaining techniques have revealed an accumulation of p-tau also in the AD retina and suggested this p-tau accumulation may reflect tau pathology in the brain. However, immunostainings are dependent on antibody specificity and tissue processing. Hence, further validation using additional methods is needed to identify the p-tau species in the retina and verify their relationship to AD pathology. Methods: We used mass spectrometry to measure p-tau peptides in retinal and hippocampal samples from non demented controls (NC, n=8), AD ( n=12), and MS (n=4). Peptides were first extracted with Lysis buffer to capture extracellular components and cytoplasm, and then with Ripa buffer to isolate nuclear and organelle proteins. We then analysed the differences in p-tau levels between diagnoses and explored how retinal p-tau variants correlate with hippocampal p-tau and neuropathological changes. Results: The mass spectrometry analysis of the retina revealed peaks corresponding to tau peptides phosphorylated at T181, S199/S202, T231, S396 + T403/S404, and T403/S404. These p-tau peptides were also detected in the hippocampal samples, along with additional p-tau peptides such as T217 and S262. Total tau phosphorylation and phosphorylation at S199/S202 and T231 were significantly higher in the retina of AD cases compared to NC. These two peptides, along with peptides phosphorylated at S396+T403/S404 and T403/S404, were also higher in cases with high amyloid-beta (A{beta}) Braak stages compared to those with low A{beta} Braak stages. Further analysis showed that higher A{beta} Braak stages were associated with higher mass spectrometry peak intensities of peptides phosphorylated at S199/S202 and S396+T403/S404. Additionally, retinal p-tau peptides at S396+T403/S404 and T403/S404 2 correlated with neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) Braak stages, and p-tau peptides S396+T403/S404 in the retina were linked to corresponding phosphorylaion in the CA1 region. Conclusions: These findings underscore the connection between retinal and brain tau pathology and highlight the potential of retinal tau as a biomarker for AD diagnosis and monitoring while also deepening our understanding of tauopathies in both the retina and brain.

">The activation of fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 provides therapeutic benefit in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease</a></h4>

              
                Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease that is characterized by the accumulation of amyloid plaque and neurofibrillary tangles, ultimately impairing multiple cognitive domains. Both plaques and tangles cause neuronal damage and stimulate inflammatory responses in glial cells. The fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1)-mediated signaling pathways support the function of damaged neurons and modulate inflammatory response. The FGFR1 agonists, including Fibroblast growth factor 1 (FGF1) and FG loop peptide (FGL), have been implicated in multiple disease therapy. Whether FGFR1 agonists can improve pathology and cognitive function in AD remains unknown. Here, we showed that administration of FGF1 and FGL to the AD mouse model reversed spatial memory impairment, enhanced neurogenesis, suppressed reactive astrogliosis, and restricted dystrophic neurite. However, only FGF1 treatment reduced the deposition of senile plaque. In microglial culture studies, FGF1 improves the phagocytosis ability of microglia, which contributes to the clearance of plaques. Together, our findings suggested that FGFR1 agonists alleviate pathology and cognitive impairment via immunomodulatory and improve neuronal health in the AD mouse model.

">Tracking changes in corticospinal excitability during visuomotor paired associative stimulation to predict motor resonance rewriting</a></h4>

              
                Mirror properties of the action observation network (AON) can be modulated through Hebbian-like associative plasticity using paired associative stimulation (PAS). We recently introduced a visuomotor protocol (mirror-PAS, m-PAS), which pairs transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over the primary motor cortex (M1) with visual stimuli of ipsilateral (to TMS) movements, leading to atypical corticospinal excitability (CSE) facilitation (i.e., motor resonance) during PAS-conditioned action observation. While m-PAS aftereffects are robust, little is known about markers of associative plasticity during its administration and their predictive value for subsequent motor resonance rewriting. In the present study, we analyzed CSE dynamics in 81 healthy participants undergoing the m-PAS before and after passively observing left- or right-hand index finger movements. Here, typical and PAS-conditioned motor resonance was assessed with TMS over the right M1. We examined CSE changes during the m-PAS and used linear regression models to explore their relationship with motor resonance modulations. Results showed that the m-PAS transiently reshaped both typical and PAS-conditioned motor resonance. Importantly, we found a gradual increase of CSE during m-PAS, which predicted the loss of typical motor resonance but not the emergence of atypical responses after the protocol's administration. Our findings suggest that the motor resonance reshaping induced by the m-PAS is not fully predictable by CSE online modulations. Likely, this rewriting is the product of a large-scale reorganization of the AON rather than a phenomenon restricted to the PAS-stimulated motor cortex. This study underlines that monitoring CSE during non-invasive brain stimulation protocols could provide valuable insight into some, but not all, their plastic outcomes.

">Chronic sleep curtailment expediates brain aging by activating the complement and coagulation cascades in mice</a></h4>

              
                Chronic sleep insufficiency is prevalent in modern society and has been associated with age-related neurodegenerative diseases. Loss of sleep accelerates the progression of neurodegeneration in animal models of neurological diseases. Here, we study whether chronic sleep curtailment leads to brain aging in wild-type animals without a genetic predisposition. We used a wild-type mouse model to simulate modern-day conditions of restricted sleep and compared the brain (cortex) proteome of young sleep-restricted animals with different aged control groups. We report the alteration of 149 proteins related to sleep and 1269 related to age with 96 proteins common between them. Through pathway analysis of proteins common to sleep restriction and aging, we discovered that the complement and coagulation cascade pathways were enriched by alterations of complement component 3 (C3), alpha-2-macroglobulin (A2M), fibrinogen alfa and beta chain (FGA and FGB). This is the first study indicating the possible role of the complement and coagulation pathways in brain aging and by chronic sleep restriction (CSR) in mice.

">Long-Term Functional Rescue of Trauma-Induced Vision Loss by a Novel, Small Molecule TrkB Activator</a></h4>

              
                Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signaling through the tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB) receptor promotes neuronal growth and survival following an injury. However, its short half-life and pleiotropic effects limit the clinical use of BDNF as a therapy in neurodegenerative disorders. Identification of novel and selective TrkB activators may ameliorate the damage caused to retinal neurons during eye-related injuries, and may reduce adverse visual outcomes associated with visual trauma. We previously described a selective TrkB agonist, N-[2-(5-hydroxy-1H-indol-3-yl) ethyl]-2-oxopiperidine-3-carboxamide (HIOC), that reduces the decline in visual function in a mouse model of ocular trauma (1). Using the lead optimization approach, we subsequently synthesized a fluoropyridine analog of HIOC, 2-fluoro-N-(2-(5-hydroxy-1H-indol-3-yl) ethyl) nicotinamide (HIFN), which also successfully activates TrkB. HIFN is a more potent TrkB activator than the parent compound, HIOC. Further, treatment with HIFN demonstrated neuroprotection in an animal model of overpressure ocular blast injury, ameliorating blast-related visual functional decline. Mice treated with HIFN had better visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, and retinal function supported by enhanced survival of retinal ganglion cells compared to vehicle-treated animals. Moreover, HIFN exhibited better protective effects than HIOC. The therapeutic effects of HIFN were attributed to TrkB activation, as blocking the receptor with a selective receptor antagonist (ANA-12) abrogated the neuroprotection. Together, our results identify HIFN, a novel TrkB receptor activator, as a strategy for decreasing retinal degeneration and progressive vision loss associated with traumatic ocular injury. In addition, this compound may have broader applications treating other diseases with altered TrkB activity.

">'SpikeNburst' and 'Nicespike': Advanced Tools for Enhancing and Accelerating In Vitro High-Density Electrophysiology Analysis</a></h4>

              
                High-density multi-electrode arrays (HD-MEAs) have revolutionized electrophysiology by enabling the recording of neuronal activity with unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution. However, analysing these large-scale datasets poses significant challenges, including artefact removal, spike sorting, and accurate assessments of neuronal synchronization. Here, we present two Python-based tools, 'spikeNburst' and 'nicespike', designed to address these challenges and provide a scalable solution for the comprehensive analysis of HD-MEA recordings. The spikeNburst tool integrates advanced methodologies for spike train filtering, burst and network burst detection, and synchronization analysis, and we implemented a full analysis pipeline in the nicespike tool, which includes GPU-accelerated spike sorting using template matching with Kilosort to accurately identify neuronal units spanning multiple electrodes. Together, these tools enable more precise analyses by mitigating redundancy and overestimation inherent in single-channel approaches. Their graphical user and command-line interfaces ensure accessibility for diverse user needs. We validated the tools on neuronal culture recordings, demonstrating their ability to identify somatic and dendritic features of neuronal units, characterize bursting behaviour, and quantify synchronization at both unit and network levels. By addressing critical limitations of existing methods, spikeNburst and nicespike provide a robust, scalable, and user-friendly framework for HD-MEA data analysis, advancing our ability to study neural network dynamics and single-cell activity in detail.

">Mutations in ASH1L cause a neurodevelopmental disorder with sex differences in epilepsy and autism</a></h4>

              
                To understand brain phenotypes associated with ASH1L, we used a mouse model, performing analysis in different genetic backgrounds: C57BL/6 and CD-1. We found that in both lines, ASH1L mutations result in seizures. Mice from both lines have microcephaly, and also less complex dendritic morphology. We also found differential effects of ASH1L between C57BL/6 and CD-1 strains on a number of different measures identifying aspects of ASH1L function that may be influenced by genetic background. When we analyzed human subjects based on biological sex, for epilepsy, intellectual disability, and ASD, we found sex differences in epilepsy and autism, with epilepsy predominantly in female and ASD in male subjects. Functional evaluation by whole cell patch clamp electrophysiology in mice demonstrated hyperexcitability female compared with male hippocampal CA1 neurons. Thus, the role of ASH1L in specific circuits may be sex-dependent leading to sexual dimorphic effects from haploinsufficiency of this gene.

">Emergent modularity in large language models: Insights from aphasia simulations</a></h4>

              
                Recent large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in complex linguistic tasks and have been shown to share certain computational principles with human language processing. However, whether LLMs' internal components perform distinct functions, like semantic and syntactic processing in human language systems, remains unclear. Here, we systematically disrupted components of LLMs to simulate the behavioral profiles of aphasia--a disorder characterized by specific language deficits resulting from brain injury. Our findings showed that lesioning specific components of LLMs could replicate behaviors characteristic of different aphasia subtypes. Notably, while semantic deficits as those observed in Wernicke's and Conduction aphasia, were relatively straightforward to simulate, reproducing syntactic and lexical impairments, as seen in Broca's and Anomic aphasia, proved more challenging. Together, these results highlight both parallels and discrepancies between emergent modularity in LLMs and the human language system, providing new insights into how information is represented and processed in artificial and biological intelligence.

">Object representations drive emotion schemas across a large and diverse set of daily-life scenes</a></h4>

              
                The rapid emotional evaluation of objects and events is essential in daily life. While visual scenes reliably evoke emotions, it remains unclear whether emotion schemas evoked by daily-life scenes depend on object processing systems or are extracted independently. To explore this, we collected emotion ratings for 4913 daily-life scenes from 300 participants, and predicted these ratings from representations in deep neural networks and fMRI activity patterns in visual cortex. AlexNet, an object-based model, outperformed EmoNet, an emotion-based model, in predicting emotion ratings for everyday scenes, while EmoNet excelled for explicitly evocative stimuli. Emotion information was processed hierarchically within the object recognition system, consistent with the visual cortex's organization. Activity patterns in the lateral occipital complex (LOC), an object-selective region, reliably predicted emotion ratings and outperformed other visual regions. These findings suggest that emotion processing in everyday scenes follows visual object recognition, with additional mechanisms engaged when object content is uninformative.

">Biplanar nulling coil system for OPM-MEG using printed circuit boards</a></h4>

              
                Optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) are a promising sensor technology for non-invasive measurement of human electrophysiological signals, in particular the magnetoencephalogram (MEG). OPMs do not need cryogenic cooling and can be placed conformal to the subject's scalp, thus greatly reducing the sensor-to-source distance and improving signal sensitivity. OPMs, however, require near-zero background magnetic field to achieve linearity and minimize signal distortion. Prior work has proposed the use of biplanar field nulling coils to remove the uniform and gradient components of the background magnetic field. Biplanar coils have been expensive to construct, involving tedious error-prone manual winding of over 1000 m of copper wire. In this work, we designed and fabricated background field nulling coils (three uniform and three gradient components) on two-layer Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs). We used an open-source software (bfieldtools) to determine the current loops needed to produce the target magnetic field in a 50-cm-diameter spherical volume. We developed a software-based approach to connect the discrete current loops into a continuous conducting path traversing the two layers of the PCB. For ease of manufacture, the designed (1.5 x 1.5 m2) coils were cut along the symmetry axis and printed as pairs of 1.5 x 0.75 m2 PCBs (2 oz Cu), soldered together and mounted on a sliding aluminum frame. The efficiency of the coils (1.3 - 7.1 nT/mA) was similar or higher than previously reported in the literature. We mapped the field inside the target region after field nulling inside our single-layer shielded room and were able to reduce the largest component of the background field from 21 to 2 nT. Using our nulling coil system, we were able to operate OPMs in a lightly shielded room (background field varying from 6.5 to 108 nT in the floor-to-ceiling direction) to record somatosensory evoked fields (SEFs) comparable to those measured using SQUID-based MEG in a 3-layer shielded room. We disseminate the software and hardware as an open-source package opmcoils. This work will facilitate access to more affordable field nulling coils for OPM-MEG and help to realize the potential of OPM-MEG as an accessible sensor technology for use in human neuroscience.

">Predicting Neuroplasticity Effects of Continuous Theta Burst Stimulation with Biomarkers from the Motor Evoked Potential TMS Input-Output Curve</a></h4>

              
                The field of neuromodulation lacks predictors of individual differences in plasticity that influence responses to repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). Continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS), a form of rTMS known for its inhibitory effects, shows variable responses between individuals, potentially due to differences in neuroplasticity. Predicting individual cTBS effects could vastly enhance its clinical and experimental utility. This study explores whether motor evoked potential (MEP) input-output (IO) parameters measured prior to neuromodulation can predict motor cortex responses to cTBS. IO curves were sampled from healthy adults by recording MEPs over a range of single pulse TMS intensities to obtain parameters including MEPmax and S50 (midpoint intensity). Subjects later received cTBS over the same location of motor cortex and their MEPs before and after stimulation were compared. Both MEPmax and S50 predicted responses, significantly correlating (p<0.05, R2>0.25) with individuals' MEP changes at 10, 20, and 30 minutes after cTBS. Further, we introduced and validated an easily implementable biomarker that does not require the time-consuming sampling of full IO curve: MEP130RMT (median of 10 MEPs at 130% RMT). MEP130RMT was also a strong predictor of cTBS response (p<0.005, R2>0.3). Head-to-head comparison against a previously studied genetic biomarker of rTMS responses (BDNF polymorphism) showed that IO based predictors had a superior performance in explaining more response variability. Thus, IO curves derived prior to cTBS administration can reliably predict cTBS-induced changes in cortical excitability. This work points toward an accessible strategy for tailoring stimulation procedures in both diagnostic and therapeutic applications of rTMS, and potentially boosting response rate to other brain stimulation approaches.

">Machine Learning-Based Model for Behavioral Analysis in Rodents: Application to the Forced Swim Test</a></h4>

              
                The Forced Swim Test (FST) is a widely used preclinical model for assessing antidepressant efficacy, studying stress response, and evaluating depressive-like behaviours in rodents. Over the last 10 years, more than 5,500 scientific articles reporting the use of the FST have been published. Despite its widespread use, the FST behaviours are still manually scored, resulting in a labor-intensive and time-consuming process that is prone to human bias and variability. Despite eliminating some biases, existing automated systems are costly and typically only able to distinguish between immobility and active behaviours. Therefore, they are often unable to accurately differentiate the major subtypes of movement patterns, such as swimming and climbing. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach based on machine learning (ML) using a three-dimensional residual convolutional neural network (3D RCNN) that processes video pixels directly, capturing the spatiotemporal dynamics of rodent behaviour. Our ML model was validated against manual scoring in rats treated with fluoxetine and desipramine, two antidepressants known to induce distinct behavioural patterns. The ML model successfully differentiated among swimming, climbing, and immobility behaviours, demonstrating its potential as a standardized and unbiased tool for automatized behavioural analysis in the FST. Subsequently, we successfully validated our model by testing its ability to distinguish between drugs that predominantly evoke climbing (i.e., amitriptyline), those that preferentially facilitate swimming (i.e., paroxetine), and those that evoke both in a more balanced manner (i.e., venlafaxine). This approach represents a significant advancement in preclinical research, providing a more accurate and efficient method to analyze forced swimming data in rodents. We anticipate that due to its adaptability, in addition to the FST, the model could be applied to various behavioural tests in laboratory animals.

">Perinatal environmental enrichment affects murine neonates' brain structure before their active engagement with environment</a></h4>

              
                Early life experiences shape individuals. Environmental enrichment, an experimental paradigm used to study the effect of increased environmental complexity and novelty in animal models, has long been recognised for its broad effect on nervous system function and behaviour. In adult rodents, structural changes in the brain due to enriched environments are well documented, notably in the hippocampus. However, the effect of environmental enrichment on the developing brain during early life is not well understood. This study aims to investigate how environmental enrichment affects brain development during the critical perinatal period, and how such effects compare to those observed during adulthood. We use high-resolution MRI to measure the brain structure of mouse neonates at postnatal day 7, born either in an enriched or a standard environment. We show that rodents exhibit brain structure differences as early as postnatal day 7. However, the regional changes observed differ from those in adulthood: hippocampal changes are limited, but changes in the hindbrain, the dorsal striatum, and the medial habenula are strong. Given the lack of direct interaction between neonates and the environment at P7, we hypothesised that maternal care may mediate these effects. We show that maternal care differs between enriched and standard environments, that maternal care correlates with brain structure changes in the neonates, and that maternal care and enriched environment affect brain structure similarly. This suggests that early changes in brain structure due to environmental enrichment are at least partly mediated by maternal care. This study provides novel insight into the differential effect of enriched environment on early brain development in rodents.

">Odor-evoked respiratory responses throughout development in sighted and blind mice</a></h4>

              
                Congenital blindness affects olfactory function depending on developmental stage. However, when studying the ontogeny of olfactory abilities, not all behaviors are expressed at every age making the longitudinal comparisons difficult. Odor-evoked respiratory responses, which are unlearned and do not require complex motor coordination, may serve as sensitive measures of olfactory abilities throughout ontogeny. Using a non-invasive measure of respiration in an olfactory perceptual paradigm, we assessed odor-evoked respiratory responses in a model of congenital blindness at 3 ages, infant, juvenile and adult, in the same mice and in both males and females. We demonstrated the differential outcome of two respiratory parameters (i.e. frequency and amplitude) in a mouse model of congenital blindness. We showed that blind mice have similar olfactory abilities than sighted mice throughout ontogeny but display enhanced sniffing frequency and amplitude, starting at the juvenile age for the latter one, that may help them better explore their environment. We also demonstrated that respiratory frequency is a robust index of age and of olfactory detection, habituation and discrimination at all ages. On the other side, respiratory amplitude does not provide a proxy of olfactory performance at all ages, however, it does highlight differences between sexes and phenotypes associated with visual deprivation. To conclude, our data highlight that respiratory parameters can be used as a complementary approach to assess olfactory performance throughout development and provide an index of olfactory plasticity.

">Hybrid Neural Networks for Volitional Movement</a></h4>

              
                Massive interconnectivity in large-scale neural networks is the key feature underlying their powerful and complex functionality. We have developed hybrid neural network (HNN) models that allow us to find statistical structure in this connectivity. Describing this structure is critical for understanding biological and artificial neural networks. The HNNs are composed of artificial neurons, a subset of which are trained to reproduce the responses of individual neurons recorded experimentally. The experimentally observed firing rates came from populations of neurons recorded in the motor cortices of monkeys performing a reaching task. After training, these networks (recurrent and spiking) underwent the same state transitions as those observed in the empirical data, a result that helps resolve a long-standing question of prescribed vs ongoing control of volitional movement. Because all aspects of the models are exposed, we were able to analyze the dynamic statistics of the connections between neurons. Our results show that the dynamics of extrinsic input to the network changed this connectivity to cause the state transitions. Two processes at the synaptic level were recognized: one in which many different neurons contributed to a buildup of membrane potential and another in which more specific neurons triggered an action potential. HNNs facilitate modeling of realistic neuron-neuron connectivity and provide foundational descriptions of large-scale network functionality.

">Suprachiasmatic Neuromedin-S Neurons Regulate Arousal</a></h4>

              
                Mammalian circadian rhythms, which orchestrate the daily temporal structure of biological processes, including the sleep-wake cycle, are primarily regulated by the circadian clock in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). The SCN clock is also implicated in providing an arousal 'signal,' particularly during the wake-maintenance zone (WMZ) of our biological day, essential for sustaining normal levels of wakefulness in the presence of mounting sleep pressure. Here we identify a role for SCN Neuromedin-S (SCNNMS) neurons in regulating the level of arousal, especially during the WMZ. We used chemogenetic and optogenetic methods to activate SCNNMS neurons in vivo, which potently drove wakefulness. Fiber photometry confirmed the wake-active profile of SCNNM neurons. Genetically ablating SCNNMS neurons disrupted the sleep-wake cycle, reducing wakefulness during the dark period and abolished the circadian rhythm of body temperature. SCNNMS neurons target the dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus (DMH), and photostimulation of their terminals within the DMH rapidly produces arousal from sleep. Pre-synaptic inputs to SCNNMS neurons were also identified, including regions known to influence SCN clock regulation. Unexpectedly, we discovered strong input from the preoptic area (POA), which itself receives substantial inhibitory input from the DMH, forming a possible arousal-promoting circuit (SCN->DMH->POA->SCN). Finally, we analyzed the transcriptional profile of SCNNMS neurons via single-nuclei RNA-Seq, revealing three distinct subtypes. Our findings link molecularly-defined SCN neurons to sleep-wake patterns, body temperature rhythms, and arousal control.

">Emergence of clustered synapses during the development of a nervous system</a></h4>

              
                Synaptic organization is central for proper transmission of neural information. Studies in invertebrates and mammalian cortices show that synapses are clustered along neurite extensions, an organization that promotes key functional roles. Here we studied how these synaptic clusters emerge during the development of a nervous system. Leveraging the available C. elegans connectomes that span all larval developmental stages, we show that clustered synapses are formed at the early stages of the neural network development and that their occurrence further increases throughout development. These synaptic clusters significantly constitute small neural circuits that endow the network with important functional roles, such as feedback between mutually synapsing neurons and information transfer in mutually regulated neurons. Moreover, clustered synapses emerge early on during development of the head motor system, where they facilitate the crucial 3D head swings. Finally, the synaptic clusters within these key neural circuits are maintained throughout all developmental stages and are robustly found across different individuals, further accentuating their central functional roles in neural networks.

">Hyperreflexia after corticospinal tract lesion reflects 1A afferent circuit changes not increased KCC2 hyperexcitability</a></h4>

              
                Hyperreflexia, spasticity, and a loss of skilled motor function are consequences of spinal cord injury (SCI). Multiple potential mechanisms underpinning hyperreflexia have been reported, including: aberrant proprioceptive afferent (PA) sprouting, which could enhance reflex signaling; reduced GABAergic inhibitory presynaptic regulation of 1A terminals (GABApre); and increased excitability produced by reduced motor neuron membrane-bound potassium-chloride co-transporter 2 (KCC2), which has only been studied after SCI and bilateral CST lesion. Here we examine ho selective CST injury allows for specific investigation of the different mechanisms to determine their contributions to hyperreflexia. Hoffmann (H)-reflex rate-dependent depression (RDD) of the forelimb and hindlimb 5th digit abductor muscles was used to assess hyperreflexia. We compared RDD in naive and unilateral-PTX animals at 7-dpi and 42-dpi, supplemented with additional timed tests to examine the time-course of hyperreflexia development. Immunohistochemistry was used to identify PA synapses (VGlut1) and GABApre (GAD65), motor neurons (ChAT), and KCC2. Following unilateral PTX, which eliminates the CST from one hemisphere, we observed significant hyperreflexia in the contralesional forelimb only. Membrane-bound KCC2 was unchanged in contralesional cervical motor neurons. Whereas both cervical and lumbar motor neurons showed increased PA sprouting contralesionally, there was a concomitant increase in GABApre terminals for the lumbar not cervical cord. Our findings show that KCC2 is dissociated from hyperreflexia in the uniPTX model. Instead, forelimb hyperreflexia can be explained by cervical motor neuron PA sprouting and an uncompensated GABApre regulation.

">A vectorial code for semantics in human hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                As we listen to speech, our brains actively compute the meaning of individual words. Inspired by the success of large language models (LLMs), we hypothesized that the brain employs vectorial coding principles, such that meaning is reflected in distributed activity of single neurons. We recorded responses of hundreds of neurons in the human hippocampus, which has a well-established role in semantic coding, while participants listened to narrative speech. We find encoding of contextual word meaning in the simultaneous activity of neurons whose individual selectivities span multiple unrelated semantic categories. Like embedding vectors in semantic models, distance between neural population responses correlates with semantic distance; however, this effect was only observed in contextual embedding models (like BERT) and was reversed in non-contextual embedding models (like Word2Vec), suggesting that the semantic distance effect depends critically on contextualization. Moreover, for the subset of highly semantically similar words, even contextual embedders showed an inverse correlation between semantic and neural distances; we attribute this pattern to the noise-mitigating benefits of contrastive coding. Finally, in further support for the critical role of context, we find that range of neural responses covaries with lexical polysemy. Ultimately, these results support the hypothesis that semantic coding in the hippocampus follows vectorial principles.

	<p>Background/Objectives: Suicides among U.S. military veterans are alarmingly high, driven by factors such as mental health issues, combat exposure, and history of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI)/concussion. This study aims to examine the relationship between concussion history, combat experience, and their effects on mental health issues and suicide ideation among military veterans. Additionally, this study investigates the impact of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) on these variables. Methods: A total of 78 veterans (62 males, 16 females) participated in this study. Participants completed a demographic survey and the Global Well-being Index (GWI) to assess concussion history and residual symptoms. A licensed social worker interviewed the veterans using the 9-Item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) for depression, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder survey (7 Items) (GAD-7) for anxiety, and the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) for suicide ideation. A 2 &amp;amp;times; 2 cross-tabulation analysis examined the relationships between concussion history, combat experience, and outcomes of anxiety, depression, and suicide ideation. PTSD was also assessed as both a predictor and an outcome. Statistical analyses yielded odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI), Chi-square, and Cramer&amp;amp;rsquo;s V (V) correlations along with associated p-values. Results: The combination of concussion history and combat experience strongly predicted either anxiety, depression, or suicide ideation (OR = 7.97, 95% CI: 1.70, 37.44; V = 0.334, (p = 0.003)), more than either factor alone. Combat experience was the strongest predictor of PTSD (OR = 11.12, 95% CI: 3.30, 37.47; V = 0.485, p &amp;amp;le; 0.001), both individually and when combined with concussion history. PTSD strongly influenced mental health issues and suicide ideation (OR = 8.16, 95% CI: 1.74, 38.25; V = 0.339, p = 0.003). Stratification by PTSD status (positive or negative) affected the relationships between independent and dependent variables. Small cell counts resulted in a wide 95% CI for some ORs, though some statistically significant Fisher&amp;amp;rsquo;s Exact Test results were observed. Credibility analysis using the critical prior interval (CPI) metric confirmed the intrinsic credibility of the results. Conclusions: This study provides insights into the relationships between concussion history, combat experience, and their impacts on mental health issues and suicide ideation among military veterans.</p>

	<p>Background: Mental fatigue can impair sport, exercise and cognitive performance. Warmup activities can improve performance when the individual is rested. However, their effectiveness when individual is fatigued has yet to be established. The research objectives were to evaluate the effects of physical and combined physical plus cognitive warmup activities on subsequent sport, exercise, and cognitive performance when rested and fatigued by sleep restriction in athletes (Study 1) and older adults (Study 2). Methods: In Study 1, 31 padel players completed a padel performance test and Stroop task after physical and combined warmups when rested and fatigued by sleep deprivation. In Study 2, 32 older adults completed sit&amp;amp;ndash;stand, arm curl, walking, Stroop, and psychomotor vigilance tests after no warmup, physical warmup, and combined warmup when rested and fatigued by sleep deprivation. In both studies, combined warmups intermixed short-, medium-, or long-duration cognitive tasks between physical warmup activities. Mental fatigue was measured using visual analog scale ratings. Results: In both studies, sleep deprivation increased mental fatigue and impaired performance. In Study 1, relative to a physical warmup, padel and Stroop performance were improved by combined warmups (with short-to-medium cognitive tasks) when rested and fatigued. In Study 2, relative to no warmup, sit&amp;amp;ndash;stand, arm curl, walking, Stroop, and reaction time performance were improved by physical and combined warmups (with short-to-medium cognitive tasks) when rested and fatigued. Conclusions: The negative effects of sleep deprivation on sport, exercise, and cognitive performance were best mitigated by combined warmups with short-to-medium cognitive tasks. Combined warmups are effective countermeasures against the deleterious effects of mental fatigue on performance.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Interest in diversity is growing worldwide. Today, an understanding and social acceptance of diverse people is becoming increasingly important. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to clarify the relationship between an individual&amp;amp;rsquo;s gray matter volume (GMV), which is thought to reflect brain health, and their understanding of diversity (gender, sexuality (LGBTQ), and origin). Methods: GMV was determined as the value of the Gray Matter Brain Healthcare Quotient (GM-BHQ) based on MRI image analysis. Meanwhile, participants&amp;amp;rsquo; understanding and acceptance of diversity was calculated based on their answers to the psychological questions included in the World Values Survey Wave 7 (WVS7). Results: Our analysis indicated that, in the group of participants with the highest understanding of diversity (PHUD. n = 11), not only the GMV at the whole brain level (t = 2.587, p = 0.027, Cohen&amp;amp;rsquo;s d = 0.780) but also the GMV of the central executive network (CEN: t = 2.700, p= 0.022, Cohen&amp;amp;rsquo;s d = 0.814) and saliency network (SN: t = 3.100, p = 0.011, Cohen&amp;amp;rsquo;s d = 0.935) were shown to be significantly higher than the theoretical value estimated from sex, age, and BMI at the 5% level. In addition, the GMV of the default mode network (DMN: t = 2.063, p = 0.066, Cohen&amp;amp;rsquo;s d = 0.622) was also higher than the theoretical value at the 10% level. Meanwhile, in the group of others (n = 10), there was no significant difference from the theoretical value. These differences between PHUD and others were also observed when comparing the two with and without controlling for educational and occupational covariates at the 5% or 10% levels. Conclusions: These results suggest that understanding diversity requires a healthy brain, centered on three networks that govern rational judgment, emotion regulation, other-awareness, self-awareness, and the valuing of actions. This is the first study to show that brain structure is related to an understanding and acceptance of the diversity of people.</p>

	<p>Introduction: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a systemic inflammatory and autoimmune disease characterized by joint swelling, pain, damage to the cartilage, and disability. In the present study, we aimed to evaluate the anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, and immune-modulatory properties of Quantum Health Accelerator&amp;amp;reg; as water enriched with vital bio-quantum information/energy (EW) following complete Freund&amp;amp;rsquo;s adjuvant (CFA)-induced RA in rats. Methods: Forty adult male Wistar rats (180&amp;amp;ndash;220 g) were divided into five groups. Arthritis was induced on day one using a single subcutaneous injection of CFA into the left hind footpad of the rat. Rats were assigned to receive methotrexate (MTX, 2 mg/kg/week, intraperitoneally), EW (orally, instead of normal water ad libitum), or their combination for 29 days. The anti-RA activities were determined by paw edema, joint diameter, arthritis score, and several nociceptive behavioral tests (thermal hyperalgesia, cold allodynia, and tactile allodynia). The levels of inflammatory (TNF-&amp;amp;alpha;, CRP, RF, and anti-CCP), anti-inflammatory (IL-10), and oxidative stress (NO, MDA, and GSH) markers were measured in serum. In addition, the levels of IFN-&amp;amp;gamma;, IL-4, IL-17, and TGF-&amp;amp;beta; were assessed in the spleen-isolated lymphocytes. Results: We found that treatment with MTX, EW, and their combination remarkably ameliorated thermal hyperalgesia, cold allodynia, and tactile allodynia results following CFA-induced RA in rats. In addition, EW also notably attenuated arthritis score, joint diameter, inflammatory cytokines, and oxidative markers while propagating anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative mediators. Conclusions: We reveal that EW possesses anti-arthritic effects, possibly through anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory properties. Collectively, EW may be a promising therapeutic agent for treating RA.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Accurate personalized survival prediction in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is essential for effective patient care planning. This study investigates whether grey and white matter changes measured by magnetic resonance imaging can improve individual survival predictions.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We analyzed data from 178 patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and 166 healthy controls in the Canadian Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Neuroimaging Consortium study. A voxel-wise linear mixed-effects model assessed disease-related and survival-related atrophy detected through deformation-based morphometry, controlling for age, sex, and scanner variations. Additional linear mixed-effects models explored associations between regional imaging and clinical measurements, and their associations with time to the composite outcome of death, tracheostomy, or permanent assisted ventilation. We evaluated whether incorporating imaging features alongside clinical data could improve the performance of an individual survival distribution model.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Deformation-based morphometry uncovered distinct voxel-wise atrophy patterns linked to disease progression and survival, with many of these regional atrophies significantly associated with clinical manifestations of the disease. By integrating regional imaging features with clinical data, we observed a substantial enhancement in the performance of survival models across key metrics. Our analysis identified specific brain regions, such as the corpus callosum, rostral middle frontal gyrus, and thalamus, where atrophy predicted an increased risk of mortality.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This study suggests that brain atrophy patterns measured by deformation-based morphometry provide valuable insights beyond clinical assessments for prognosis. It offers a more comprehensive approach to prognosis and highlights brain regions involved in disease progression and survival, potentially leading to a better understanding of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

">Neural circuit mechanisms to transform cerebellar population dynamics for motor control in monkeys</a></h4>

              
                We exploit identification of neuron types during extracellular recording to demonstrate how the cerebellar cortex's well-established architecture transforms inputs into outputs. During smooth pursuit eye movements, the floccular complex performs distinct input-output transformations of temporal dynamics and directional response properties. The responses of different interneuron types localize the circuit mechanisms of each transformation. Mossy fibers and unipolar brush cells emphasize eye position dynamics uniformly across the cardinal axes; Purkinje cells and molecular layer interneurons code eye velocity along directionally biased axes; Golgi cells show unmodulated firing. Differential directional response properties of different neuron types localize the directional input-output transformation to the last-order inputs to Purkinje cells. Differential temporal dynamics pinpoint the site of the temporal input-output transformation to granule cells. Specific granule cell population dynamics allow the temporal transformations required in the area we study and generalize to many temporal transformations, providing a complete framework to understand cerebellar circuit computation.

">Opposing control of the respiratory brainstem on multiple timescales achieved by transmitter co-release from the locus coeruleus</a></h4>

              
                The locus coeruleus (LC) provides widespread noradrenergic (NAergic) modulation throughout the brain to influence a wide range of functions, including breathing. Although both anatomical and physiological evidence supports the involvement of the LC in both the upstream integration and the downstream modulation of breathing, the circuitry behind the latter is unknown. Here, we show that NAergic LC neurons send projections to the K[o]lliker-Fuse nucleus (KF), a critical site in the control of breathing. Long duration activation of NAergic LC neuron terminals in pontine slices induces persistent inhibitory and excitatory NA currents or increases firing rate in postsynaptic KF neurons. Short stimulation on the other hand leads to the VGluT2-dependent release of glutamate that may be co-released with NA in a monosynaptic circuit. Together these results demonstrate that LC neurons can exert flexible, opposing effects on different timescales via glutamatergic and NAergic signaling onto a key respiratory brainstem nucleus.

">Subthreshold electric fields bidirectionally modulate neurotransmitter release through axon polarization</a></h4>

              
                Subthreshold electric fields modulate brain activity and demonstrate potential in several therapeutic applications. Electric fields are known to generate heterogenous membrane polarization within neurons due to their complex morphologies. While the effects of somatic and dendritic polarization in postsynaptic neurons have been characterized, the functional consequences of axonal polarization on neurotransmitter release from the presynapse are unknown. Here, we combined noninvasive optogenetic indicators of voltage, calcium and neurotransmitter release to study the subcellular response within single neurons to subthreshold electric fields. We first captured the detailed spatiotemporal polarization profile produced by uniform electric fields within individual neurons. Small polarization of presynaptic boutons produces rapid and powerful bidirectional modulation of neurotransmitter release, depending on the direction of polarization. We determined that subthreshold electric fields drive this effect by rapidly altering the number of synaptic vesicles participating in neurotransmission, producing effects which resemble short-term plasticity akin to presynaptic homeostatic plasticity. These results provide key insights into the mechanisms of subthreshold electric fields at the cellular level.

">Indigenous gut microbes modulate neural cell state and neurodegenerative disease susceptibility</a></h4>

              
                The native microbiome influences a plethora of host processes, including neurological function. However, its impacts on diverse brain cell types remains poorly understood. Here, we performed single nucleus RNA sequencing on hippocampi from wildtype, germ-free mice and reveal the microbiome-dependent transcriptional landscape across all major neural cell types. We found conserved impacts on key adaptive immune and neurodegenerative transcriptional pathways, underscoring the microbiome's contributions to disease-relevant processes. Mono-colonization with select indigenous microbes identified species-specific effects on the transcriptional state of brain myeloid cells. Colonization by Escherichia coli induced a distinct adaptive immune and neurogenerative disease-associated cell state, suggesting increased disease susceptibility. Indeed, E. coli exposure in the 5xFAD mouse model resulted in exacerbated cognitive decline and amyloid pathology, demonstrating its sufficiency to worsen Alzheimer's disease-relevant outcomes. Together, these results emphasize the broad, species-specific, microbiome-dependent consequences on neurological transcriptional state and highlight the capacity of specific microbes to modulate disease susceptibility.

	<p>Background and objectives: This study aimed to investigate whether perceptual sensitivity to tactile stimulus is affected by awareness of who controls the stimulus intensity. Methods: Thirteen healthy participants took part in this study. A participant held a dial and an experimenter held the other dial. One dial was to control the intensity of the tactile stimulus while the other (dummy dial) was inactive. The intensity of the tactile stimulus to the participant&amp;amp;rsquo;s index finger providing each 1 s was increased by the participant or by someone else with or without the participants viewing a dial controlling the stimulus intensity. Results and conclusions: The stimulus intensity at the perceptual threshold, when controlled by the participant, was significantly lower compared to when controlled by someone else, regardless of visual availability. This indicates that awareness of the self-control of the tactile stimulus intensity enhances tactile sensitivity. The electrodermal level immediately preceding the stimulus at the perceptual threshold was significantly lower when the participant controlled the stimulus intensity compared to when it was controlled by someone else, with eyes closed. The electrodermal levels immediately before the perceptual threshold stimulus, when triggered by another person, were significantly higher with the eyes closed. These electrodermal findings suggest that cognitive stress is greater when the timing of the initial tactile perception is difficult to predict.</p>

	<p>Recent studies applying machine learning (ML) to saccade and vergence eye movements have demonstrated the ability to distinguish individuals with dyslexia, learning disorders, or attention disorders from healthy individuals or those with other pathologies. Stroke patients are known to exhibit visual deficits and eye movement disorders. This study focused on saccade and vergence measurements using REMOBI technology V3 and the Pupil Core eye tracker. Eye movement data were automatically analyzed with the AIDEAL V3 (Artificial Intelligence Eye Movement Analysis) cloud software developed by Orasis-Ear. This software computes multiple parameters for each type of eye movement, including the latency, accuracy, velocity, duration, and disconjugacy. Three ML models (logistic regression, support vector machine, random forest) were applied to the saccade and vergence eye movement features provided by AIDEAL to identify stroke patients from other groups: a population of children with learning disorders and a population with a broader spectrum of dysfunctions or pathologies (including children and adults). The different classifiers achieved macro F1 scores of up to 75.9% in identifying stroke patients based on the saccade and vergence parameters. An additional ML analysis using age-matched groups of stroke patients and adults or seniors reduced the influence of large age differences. This analysis resulted in even higher F1 scores across all three ML models, as the comparison group predominantly included healthy individuals, including some with presbycusis. In conclusion, ML applied to saccade and vergence eye movement parameters, as measured by the REMOBI and AIDEAL technology, is a sensitive method for the detection of stroke-related sequelae. This approach could be further developed as a clinical tool to evaluate recovery, compensation, and the evolution of neurological deficits in stroke patients.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the association between risk-taking behaviors, vestibular symptoms/impairment and perception&amp;amp;ndash;action coupling behavior in recently concussed adolescents. Methods: This study utilized a cross-sectional design to evaluate the early effects of concussion on 12&amp;amp;ndash;18-year-old adolescents (n = 47) recruited from a concussion specialty clinic at their presenting clinical appointment. The Perception&amp;amp;ndash;Action Coupling Task (PACT) was used to assess action boundary perception by evaluating the participant&amp;amp;rsquo;s ability to quickly and accurately determine whether a virtual &amp;amp;ldquo;ball&amp;amp;rdquo; fits in a virtual &amp;amp;ldquo;hole&amp;amp;rdquo;. Accuracy, response time and inverse efficiency were evaluated at the 0.8 and 1.2 ratios of ball&amp;amp;ndash;hole pairings, where 0.8 indicates the ball was slightly smaller than the hole and 1.2 indicates the ball was slightly larger than the hole. The Balloon Analog Risk Task (BART) is a computerized test which measures risk-taking behavior by &amp;amp;ldquo;pumping&amp;amp;rdquo; up a balloon. Each pump provides a small amount of virtual money into their bank; the goal is to make as much money as possible without popping the virtual balloon. The Vestibular Ocular Motor Screening (VOMS) tool is a brief screening tool designed to identify ocular or vestibular dysfunction following sport-related concussion, where horizontal/vertical vestibular ocular reflex (VOR) and visual motion sensitivity (VMS) are the primary vestibular outcomes. Pearson correlation matrices were developed to evaluate the association between BART, VOMS and PACT outcomes within the study cohort of concussed adolescents. Results: PACT inverse efficiency at the 1.2 ball&amp;amp;ndash;hole ratio was significantly correlated with all three VOMS outcomes (r = 0.33&amp;amp;ndash;0.37). The standard deviation of pump reaction time during BART was significantly correlated with accuracy (r = &amp;amp;minus;0.47) and inverse efficiency (r = 0.42) at the 1.2 ratio. The standard deviation of the total number of pumps during BART was significantly correlated with PACT response time at the 1.2 ratio (r = 0.34). Horizontal VOR correlated with balloons collected (r = &amp;amp;minus;0.30) and balloons popped (r = &amp;amp;minus;0.30). Conclusions: The results of this study suggest that risk-taking behaviors and vestibular symptoms/impairment are associated with worse action boundary perception in adolescents following concussion. This relationship is more pronounced in male adolescents than females.</p>

	<p>Background: Embodied cognition is an emerging concept in cognitive science that emphasizes the integral role of perception, action, and bodily experience in shaping human thought and understanding. Recently, a new instrument has been developed called the Automated Test of Embodied Cognition (ATEC), which provides a comprehensive measure of eight domains of embodied cognition. Method: An embodied cognition in an alcohol use disorder (AUD) sample (N = 49) was assessed using ATEC, which employs cognitively demanding physical tasks, like an exercise video, to measure executive functions (EFs), memory, and other cognitive processes &amp;amp;ldquo;in action&amp;amp;rdquo;. Results: Embodied delayed recall was the most frequent impairment (84%), and EF impairments were also common. Among the EF domains, self-regulation was the most frequently impaired at 43%. Using the ATEC total score, 43% of the sample were rated as having a mild or greater level of overall impairment. Strong support for concurrent validity was found for ATEC EF and memory domains when correlated with neurocognitive assessments conceptually related to them. Significant categorical agreement (impaired/not impaired) was also found between neurocognitive testing and ATEC total score. Using the ATEC total score, younger age, higher education, and better premorbid IQ were found to be potential protective factors against cognitive decline. Conclusions: Findings support ATEC&amp;amp;rsquo;s potential for future studies related to AUD and other disorders that may lead to cognitive decline. Embodied cognition may provide new insights into how AUD affects cognition and functioning and be useful to determine what interventions may improve recovery.</p>

Development and association with symptoms of depression and anxiety. [version 1; peer review: awaiting </a></h4>

              
                Background There is a need to go beyond mere measures of time used on social media. Existing tools inadequately capture the multidimensional nature of social media use, leaving a gap for concise yet comprehensive assessment tools. Aims This study aimed to develop a short questionnaire addressing three critical dimensions of social media use: self-presentation, negative experiences, and problematic use. The association between these dimensions and symptoms of anxiety and depression was also investigated. Methods This study uses two independent datasets of adolescents aged 16+ years in Norway. Using Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) analyses, a pool of 31 social media items was analyzed to investigate factor structure and associations with symptoms of anxiety and depression. For model development, the “LifeOnSoMe”-study was employed (>3,500 participants), and data from a pilot study (~500 participants) was used for external validation. Results Based on ACO-analyses, a 20-item six-factor model was identified, encompassing social comparison and self-presentation (five items), and three items for each of the following domains: negative experiences (Negative acts and Unwanted attention from others) and problematic use (Subjective overuse, Social obligations, and Source of concern). Confirmatory factor analyses demonstrated very good to excellent fit in both datasets, and consistent associations between the six different domains and symptoms of anxiety and depression. Discussion The suggested 20-item questionnaire provides a robust and succinct tool for evaluating social media’s impact on mental health, offering substantial explanatory power for variance in anxiety and depression symptoms. This can serve as meaningful tool for assessing the potential impact of social media use for mental health and related outcomes.

Black cumin (Nigella sativa L.), an esteemed nutraceutical herb, is well-known for its multiple health advantages among health-conscious individuals, researchers, and pharmaceutical businesses. Black cumin and its principal bioactive ingredient, thymoquinone (TQ), have been found to lower oxidative stress and inflammation, while also enhancing immunological function, cellular viability, and energy metabolism. They protect against metabolic, cardiovascular, digestive, hepatic, renal, pulmonary, reproductive, and neurological diseases, as well as cancer. Black cumin works as a countermeasure to minimize the toxicity and side effects of pharmaceuticals. Furthermore, the possible effects of black cumin on prostate health and disorders like benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer are not well understood. This narrative review seeks to reveal knowledge gaps. This study intends to guide future research into the possible uses of black cumin and TQ in prostate health and illness.

Background <p>Norovirus is a leading cause of acute gastroenteritis, adding to strain on healthcare systems. Diagnostic test reporting of norovirus is often delayed, resulting in incomplete data for real-time surveillance.</p> Methods <p>To nowcast the real-time case burden of norovirus a generalised additive model (GAM), semi-mechanistic Bayesian joint process and delay model “epinowcast”, and Bayesian structural time series (BSTS) model including syndromic surveillance data were developed. These models were evaluated over weekly nowcasts using a probabilistic scoring framework.</p> Results <p>Using the weighted interval score (WIS) we show a heuristic approach is outperformed by models harnessing time delay corrections, with daily mean WIS = 7.73, 3.03, 2.29 for the baseline, “epinowcast”, and GAM, respectively. Forecasting approaches were reliable in the event of temporally changing reporting values, with WIS = 4.57 for the BSTS model. However, the syndromic surveillance (111 online pathways) did not improve the BSTS model, WIS = 10.28, potentially indicating poor correspondence between surveillance indicators.</p> Interpretation <p>Analysis of surveillance data enhanced by nowcasting delayed reporting improves understanding over simple model assumptions, important for real-time decision making. The modelling approach needs to be informed by the patterns of the reporting delay and can have large impacts on operational performance and insights produced.</p>

Motivated by the spatiotemporal waves of MAPK/ERK activity, crucial for long-range communication in regenerating tissues, we investigated stochastic homoclinic fronts propagating through channels formed by directly interacting cells. We evaluated the efficiency of long-range communication in these channels by examining the rate of information transmission. Our study identified the stochastic phenomena that reduce this rate: front propagation failure, new front spawning, and variability in the front velocity. We found that a trade-off between the frequencies of propagation failures and new front spawning determines the optimal channel width (which geometrically determines the front length). The optimal frequency of initiating new waves is determined by a trade-off between the input information rate (higher with more frequent initiation) and the fidelity of information transmission (lower with more frequent initiation). Our analysis provides insight into the relative timescales of intra- and intercellular processes necessary for successful wave propagation.

                <p>by Gayathri Samarasekera, Nancy E. Go, Courtney Choutka, Jing Xu, Yuka Takemon, Jennifer Chan, Michelle Chan, Shivani Perera, Samuel Aparicio, Gregg B. Morin, Marco A. Marra, Suganthi Chittaranjan, Sharon M. Gorski</p>

Cell stress adaptation plays a key role in normal development and in various diseases including cancer. Caspases are activated in response to cell stress, and growing evidence supports their function in non-apoptotic cellular processes. A role for effector caspases in promoting stress-induced cytoprotective autophagy was demonstrated in <i>Drosophila</i>, but has not been explored in the context of human cells. We found a functionally conserved role for effector caspase 3 (CASP3) and caspase 7 (CASP7) in promoting starvation or proteasome inhibition-induced cytoprotective autophagy in human breast cancer cells. The loss of CASP3 and CASP7 resulted in an increase in PARP1 cleavage, reduction in LC3B and ATG7 transcript levels, and a reduction in H2AX phosphorylation, consistent with a block in autophagy and DNA damage-induced stress response pathways. Surprisingly, in non-lethal cell stress conditions, CASP7 underwent non-canonical processing at two calpain cleavage sites flanking a PARP1 exosite, resulting in stable CASP7-p29/p30 fragments. Expression of CASP7-p29/p30 fragment(s) could rescue H2AX phosphorylation in the CASP3 and CASP7 double knockout background. Strikingly, yet consistent with these phenotypes, the loss of CASP3 and CASP7 exhibited synthetic lethality with BRCA1 loss. These findings support a role for human caspases in stress adaptation through PARP1 modulation and reveal new therapeutic avenues for investigation.

                <p>by Oluwamuyiwa T. Amusan, Shuqi Wang, Chaoran Yin, Heather S. Koehler, Yixun Li, Tencho Tenev, Rebecca Wilson, Benjamin Bellenie, Ting Zhang, Jian Wang, Chang Liu, Kim Seong, Seyedeh L. Poorbaghi, Joseph Yates, Yuchen Shen, Jason W. Upton, Pascal Meier, Siddharth Balachandran, Hongyan Guo</p>

Necroptosis initiated by the host sensor Z-NA binding protein 1 (ZBP1) is essential for host defense against a growing number of viruses, including herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1). Studies with HSV-1 and other necroptogenic stimuli in murine settings have suggested that ZBP1 triggers necroptosis by directly complexing with the kinase RIPK3. Whether this is also the case in human cells, or whether additional co-factors are needed for ZBP1-mediated necroptosis, is unclear. Here, we show that ZBP1-induced necroptosis in human cells requires RIPK1. We have found that RIPK1 is essential for forming a stable and functional ZBP1-RIPK3 complex in human cells, but is dispensable for the formation of the equivalent murine complex. The receptor-interacting protein (RIP) homology interaction motif (RHIM) in RIPK3 is responsible for this difference between the 2 species, because replacing the RHIM in human RIPK3 with the RHIM from murine RIPK3 is sufficient to overcome the requirement for RIPK1 in human cells. These observations describe a critical mechanistic difference between mice and humans in how ZBP1 engages in necroptosis, with important implications for treating human diseases.

                Background The study examines the impact of mobile phones on the socioeconomic development of rural women in Peru, using data from the National Household Survey from 2016 to 2022. Previous studies have highlighted the role of information and communication technologies (ICT) in empowering rural women and reducing the digital gender gap. Method A quantitative approach and a correlational design were applied. The Mincer equation adjusted with the Heckman method was used to estimate the effect of mobile phone use on the income of rural women, considering socioeconomic and demographic variables. The sample included between 1,436 and 1,568 rural Peruvian women per year. Results The results indicate a positive correlation between owning a personal mobile phone and the income of rural women in the period 2016-2019. In 2018, owning a mobile phone was associated with a 39.3% increase in income levels. In 2022, this effect was 49.9%. Conclusions It is concluded that the income of rural women in Peru is positively linked to the possession of a mobile phone, but also depends on factors such as years of education, work experience, marital status, household headship, and labor market participation. The findings support the implementation of public policies to reduce the digital gender gap and promote sustainable development.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Investigate the immune system's role in cluster headache by analyzing cytokines in people with cluster headache and headache-free controls, and explore if certain cytokines could predict a specific phenotype.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We measured 45 cytokines in adult participants from the Danish Cluster Headache Biobank in a prospective case–control setup. People with cluster headache were diagnosed according to the International Classification of Headache Disorders third-edition. Controls were matched for age and sex.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 412 were analyzed deriving from 99 with chronic cluster headache, 108 with episodic cluster headache (ECH) in bout, 105 with ECH in remission, and 100 successfully matched controls. Compared with controls, 13 cytokines were altered for ECH in bout (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05), 3 in remission (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05), and 10 for chronic cluster headache (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). Oncostatin m was significantly elevated in all 3 disease states compared with controls (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). Overall, the investigated cytokines showed distinct patterns of alterations between chronic cluster headache and episodic cluster headache in bout and, interestingly, IL-1β was significantly associated with having chronic cluster headache rather than episodic in bout in a logistic regression model adjusting for potential confounders (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Findings show that the immune system is altered in all 3 states of cluster headache compared with controls. Oncostatin m was elevated, constituting a promising target for future studies. The distinct alterations between episodic and chronic cluster headache are striking and urges further research of the immune system in cluster headache to better understand its potential role in prediction of disease activity and treatment response.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Gain-of-function (GoF) variants in <i>KCNT1</i> encoding for potassium channels are associated with different epilepsy phenotypes, including epilepsy of infancy with migrating focal seizures (EIMFS), other early infantile developmental and epileptic encephalopathies, and focal epilepsy. Fluoxetine blocks currents from both wild-type (WT) and mutant KCNT1 channels with GoF in vitro features. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that treatment with fluoxetine might improve clinical outcome in patients with EIMFS carrying GoF variants in KCNT1 channels showing in vitro sensitivity to fluoxetine blockade.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We enrolled three pediatric patients carring de novo KCNT1 genetic variants linked to EIMFS. Functional and pharmacological studies to assess fluoxetine's ability to counteract in vitro variant-induced functional effects were performed with patch-clamp electrophysiology on heterologous channel expression in mammalian Chinese hamster ovary cells. Neuropsychological assessment, electroencephalogram and seizure diary were evaluated at baseline and every 3 months during the study. Electrocardiography and blood levels of medications were monitored for safety.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>All 3 <i>KCNT1</i> variants displayed GoF effects in vitro. Exposure to fluoxetine (10μM) blocked both WT and mutant KCNT1 channels, therefore, counteracting variant-induced functional effects. Treatment with fluoxetine caused a variable reduction of seizure frequency (25–75%). Improvement in visual attention, participation, and muscle tone was also reported. No adverse events were reported except for transient dyskinesia in 1 patient, which was probably related to an increase in fluoxetine plasma level.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Fluoxetine may be a potential targeted medication in EIMFS caused by <i>KCNT1</i> GoF variants. Further research is needed to assess its long-term efficacy and safety. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The objective of this study was to investigate the differences in cyclic alternating patterns (CAP) metrics, a non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep physiological rhythm, among recently diagnosed patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), and individuals at high and low risk for developing PD based on genetic and prodromal risk.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In this cross-sectional exploratory study, participants underwent clinical, cognitive, and motor evaluation to compute risk based on the Movement Disorder Society (MDS) prodromal criteria and a standard overnight polysomnography. CAP rate, CAP index, A index subtypes, number of CAP sequences, and CAP sequence duration were computed from the electroencephalogram (EEG) signal.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The study included 30 patients with early PD (mean age = 62.80 ± 7.69, disease duration = 1.10 ± 1.09), 26 participants at risk for PD (age = 64.88 ± 10.09), and 36 participants with low risk for PD (age = 56.83 ± 7.41). Despite comparable macrosleep architecture, most CAP measures were significantly lower in patients with PD compared with the low-risk group, whereas the at-risk group showed transitional values between PD and the low-risk group. The A2 index was significantly lower in both the at-risk and PD groups from the low-risk group (at risk = 7.59 ± 4.59; PD = 7.71 ± 5.83; and low risk = 12.85 ± 8.63; <i>p</i> = 0.010). Lower CAP rate and lower CAP index were associated with greater disease severity (<i>r</i> = −0.23 and − 0.24, respectively).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Patients with early clinical PD exhibit alterations in CAP dynamics despite having comparable macrosleep architecture. Alterations of the NREM microsleep structure may occur early in the neurodegenerative process and the A2 index may be an early event in the evolution of the disease with the potential to serve as an early marker for disease progression.

                Background According to “Data Bridge Market Research”, tiny houses are increasingly popular, encouraging people globally to downsize and minimize their ecological footprint. Egypt ranks as one of the nations listed in the worldwide tiny house industry, with a notable increase in interest from 2022 to 2029. This can be developed using sustainable, energy-efficient materials that enhance insulation and thermal comfort, making them an affordable and environmentally friendly option. The study aims to demonstrate how applying insulation to walls and roofs can facilitate a transition from unsustainable lifestyles to more sustainable, economical living, ultimately benefiting both individuals and the environment. Methods This study focuses on the concept of tiny housing, environmental sustainability, and guidelines that are applicable during any step of the design procedure. Four thermal insulation materials will be assessed with a passive design approach on a 40 square metre tiny house, with the help of “Design Builder” software, applied to the walls and roof to discover which material possesses the greatest energy efficiency while lowering the energy consumptions. Results Results showed that the base case scenario achieved 30.96% of the total hours feeling discomfort, and after applying the four insulative materials on a 40 square meters tiny housing, the cellulose insulation has proved to be the most effective one among the others in Faiyum, Egypt, experiencing 24.49% of the total hours being discomfort, with 20.92% highest reduction. PPD% has been examined as well for all four scenarios, proving that the cellulose insulation with a 52.36 PPD% showed a 12.28 PPD% reduction. Conclusion Given Egypt’s financial challenges, architects must prioritize thermal considerations and insulative materials in construction. This study evaluates thermal performance between a no-insulation case and four scenarios using common insulative materials to enhance thermal comfort in Fayium housing, Egypt.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-225/v1?src=rss">Occupational therapists’ perspectives on the use of exoskeletons for post-stroke rehabilitation [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Robot-assisted therapy is a promising approach to enhance stroke rehabilitation, particularly in improving upper-limb function through intensive and repetitive training. Successful integration of technology into clinical practice relies on therapists’ acceptance and endorsement. Our purpose is to share the perspectives of the occupational therapists who facilitate robot-assisted therapy and the benefits and challenges of practical implementation of the robot. Clinicians who worked with stroke survivors to research the usability, feasibility, and efficacy of the Harmony exoskeleton discuss their impressions of the technology on stroke rehabilitation. Overall, therapists expressed positive views on the therapeutic and adjunctive use of robot-assisted technology, emphasizing patient engagement, objective evaluations of progress, and ease of certain aspects of their role. Additional feedback highlighted the Harmony exoskeleton’s ability to promote neuromuscular re-education and foster neuroplasticity. Barriers to implementation include physical capabilities, patient suitability, technical difficulties, and the need for advanced quantitative feedback and data analysis. To maximize the impact of robot-assisted therapy in stroke rehabilitation, ongoing research and development are necessary to address identified challenges. Improved limb support, quantitative feedback, equipment reliability, and more levels of weight support for patients with higher levels of function may improve therapist acceptance of this device and may inform exoskeleton development.

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The ability to navigate spatially in the physical world is a fundamental cognitive skill. This study examines the anatomical correlates of map-assisted wayfinding in an unfamiliar virtual environment using structural magnetic resonance magining (MRI). Thirty-three participants were required to reach up to seven different locations represented on a navigational map in a simulated environment, while their gazing behavior was recorded, and, in close temporal proximity, the anatomical MRI of their brain was acquired. Significant predictors of wayfinding performance were the volumes of the right hippocampus, left retrosplenial cortex, and posterior cingulate cortex—left inferior frontal gyrus, right superior frontal gyrus, and right cerebellar lobule VIIB. Detailed analyses revealed a dissociation between two clusters of gray matter density in the right hippocampus. Compared with the poorest wayfinders, the best wayfinders exhibited more gray matter density in a cluster located in the right posterior hippocampus but less gray matter density in a cluster located in the anterior section of the hippocampus. In addition, top performers spent more time gazing at the map, highlighting the benefit of using external aids during navigation tasks. Altogether, these results underscore how structural adaptations are associated with spatial navigation performance.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.70004?af=R">The Modulation by the Locus Coeruleus of Recent and Remote Memory Retrieval is Activity‐Dependent</a></h4>

              
                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The hippocampus plays a crucial role in acquiring, storing, and retrieving associative experience. Whereas neuromodulatory control of the hippocampus by the locus coeruleus (LC) enhances memory acquisition and consolidation, less is known about its influence on memory retrieval. The LC fires at tonic (0.5–8 Hz) and phasic frequencies (10–25 Hz), relative to arousal and affective states. Here, we explored to what extent LC stimulation at different frequencies (2–100 Hz) and respective stimulation patterns, before retrieval of recently acquired or remote spatial memory, alter working memory (WM) or reference memory (RM) in male rats. Here, animals learned a spatial memory task in an eight-arm radial maze over a period of 15 days. LC stimulation before recent memory testing did not affect WM. However, LC stimulation at 20 or 100 Hz, but not 5–10 Hz, impaired retrieval of recently consolidated RM. These frequency-dependent impairments were abolished by intracerebral β-adrenergic receptor (β-AR), but not D1/D5 receptor, antagonism. When memory retrieval was assessed 4 weeks after initial consolidation (Day 34), RM was significantly impaired compared to the final day of recent memory testing (on Day 6). RM was not altered by LC stimulation before remote memory retrieval. However, LC stimulation at 2–100 Hz improved WM. Taken together, these data suggest that frequency-dependent NA release from the LC disrupts retrieval of recently acquired RM via activation of β-AR. Strikingly, increasing LC activity <i>in general</i> improves WM of a remotely acquired spatial learning task, assessed 4 weeks after the recent memory testing, suggesting that the increased effort of sustaining WM of a task learned in the past requires higher LC engagement.</p>

                Guo et al. demonstrate that the spatial segregation of EPI/PrE precursors during the second cell fate decision of mammalian embryos is driven by blastocyst cavity oscillation. By combining experiments and computational simulations, they show that cavity oscillation promotes cell-cell contact fluctuations and convergent cell flows, leading to EPI/PrE precursor segregation.

                Schulz et al. demonstrate how neural encoding and decoding can be cast as computing conditional distributions and how to modify variational autoencoders (VAEs) to calculate such distributions. The proposed VAE-masking scheme allows for joint dimensionality reduction of neural and behavioral data and conditional generation of one modality given the other.

	<p>Background/Objectives: As the global population ages, the need for effective nonpharmacological interventions to support cognitive health has become increasingly urgent. Singing has been identified as a promising strategy to enhance cognitive function and emotional well-being in older adults. While substantial research has focused on the neurocognitive benefits of musical training, the specific effects of singing on neuroplasticity and cognition in aging populations remain underexplored. Methods: This review synthesizes findings from PubMed, PsycINFO, and Google Scholar to examine the impact of singing on cognitive health, particularly in mitigating cognitive decline and promoting mental well-being. Results: Key benefits of singing include improvements in verbal fluency, executive function, and episodic memory. Structural changes such as increased white matter integrity and enhanced auditory&amp;amp;ndash;motor integration highlight the potential of singing to stimulate neuroplasticity. Among individuals with dementia, singing fosters episodic memory, mood enhancement, and social connection, while healthy older adults demonstrate improved verbal flexibility and cognitive resilience. However, methodological limitations, such as small sample sizes and cross-sectional designs, preclude definitive conclusions about long-term benefits. Conclusions: Future research should explore the specific neural mechanisms underlying these effects, with an emphasis on longitudinal studies and diverse populations. Tailored, inclusive singing programs could address individual cognitive and physical abilities while fostering sustained engagement and social connection. As a low-cost, scalable intervention, singing holds promise for addressing cognitive and emotional challenges associated with aging, offering an accessible avenue to support healthy aging and enhance quality of life across diverse populations.</p>

	<p>Background: Natural nootropic compounds are evidenced to restore brain function in clinical and older populations and are purported to enhance cognitive abilities in healthy cohorts. This study aimed to provide neurocomputational insight into the discrepancies between the remarkable self-reports and growing interest in nootropics among healthy adults and the inconclusive performance-enhancing effects found in the literature. Methods: Towards this end, we devised a randomised, double-blinded, and placebo-controlled study where participants performed a visual categorisation task prior to and following 60 days of supplementation with a plant-based nootropic, while electroencephalographic (EEG) signals were concurrently captured. Results: We found that although no improvements in choice accuracy or reaction times were observed, the application of multivariate information-theoretic measures to the EEG source space showed broadband increases in similar and complementary interdependencies across brain networks of various spatial scales. These changes not only resulted in localised increases in the redundancy among brain network interactions but also more significant and widespread increases in synergy, especially within the delta frequency band. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that natural nootropics can improve overall brain network cohesion and energetic efficiency, computationally demonstrating the beneficial effects of natural nootropics on brain health. However, these effects could not be related to enhanced rapid perceptual decision-making performance in a healthy adult sample. Future research investigating these specific compounds as cognitive enhancers in healthy populations should focus on complex cognition in deliberative tasks (e.g., creativity, learning) and over longer supplementation durations.

	<p>Background: In rare cases, isolated hypoglossal palsy may arise from dissection and/or pseudoaneurysm of either the internal carotid artery (ICA) or the vertebral artery (VA). However, the mechanism of this pathology has not been elucidated, and no high-quality randomized data exist to guide its management. Case Description: A 43-year-old man without a significant medical history presented with signs of isolated right hypoglossal palsy following a vigorous coughing episode. Imaging demonstrated dissection and pseudoaneurysm of the left ICA in addition to dissection of the right VA. After 2 weeks on 325 mg aspirin daily, the patient presented with left (rather than right) tongue symptoms and worsening ICA and VA stenosis. While on 325 mg aspirin plus 75 mg clopidogrel daily without additional endovascular intervention, the patient improved with no residual symptoms at 6 weeks from symptom onset. Conclusions: Acute hypoglossal nerve palsy may present with ipsilateral swelling, which could be mistaken for contralateral atrophy. We suggest ordering a CT angiogram initially to delineate a potential ICA versus VA dissection, as well as to rule out other etiologies. In our case, dissection and pseudoaneurysm from the ICA likely led to hypoglossal palsy through a mass effect on the nerve. Our comprehensive literature review favors initial management with dual-antiplatelet agents, and to then escalate to procedural interventions if symptoms worsen.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Violent behaviors are uncommon in patients with schizophrenia (Sch), but when present, exacerbate stigma and challenge treatment. The following study aimed to identify the structural abnormalities associated with violent behaviors in Sch by implementing a validated tool specifically designed to evaluate violent behaviors in psychiatric populations, as well as by performing region-of-interest neuroimaging analyses, focused on areas commonly associated with the neurobiology of violence and aggression. Methods: Eighty-three participants were divided into three groups: Sch with violent behaviors (Sch+V, n = 34), Sch without violent behaviors (Sch-V, n = 28), and healthy controls (HC, n = 21). Structural neuroimaging analyses were performed across groups to assess gray matter volume (GMV) and cortical thickness (CT) differences in regions previously implicated in aggressive behaviors. Results: The data revealed significant reductions in GMV in the right amygdala and diminished cortical thickness (CT) in the bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortices (dlPFC) in patients with Sch+V compared to patients with Sch-V and HCs. Right amygdalar volume also demonstrated a negative correlational trend with hostility scores in patients with Sch+V. Conclusions: These findings underscore disruptions in the structural integrity of the dlPFC&amp;amp;mdash;responsible for inhibitory control&amp;amp;mdash;and the amygdala&amp;amp;mdash;central to emotional processing in violent patients with Sch. Future research should aim to investigate potential functional interactions at a network level to gain a deeper understanding of the neurobiological underpinnings of violent behaviors in this population.</p>

	<p>The present review describes the use and effectiveness of mental imagery in Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease-related dementia. Six databases were thoroughly searched from January 2010 to December 2024. Different types of studies were retrieved and reviewed for imagery of the motor, cognitive, and emotional states and quality of life of the elderly with dementia. Although the scarce results showed the positive effect of mental imagery to the every-day life of older adults with dementia, more research should be conducted with larger homogenous samples and more valid tools. Future recommendations are provided.</p>

	<p>Background: The embodied cognition approach, as applied to concrete knowledge, is centred on the role of the perceptual and motor aspects of experience. To extend the embodied framework to abstract knowledge, some studies have suggested that further dimensions, such as affective or social experiences, are relevant for the semantic representations of abstract concepts. The objective of this study is to develop a measure that can quantitatively capture the multidimensional nature of abstract concepts. Methods: We used dimension-rating methods, known to be suitable, to account for the semantic representations of abstract concepts, to develop a new database of 964 Italian words, rated by 542 participants. Besides classical psycholinguistic variables (i.e., concreteness, imageability, familiarity, age of acquisition, semantic diversity) and affective norms (i.e., valence, arousal), we collected ratings on selected dimensions characterizing the semantic representations of abstract concepts, i.e., introspective, mental state, quantitative, spatial, social, moral, theoretical, and economic dimensions. The measure of exclusivity was incorporated to quantify the number of dimensions, and the respective relevance, for each concept. Concepts with a high value of exclusivity rely on only one/a few dimension/s with high value on the respective rating scale. Results: A multidimensional representation characterized most abstract concepts, with two robust major clusters. The first was characterized by dense intersections among introspective, mental state, social, and moral dimensions; the second, less interconnected, cluster revolved around quantitative, spatial, theoretical, and economic dimensions. Quantitative, theoretical, and economic concepts obtained higher exclusivity values. Conclusions: The present study contributes to the investigation of the semantic organization of abstract words and supports a controlled selection and definition of stimuli for clinical and research settings.</p>

                <p>Speech intelligibility declines with age and sensorineural hearing damage (SNHL). However, it remains unclear whether cochlear synaptopathy (CS), a recently discovered form of SNHL, significantly contributes to this issue. CS refers to damaged auditory-nerve synapses that innervate the inner hair cells and there is currently no go-to diagnostic test available. Furthermore, age-related hearing damage can comprise various aspects (e.g., hair cell damage, CS) that each can play a role in impaired sound perception. To explore the link between cochlear damage and speech intelligibility deficits, this study examines the role of CS for word recognition among older listeners. We first validated an envelope-following response (EFR) marker for CS using a Budgerigar model. We then applied this marker in human experiments, while restricting the speech material&rsquo;s frequency content to ensure that both the EFR and the behavioral tasks engaged similar cochlear frequency regions. Following this approach, we identified the relative contribution of hearing sensitivity and CS to speech intelligibility in two age-matched (65-year-old) groups with clinically normal (<I>n</I> = 15, 8 females) or impaired audiograms (<I>n</I> = 13, 8 females). Compared to a young normal-hearing control group (<I>n</I> = 13, 7 females), the older groups demonstrated lower EFR responses and impaired speech reception thresholds. We conclude that age-related CS reduces supra-threshold temporal envelope coding with subsequent speech coding deficits in noise that cannot be explained based on hearing sensitivity alone.</p>

                <p>Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) is a severe neurological disease associated with Th17/Treg cell imbalance and dysregulation of the Wnt/&beta;-catenin signaling pathway. This study investigates whether miR-155 inhibition can activate Wnt/&beta;-catenin signaling, improve Th17/Treg balance, and provide neuroprotection against stroke. We conducted a multilevel experimental design, including high-throughput sequencing, bioinformatics analysis, in vivo mouse models, and in vitro cell experiments. High-throughput sequencing revealed significant differential gene expression between the miR-155 antagomir&ndash;treated and control groups (BioProject: PRJNA1152758). Bioinformatics analysis identified key genes linked to Wnt/&beta;-catenin signaling and Th17/Treg imbalance. In vitro experiments confirmed that miR-155 inhibition activated Wnt/&beta;-catenin signaling and improved Th17/Treg ratios. In vivo studies demonstrated that miR-155 antagomir treatment provided significant neuroprotection against AIS. These findings suggest that targeting miR-155 could be a promising therapeutic strategy for stroke by modulating immune balance and key signaling pathways.</p>

                Background The danger of earthquakes poses a serious threat to people worldwide. One of the most significant challenges is preparing communities to cope effectively with this disaster. Therefore, understanding earthquake hazards is critically important for preparedness, mitigation, and an effective response to this threat. This report aims to observe and conduct a preliminary assessment of the degree to which community preparedness for earthquake disasters has been implemented. Methods Empirical data were obtained from survey respondents and interviews. The respondents were members of a community affected by the Cianjur earthquake, which occurred on November 21, 2022. The data were analysed using the mean range approach, based on Likert scales. Additionally, the Spearman correlation method was employed to indicate the relationship between community awareness and infrastructure readiness. Result Based on empirical evidence and preliminary analysis, it is evident that the preparedness of the community to respond effectively to earthquake catastrophes is inadequate. An apparent lack of readiness is observed in the inadequate construction of housing that fails to meet disaster standards, and the absence of disaster response facilities is notable. Conclusions Based on our initial assumption, it appears that knowledge related to disaster resilience in this area has not been adequately disseminated or socialized. However, this premise requires further investigation.

                This report presents the successful orthodontic management of a case of odontoma associated with impaction of the mandibular right permanent canine and Molar-incisor-hypomineralization (MIH). Although case studies have reported the management of odontomas and MIH as separate entities, there is a lack of evidence regarding the comprehensive management of patients presenting with a combination of odontoma, dental impaction, and MIH. A 15-year, 7-month-old female patient complained of the appearance of her smile and the delayed eruption of her mandibular right permanent canine. She was diagnosed with Angle’s Class I molar relationship and Class II canine relationship with the maxillary permanent right lateral incisor in a lingual crossbite. Furthermore, she had mandibular right permanent canine impaction, retained mandibular right primary canine, and MIH in the permanent anterior teeth and first molars. The management involved the removal of the odontoma to allow for orthodontic traction of the lower permanent right canine. After that, the esthetic appearance of the teeth was improved through restorative treatment.

[version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background The work experience of seafarers differs significantly from other land-based occupations due to several factors, particularly remoteness and the restricted work environment. This study seeks to examine the impact of burnout and health impairment in the maritime industry, using the Job Demand-Resources theory as a framework. Methods To investigate these phenomena, an online questionnaire was sent to 629 Italian seafarers and we conducted analysis on a valid sample of 239 respondents (94.6% men, Mage = 39.44, SD = 12.8). We tested a mediated Structural Equation Model (SEM) aimed at predicting negative health outcomes. Results The results show that burnout plays a mediating role between job demands (such as workload and cognitive strain) and health impairment (such as sleep quality and physical well-being) (Total Indirect Effect = 0.443, p < .0001) as well as between job resources (such as social support and transformational leadership) and health impairment (Total Indirect Effect = -0.249, p < .0001). Furthermore, the findings highlight the direct influence of occupational resources on seafarers’ health. Conclusions The discussion highlights the urgent need for more research in the field of organisational psychology in the maritime industry and the discrepancies between these findings, which are consistent with the existing maritime literature, and other studies that do not include seafarers in their sample groups.

                Background The mass vaccination campaign against COVID-19 has been commonly considered the best response to the global COVID-19 pandemic crisis. However, assessment of its real-world effect can be performed by analysis of all-cause mortality by vaccination status. The UK is perhaps the only country which has made publicly available all-cause mortality data by vaccination status. Methods Data from April 2021 to May 2023 published by the UK Office for National Statistics (ONS) were retrospectively analyzed by age groups and vaccination status; the standardized mortality ratio (SMR) for all-cause and non-COVID-19 mortality was calculated against the corresponding unvaccinated groups. Results We found that across all age groups, all-cause mortality SMRs increased from a certain date, dependent on the age group. Across all age groups, all-cause mortality SMRs were initially much lower than 1. However, due to their increase, by a certain date for the 18-39, 80-89 and 90+ age groups they exceeded the reference value. For the other age groups, the date at which the SMR would reach 1 can be predicted, provided the trend is maintained. Non-COVID-19 SMRs’ trends were very similar. Their initial values much lower than 1 are suggestive of significant biases in the ONS dataset, leading to underestimate the risks for the vaccinated people, as it is implausible that COVID-19 vaccines protect against non-COVID-19 deaths. Conclusions The increase over time in all-cause death SMRs in vaccinated people compared to unvaccinated, and their excess from the reference values for certain age groups, should be carefully considered to understand the underlying factors. Furthermore, since the initial values of the SMRs are much lower than 1, we assume the presence of significant biases in the ONS dataset, leading to understimate the risks for the vaccinated people, as it is implausible that COVID-19 vaccines protect against non-COVID-19 deaths. It would be desirable for other major countries to systematically collect all-cause mortality by vaccination status and, in the meantime, a pending indepth investigations, much greater caution should be exercised in promoting mass vaccination campaigns.

The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the importance of non-traditional data sources, such as mobile phone data, to inform effective public health interventions and monitor adherence to such measures. Previous studies showed how socioeconomic characteristics shaped population response during restrictions and how repeated interventions eroded adherence over time. Less is known about how different population strata changed their response to repeated interventions and how this impacted the resulting mobility network. We study population response during the first and second infection waves of the COVID-19 pandemic in Chile and Spain. Via spatial lag and regression models, we investigate the adherence to mobility interventions at the municipality level in Chile, highlighting the significant role of wealth, labor structure, COVID-19 incidence, and network metrics characterizing business-as-usual municipality connectivity in shaping mobility changes during the two waves. We assess network structural similarities in the two periods by defining mobility hotspots and traveling probabilities in the two countries. As a proof of concept, we simulate and compare outcomes of an epidemic diffusion occurring in the two waves. While differences exist between factors associated with mobility reduction across waves in Chile, underscoring the dynamic nature of population response, our analysis reveals the resilience of the mobility network across the two waves. We test the robustness of our findings recovering similar results for Spain. Finally, epidemic modeling suggests that historical mobility data from past waves can be leveraged to inform future disease spatial invasion models in repeated interventions. This study highlights the value of historical mobile phone data for building pandemic preparedness and lessens the need for real-time data streams for risk assessment and outbreak response. Our work provides valuable insights into the complex interplay of factors driving mobility across repeated interventions, aiding in developing targeted mitigation strategies.

                <p>by Bente Winkler, Dominik Funke, Christian Klämbt</p>

The central nervous system is well-separated from external influences by the blood–brain barrier. Upon surveillance, infection or neuroinflammation; however, peripheral immune cells can enter the brain where they often cause detrimental effects. To invade the brain, immune cells not only have to breach cellular barriers, but they also need to traverse associated extracellular matrix barriers. Neither in vertebrates nor in invertebrates is it fully understood how these processes are molecularly controlled. We recently established <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> as a model to elucidate peripheral immune cell invasion into the brain. Here, we show that neuroinflammation leads to the expression of Unpaired cytokines that activate the JAK/STAT signaling pathway in glial cells of the blood–brain barrier. This in turn triggers the expression of matrix metalloproteinases enabling remodeling of the extracellular matrix enclosing the fly brain and a subsequent invasion of immune cells into the brain. Our study demonstrates conserved mechanisms underlying immune cell invasion of the nervous system in invertebrates and vertebrates and could, thus, further contribute to understanding of JAK/STAT signaling during neuroinflammation.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTRv) is an autosomal dominant genetic disease characterized by the misfolding and deposition of the transthyretin (TTR) protein. This study aimed to describe the clinical and genetic characteristics of ATTRv in a large multicenter Chinese cohort.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Patients from 14 centers were included in the study. The clinical and genetic characteristics of all patients were summarized. The peripheral blood white blood cell mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) was detected in offspring from different genders.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 202 individuals with ATTRv from 148 families were identified. The average age of onset was 50.6 ± 12.4 years. Among these cases, 117 (57.9%) were classified as late-onset (≥50 years) and 85 (42.1%) as early-onset. Overall, the length dependent axonal sensorimotor peripheral neuropathy was the predominant phenotype (89.1%). A total of 42 heterozygous missense variants and 1 deletion variant were identified. The most common variants were Val30Met (19.8%) and Ala97Ser (15.8%) and patients with Val30Met and Ala97Ser were mostly late-onset in our cohort. Thirty-nine of these patients died with a mean age of 56.1 ± 13.5 years. Anticipation according to gender groups of offspring-parent pairs was different, and mother-son pairs showed the largest anticipation. The copies of mtDNA in the mother's offspring outnumbered those of the father's offspring (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This study highlights that ATTRv patients in China exhibit high heterogeneity in their initial symptoms. The most common variants observed in this cohort is Val30Met. The mtDNA copy number shows gender-linked effects. These results can impact ATTRv diagnosis and patient care strategies. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease characterized by altered metabolome and energy homeostasis, manifesting with body mass index changes and hypermetabolism—both prognostic of disease progression and survival. The cross-sectional ALS metabolome has been characterized, but longitudinal correlations to functional decline are lacking.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We longitudinally evaluated metabolomes from ALS plasma and terminal postmortem spinal cord and brain motor cortex tissue. We constructed 3 plasma models. A linear mixed effects model correlated all metabolite levels across all timepoints to their corresponding functional scores. An interaction model predicted a longitudinal change in function from baseline metabolites, whereas a progression model identified metabolites linked to a 20% or 50% drop in function. In postmortem samples, differential metabolites in onset versus second spinal cord segments served as a surrogate of disease progression. Mendelian randomization assessed potential causality from metabolites.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In plasma, all models primarily selected lipid metabolites and sub-pathways, in addition to amino acids, xenobiotics, and various less frequently selected pathways. Among lipids, fatty acids and sphingomyelins were predominant, along with plasmalogens, phosphatidylcholines, and lysophospholipids. Sex interaction findings were nominal. In the spinal cord, sphingomyelin and long-chain saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids were more abundant in the onset segment tissue, whereas phosphatidylcholines and phosphatidylethanolamines were less abundant. Mendelian randomization suggested that impaired carnitine and short chain acylcarnitine metabolism may be genetically determined in ALS, along with various antioxidant derivatives.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our findings suggest metabolomic changes primarily involving different lipid classes and carnitine metabolism may underscore ALS severity and progression. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>We aimed at evaluating the brain metabolic features of fused in sarcoma amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (<i>FUS</i>-ALS) compared with sporadic ALS (sALS), using 2-[fluorine-18] fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography (2-[<sup>18</sup>F]FDG-PET).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We employed the 2-sample <i>t</i>-test model of SPM12, implemented in MATLAB, to compare 12 <i>FUS</i>-ALS cases with 40 healthy controls (HC) and 48 sALS, randomly collected from the series of patients who underwent brain 2-[<sup>18</sup>F]FDG-PET at the ALS Center of Turin (Italy) at diagnosis from 2009 to 2019. In the comparisons between cases and HC, we included age at PET and sex as covariates. Because <i>FUS</i>-ALS usually shows early onset in spinal regions, in the comparison between <i>FUS</i>-ALS and sALS, we included singularly the following covariates in a second step, to evaluate the determinants of eventual metabolic differences: age at PET, sex, and onset (spinal/bulbar).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>sALS patients showed significant relative hypometabolism in bilateral fronto-temporo-occipital cortex and right insula as compared with <i>FUS</i>-ALS. After adjusting for age, the relative hypometabolism remained in the bilateral precentral gyrus and in the right middle and inferior temporal gyrus. As compared with HC, <i>FUS</i> patients displayed a significant relative hypermetabolism in the pontobulbar region and right cerebellar tonsil, dentate nucleus, and uvula, while sALS showed relative hypometabolism in bilateral frontal and occipital cortices and in left temporal and parietal regions.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Patients with <i>FUS</i>-ALS show relative preservation of motor cortex metabolism compared with those with sALS, possibly reflecting the prevalence of lower motor neuron impairment in their phenotype. Prospective studies are necessary to investigate the possible role of 2-[<sup>18</sup>F]FDG-PET as a biomarker to track disease spreading in clinical trials. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                Introduction Calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)2) is the material of choice for pulp therapy. However, Ca(OH)2 has drawbacks such as toxicity, poor sealing, and tunnel defect formation. Alternative materials have been developed to provide more biocompatible materials with better dentin formation ability. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of composites containing gelatin (G), chitosan (CH), tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS), and Ca(OH)2, namely G-CH-TEOS-Ca (OH)2 (Extended data) on inflammation of the dental pulp (expression of COX-2, PGP 9.5, TNF-α, and neutrophil number). Materials and methods A total of 16 Wistar rat models of acute pulp injury were prepared and divided into two groups, treatment and control, 8 with each. In the treatment group, we applied a pulp-capping material using G-CH-TEOS-Ca (OH)2 and Ca(OH)2. On the 1st and 3rd days, rats were sacrificed. Tissue samples from 4 rats in each group were processed for histological preparation. COX-2, PGP 9.5, and TNF-α were observed using immunohistochemical (IHC) staining, and neutrophil numbers were observed using hematoxylin-eosin staining. Image analysis of COX-2, PGP 9.5, and TNF-α expression was performed using ImageJ software. Results The results showed a decrease significantly in COX-2 expression while PGP 9.5 and TNF-α expression were significantly higher than those in the control group. Neutrophil numbers were lower in the treatment group than in the control group, but the difference was not statistically significant. Conclusion The G-CH-TEOS-Ca (OH)2 composite material may have potential as an exposed pulp medicament by reducing mediator of inflammation (COX-2 expression) and increasing the regeneration factor (TNF-α expression) and nerve (PGP 9.5 expression).

                Background The cestode Hymenolepis diminuta is a cosmopolitan parasite, which in the adult stage is usually found in the small intestine of rats and accidentally in humans. Case report We describe the finding of eggs of this parasite in an asymptomatic 3-year-old child. The child had extremely high IgE values of 1,376 IU/ml. After receiving treatment with Albendazole suspension 400mg/20mL, on the 10th day post-treatment, he showed no H. diminuta eggs in his fecal matter Conclusions Detailed morphological review of Hymenolepis nana-like eggs is recommended to distinguish them from H. diminuta eggs.

                Background Research integrity, essential for ethical scientific research, has been inadequately addressed in Ethiopia, resulting in gaps in addressing misconduct like plagiarism, falsification and fabrication. The aim of this study was to assess the magnitude and factors associated with research misconduct at a public university in Ethiopia. Methods An institutional-based cross-sectional study was conducted on a random sample of researchers. Data were collected via a self-administered, structured questionnaire, which was adapted from a similar study. The collected data were analysed using descriptive, bivariate, and multivariable logistic regression. Result A total of 244 researchers participated in the study, resulting in an 82% response rate. In our study, 37.7% of participants reported engaging in at least one form of misconduct, 95% CI [31.6%, 44.1%]. Authorship misconduct was the most common form of self-reported misconduct (47.5%), 95% CI [41.1%, 54.0%], followed by fabrication and falsification (40.6%), 95% CI [34.4%, 47.0%]. Publication pressure was significantly associated with research misconduct (AOR = 3.18; 95% CI: [1.02, 9.95]). Conclusion This study highlights the prevalence of research misconduct and questionable research practices among academic researchers, with authorship misconduct, fabrication, falsification, and plagiarism being the most commonly reported types. Attitudes toward research misconduct and self-reported involvement were influenced by academic position, research experience, and publication pressure, with junior researchers being more likely to report engaging in misbehavior. While ethics training has occasionally been associated with reduced rates of research misconduct, its effectiveness remains uncertain, as institutional culture, supervision, and mentorship may play a more significant role. Addressing research misconduct requires a comprehensive approach that extends beyond ethical instruction, incorporating targeted support for early-career researchers, open dialogue, and institutional policy reforms.

                Background Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C) is a valuable marker in the management of Diabetes Mellitus, aiding in screening and diagnosis, and as a predictor of complications. Iron deficiency anaemia in developing countries has been found to affect the blood levels of HbA1C, decreasing its sensitivity. This study was undertaken to analyse the influence of iron deficiency anaemia on HbA1c levels, and thereby assess the reliability of A1C as a diagnostic marker for diabetes mellitus in iron deficient patients Methods This cross-sectional observational case-control study was conducted in a single tertiary care center. A total of 164 patients were recruited, 82 each from the case and control groups. The groups were matched for age and sex. Cases were nondiabetics with iron deficiency, and controls were nondiabetics without iron deficiency Results Age and sex were matched between cases and controls. The median ferritin levels were 5.9 ng/dl (n= 82) and 144 ng/dl (n= 82) among cases and controls. Transferrin saturation was distributed among cases, with a median of 3.4% for males (n= 36) and 3.2% for females (n= 46). Median hemoglobin levels were compared among each age group, with more severe anemia being seen as age increased. HbA1C was also compared age -wise, with results being statistically significant across each category. There was a statistically significant difference between HbA1C levels in cases and controls (p<0.0001), with some cases having A1C in the diabetic range, without any signs and symptoms of diabetes, and normal fasting and post prandial glucose Conclusion The results of our study suggest that although HbA1C is a diagnostic marker for type 2 diabetes mellitus, it loses its reliability when there is a co-existing iron deficiency anaemia. Hence certain amount of vigilance is mandated to confirm diabetes mellitus based on HbA1C, when the patient also has iron deficiency.
