              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04752">Towards a Vision-Language Episodic Memory Framework: Large-scale Pretrained Model-Augmented Hippocampal Attractor Dynamics</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2505.04752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling episodic memory (EM) remains a significant challenge in both neuroscience and AI, with existing models either lacking interpretability or struggling with practical applications. This paper proposes the Vision-Language Episodic Memory (VLEM) framework to address these challenges by integrating large-scale pretrained models with hippocampal attractor dynamics. VLEM leverages the strong semantic understanding of pretrained models to transform sensory input into semantic embeddings as the neocortex, while the hippocampus supports stable memory storage and retrieval through attractor dynamics. In addition, VLEM incorporates prefrontal working memory and the entorhinal gateway, allowing interaction between the neocortex and the hippocampus. To facilitate real-world applications, we introduce EpiGibson, a 3D simulation platform for generating episodic memory data. Experimental results demonstrate the VLEM framework's ability to efficiently learn high-level temporal representations from sensory input, showcasing its robustness, interpretability, and applicability in real-world scenarios.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05331">Aesthetics Without Semantics</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2505.05331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While it is easy for human observers to judge an image as beautiful or ugly, aesthetic decisions result from a combination of entangled perceptual and cognitive (semantic) factors, making the understanding of aesthetic judgements particularly challenging from a scientific point of view. Furthermore, our research shows a prevailing bias in current databases, which include mostly beautiful images, further complicating the study and prediction of aesthetic responses. We address these limitations by creating a database of images with minimal semantic content and devising, and next exploiting, a method to generate images on the ugly side of aesthetic valuations. The resulting Minimum Semantic Content (MSC) database consists of a large and balanced collection of 10,426 images, each evaluated by 100 observers. We next use established image metrics to demonstrate how augmenting an image set biased towards beautiful images with ugly images can modify, or even invert, an observed relationship between image features and aesthetics valuation. Taken together, our study reveals that works in empirical aesthetics attempting to link image content and aesthetic judgements may magnify, underestimate, or simply miss interesting effects due to a limitation of the range of aesthetic values they consider.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05371">From Sleep Staging to Spindle Detection: Evaluating End-to-End Automated Sleep Analysis</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2505.05371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automation of sleep analysis, including both macrostructural (sleep stages) and microstructural (e.g., sleep spindles) elements, promises to enable large-scale sleep studies and to reduce variance due to inter-rater incongruencies. While individual steps, such as sleep staging and spindle detection, have been studied separately, the feasibility of automating multi-step sleep analysis remains unclear. Here, we evaluate whether a fully automated analysis using state-of-the-art machine learning models for sleep staging (RobustSleepNet) and subsequent spindle detection (SUMOv2) can replicate findings from an expert-based study of bipolar disorder. The automated analysis qualitatively reproduced key findings from the expert-based study, including significant differences in fast spindle densities between bipolar patients and healthy controls, accomplishing in minutes what previously took months to complete manually. While the results of the automated analysis differed quantitatively from the expert-based study, possibly due to biases between expert raters or between raters and the models, the models individually performed at or above inter-rater agreement for both sleep staging and spindle detection. Our results demonstrate that fully automated approaches have the potential to facilitate large-scale sleep research. We are providing public access to the tools used in our automated analysis by sharing our code and introducing SomnoBot, a privacy-preserving sleep analysis platform.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14592">The role of gap junctions and clustered connectivity in emergent synchronisation patterns of inhibitory neuronal networks</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2402.14592v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inhibitory interneurons, ubiquitous in the central nervous system, form networks connected through both chemical synapses and gap junctions. These networks are essential for regulating the activity of principal neurons, especially by inducing temporally patterned dynamic states. We aim to understand the dynamic mechanisms for synchronisation in networks of electrically and chemically coupled interneurons. We use the exact mean-field reduction to derive a neural mass model for both homogeneous and clustered networks. We first analyse a single population of neurons to understand how the two couplings interact with one another. We demonstrate that the network transitions from an asynchronous to a synchronous regime either by increasing the strength of the gap junction connectivity or the strength of the background input current. Conversely, the strength of inhibitory synapses affects the population firing rate, suggesting that electrical and chemical coupling strengths act as complementary mechanisms by which networks can tune synchronous oscillatory behavior. In line with previous work, we confirm that the depolarizing spikelet is crucial for the emergence of synchrony. Furthermore, find that the fast frequency component of the spikelet ensures robustness to heterogeneity. Next, inspired by the existence of multiple interconnected interneuron subtypes in the cerebellum, we analyse networks consisting of two clusters of cell types defined by differing chemical versus electrical coupling strengths. We show that breaking the electrical and chemical coupling symmetry between these clusters induces bistability, so that a transient external input can switch the network between synchronous and asynchronous firing. Together, our results shows the variety of cell-intrinsic and network properties that contribute to synchronisation of interneuronal networks with multiple types of coupling.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02529">Active learning of neural population dynamics using two-photon holographic optogenetics</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2412.02529v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in techniques for monitoring and perturbing neural populations have greatly enhanced our ability to study circuits in the brain. In particular, two-photon holographic optogenetics now enables precise photostimulation of experimenter-specified groups of individual neurons, while simultaneous two-photon calcium imaging enables the measurement of ongoing and induced activity across the neural population. Despite the enormous space of potential photostimulation patterns and the time-consuming nature of photostimulation experiments, very little algorithmic work has been done to determine the most effective photostimulation patterns for identifying the neural population dynamics. Here, we develop methods to efficiently select which neurons to stimulate such that the resulting neural responses will best inform a dynamical model of the neural population activity. Using neural population responses to photostimulation in mouse motor cortex, we demonstrate the efficacy of a low-rank linear dynamical systems model, and develop an active learning procedure which takes advantage of low-rank structure to determine informative photostimulation patterns. We demonstrate our approach on both real and synthetic data, obtaining in some cases as much as a two-fold reduction in the amount of data required to reach a given predictive power. Our active stimulation design method is based on a novel active learning procedure for low-rank regression, which may be of independent interest.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05138">Guiding Evolutionary AutoEncoder Training with Activation-Based Pruning Operators</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2505.05138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores a novel approach to neural network pruning using evolutionary computation, focusing on simultaneously pruning the encoder and decoder of an autoencoder. We introduce two new mutation operators that use layer activations to guide weight pruning. Our findings reveal that one of these activation-informed operators outperforms random pruning, resulting in more efficient autoencoders with comparable performance to canonically trained models. Prior work has established that autoencoder training is effective and scalable with a spatial coevolutionary algorithm that cooperatively coevolves a population of encoders with a population of decoders, rather than one autoencoder. We evaluate how the same activity-guided mutation operators transfer to this context. We find that random pruning is better than guided pruning, in the coevolutionary setting. This suggests activation-based guidance proves more effective in low-dimensional pruning environments, where constrained sample spaces can lead to deviations from true uniformity in randomization. Conversely, population-driven strategies enhance robustness by expanding the total pruning dimensionality, achieving statistically uniform randomness that better preserves system dynamics. We experiment with pruning according to different schedules and present best combinations of operator and schedule for the canonical and coevolving populations cases.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05375">Threshold Modulation for Online Test-Time Adaptation of Spiking Neural Networks</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2505.05375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, spiking neural networks (SNNs), deployed on neuromorphic chips, provide highly efficient solutions on edge devices in different scenarios. However, their ability to adapt to distribution shifts after deployment has become a crucial challenge. Online test-time adaptation (OTTA) offers a promising solution by enabling models to dynamically adjust to new data distributions without requiring source data or labeled target samples. Nevertheless, existing OTTA methods are largely designed for traditional artificial neural networks and are not well-suited for SNNs. To address this gap, we propose a low-power, neuromorphic chip-friendly online test-time adaptation framework, aiming to enhance model generalization under distribution shifts. The proposed approach is called Threshold Modulation (TM), which dynamically adjusts the firing threshold through neuronal dynamics-inspired normalization, being more compatible with neuromorphic hardware. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of this method in improving the robustness of SNNs against distribution shifts while maintaining low computational cost. The proposed method offers a practical solution for online test-time adaptation of SNNs, providing inspiration for the design of future neuromorphic chips. The demo code is available at github.com/NneurotransmitterR/TM-OTTA-SNN.

                arXiv:2501.19113v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce Genetic AI, a novel method for multi-objective optimization without external parameters or predefined weights. The method can be applied to all problems that can be formulated in matrix form and allows for a data-less training of AI models. Without employing predefined rules or training data, Genetic AI first converts the input data into genes and organisms. In a simulation from first principles, these genes and organisms compete for fitness, where their behavior is governed by universal evolutionary strategies. We present four evolutionary strategies: Dominant, Altruistic, Balanced and Selfish and show how a linear combination can be employed in a fully self-consistent evolutionary game. Investigating fitness and evolutionary stable equilibriums, Genetic AI helps solving optimization problems with a set of predefined, discrete solutions that change dynamically. We show the universality of the approach on two decision problems.

                arXiv:2505.04165v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are increasingly recognized for their biological plausibility and energy efficiency, positioning them as strong alternatives to Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) in neuromorphic computing applications. SNNs inherently process temporal information by leveraging the precise timing of spikes, but balancing temporal feature utilization with low energy consumption remains a challenge. In this work, we introduce Temporal Shift module for Spiking Neural Networks (TS-SNN), which incorporates a novel Temporal Shift (TS) module to integrate past, present, and future spike features within a single timestep via a simple yet effective shift operation. A residual combination method prevents information loss by integrating shifted and original features. The TS module is lightweight, requiring only one additional learnable parameter, and can be seamlessly integrated into existing architectures with minimal additional computational cost. TS-SNN achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks like CIFAR-10 (96.72\%), CIFAR-100 (80.28\%), and ImageNet (70.61\%) with fewer timesteps, while maintaining low energy consumption. This work marks a significant step forward in developing efficient and accurate SNN architectures.

                <p>Principal neurons (PNs) of the lateral superior olive (LSO) are a critical component of brain circuits that compare information between the two ears to extract sound source-location-related cues. LSO PNs are not a homogenous group but differ in their transmitter type, intrinsic membrane properties, and projection pattern to higher processing centers in the inferior colliculus. Glycinergic inhibitory LSO PNs have higher input resistance than glutamatergic excitatory LSO PNs (~double). This suggests that the inhibitory cell type has a lower minimum input or signal intensity required to produce an output (activation threshold) which may impact how they integrate binaural inputs. However, cell-type-specific differences in the strength of synaptic drive could offset or accentuate such differences in intrinsic excitability and have not been assessed. To evaluate this possibility, we used a knock-in mouse model to examine spontaneous and electrically stimulated (evoked) synaptic events in LSO PN types using voltage-clamp technique. Both excitatory and inhibitory spontaneous postsynaptic currents were larger in inhibitory LSO PNs, but evoked events were not. Additionally, we found that LSO PN types had inputs with similar short-term plasticity and number of independent fibers. An important contrast was that inhibitory LSO PNs received inhibitory inputs with slower decay kinetics which could impact integrative functions. These data suggest that synaptic inputs onto LSO PNs are unlikely to offset excitability differences. Differences in activation threshold along with transmitter type and projection laterality may allow for distinct roles for LSO PN types in inferior colliculus information processing.</p>

                <p>Childhood epilepsy is a common and devastating condition, for which many children still do not have adequate treatment. Some children with drug-resistant epilepsy require surgical excision of epileptogenic brain tissue for seizure control, affording the opportunity to study this tissue ex vivo to interrogate human epileptic neurons for potentially hyperexcitable perturbations in intrinsic electrophysiological properties. In this study, we characterized the diversity of layer L2/3 (L2/3) pyramidal neurons (PNs) in ex vivo brain slices from pediatric patients with epilepsy. We found a remarkable diversity in the firing properties of epileptic L2/3 PNs: five distinct subpopulations were identified. Additionally, we investigated whether the etiology of epilepsy influenced the intrinsic neuronal properties of L2/3 PNs when comparing tissue from patients with epilepsy due to malformations of cortical development (MCDs), other forms of epilepsy (OEs), or with deep-seated tumors. When comparing epileptic with control L2/3 PNs, we observed a decrease in voltage sag and lower maximum firing rates. Moreover, we found that MCD and OE L2/3 PNs were mostly similar indicating that epilepsy etiology may not outweigh the influences of epileptiform activity on L2/3 PN physiology. Lastly, we show that the proconvulsant drug, 4-aminopyridine (4-AP), leads to increased AP half-width, reduced firing rate accommodation, and slower AHPs. These changes imply that 4-AP induces an increase in [K<sup>+</sup>]<SUB>o</SUB> and a resultant increase in AP duration, leading to the release of more excitatory neurotransmitters per action potential, thereby promoting network hyperexcitability.</p>

                <p>The explore/exploit trade-off is a fundamental property of choice selection during reward-guided decision making, where the "same" choice can reflect either of these internal cognitive states. An unanswered question is whether the execution of a decision provides an underexplored measure of internal cognitive states. Touchscreens are increasingly used across species for cognitive testing and afford the ability to measure the precise location of choice touch responses. We examined how male and female mice in a restless bandit decision making task interacted with a touchscreen to determine if the explore/exploit trade-off, prior reward, and/or sex differences change the variability in the kinetics of touchscreen choices. During exploit states, successive touch responses are closer together than those made in an explore state, suggesting exploit states reflect periods of increased motor stereotypy. Although exploit decisions might be expected to be rewarded more frequently than explore decisions, we find that immediate past reward reduces choice variability independently of explore/exploit state. Male mice are more variable in their interactions with the touchscreen than females, even in low-variability trials such as exploit or following reward. These results suggest that as exploit behavior emerges in reward-guided decision making, all mice become less variable and more automated in both their choice and the actions taken to make that choice, but this occurs on a background of increased male variability. These data uncover the hidden potential for touchscreen decision making tasks to uncover the latent neural states that unite cognition and movement.</p>

                <p>by William R. Shoemaker, Álvaro Sánchez, Jacopo Grilli</p>

Ecology has historically benefited from the characterization of statistical patterns of biodiversity within and across communities, an approach known as macroecology. Within microbial ecology, macroecological approaches have identified universal patterns of diversity and abundance that can be captured by effective models. Experimentation has simultaneously played a crucial role, as the advent of high-replication community time-series has allowed researchers to investigate underlying ecological forces. However, there remains a gap between experiments performed in the laboratory and macroecological patterns documented in natural systems, as we do not know whether these patterns can be recapitulated in the lab and whether experimental manipulations produce macroecological effects. This work aims at bridging the gap between experimental ecology and macroecology. Using high-replication time-series, we demonstrate that microbial macroecological patterns observed in nature exist in a laboratory setting, despite controlled conditions, and can be unified under the Stochastic Logistic Model of growth (SLM). We found that demographic manipulations (e.g., migration) impact observed macroecological patterns. By modifying the SLM to incorporate said manipulations alongside experimental details (e.g., sampling), we obtain predictions that are consistent with macroecological outcomes. By combining high-replication experiments with ecological models, microbial macroecology can be viewed as a predictive discipline.

                <p>by Péter Polcz, István Z. Reguly, Kálmán Tornai, János Juhász, Sándor Pongor, Attila Csikász-Nagy, Gábor Szederkényi</p>

Optimal intervention planning is a critical part of epidemiological control, which is difficult to attain in real life situations. Ordinary differential equation (ODE) models can be used to optimize control but the results can not be easily translated to interventions in highly complex real life environments. Agent-based methods on the other hand allow detailed modeling of the environment but optimization is precluded by the large number of parameters. Our goal was to combine the advantages of both approaches, i.e., to allow control optimization in complex environments. The epidemic control objectives are expressed as a time-dependent reference for the number of infected people. To track this reference, a model predictive controller (MPC) is designed with a compartmental ODE prediction model to compute the optimal level of stringency of interventions, which are later translated to specific actions such as mobility restriction, quarantine policy, masking rules, school closure. The effects of interventions on the transmission rate of the pathogen, and hence their stringency, are computed using PanSim, an agent-based epidemic simulator that contains a detailed model of the environment. The realism and practical applicability of the method is demonstrated by the wide range of discrete level measures that can be taken into account. Moreover, the change between measures applied during consecutive planning intervals is also minimized. We found that such a combined intervention planning strategy is able to efficiently control a COVID-19-like epidemic process, in terms of incidence, virulence, and infectiousness with surprisingly sparse (e.g. 21 day) intervention regimes. At the same time, the approach proved to be robust even in scenarios with significant model uncertainties, such as unknown transmission rate, uncertain time and probability constants. The high performance of the computation allows a large number of test cases to be run. The proposed computational framework can be reused for epidemic management of unexpected pandemic events and can be customized to the needs of any country.

As a result of rapidly accelerating artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities, multiple national governments and multinational bodies have launched efforts to address safety, security and ethics issues related to AI models. One high priority among these efforts is the mitigation of misuse of AI models, such as for the development of chemical, biological, nuclear or radiological (CBRN) threats. Many biologists have for decades sought to reduce the risks of scientific research that could lead, through accident or misuse, to high-consequence disease outbreaks. Scientists have carefully considered what types of life sciences research have the potential for both benefit and risk (dual use), especially as scientific advances have accelerated our ability to engineer organisms. Here we describe how previous experience and study by scientists and policy professionals of dual-use research in the life sciences can inform dual-use capabilities of AI models trained using biological data. Of these dual-use capabilities, we argue that AI model evaluations should prioritize addressing those which enable high-consequence risks (i.e., large-scale harm to the public, such as transmissible disease outbreaks that could develop into pandemics), and that these risks should be evaluated prior to model deployment so as to allow potential biosafety and/or biosecurity measures. While biological research is on balance immensely beneficial, it is well recognized that some biological information or technologies could be intentionally or inadvertently misused to cause consequential harm to the public. AI-enabled life sciences research is no different. Scientists’ historical experience with identifying and mitigating dual-use biological risks can thus help inform new approaches to evaluating biological AI models. Identifying which AI capabilities pose the greatest biosecurity and biosafety concerns is necessary in order to establish targeted AI safety evaluation methods, secure these tools against accident and misuse, and avoid impeding immense potential benefits.

                <p>by Daniel Schmid, Heiko Neumann</p>

Object-basd visual attention marks a key process of mammalian perception. By which mechanisms this process is implemented and how it can be interacted with by means of attentional control is not completely understood yet. Incremental binding is a mechanism required in demanding scenarios of object-based attention and is experimentally well investigated. Attention spreads across a representation of the visual object and labels bound elements by constant up-modulation of neural activity. The speed of incremental binding was found to be dependent on the spatial arrangement of distracting elements in the scene and to be scale invariant giving rise to the growth-cone hypothesis. In this work, we propose a neural dynamical model of incremental binding that provides a mechanistic account for these findings. Through simulations, we investigate the model properties and demonstrate how an attentional spreading mechanism tags neurons that participate in the object binding process. They utilize Gestalt properties and eventually show growth-cone characteristics labeling perceptual items by delayed activity enhancement of neuronal firing rates. We discuss the algorithmic process underlying incremental binding and relate it to our model computations. This theoretical investigation encompasses complexity considerations and finds the model to be not only of explanatory value in terms of neurophysiological evidence, but also to be an efficient implementation of incremental binding striving to establish a normative account. By relating the connectivity motifs of the model to neuroanatomical evidence, we suggest thalamo-cortical interactions to be a likely candidate for the flexible and efficient realization suggested by the model. There, pyramidal cells are proposed to serve as the processors of incremental grouping information. Local bottom-up evidence about stimulus features is integrated via basal dendritic sites. It is combined with an apical signal consisting of contextual grouping information which is gated by attentional task-relevance selection mediated via higher-order thalamic representations.

                <p>by Wenjun Zhao, Erica Larschan, Björn Sandstede, Ritambhara Singh</p>

Inferring gene regulatory networks from gene expression data is an important and challenging problem in the biology community. We propose OTVelo, a methodology that takes time-stamped single-cell gene expression data as input and predicts gene regulation across two time points. It is known that the rate of change of gene expression, which we will refer to as gene velocity, provides crucial information that enhances such inference; however, this information is not always available due to the limitations in sequencing depth. Our algorithm overcomes this limitation by estimating gene velocities using optimal transport. We then infer gene regulation using time-lagged correlation and Granger causality via regularized linear regression. Instead of providing an aggregated network across all time points, our method uncovers the underlying dynamical mechanism across time points. We validate our algorithm on 13 simulated datasets with both synthetic and curated networks and demonstrate its efficacy on 9 experimental data sets.

                <p>by Naruemon Rueangkham, Miguel Valle-Inclán Cabello, Franziska Lautenschläger, Rhoda J. Hawkins</p>

We present a model to calculate the displacement and extension of deformable cellular cargo pulled by molecular motors stepping along cytoskeletal filaments. We consider the case of a single type of molecular motor and cytoskeletal filaments oriented in one dimension in opposite directions on either side of a cargo. We model a deformable cargo as a simple elastic spring. We simulate this tug-of-war simple exclusion process model using a Monte Carlo Gillespie algorithm and calculate the displacement and extension of the cargo for different configurations of motors and filaments. We apply our model to kinesin-1 motors on microtubules to investigate whether they are strong enough to translocate and deform the largest cellular cargo, the nucleus. We show that the extension caused by motors on a single microtubule saturates for larger numbers of motors but that the extension and displacement scales linearly with the number of microtubules. We also show how the binding and unbinding behaviors of molecular motors on microtubule filaments affect the nuclear deformation. Our modelling results correspond to experiments on cells treated with the drug kinesore, which is thought to increase rescue events resulting in more stable microtubules and more active kinesin-1 molecular motors bound to them. Both the experiments and our simulations result in nuclear deformation.

Chemical synaptic transmission at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) is regulated by electrical activity of the motor circuit, but may also be affected by neuromodulation. Here, we assessed the role of neuropeptide signaling in the plasticity of NMJ function in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>. We show that the CAPS (Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent activator protein for secretion) ortholog UNC-31, which regulates exocytosis of dense core vesicles, affects both pre- and post-synaptic functional properties, as well as NMJ-mediated locomotion. Despite reduced evoked acetylcholine (ACh) transmission, the loss of <i>unc-31</i> results in a more vigorous response to presynaptic stimulation, i.e., enhanced muscle contraction and Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients. Based on expression profiles, we identified neuropeptides involved in both cholinergic (FLP-6, FLP-15, NLP-9, NLP-15, NLP-21, and NLP-38) and GABAergic motor neurons (FLP-15, NLP-15), that mediate normal transmission at the NMJ. In the absence of these peptides, neurons fail to upregulate their ACh output in response to increased cAMP signaling; for <i>flp-15; nlp-15</i> double mutants, we observed overall increased postsynaptic currents, indicating that these neuropeptides may be inhibitory. We also identified proprotein convertases encoded by <i>aex-5/kpc-3</i> and <i>egl-3/kpc-2</i> that act synergistically to generate these neuropeptides. We propose that postsynaptic homeostatic scaling, mediated by increased muscle activation, likely through excitability, might compensate for the reduced cholinergic transmission in mutants affected for neuropeptide signaling, thus maintaining net synaptic strength. We show that in the absence of UNC-31 muscle excitability is modulated by upregulating the expression of the muscular L-type voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel EGL-19. Our results unveil a role for neuropeptidergic regulation in synaptic plasticity, linking changes in presynaptic transmission to compensatory changes in muscle excitability.

With the growth of artificial intelligence (AI)-ready datasets such as the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), new opportunities for data-driven research are being created, but also generating risks of data exploitation by paper mills. In this work, we focus on two areas of potential concern for AI-supported research efforts. First, we describe the production of large numbers of formulaic single-factor analyses, relating single predictors to specific health conditions, where multifactorial approaches would be more appropriate. Employing AI-supported single-factor approaches removes context from research, fails to capture interactions, avoids false discovery correction, and is an approach that can easily be adopted by paper mills. Second, we identify risks of selective data usage, such as analyzing limited date ranges or cohort subsets without clear justification, suggestive of data dredging, and post-hoc hypothesis formation. Using a systematic literature search for single-factor analyses, we identified 341 NHANES-derived research papers published over the past decade, each proposing an association between a predictor and a health condition from the wide range contained within NHANES. We found evidence that research failed to take account of multifactorial relationships, that manuscripts did not account for the risks of false discoveries, and that researchers selectively extracted data from NHANES rather than utilizing the full range of data available. Given the explosion of AI-assisted productivity in published manuscripts (the systematic search strategy used here identified an average of 4 papers per annum from 2014 to 2021, but 190 in 2024–9 October alone), we highlight a set of best practices to address these concerns, aimed at researchers, data controllers, publishers, and peer reviewers, to encourage improved statistical practices and mitigate the risks of paper mills using AI-assisted workflows to introduce low-quality manuscripts to the scientific literature.

<p>Using two different EEG tasks with static and articulating faces, deprivation-induced cortical changes in postlingually deafened individuals were found by means of reduced visual cortex activation and a relationship between these alterations and the CI outcome after 6 months. These alterations are not significantly affected by CI experience.</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Although a cochlear implant (CI) can partially restore auditory function, CI recipients show alterations not only in auditory but also in visual cortical processing. Yet, it is not well understood how these visual changes relate to the CI outcome and to what extent these changes are induced by auditory deprivation and the limited CI input, respectively. Here, we present a prospective longitudinal electroencephalography study which examined the deprivation- and CI-induced alterations on cortical face processing by comparing visual evoked potentials (VEP) in CI users before and 6 months after implantation. A group of normal-hearing (NH) listeners served as a control. The participants performed a word-identification task and a face-categorization task to study the cortical processing of static and articulating faces in attended and unattended conditions. The CI candidates and CI users showed a reduced visual-cortex activation, a stronger functional connectivity between the visual and auditory cortex, and a reduced attention effect in the (extended) alpha frequency range (8–18 Hz) when compared to NH listeners. There was a positive correlation between the P1 VEP amplitude recorded before implantation and the speech recognition ability after implantation. Our results suggest that the CI users' alterations in cortical face processing are mainly induced by auditory deprivation and not by CI experience. Importantly, these deprivation-induced changes seem to be related to the CI outcome. Our results suggest that the visual P1 amplitude as recorded <i>before</i> implantation provides an objective index of cortical visual reorganization that may help predict the CI outcome.</p>

[version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Pollution refers to the addition of harmful substances to that level where they cause an effect on the environment, it has three major categories such as water, soil, and air pollution but this report is on water pollution. It occurs when harmful substances contaminate water bodies such as, groundwater, rivers, lakes, and oceans rendering them unfavorable for various purposes for example drinking, recreation, and support to aquatic life. Globally, over 80% of wastewater worldwide is discharged into the water bodies without adequate treatment. In Africa, lack of clean water and sanitation is a significant challenge in many countries, affecting approximately 319 million people. Thus, water pollution is one of the types of pollution that has been threatening the lives of living organisms. Implementing effective policies and strategies can have a profound impact on the environment and local communities. By reducing pollution levels and improving water quality, we can create a healthier environment and decrease the incidence of waterborne diseases, leading to improved health and well-being for residents. The research on water pollution in the River Meizimera Kihihi has important implications for future research, policy and governance, human health, the environment, and communities and society. In conclusion, effective policies can foster community involvement, raise awareness, and promote collective action to address water pollution. By achieving clean water and sanitation (SDG 6), we can contribute to the broader sustainable development goals. This research has important ramifications for future research, policy and governance, human health, the environment, communities, and society. This study investigated the problems of water pollution, its causes, its impact, and the current effort to address the issues along the river of Meizimera-kihihi, Kanugu district, Uganda. Recommendations were made, which included encouraging the adoption of sustainable agricultural practices, industrial processes, and waste management strategies to minimize pollution.

                Background Young people with mental disorders should be offered evidence-based treatments. In 2018, we developed a national evidence portal in Norway providing access to living evidence summaries. This work has been an important contribution to mental health care in Norway but is also a rich data source for exploring the existing research. At the time of this study, eight overviews of overviews (OoO) were published addressing the effects of treatments for attention deficit / hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder, psychosis, obsessive compulsive disorder, self-harm and trauma / post-traumatic stress disorder. The objective of this study was to do a secondary analysis of this evidence to describe the state-of-the art in this field, and to map: treatments evaluated for each diagnostic group and the longest time of follow-up treatment comparisons evaluated for more than one diagnostic group Methods We performed a mapping review. Data extraction was performed independently by two authors. All data was entered into Excel. Unique treatment comparisons were visualised in Sunburst diagrams. The longest time of follow-up and treatments evaluated across diagnostic groups were reported in descriptive tables. Results We identified 200 treatment comparisons including a wide variety of interventions. Some diagnoses are treated mostly with pharmaceutical therapies (such as bipolar disorder) or psychological therapy alone or in combination (such as anxiety and psychosis). Others are treated with a broader spectrum of therapeutic approaches (such as depression and ADHD). The evidence supporting most treatments is of low to very low certainty. Ten percent of the comparisons included follow-up assessments beyond 12 months. Cognitive behavioural therapy, dialectic behavioural therapy, physical activity and mindfulness interventions were effective across populations. Conclusions The evidence supporting treatment of mental disorders in young people has important limitations. Future research efforts should address these evidence gaps.

                The taxon Elasmobranchii (sharks and rays) contains one of the most long-established evolutionary lineages of vertebrates with a tantalizing collection of species occupying critical aquatic habitats. To overcome the current limitation in molecular resources, we launched the Squalomix Consortium in 2020 to promote a genome-wide array of molecular approaches, specifically targeting shark and ray species. Among the various bottlenecks in working with elasmobranchs are their elusiveness and low fecundity as well as the large and highly repetitive genomes. Their peculiar body fluid composition has also hindered the establishment of methods to perform routine cell culturing required for their karyotyping. In the Squalomix consortium, these obstacles are expected to be solved through a combination of in-house cytological techniques including karyotyping of cultured cells, chromatin preparation for Hi-C data acquisition, and high fidelity long-read sequencing. The resources and products obtained in this consortium, including genome and transcriptome sequences, a genome browser powered by JBrowse2 to visualize sequence alignments, and comprehensive matrices of gene expression profiles for selected species are accessible through https://github.com/Squalomix/info.

sFCD decreased widely, whereas lFCD increased in PLP patients.
Hub dysfunction in the PreCG/INS/MOG/PCUN correlated with clinical severity.
Seed-based FC showed divergent patterns: diminished intra-hub connectivity versus enhanced DLPFC-directed coupling.
Critical pathways associated with symptom severity: DLPFC-INS and DLPFC-PCUN circuits.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Phantom limb pain (PLP) is prevalent and challenging to treat in amputees, which likely stems from maladaptive cortical reorganization, but the precise mechanisms remain unclear. This study aimed to comprehensively investigate the cortical remodeling patterns in amputees experiencing PLP, pinpointing key brain regions and neural circuits directly associated with the pain. Eighteen PLP patients and 20 healthy participants were recruited for resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI). The functional connectivity density (FCD) mapping method was used to identify PLP-related abnormal local and global signaling hubs. FCD changes were observed within the sensorimotor, pain-processing, and visual stream networks in PLP patients, with the precentral gyrus (PreCG), insula (INS), precuneus (PCUN), and middle occipital gyrus (MOG) identified as key hubs correlated with the visual analog scale (VAS) pain ratings. A voxel-wise functional connectivity (FC) analysis was further performed between the VAS-correlated FCD hubs and the rest of the brain. FC was significantly decreased between the hubs and widespread brain regions. In contrast, increased FC was revealed between the hubs and subregions of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) (the dorsolateral superior frontal gyrus [SFGdor] and middle frontal gyrus [MFG]). FC of the SFGdor-INS and MFG-PCUN pathways was negatively correlated with VAS pain ratings specifically, likely playing crucial roles in PLP. These results provide novel insights into the critical neural mechanisms of PLP, highlighting valuable targets for developing long-term effective neuromodulation modalities.</p>

                Microglia–neuron interactions are essential for maintaining brain homeostasis. In a recent study, Zhao and colleagues demonstrated that activation of Gi–G-protein-coupled receptors (Gi-GPCRs) on microglia suppresses microglial process dynamics, reduces neuronal activity, and disrupts network synchronization. These findings highlight the role of microglial Gi-GPCR signaling in neuromodulation and its role in network activity in the healthy brain.

                Papanikolaou et al. show that deep-layer cortical neurons exhibit abnormally prolonged Ca2+ transients early in Alzheimer’s mouse models. This is linked to suppressed activity and altered tuning of fast-spiking parvalbumin interneurons, mediated by reduced NPTX2 and GluA4, and reversed by NPTX2 overexpression, revealing a deep-layer circuit vulnerability in early Alzheimer’s.

Their findings reveal that NSUN2 stabilizes PHGDH and SHMT2 mRNAs, promoting serine/glycine biosynthesis and cancer growth. Targeting the NSUN2/m5C axis may offer new therapeutic strategies for AML treatment.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101747">Dynamics of striatal action selection and reinforcement learning</a></h4>

              
                Spiny projection neurons (SPNs) in dorsal striatum are often proposed as a locus of reinforcement learning in the basal ganglia. Here, we identify and resolve a fundamental inconsistency between striatal reinforcement learning models and known SPN synaptic plasticity rules. Direct-pathway (dSPN) and indirect-pathway (iSPN) neurons, which promote and suppress actions, respectively, exhibit synaptic plasticity that reinforces activity associated with elevated or suppressed dopamine release. We show that iSPN plasticity prevents successful learning, as it reinforces activity patterns associated with negative outcomes. However, this pathological behavior is reversed if functionally opponent dSPNs and iSPNs, which promote and suppress the current behavior, are simultaneously activated by efferent input following action selection. This prediction is supported by striatal recordings and contrasts with prior models of SPN representations. In our model, learning and action selection signals can be multiplexed without interference, enabling learning algorithms beyond those of standard temporal difference models.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98386">VGLL2 and TEAD1 fusion proteins identified in human sarcoma drive YAP/TAZ-independent tumorigenesis by engaging EP300</a></h4>

              
                Studies on Hippo pathway regulation of tumorigenesis largely center on YAP and TAZ, the transcriptional co-regulators of TEADs. Here, we present an oncogenic mechanism involving VGLL and TEAD fusions that is Hippo pathway-related but YAP/TAZ-independent. We characterize two recurrent fusions, <i>VGLL2-NCOA2</i> and <i>TEAD1-NCOA2</i>, recently identified in human spindle cell rhabdomyosarcoma. We demonstrate that in contrast to VGLL2 and TEAD1 the fusion proteins are potent activators of TEAD-dependent transcription, and the function of these fusion proteins does not require YAP/TAZ. Furthermore, we identify that VGLL2 and TEAD1 fusions engage specific epigenetic regulation by recruiting histone acetyltransferase EP300 to control TEAD-mediated transcriptional and epigenetic landscapes. We show that small-molecule EP300 inhibition can suppress fusion protein-induced oncogenic transformation both in vitro and in vivo in mouse models. Overall, our study reveals a molecular basis for VGLL involvement in cancer and provides a framework for targeting tumors carrying <i>VGLL</i>, <i>TEAD</i>, or <i>NCOA</i> translocations.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101511">Non-feature-specific elevated responses and feature-specific backward replay in human brain induced by visual sequence exposure</a></h4>

              
                The ability of cortical circuits to adapt in response to experience is a fundamental property of the brain. After exposure to a moving dot sequence, flashing a dot as a cue at the starting point of the sequence can elicit successive elevated responses even in the absence of the sequence. These cue-triggered elevated responses have been shown to play a crucial role in predicting future events in dynamic environments. However, temporal sequences we are exposed to typically contain rich feature information. It remains unknown whether the elevated responses are feature-specific and, more crucially, how the brain organizes sequence information after exposure. To address these questions, participants were exposed to a predefined sequence of four motion directions for about 30 min, followed by the presentation of the start or end motion direction of the sequence as a cue. Surprisingly, we found that cue-triggered elevated responses were not specific to any motion direction. Interestingly, motion direction information was spontaneously reactivated, and the motion sequence was backward replayed in a time-compressed manner. These effects were observed even after brief exposure. Notably, no replay events were observed when the second or third motion direction of the sequence served as a cue. Further analyses revealed that activity in the medial temporal lobe (MTL) preceded the ripple power increase in visual cortex at the onset of replay, implying a coordinated relationship between the activities in the MTL and visual cortex. Together, these findings demonstrate that visual sequence exposure induces twofold brain plasticity that may simultaneously serve for different functional purposes. The non-feature-specific elevated responses may facilitate general processing of upcoming stimuli, whereas the feature-specific backward replay may underpin passive learning of visual sequences.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96090">Characterisation and comparison of semen microbiota and bacterial load in men with infertility, recurrent miscarriage, or proven fertility</a></h4>

              
                Several studies have associated seminal microbiota abnormalities with male infertility but have yielded differing results owing to their limited sizes or depths of analyses. The semen microbiota during recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) has not been investigated. Comprehensively assessing the seminal microbiota in men with reproductive disorders could elucidate its potential role in clinical management. We used semen analysis, terminal-deoxynucleotidyl-transferase-mediated-deoxyuridine-triphosphate-nick-end-labelling, Comet DNA fragmentation, luminol reactive oxidative species (ROS) chemiluminescence, and metataxonomic profiling of semen microbiota by 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing in this prospective, cross-sectional study to investigate composition and bacterial load of seminal bacterial genera and species, semen parameters, ROS, and sperm DNA fragmentation in men with reproductive disorders and proven fathers. 223 men were enrolled, including healthy men with proven paternity (n=63), the male partners in a couple encountering RPL (n=46), men with male factor infertility (n=58), and the male partners of couples with unexplained infertility (n=56). Rates of high sperm DNA fragmentation, elevated ROS, and oligospermia were more prevalent in the study group compared with control. In all groups, semen microbiota clustered into three major <i>genera</i>-dominant groups (1, <i>Streptococcus</i>; 2, <i>Prevotella</i>; 3, <i>Lactobacillus</i> and <i>Gardnerella</i>); no species clusters were identified. Group 2 had the highest microbial richness (p&lt;0.001), alpha-diversity (p&lt;0.001), and bacterial load (p&lt;0.0001). Overall bacterial composition or load has not been found to associate with semen analysis, ROS, or DNA fragmentation. Whilst global perturbation of the seminal microbiota is not associated with male reproductive disorders, men with unidentified seminal <i>Flavobacterium</i> are more likely to have abnormal seminal analysis. Future studies may elucidate if <i>Flavobacterium</i> reduction has therapeutic potential.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101667">Adolescent alcohol exposure promotes mechanical allodynia and alters synaptic function at inputs from the basolateral amygdala to the prelimbic cortex</a></h4>

              
                Binge drinking is common among adolescents despite mounting evidence linking it to various adverse health outcomes that include heightened pain perception. The prelimbic (PrL) cortex is vulnerable to insult from adolescent alcohol exposure and receives input from the basolateral amygdala (BLA) while sending projections to the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray (vlPAG) – two brain regions implicated in nociception. In this study, adolescent intermittent ethanol (AIE) exposure was carried out in male and female rats using a vapor inhalation procedure. Assessments of mechanical and thermal sensitivity revealed that AIE exposure-induced protracted mechanical allodynia. To investigate synaptic function at BLA inputs onto defined populations of PrL neurons, retrobeads and viral labeling were combined with optogenetics and slice electrophysiology. Recordings from retrobead labeled cells in the PrL revealed AIE reduced BLA-driven feedforward inhibition of neurons projecting from the PrL to the vlPAG, resulting in augmented excitation/inhibition (E/I) balance and increased intrinsic excitability. Consistent with this finding, recordings from virally tagged PrL parvalbumin interneurons (PVINs) demonstrated that AIE exposure reduced both E/I balance at BLA inputs onto PVINs and PVIN intrinsic excitability. These findings provide compelling evidence that AIE alters synaptic function and intrinsic excitability within a prefrontal nociceptive circuit.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/104441">HERV activation segregates ME/CFS from fibromyalgia while defining a novel nosologic entity</a></h4>

              
                Research of myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) and fibromyalgia (FM), two acquired chronic illnesses affecting mainly females, has failed to ascertain their frequent co-appearance and etiology. Despite prior detection of human endogenous retrovirus (HERV) activation in these diseases, the potential biomarker value of HERV expression profiles for their diagnosis, and the relationship of HERV expression profiles with patient immune systems and symptoms had remained unexplored. By using HERV-V3 high-density microarrays (including over 350k HERV elements and more than 1500 immune-related genes) to interrogate the transcriptomes of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from female patients diagnosed with ME/CFS, FM, or both, and matched healthy controls (<i>n</i> = 43), this study fills this gap of knowledge. Hierarchical clustering of HERV expression profiles strikingly allowed perfect participant assignment into four distinct groups: ME/CFS, FM, co-diagnosed, or healthy, pointing at a potent biomarker value of HERV expression profiles to differentiate between these hard-to-diagnose chronic syndromes. Differentially expressed HERV–immune–gene modules revealed unique profiles for each of the four study groups and highlighting decreased γδ T cells, and increased plasma and resting CD4 memory T cells, correlating with patient symptom severity in ME/CFS. Moreover, activation of HERV sequences coincided with enrichment of binding sequences targeted by transcription factors which recruit SETDB1 and TRIM28, two known epigenetic silencers of HERV, in ME/CFS, offering a mechanistic explanation for the findings. Unexpectedly, HERV expression profiles appeared minimally affected in co-diagnosed patients denoting a new nosological entity with low epigenetic impact, a seemingly relevant aspect for the diagnosis and treatment of this prevalent group of patients.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/88387">Comprehensive analysis of nasal IgA antibodies induced by intranasal administration of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein</a></h4>

              
                Intranasal vaccination is an attractive strategy for preventing COVID-19 disease as it stimulates the production of multimeric secretory immunoglobulin A (IgA), the predominant antibody isotype in the mucosal immune system, at the target site of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) entry. Currently, intranasal vaccine efficacy is evaluated based on the measurement of polyclonal antibody titers in nasal lavage fluid. However, how individual multimeric secretory IgA protects the mucosa from SARS-CoV-2 infection remains to be elucidated. To understand the precise contribution and molecular nature of multimeric secretory IgA induced by intranasal vaccines, we developed 99 monoclonal IgA clones from nasal mucosa and 114 monoclonal IgA or IgG clones from nonmucosal tissues of mice that were intranasally immunized with the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. The nonmucosal IgA clones exhibited shared origins and common and unique somatic mutations with the related nasal IgA clones, indicating that the antigen-specific plasma cells in the nonmucosal tissues originated from B cells stimulated at the nasal mucosa. Comparing the spike protein binding reactivity, angiotensin-converting enzyme-2-blocking, and in vitro SARS-CoV-2 virus neutralization of monomeric and multimeric secretory IgA pairs recognizing different epitopes showed that even non-neutralizing monomeric IgAs, which represent 70% of the nasal IgA repertoire, can protect against SARS-CoV-2 infection when expressed as multimeric secretory IgAs. We also demonstrated that the intranasal administration of multimeric secretory IgA delivered as prophylaxis in the hamster model reduced infection-induced weight loss. Our investigation is the first to demonstrate the function of nasal IgA at the monoclonal level, showing that nasal immunization can provide effective immunity against SARS-CoV-2 by inducing multimeric secretory IgAs at the target site of the virus infection.

">Consolidation of a recurrent choice pattern into a fixed action schema requires the orbitofrontal cortex</a></h4>

              
                Our actions are crystallized by repetition, warranting the efficiency, reproducibility and stability of decisions. Unlike a habit that is formally defined as insensitive to reward value, such persistency in choice can still be shaped and executed in a goal-directed manner, which underlies many volitional behaviors in animals. Yet, largely due to the absence of an established procedure that accesses non-habitual but persistent patterns of choice in animal models, empirical findings that identify its neural substrates are lacking. Using a cost-benefit conflicting decision paradigm in rodents, we here introduce an experimental procedure involving extensive decision opportunities in a fixed contingency, whereby mice acquire a recurrent pattern of choice and shape it into a fixed schema of goal-directed action to guide behavior. A subsequent functional screening of neural circuitry by chemogenetic inhibition reveals the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) as a candidate for this form of choice. Notably, we found that OFC plays a specific role in embedding the recurrent choice pattern into the fixed schema for action selection, but not in merely defining conflicting choice. Consistently, we uncover that OFC ablation leaves animals' ability intact to make a conflicting choice, but selectively disrupts the formation of the fixed action schema. These findings suggest that OFC is crucial to ensure persistency in action selection by solidifying extensive history of recurrent choices into a firmly established schema of action selection, providing novel insights into how the stability and persistency of behavior are held in the brain.

">Alignment of human behavior, brain, and AI models in the high-level valence processing of complex social scenes</a></h4>

              
                Humans can evaluate the emotional meaning of complex social scenes in real-life settings. Recent evidence from the human brain and AI models pointed to visual processing as a core substrate for representing emotional valence of natural images, but this conclusion may not generalize to complex social scenes. We implemented experiments with social scenes in which emotional valence is partially dissociated from visual characteristics, objects, and scene settings. Human behavior, neuroimaging, and visual AI models confirm that visual processing captures basic emotional associations of objects and scene elements. However, when the valence of social scenes is incongruent with these basic properties, higher levels of processing are needed in the human association cortex and AI models. Our results show how and when valence processing demands advanced cognitive, neural, and computational processes that extend beyond the encoding of visual features.

">White matter microstructure and macrostructure brain charts across the human lifespan</a></h4>

              
                Normative reference charts are widely used in healthcare, especially for assessing the development of individuals by benchmarking anatomic and physiological features against population trajectories across the lifespan. Recent work has extended this concept to gray matter morphology in the brain, but no such reference framework currently exists for white matter (WM) even though WM constitutes the essential substrate for neuronal communication and large-scale network integration. Here, we present the first comprehensive WM brain charts, which describe how microstructural and macrostructural features of WM evolve across the lifespan, by leveraging over 26,199 diffusion MRI scans from 42 harmonized studies. Using generalized additive models for location, scale, and shape (GAMLSS), we estimate age- and sex-stratified trajectories for 72 individual white matter pathways, quantifying both tract-specific microstructural and morphometric features. We demonstrate that these WM brain charts enable four important applications: (1) defining normative trajectories of WM maturation and decline across distinct pathways, (2) identifying previously uncharacterized developmental milestones and spatial gradients of tract maturation, (3) detecting individualized deviations from normative patterns with clinical relevance across multiple neurological disorders, and (4) facilitating standardized, cross-study centile scoring of new datasets. By establishing a unified, interpretable reference framework for WM structure, these brain charts provide a foundational metric for research and clinical neuroscience. The accompanying open-access trajectories, centile scoring tools, and harmonization methods facilitate precise mapping of WM development, aging, and pathology across diverse populations. We release the brain charts and provide an out-of-sample alignment process as a Docker image: https://zenodo.org/records/15367426.

">Sex-specific behavioral feedback modulates sensorimotor processing and drives flexible social behavior</a></h4>

              
                How the brain enables individuals to adapt behavior to their partner is key to understanding social exchange. For example, courtship behavior involves sensorimotor processing of signals by prospective partners that can result in behavioral dialogue, such as stereotyped movements and singing. The courtship behavior of Drosophila melanogaster males with their partners, which are usually female but can also be male, involves singing. To investigate how behavioral feedback and sensorimotor processing contribute to flexible social interactions, we compared the courtship behavior and singing of male D. melanogaster towards males and females. Quantitative analysis of their interactions revealed that while underlying courtship and song rules are unaffected by the sex of the partner, the behavioral dynamics and song sequences differ by partner sex. This divergence stems from sex-specific behavioral feedback: females decelerate to song, while males orient towards the singer. Moreover, optogenetic manipulations reveal that the partners responses are driven by a specific neural circuit that links song detection with arousal and social decisions. Our findings demonstrate that flexible social behaviors can arise from fixed sensorimotor rules through a context-dependent selection facilitated by the partners behavioral feedback. More broadly, our results reveal compositionality as a key mechanism for achieving behavioral flexibility during complex social interactions such as courtship.

">Dynamics of oscillatory power subtends multiplexing of perceptual and mnemonic information within the premotor cortex</a></h4>

              
                Flexible behaviour requires decision-making that integrates both perceptual and mnemonic-related information. While the dorsal premotor cortex (PMd) is known to support decision-making based on perceptual computations, its contributions to decisions based on mnemonic information for motor planning are underexplored. Here, investigating local field potential (LFP) oscillations in PMd of monkeys performing a transitive inference task required the formation and retrieval of mnemonic representations of an arbitrarily defined rank order among perceptual items. Our results highlight that a dynamic interplay between lower frequencies (Theta, Alpha, Beta) and high-Gamma oscillatory activity of LFP reflects a mechanism for accessing and manipulating memory-related information underlying decision-making. These findings provide evidence that the PMd plays a role in multiplexing both perceptual and mnemonic information, extending its competence beyond the association of perceptual input with motor decisions.

">PTEN regulates starburst amacrine cell dendrite morphology during development</a></h4>

              
                Neurons are subject to extensive developmental regulation to ensure precise subtype-specific morphologies that are intimately tied to their function. Starburst amacrine cells (SACs) in the mammalian retina have a highly stereotyped, radially symmetric dendritic arbor that is essential for their role in direction-selective circuits in the retina. We show that PTEN, the primary negative regulator of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway that is highly implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders, regulates SAC morphology in a cell-autonomous manner. Pten-deficient SACs show a nearly twofold increase in the number of dendritic branches, while other morphological properties remain largely unchanged. These morphological changes arise late in SAC development after dendrite development is largely complete and persist into adulthood. Mechanistically, excessive dendritic branching appears to arise from dysregulated mTOR activity. Despite this dramatic increase in dendritic branches, Pten-deficient SACs maintain a normal population number, organization of synaptic outputs, and intact direction-selectivity in the retina. Collectively, these results show that PTEN is essential for the normal development of highly stereotyped neuronal morphology.

">Integrated Classification of Cortical Cells and Quantitative Projectomic Mapping Unveil Organizational Principles of Brain-Wide Connectomes at Single Cell Level</a></h4>

              
                Molecularly defined cortical cell types have recently been linked to whole neuronal morphology (WNM), particularly those characterized by whole-brain-wide projections, such as intratelencephalic (IT), extratelencephalic (ET), and corticothalamic (CT) neurons. In contrast, classical morphological classifications (e.g., tufted TPC, small tufted SPC, and stellate SSC) are based primarily on local dendrosomatic and axonal structures, especially apical dendrites. This study bridges these perspectives by establishing a new neuronal taxonomy, analyzing the connectomes of defined cortical cell types, and comparing them with those obtained from bulk anterograde injections. Neurons were sparsely labeled via tamoxifen-inducible Cre lines with GFP reporters, and 1,419 WNM cells were comprehensively reconstructed with Vaa3D-TeraVR from ~15 areas across six functional regions of molecularly labeled brains imaged with 2p-fMOST. These cells were newly classified by integrating current molecular-WNM and classical morphological perspectives, with sample size augmented by 1,455 publicly available WNM cells reconstructed from the Mouse-Light project and CEBSIT. This effort defined ten combined molecular-WNM-classical morphological cell types: L5ET_TPC, L6CT_NPC, L6b_HPC, and seven IT types including L2/3IT_TPC, L4IT_SSC, L4IT_UPC, L4IT_TPC, L5IT_SPC, L6IT_IPC, and L6IT_car3PC. Clustering, quantitative analyses and random Forest classifier objectively validated these types and revealed their distinct connectomes, along with convergent, topographic, and hierarchical organizations across their projection brain regions. At the single-cell level, multiple organizational principles governing cortico-cortical (C-C) and cortico-subcortical (C-subC) connectomes emerged with unprecedented detail, offering a precise GPS-like tool for in vivo recordings and robust datasets for neuronal network modeling. Comparisons with bulk anterograde injection data underscored the limitations of traditional methods in identifying projection targets. Overall, our approach provides significant insights into cortical circuitry and elucidates the complex interplay between neuronal molecular identity, whole morphology, and classical morphological classification.

">FGA139, a Novel Cysteine Protease Inhibitor, Exhibits Anti-Inflammatory and Neuroprotective Activity and Reveals Microglial Modulation via Multi-Omics Profiling</a></h4>

              
                Neuroinflammation is a key driver in the progression of numerous brain disorders, with cysteine proteases such as calpains, caspases, and cathepsins playing central roles in inflammatory signaling. This study investigates FGA139, a novel irreversible inhibitor targeting cysteine proteases. We evaluated the anti-inflammatory properties of FGA139 in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated macrophages (RAW264.7) and microglia (HMC3). In addition, its neuroprotective effects were assessed in differentiated SH-SY5Y neuron-like cells exposed to conditioned media (CM+) derived from the activated immune cells. FGA139 exhibited a favorable safety profile and robust anti-inflammatory activity, significantly reducing nitric oxide (NO) production in macrophages and TNF levels in microglia. Conditioned media from both LPS-stimulated immune cells lines (CM+) reduced neurite length in neuronal cells. However, CM+; from HMC3 cells impaired neuronal viability, whereas CM+; from RAW264.7 cells elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) and NO levels, indicating distinct neurotoxic signatures. Preincubation of neuron-like cells with FGA139 effectively mitigated most of these adverse effects. Metabolomic analysis of the activated microglia supernatant revealed that FGA139 increased extracellular levels of neuroprotective metabolites, including purines, linoleic acid, and phenyllactic acid. Proteomic data confirmed that FGA139 attenuated M1-like microglial polarization, likely through modulation of pathways associated with zinc transport and vesicle trafficking. In conclusion, FGA139 demonstrates potent neuroprotective effects and modulates microglial activation. These findings uncover novel mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of cysteine protease inhibition and support the therapeutic potential of FGA139 in treating neuroinflammatory conditions, positioning it as a promising modulator of microglial function.

">Dual-Resonance Shapes REM Sleep: A Mechanistic Link Between Homeostasis, Circadian Phase, and Sleep Deficit.</a></h4>

              
                How circadian and homeostatic processes interact to shape REM sleep architecture remains unresolved. Here, we empirically confirm the existence of a conserved resonance curve governing REM episode duration, as previously predicted by the wave model of sleep dynamics. This curve emerges from two converging resonance states - homeostatic and circadian - that form a stable framework across conditions. Their relative phase and amplitude determine REM structure, producing bell-shaped, linear, or bimodal profiles. The model reproduces REM dynamics during regular sleep, extension, and post-deprivation recovery. Crucially, REM duration alone provides an experimentally accessible readout: simultaneously revealing circadian phase and quantifying sleep deficit as additional hours needed to restore homeostatic equilibrium. Together, these findings reposition REM duration from a descriptive marker to a mechanistic signal, linking sleep architecture to the dynamic interplay of internal regulatory systems.

">A structure-guided antibody detects SOD1 oligomers in diverse ALS genotypes.</a></h4>

              
                Antibodies offer versatility as diagnostic and therapeutic tools to target specific protein epitopes. However, the transient nature of intermediate protein conformations, such as that of amyloid oligomers, poses a challenge for antibody development. We use a structure-guided approach to generate a monoclonal antibody against oligomers of Superoxide Dismutase 1 (SOD1). Mutations in SOD1 are linked to a subset of familial Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (fALS), a fatal neurodegenerative disease. Based on the corkscrew-like features of non-native SOD1 oligomers previously determined, we generate an antibody specific to SOD1 oligomers. We show that the antibody, CSAb detects SOD1 oligomers, not fibrils or native SOD1, and alleviates the cytotoxic effects of SOD1 oligomers in a cell culture model of primary motor neurons. Immunohistochemical analyses of human ALS subjects show CSAb reactivity in both neuronal and non-neuronal cells. Finally, we provide evidence that CSAb reactive SOD1 oligomers are present in non-SOD1 linked fALS and sporadic ALS subjects. Together, our study provides a new probe against SOD1 oligomers and suggests that cytotoxic SOD1 oligomers are prevalent in diverse ALS genotypes.

">C57 and DBA mouse strains express distinct cocaine avoidance phenotypes in an operant runway independent of differences in striatal dynorphin-enkephalin balance</a></h4>

              
                Rationale: Human self-report data and rodent models indicate cocaine can induce negative affect, which may impact future cocaine use severity. Despite this, understanding of the neurobiology driving cocaine avoidance is limited. Within the striatum, the opioid peptides enkephalin and dynorphin are associated with cocaine reward and aversion, respectively. Additionally, striatal dynorphin signaling resulting from stress or cocaine withdrawal acts as a negative reinforcer to increase cocaine seeking. Objectives: We validated the use of the cocaine self-administration runway in mice to measure the development of cocaine avoidance and tested whether mice with higher relative striatal dynorphin-to-enkephalin expression are resistant to developing cocaine avoidance. Methods: Cocaine avoidance in the self-administration runway was measured in two inbred mouse strains, C57BL/6J and DBA/2J, known to have opposite striatal dynorphin/enkephalin milieus, and in mice lacking enkephalin selectively from striatal medium spiny neurons (D2-PenkKO). Results: Both inbred strains developed cocaine avoidance, though they expressed it differently. Across training, DBA/2J mice increased their latency to self-administer cocaine, and C57BL/6J increased the number of retreats away from the cocaine-paired goal box. D2-PenkKOs developed similar cocaine avoidance compared to littermate controls. Conclusions: Mice develop avoidance to self-administer cocaine in the runway across a range of strains. Pre-existing strain differences in the striatal dynorphin/enkephalin milieu, however, do not appear to alter the development of cocaine avoidance, and striatal enkephalin is not necessary for the development of cocaine avoidance. This suggests higher relative striatal dynorphin does not facilitate cocaine seeking by mitigating cocaine avoidance.

">Transient Suppression of Dopamine Transporter Palmitoylation by Methamphetamine: Implications for Transport Regulation</a></h4>

              
                The dopamine transporter (DAT) exerts temporal and spatial control over dopaminergic neurotransmission through reuptake of extracellular dopamine (DA). The functional capacity of DAT is under the control of signaling inputs and post-translational modifications that confer acute presynaptic regulation of reuptake in response to physiological needs, and dysregulation of these processes may contribute to DA imbalances in mood disorders and drug addiction. A key modification of DAT is palmitoylation, a lipid adduction that enhances transport velocity, is suppressed by protein kinase C, and opposes protein kinase C-mediated down-regulation. Here we now show in rat striatum and heterologous cells that transporter palmitoylation is also linked to methamphetamine (METH), undergoing rapid and transient reductions in response to the drug. The time course and other characteristics of palmitoylation reduction parallel those of METH-induced transport down-regulation, and a palmitoylation-deficient DAT mutant shows enhanced down-regulation to METH, supporting a mechanistic link between reduction of the modification and reduced reuptake activity. Recovery rates differed, however, with palmitoylation returning to starting levels more rapidly than reuptake, indicating that down-regulation mechanisms remain engaged with transporters that have undergone repalmitoylation. These results support palmitoylation as a rapid response mechanism that modulates DAT entry into METH-induced down-regulation states and suggest a broader role for the modification in control of reuptake in additional physiological and pathophysiological conditions.

">A spatial code governs olfactory receptor choice and aligns sensory maps in the nose and brain</a></h4>

              
                Although topographical maps organize many peripheral sensory systems, it remains unclear whether olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) choose which of the ~1100 odor receptors (ORs) to express based upon their spatial location in the olfactory epithelium (OE) or instead ORs are scattered randomly. Here we reveal that each OR is expressed at a precise mean position along the OE dorsoventral axis, thereby instantiating a receptor map. This patterning reflects the differential use, by precursors and mature OSNs, of a coherent gene expression program controlled by a spatially-varying retinoic acid gradient; this program -- which includes key transcription factors and axon guidance genes -- translates position into a spatially appropriate distribution of OR choices and aligns the epithelial map of OR identity with the glomerular map present in the olfactory bulb. These results identify a transcriptional code that distinguishes and spatially organizes the vast array of sensory channels that comprise the olfactory system.

">Age differences in motivation drive performance during the sustained attention to response task</a></h4>

              
                Young and older adults prioritise speed and accuracy differently during sustained attention tasks. While older adults generally show a preference of accuracy over speed, this is not always the case. The underlying factor behind this inconsistency may be motivational differences, with older participants compensating for a speed disadvantage with increased intrinsic motivation to perform well. We investigated this in a pre-registered study, using the Sustained aAttention to Response Task (SART) in young (n = 25, mean age = 19) and older adults (n = 25, mean age = 69.5). We matched participant accuracy by titrating response window length. Both groups achieved similar performance and strategy during the titration, enabling a comparison without confounds resulting from differences in default age-specific strategies. All participants were then monetarily encouraged to perform better in terms of accuracy. Both groups responded with an adaptive strategy of slowed reaction times and enhanced accuracy, but the young participants improved much more, outperforming older adults, and reversing the speed-accuracy strategies that are typically observed. In addition, older participants reported higher baseline levels of motivation alongside a reduced motivation to alter performance for money. So, while the older participants could match young participant performance in titration due to their higher baseline motivational levels, the young participants improved much more than older adults in response to the monetary incentive. From these findings we argue that older adults are intrinsically motivated to do well on tasks whereas younger age groups perform optimally only after incentivisation.

">A joint probabilistic model of human scene and object recognition via non-hierarchical residual computation</a></h4>

              
                Visual object and scene recognition have been extensively studied, but separately.  We here propose that the two processes could be intrinsically linked in the neural system. We developed a Joint Residual Variational Autoencoder (JRVAE) with two networks: VAE1 for coarse scene recognition and VAE2 for object recognition using residuals from VAE1's reconstructions. Our model demonstrates emergent functional specialization when conditioned on information reduction in peripheral vision, with quantitative analysis confirming VAE1 excels at the representation of scenes while VAE2 specializes in that of objects. This architecture naturally implements figure-ground segmentation and aligns with neurobiological evidence of distinct cortical pathways. Our findings suggest residual computation enables joint visual processing that mirrors human perception's coarse-to-fine principle in perception.

">Short-Term Exposure to Polystyrene Microplastics Alters Cognition, Immune, and Metabolic Markers in an APOE Genotype and Sex-Dependent Manner</a></h4>

              
                Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorders and one of the leading causes of death in individuals over the age of 65. Most cases of AD develop sporadically, however, there are several risk factors that have been identified which significantly increases an individual's risk for developing AD. The most prominent of these is Apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4), which can potentially result in an up to 10-fold greater risk of developing AD. The presence of APOE4 alone, however, cannot be solely responsible for AD as the disease may occur even in the absence of APOE4. Therefore, there must be other contributing factors such as exposure to environmental toxins including heavy metals and pesticides, which have independently been shown to contribute to AD. Nano- and microplastics (NMPs) are plastic particles less than 1 micrometers and 5 millimeters in size, respectively, and have only recently been identified as a major environmental pollutant with serious health concerns. Given the adverse health effects that are increasingly being associated with NMPs exposure, we sought to understand how the combination of APOE4 and NMPs exposure may work synergistically to promote cognitive dysfunction and alter key regulatory pathways to impact overall health. Following an acute (3 week) exposure to pristine spherical fluorescently-labeled 0.1 and 2 micrometer polystyrene (PS) NMPs, we found significant sex-dependent alterations in locomotor and recognition memory in APOE4 mice, but not in APOE3 controls. We additionally found that exposure to PS-NMPs resulted in sex and genotype specific alterations in astrocytic and microglial markers in the brain, and in CYP1A1, a major metabolizer of environmental polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, in the liver. These results suggest PS-NMPs may interact with the APOE4 allele to promote cognitive dysfunction and alter immune and metabolic pathways which may contribute to disease-like states.

">Correlates of head-fixed orienting movements in mouse superior colliculus and substantia nigra pars reticulata</a></h4>

              
                Orienting movements are a critical component of the natural behavioral repertoire, but their underlying neural bases are not well understood. The deep superior colliculus (dSC) integrates input from several brain regions that influence the selection of targets for orienting movements and coordinates activity among brainstem motor nuclei to initiate and execute movement. Evidence suggests that one prominent dSC input, the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr), permits movement by disinhibiting its targets, but much is unknown about the relationship between SNr activity, dSC activity, and movement. Building on increasing application of the head-fixed mouse model to elucidate the neural basis of behavior, we examined neural activity recorded in dSC and SNr with high-density probes in mice performing several variants of a sensorimotor orienting task, from our labs and in data sets curated by the International Brain Laboratory. We found that dSC and SNr were active preceding and throughout movement, across task variants, suggesting that they were engaged by the required movements. Prior to movement, SNr activity reflected the outcome of the previous trial, consistent with a role in biasing movements towards the highest value target. However, the dependence of dSC activity on movement direction was weaker than in other directional orienting behaviors, and we found little evidence for strong suppression of dSC by SNr. These results complement and extend previous findings from other orienting tasks and suggest diverse roles for modulatory input from SNr to dSC in shaping motor behavior.

">Individualized AI-driven neuromodulation enhances tongue motor and sensory control: preliminary efficacy targeted towards the alleviation of chronic cranial neuropathies</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: Adequate sensory inputs and motor control are essential components of safe swallowing, with significant impact on both quality of life and patient survival. Conversely, both of these neuronal activities are negatively impacted during the early phases of ALS development, following instrumentation of the cervical spine through an anterior approach and broadly by delivery of surgical and radiation-based treatments for head and neck cancer. Our goal is to demonstrate the feasibility, and preliminary efficacy of the individualized fMRI neuromodulation (iNM) intervention pioneered by the Papageorgiou Lab (U.S. Patent No.16/954,256; European Patent No. 19 753 851.5) in enhancing tongue motor and sensory control (TMSC) in these variable patient populations. Although clinical trials show that steroids (NCT04151082) and gabapentin (NCT03747562) temporarily reduce pain, their adverse effects compromise tolerance and adherence. Thus, we need new treatments. The goal here was to strengthen networks that regulate TMSC through our individualized fMRI AI-NeuroModulation, termed iNM fMRI measures the magnitude and spatial extent of the ratio of oxygenated (O2) to deoxygenated hemoglobin (Hb). Our non-invasive, precision-medicine AI-iNM intervention: (1) target primary motor and sensory areas in the brain that regulate swallowing with 1mm level precision, (2) targets each patient's unique anatomical motor and sensory extents , and (3) iNM is and are guided by reinforcing or inhibiting the HbO2 intensity and extent of each patient's unique brain network, as opposed to self-regulation of the HbO2 intensity. Methods: Thirty healthy subjects participated in a 2-day study which included iNM and control conditions. We first computed the individualized TMSC cortical selectivity to be targeted in the iNM condition. Support vector machine (SVM) classified cortical tongue direction and tongue-at-rest patterns generated via iNM and control. We quantified the BOLD magnitude for each network by computing the area under the curve (AUC), variance and association between brain states and TMSC responses via dynamic causal modeling (DCM). Results: The mechanisms associated with attention-memory and sensorimotor iNM are: 1. 45% increase in the AUC's BOLD magnitude (p<0.001); 2. 14% decrease in the BOLD's intensity variance (p<0.01); and 3. 20% increase in network expansion (p<0.001). DCM uncovered 97% of the trials as pure motor signal, while 3% were noise in the iNM condition (compared to 83% of the TMSC trials and 17% noise in the control condition): 1. 70% motor-to-motor (M1, motor cerebellum, basal ganglia) and 70% motor-to-sensory; 2. 69% sensory-to-sensory (intraparietal lobule, insula, claustrum, sensory cerebellum, ACC); and 3. 70% sensorimotor-to-attention-memory network connectivities. Conclusion: iNM showed spatiotemporal causality between networks that regulate motor and sensory control, which can serve as clinical biomarkers for the RICN alleviation in head and neck cancer survivors.

">FLP-15 functions through the GPCR NPR-3 to regulate local and global search behaviours in Caenorhabditis elegans</a></h4>

              
                Foraging is essential for sustenance and well-being of all organisms. The transition from well-fed to food-deprived conditions in C. elegans triggers a localized exploration of the environment characterized by frequent reorientations. However, over time the cumulative frequency of these reorientations decreases, facilitating the transition to global search behaviour. To investigate the genetic regulation of foraging in C. elegans, we conducted a screen of neuropeptide mutants and identified several candidates involved in modulating this behaviour. Among these, neuropeptide FLP-15 emerged as a key regulator of both local and global search behaviours. Our observations revealed that FLP-15 regulates the frequency and duration of reversals during foraging. Further investigation indicated that FLP-15 is expressed in and functions through the I2 pharyngeal neuron via the G-protein coupled receptor NPR-3. Mutants lacking either flp-15 or npr-3 displayed a significant decrease in reversal frequency during local search behaviours. Interestingly, unlike wild-type animals, the reversal frequency in flp-15 and npr-3 mutants did not decrease over time. This study also describes the expression pattern of NPR-3, in a subset of head neurons, predominantly comprising of dopaminergic neurons. This expression pattern highlights a potential link between neuropeptide signalling and dopaminergic modulation of behaviour. Finally, exogenous dopamine supplementation assays revealed that FLP-15 may regulate foraging by modulating dopamine transmission, highlighting a novel neuropeptide-dopamine interaction involved in the control of foraging behaviours.

">iCSD can produce spurious results in dense electrode arrays</a></h4>

              
                Estimation of the current source density (CSD) is a commonly-used method to interpret local field potential (LFP) signals by estimating the location of the neural sinks and sources of current that give rise to the LFP. We show analytically that, when the inter-electrode spacing is small relative to the width of the current distribution, commonly used methods to estimate the CSD produces spurious results, calculating true sources as sinks and vice versa. By simulating a biologically-detailed subvolume of the rat somatosensory cortex with over 200,000 biophysically-detailed neurons, we show that, for high-density recording electrodes, the estimated CSD diverges from expected results, necessitating awareness and careful interpretation of CSD results.

">Repositioning of polyubiquitin alters the pathologic tau filament structure</a></h4>

              
                Structurally diverse tau filaments form proteinaceous aggregates in a heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative diseases called tauopathies1. The factors extrinsic to the highly ordered core structure that influence tau filament stability are not well understood. Here, we found that polyubiquitinated tau filaments from Alzheimer's disease and vacuolar tauopathy human brain tissue exhibit distinct seeding patterns in mice, in association with differences in tau filament ultrastructure determined by cryo-electron microscopy. Interestingly, chemical modulation of the polarity of polyubiquitin adjacent to the tau core with the small molecule ubistatin B resulted in the repositioning of poorly structured densities towards positively charged residues on the highly structured core filament, leading to shifting of the protofilament-protofilament interface of certain vacuolar tauopathy tau filaments. These results suggest that the structure of tau filaments that are associated with different seeding activities in vivo can be influenced by post-translational modifications.

">Seizure-induced Transient Disruptive Changes in Brain Microstructure</a></h4>

              
                A leading hypothesis for the mechanisms of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) posits an initial disruptive effect followed by enhanced neuroplasticity. However, direct evidence of the presumed early disruptive changes, potentially driven by seizures, remains limited. This study examined longitudinal changes in multishell diffusion MRI-derived metrics in 25 individuals with depression, with scans acquired two hours before and after their first ECT session. Follow-up scans were collected within 14 days and 6 months after the last ECT session. To control for potential confounding effects of anesthesia and repeated measurements, two additional groups were included: 16 individuals undergoing short-acting anesthesia and 16 healthy controls without interventions. A multicompartment model was applied to explore extracellular free water and microstructures in the intracellular/extracellular compartments. Whole-brain voxel-wise analyses identified a pattern consistent with vasogenic edema (e.g., increased extracellular free water) in widespread bilateral brain regions following a single ECT session. Increases in brain tissue free water were significantly correlated with electrical stimulus charge (r=0.51, p=0.01) but not with post-ictal reorientation time (r=0.11, p=0.92). These changes were not observed in either control group. Follow-up assessments confirmed that the alterations in tissue free water resolved within 14 days. A single ECT-induced seizure induces transient, reversible changes consistent with vasogenic edema, rather than irreversible cellular injury typically associated with cytotoxic edema. These reversible changes may represent an initial disruptive phase that facilitates subsequent adaptive brain responses, including neuroplasticity and network reorganization underlying the therapeutic effects of ECT.

">Repetitive Neuronal Activation Regulates Cellular Maturation State via Nuclear Reprogramming</a></h4>

              
                Neural stimulation, such as electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), are highly effective clinical interventions for a broad spectrum of psychiatric disorders, including depression and schizophrenia. However, their mechanism of action at the cellular level remains poorly understood. Here, we modelled ECT with repeated optogenetic neuronal stimulation in the mouse dentate gyrus, and observed ECT-like behavioral effects, including decreased depression-like behavior and increased locomotor activity. At the cellular level, we found dematuration to a long-term stable state, persisting for more than one month, defined by changes in nuclear structure, gene expression patterns resembling the G2/M phase of the cell cycle, and altered neural coding of navigational information. Moreover, knockout of the G2/M master regulator Cyclin B rescued some of behavioral and cellular effects. These findings demonstrate that ECT-like brain stimulation triggers plasticity of the cellular state, revealing a form of stimulus-regulated nuclear reprogramming with potential clinical utility.

">Modeling human retinal ganglion cell axonal outgrowth, development, and pathology using pluripotent stem cell-based microfluidic platforms</a></h4>

              
                Retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) are highly compartmentalized cells, with long axons serving as the sole connection between the eye and the brain. RGC degeneration in injury and/or disease also occurs in a compartmentalized manner, with distinct injury responses in axonal and somatodendritic compartments. Thus, the goal of this study was to establish a novel microfluidic-based platform for the analysis of RGC compartmentalization in health and disease states. Human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived RGCs were seeded into microfluidics, enabling the recruitment and isolation of axons apart from the somatodendritic compartment. Initial studies explored axonal outgrowth and compartmentalization of axons and dendrites. We then compared the differential response of RGCs differentiated from hPSCs carrying the OPTN(E50K) glaucoma mutation with isogenic control RGCs in their respective axonal and somatodendritic compartments, followed by analysis of axonal transport. Further, we explored the axonal transcriptome via RNA-seq, focusing on disease-related axonal differences. Finally, we established models to uniquely orient astrocytes along the axonal compartment combined with modulation of astrocyte reactivity as a pathological feature of neurodegeneration. Overall, RGC culture within microfluidic chips allowed enhanced cell growth and maturation, including long-distance axonal projections and proper compartmentalization, while patient-specific RGCs exhibited axonal outgrowth deficits as well as decreased rate of axonal transport. Finally, the induction of astrocyte reactivity uniquely along the proximal region of RGC axons led to the onset of neurodegenerative phenotypes in RGCs. These results represent the first study to effectively recapitulate the highly compartmentalized properties of hPSC-derived RGCs in healthy and disease states, providing a more physiologically relevant in vitro model for neuronal development and degeneration.

Mackey et al. critique the tool, questioning its advantage over classic current source density (CSD) analysis, and reason backwards to challenge the motif's ubiquity. In our rebuttal, we confirm the spectrolaminar motif in diverse cortical areas using data from multiple research groups (who joined us in this rebuttal) as well as in the dataset provided by Mackey et al. Additionally, we introduce vFLIP2, an improved version of our tool that addresses their comments. It reliably identified and localized the motif in our data and in the dataset of Mackey et al. Our findings reaffirm the motif's ubiquity. We value the comments of Mackey et al., which helped refine our tool.

">Neural rhythms as priors of speech computations</a></h4>

              
                The transformation of continuous speech into discrete linguistic representations forms the basis of speech recognition. Natural speech encodes cues at distinct timescales. Phonetic features have modulation frequencies of 30-50 Hz, syllables and words around 4-7 Hz, and phrases 1-2 Hz. Strikingly, these frequencies mirror frequencies of endogenous network rhythms of the brain and synaptic time constants of the underlying neural circuits. Here, we suggest that endogenous brain rhythms serve as priors for speech recognition, encoding knowledge of speech structure in the dynamics of network computations. In a network of coupled oscillators, we find that speech is readily identified when characteristic frequencies of the oscillators match frequencies of circuit rhythms in the brain. When signal and circuit rhythms are mismatched, speech identification is impaired. Compared to a baseline recurrent neural network without intrinsic oscillations, the coupled oscillatory network has significantly higher performance in speech recognition across languages, but not in the recognition of signals that lack speech-like structure, such as urban sounds. Our results suggest a central computational role of brain rhythms in speech processing.

">A hierarchical cascade of sleep rhythms drive memory consolidation in humans and are disrupted in epilepsy.</a></h4>

              
                The cross-regional interplay of slow oscillations, sleep spindles, and ripples during sleep is believed to support systems memory consolidation but is understudied in humans. Using a validated behavioral task and intracranial neural recordings from orbitofrontal cortex, thalamus, and hippocampus in 19 epilepsy patients, we examined the cross-regional interplay of sleep-oscillations and their role in memory consolidation. Orbitofrontal slow oscillations robustly modulate sleep rhythms both within and across regions. Most combinations of oscillation rates predict overnight memory consolidation, but hippocampal ripple rate and coupled hippocampal-orbitofrontal ripples were the strongest positive predictors of memory consolidation. In contrast, epileptic spikes coupled to sleep oscillations strongly predicted reduced memory consolidation, with the strongest negative effect observed when epileptic spikes were coupled to slow oscillations. These findings provide direct evidence of the hierarchical cascade of sleep oscillations in human memory processing and reveal how epileptic spikes disrupt this process in patients with epilepsy.

">Modeling Dyslexia in Neurotypical Adults by Combining Neuroimaging and Neuromodulation Techniques: A Hypothesis Paper</a></h4>

              
                Dyslexia is a prevalent developmental disorder marked by deficits in literacy skills. Given that the core deficits of dyslexia are uniquely human, animal models have not been as useful in dyslexia research as they have been in other areas of research. While significant progress has been made through behavioral and neuroimaging studies, a viable model could facilitate controlled investigations into the neural mechanisms underlying dyslexia and accelerate the development of targeted interventions. In this hypothesis article, we propose a two-pronged approach to model dyslexia in neurotypical adults using neuroimaging and neuromodulation techniques. First, we propose using functional and structural MRI data to cluster individuals into neuropathologically derived subgroups in order to facilitate the classification of dyslexia subtypes based on neuropathological characteristics. Second, we propose employing transcranial temporal interference stimulation (tTIS) to temporarily downregulate activity in brain regions specified in the clustering analysis, inducing subtype-specific dyslexic symptoms in neurotypical individuals. This approach enables the establishment of causal or probabilistic relationships between neuropathologies and dyslexia subtypes, while at the same time creating dyslexia models to facilitate investigation into subtype-specific interventions. By integrating neuroimaging and neuromodulation, we hope to offer a viable substitute for animal models in dyslexia and accelerate the development of personalized therapeutic strategies for dyslexia.

">Transcriptome-informed brain cartography of polygenic risk and association with brain structure in major psychiatric disorders</a></h4>

              
                Psychiatric disorders are complex, polygenic conditions characterized by patterned structural brain alterations. Whether these changes reflect transcriptional dysregulation driven by genetic risk remains unclear. We introduce a novel imaging-transcriptomics framework that integrates transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) with brain transcriptomic atlases to predict macroscale structural brain abnormalities across seven disorders: ADHD, ASD, AN, BD, MDD, OCD, and schizophrenia (SCZ). We generated disorder-specific Gene Expression-based Disorder Associated Risk (GEDAR) maps and assessed their spatial correlation with observed brain alterations thereby establishing a structured approach to map polygenic transcriptional risk onto macroscale brain phenotypes. We found significant transcriptomic-anatomical correlations in MDD (cortical and subcortical), SCZ (subcortical), and ADHD (subcortical), indicating that regional transcriptional vulnerability might contribute to varying extents to the anatomical expression of genetic risk in these disorders. Pathway enrichment analysis on genetically predicted differentially expressed genes for those disorders where we found spatial correlations between GEDAR maps and observed structural changes revealed immune-related processes as dominant in MDD and SCZ, and neurodevelopmental pathways in ADHD. ASD, AN, OCD, and cortical SCZ lacked significant associations. Importantly, spatial transcriptomic-anatomical alignment did not scale with between-disorder differences in heritability, pointing instead toward additional influences like developmental timing or environmental interactions. These findings underscore the potential and limitations of imaging transcriptomics as a framework for bridging the gap between genetic architecture and systems-level brain changes in psychiatric disorders.

">Nutritional Ketosis Attenuates Sucrose Bingeing-Induced Behavioral Deficits by Improving Synaptic Plasticity and Anti-Inflammatory Signalling in the Prefrontal Cortex of Male and Female Mice</a></h4>

              
                Binge eating, one of the defining characteristics of binge eating disorder, has been linked to poor health span. Animals, like humans, selectively binge on highly palatable foods, implying that the binge-like behavior is motivated by hedonic rather than metabolic signals. Given the association between reward processing and food intake, this study explored sex-specific underlying biological mechanisms, including synaptic, neuroimmune and neurometabolic correlates of binge-like sucrose drinking, compulsivity and anxiety-like behaviors, utilizing a preclinical model of hedonic sucrose drinking. Throughout the experiment, male and female mice binged on a sweet solution when given food ad libitum with free access and a choice between water and a 10% (w/v) sucrose solution, with females consuming more sucrose. The sucrose intake was positively correlated with transcription of genes for dopamine receptors (Drd1, Drd2) in the PFC of male and female mice. Sucrose-bingeing increased PFC neuroinflammation, concomitantly increasing region-specific blood-brain barrier permeability in males. Sucrose bingeing elevated the transcription of glucose metabolism genes (Slc2a3, Glo1) while inhibiting ketone oxidation pathway genes (Slc16a1, Oxct1, Acat1) in the PFC of males and females. Nutritional ketosis attenuated sucrose bingeing, compulsivity and anxiety-like behaviors in sucrose-dependent male and female mice by suppressing the transcription of reward-related genes (Drd1, Drd2) while promoting an anti-inflammatory neuroimmune microenvironment in the PFC of male and female mice in a sex-dependent manner. Overall, this study identified synaptic, neuroimmune and neurometabolic mechanisms as novel druggable targets and nutritional ketosis as a potential therapy for diseases where binge-like eating, compulsivity and anxiety-like behaviors are the main symptoms, such as binge eating disorder.

                <p>The event-related potential/field component N400(m) is a widely accepted neural index for semantic prediction. Top-down input from inferior frontal areas to perceptual brain regions is hypothesized to play a key role in generating the N400, but testing this has been challenging due to limitations of causal connectivity estimation. We here provide new evidence for a predictive model of speech comprehension in which IFG activity feeds back to shape subsequent activity in STG/MTG. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) data was obtained from 21 participants (10 men, 11 women) during a classic N400 paradigm where the semantic predictability of a fixed target noun was manipulated in simple German sentences through the preceding verb. To estimate causality, we implemented a novel approach, based on machine learning and temporal generalization, to test the effect of inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) on temporal regions. A support vector machine (SVM) classifier was trained on IFG activity to classify less predicted (LP) and highly predicted (HP) nouns and tested on superior/middle temporal gyri (STG/MTG) activity, time-point by time-point. The reverse procedure was then performed to establish spatiotemporal evidence for or against causality. Significant decoding results were found in our bottom-up model, which were trained at hierarchically lower level areas (STG/MTG) and tested at the hierarchically higher IFG areas. Most interestingly, decoding accuracy also significantly exceeded chance level when the classifier was trained on IFG activity and tested on successive activity in STG/MTG. Our findings indicate dynamic top-down and bottom-up flow of information between IFG and temporal areas when generating semantic predictions.</p>

                <p>Although it is uncontroversial that word meanings shift depending on their context, our understanding of contextualized lexical meaning remains poor. How is a contextualized semantic space organized? In this MEG study (27 human participants, 16 women, 10 men, 1 nonbinary), we manipulated the semantic and syntactic contexts of wordforms to query the organization of this space. All wordforms were noun/verb ambiguous and varied in the semantic distance between their noun and verb uses: unambiguous stems, polysemes with distinct but related meanings, and homonyms with completely unrelated meanings. The senses of each stem were disambiguated by a unique discourse sentence and the items were placed in syntactic contexts of varying sizes. Univariate results characterized syntactic context as a bilateral and distributed effect. A multivariate representational similarity analysis correlated one-hot models of the categorical factors and contextualized embedding-based models with MEG activity. Of all models representing ambiguity, only a model differentiating between syntactic categories across contexts correlated with the brain. An All-Embeddings model, where each contextualized word had a distinct representation, explained distributed neural activity across the left hemisphere. Finally, a Syntactic Context model and Within-Context-Stem model were significant in left occipitoparietal regions. While the noun versus verb contrast affected neural signals robustly, we saw no evidence of the homonym&ndash;polyseme&ndash;unambiguous contrast, over and above the evidence for fully itemized representations. These findings suggest that in contexts devoid of ambiguity, the neural representation of a word is mainly shaped by its syntactic category and its contextually informed, unique semantic representation.</p>

                <p>Responses to acute stress function to restore homeostasis. Hence, the study of neurophysiological responses to acute stress helps to understand mechanisms underlying adaptive coping in the face of environmental demands. The infralimbic medial prefrontal cortex (IL-mPFC) modulates the switch between behavioral coping styles, and acute stress enhances glutamatergic neurotransmission on mPFC projection neurons. However, the role of acute stress responses and stress hormones on the physiology of IL-mPFC projection neurons during adulthood remains underexplored. Here, we studied rapid and slow effects of acute corticosterone exposure on synaptic transmission and intrinsic membrane excitability in layer 5 pyramidal neurons of the IL (L5-IL PNs) in adult male rats using ex vivo whole-cell patch-clamp of mPFC slices. We report that corticosterone dynamically modulates the physiology of L5-IL PNs in a time-dependent manner. Specifically, corticosterone elicits a strong rapid shift of the excitatory&ndash;inhibitory balance toward enhanced excitation with mineralocorticoid (MR) and glucocorticoid receptors (GR) playing complementarily roles. Also, corticosterone rapidly and transiently decreases the firing rate of L5-IL PNs via GR. Moreover, acute stress or corticosterone slowly enhances glutamatergic neurotransmission via MR and GR without modulating inhibitory neurotransmission or intrinsic excitability of adult L5-IL PNs. Our findings highlight the potential relevance of corticosterone effects on L5-IL PNs to promote a homeostatic response in adult male rats. First, corticosterone rapidly attenuates IL intrinsic excitability during the rapid initial phase of the acute stress response. Later on, corticosterone slowly restores IL output function over time to promote adaptive executive responses when context changes.</p>

                <p>Encoding new memories relies on functional connections between the medial temporal lobe and the frontoparietal cortices. Multiscan fMRI showed changes in these functional connections before and after memory encoding, potentially influenced by the thalamus. As different thalamic nuclei are interconnected with distinct cortical networks, we hypothesized that variations in corticothalamic recruitment may impact individual memory performance. We used a multiscan fMRI protocol including a resting-state scan followed by an associative memory task encompassing encoding and retrieval phases, in two independent samples of healthy adults (<I>N</I><SUB>1</SUB> = 29, mean age = 26, males = 35%; <I>N</I><SUB>2</SUB> = 108, mean age = 28, males = 52%). Individual activity and functional connectivity were analyzed in the native space to minimize registration bias. By modeling the direct and indirect effects of corticothalamic recruitment on memory using structural equation modeling, we showed a positive association between resting-state functional connectivity of the medial thalamic subdivision within the frontoparietal network and memory performance across samples (effect size <I>R</I><sup>2</sup> ranging between 0.27 and 0.36; <I>p</I>-values between 0.01 and 4 <FONT FACE="arial,helvetica">x</FONT> 10<sup>&ndash;5</sup>). This direct relationship was mediated by decreased activation of the anterior subdivision during encoding (<I>R</I><sup>2</sup> ranging between 0.04 and 0.2; <I>p</I>-values between 0.05 and 0.006) and by increased activation of the medial subdivision during retrieval (<I>R</I><sup>2</sup> ranging between 0.04 and 0.2; <I>p</I>-values between 0.05 and 0.004). Moreover, three distinct clusters of individuals displayed different corticothalamic patterns across memory phases. We suggest that associative memory encoding relies on the distinct corticothalamic pathways involving medial thalamic recruitment and suppression of anterior subdivision to support the successful encoding of new memories.</p>

                <p>The difficulty of tracking multiple moving objects among identical distractors increases with the number of tracked targets. Previous research has shown that the number of targets tracked (i.e., load) modulates activity in brain areas related to visuospatial attention, giving rise to so-called attention response functions (ARFs). While the hemifield/hemispheric effects of spatial attention (e.g., hemispatial neglect, hemifield capacity limits) are well described, it had not previously been tested whether a hemispheric or hemifield imbalance exists among ARFs. By recording blood oxygenation level-dependent activity from human brains (<I>n</I> = 19, female and male) in a multiple-object tracking paradigm, we show that the number of tracked objects modulates activity in a large network of areas bilaterally. A significant effect of contralateral load was found in earlier areas throughout the dorsal and ventral visual streams, while the effects of ipsilateral load emerged in later areas. Both contra- and ipsilateral load significantly influenced activity in the parietal and frontal lobes, specifically the dorsal attention network. In addition, some brain regions in the occipital lobe were significantly more sensitive to contralateral than ipsilateral load. Our results are consistent with findings showing that a diverse set of brain areas contributes to tracking multiple targets. In particular, we extend the canonical view of load-based ARFs to include hemifield bias. Given the hemifield-specific nature of speed and capacity limits to multiple-object tracking, we conjecture that areas that show a strong hemifield preference may impose a bottleneck on processing that results in limits on the capacity and speed of tracking.</p>

                <p>Neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders such as autism and schizophrenia are devastating brain illnesses that are often associated with deficits in social behaviors. Thus, understanding the molecular mechanisms contributing to the etiology underlying these social defects will be critical in developing therapeutic strategies for these disorders. Here, we have identified a crucial role of carboxyl-terminus (C-tail) of Neuroligin 2 (NL2), a cell adhesion molecule highly enriched at inhibitory synapses, in social behaviors. Indeed, we have found that genetic deletion of NL2 C-tail in mice (StopKI mice) significantly reduces GABAergic synaptic density and inhibitory synaptic transmission in hippocampal CA1 neurons. Importantly, both male and female StopKI mice also manifest elevated obsessive&ndash;compulsive disorder-like phenotypes. In addition, we have observed impaired social cognition behaviors in these mice that have not been previously observed in NL2 knock-out mice. These data reveal an unappreciated role of the NL2 C-tail in regulating social behaviors and highlight the importance of NL2 C-tail&ndash;mediated signaling in delineating molecular determinants for neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders.</p>

                <p>Mind wandering, occupying 30&ndash;50% of our waking time, remains an enigmatic phenomenon in cognitive neuroscience. A large number of studies showed a negative association between mind wandering and attention-demanding (model-based) tasks in both natural settings and laboratory conditions. Mind wandering, however, does not seem to be detrimental for all cognitive domains and was observed to benefit creativity and problem-solving. We examined if mind wandering may facilitate model-free processes, such as probabilistic learning, which relies on the automatic acquisition of statistical regularities with minimal attentional demands. We administered a well-established implicit probabilistic learning task combined with thought probes in healthy adults (<I>N</I> = 37, 30 females). To explore the neural correlates of mind wandering and probabilistic learning, participants were fitted with high-density electroencephalography. Our findings indicate that probabilistic learning was not only immune to periods of mind wandering but was positively associated with it. Spontaneous, as opposed to deliberate mind wandering, was particularly beneficial for extracting the probabilistic patterns hidden in the visual stream. Cortical oscillatory activity in the low-frequency (slow and delta) range, indicative of covert sleep-like states, was associated with both mind wandering and improved probabilistic learning, particularly in the early stages of the task. Given the importance of probabilistic implicit learning in predictive processing, our findings provide novel insights into the potential cognitive benefits of task-unrelated thoughts in addition to shedding light on its neural mechanisms.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/19/e1471242025?rss=1">A Novel Candidate Neuromarker of Central Motor Dysfunction in Childhood Apraxia of Speech</a></h4>

              
                <p>Childhood apraxia of speech (CAS) is conceived as an impairment of the central motor system's ability to program multiple speech movements, resulting in inaccurate transitions between and relative timing across speech sounds. However, the extant neuroimaging evidence base is scant and inconclusive, and the neurophysiological origins of these motor planning problems remain highly underspecified. In the first magnetoencephalography study of this disorder, we measured brain activity from typically developing (TD) children (<I>N</I> = 19, 11 males, 8 females) and children with CAS (<I>N</I> = 7 males) during performance of a speech task designed to interrogate function of the speech areas of the primary sensorimotor cortex. Relative to their TD peers, our sample of children with CAS showed abnormal speech-related responses within the mu-band motor rhythm, and beamformer source reconstruction analyses specify a brain origin of this speech rhythm in the left cerebral hemisphere, within or near pre-Rolandic motor areas crucial for the planning and control of speech and oromotor movements. These results provide a new and specific candidate mechanism for the core praxic features of CAS; point to a novel and robust neurophysiological marker of typical and atypical expressive speech development; and support an emerging neuroscientific consensus which assigns a central role for programming and coordination of speech movements to the motor cortices of the precentral gyrus.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/19/e1767242025?rss=1">Anatomically Distinct Regions in the Inferior Frontal Cortex Are Modulated by Task and Reading Skill</a></h4>

              
                <p>The inferior frontal cortex (IFC) is a critical region for reading and language. This part of the cortex is highly heterogeneous in its structural and functional organization and shows high variability across individuals. Despite decades of research, the relationship between specific IFC regions and reading skill remains unclear. To shed light on the function of IFC in reading, we aim to (1) characterize the functional landscape of text-selective responses in IFC, while accounting for interindividual variability, and (2) examine how text-selective regions in the IFC relate to reading proficiency. To this end, children with a wide range of reading ability (<I>N</I> = 66; age 7&ndash;14 years, 34 female, 32 male) completed functional MRI scans while performing two tasks on text and nontext visual stimuli. Importantly, both tasks do not explicitly require reading and can be performed on all visual stimuli. This design allows us to tease apart stimulus-driven responses from task-driven responses and examine where in IFC task and stimulus interact. We were able to identify three anatomically distinct, text-selective clusters of activation in the IFC, inferior frontal sulcus (IFS), and dorsal and ventral precentral gyrus (PrG). These three regions showed a strong task effect that was highly specific to text. Furthermore, text selectivity in the IFS and dorsal PrG was associated with reading proficiency, such that better readers showed higher selectivity to text. These findings suggest that text-selective regions in the IFC are sensitive to both stimulus and task and highlight the importance of this region for proficient reading.</p>

                <p>Flexible experience-dependent learned escape has paramount survival value. However, flight is generally investigated in the presence of innate threats. To study conditioned escape, we developed a paradigm in which mice learn to escape a moving shock grid, which simulates a naturalistic situation of being chased by a threat. In a single session, mice learn to escape from the shock-delivering moving grid, displaying a "flight upon grid approach" (FUGA). Importantly, this learned flight is also displayed the next day during fear retrieval, in the absence of shock. We reasoned that circuits implicated in escape and learned fear control this behavior. Fittingly, cholecystokinin (cck)-expressing cells in the hypothalamic dorsal premammillary nucleus (PMd-cck neurons) are necessary for escape from innate threats, and PMd activity modulates learned defense, suggesting it may participate in the maintenance of learned FUGA escapes. Here, we show in male and female mice that inhibiting PMd-cck activity during FUGA acquisition impairs learned flight during fear retrieval. Furthermore, these results were specific to a paradigm with a moving threat, as PMd-cck inhibition during fear acquisition did not alter behavior during fear retrieval in contextual or auditory-cued fear conditioning. Lastly, PMd-cck cells encoded distance to the moving grid and FUGA escape speed, but were not activated by fear-conditioned tones or conditioned freezing. These data show that the PMd is critical for the maintenance of the memory of the threat associated with the grid and underscore recent views demonstrating that the hypothalamus has key contributions for learning flexible experience-dependent survival actions.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/19/e1930242025?rss=1">Intracellular Spermine Is a Key Player in GSG1Ls Regulation of Calcium-Permeable AMPAR Channel Conductance and Recovery from Desensitization</a></h4>

              
                <p>Calcium-permeable AMPA-type glutamate receptors (CP-AMPARs) contribute to excitatory synaptic transmission and play pivotal roles in normal and detrimental forms of plasticity. Most AMPARs are associated with auxiliary subunits. Transmembrane AMPAR regulatory proteins (TARPs), the prototypical auxiliary subunits, enhance current through CP-AMPAR channels by increasing single-channel conductance and relieving the characteristic voltage-dependent block by endogenous intracellular polyamines, such as spermine. In contrast, the atypical auxiliary subunit GSG1L negatively regulates CP-AMPARs, suppressing current flow by promoting polyamine block and reducing channel conductance. Here, we investigated the role of polyamines in these opposing effects. We show that, in the absence of auxiliary subunits, intracellular spermine decreases CP-AMPAR single-channel conductance. This effect is prevented by the presence of TARPs but enhanced by the presence of GSG1L. Unexpectedly, intracellular spermine is necessary for both GSG1L&rsquo;s attenuation of CP-AMPAR channel conductance and its characteristic slowing of recovery from desensitization. These various effects are determined by specific residues within the channel&rsquo;s selectivity filter and within GSG1L's C-tail. Together, our findings reveal that intracellular polyamines play an essential role in GSG1L&rsquo;s unique ability to negatively regulate many of the key properties of CP-AMPARs.</p>

                <p>Recent rodent data suggest that the cerebellum&mdash;a region typically associated with processing sensory prediction errors (PEs)&mdash;also processes PEs in reinforcement learning (RL-PEs; i.e., learning from action outcomes). We tested whether cerebellar output is necessary for RL-PE processing in regions more traditionally associated with action-outcome processing, such as the striatum and anterior cingulate cortex. The feedback-related negativity (FRN) was measured as a proxy of cerebral RL-PE processing in a probabilistic feedback learning task using electroencephalography. Two complementary experiments were performed in humans. First, patients with chronic cerebellar stroke (20 male, 6 female) and matched healthy controls (19 male, 7 female) were tested. Second, single-pulse cerebellar transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was applied in healthy participants (7 male, 17 female), thus implementing a virtual lesion approach. Consistent with previous studies, learning of action-outcome associations was intact with only minor changes in behavioral flexibility. Importantly, no significant RL-PE processing was observed in the FRN in patients with cerebellar stroke and in participants receiving cerebellar TMS. Findings in both experiments show that RL-PE processing in the forebrain depends on cerebellar output in humans, complementing and extending previous findings in rodents.</p>

                <p>Generalization allows previous experience to adaptively guide behavior when conditions change. The infralimbic (IL) subregion of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex plays a known role in generalization processes, although mechanisms remain unclear. A basic physical unit of memory storage and expression in the brain is a sparse, distributed group of neurons known as an engram. Here, we set out to determine whether an engram established during learning contributes to generalized responses in IL. Generalization was tested in male and female mice by presenting a novel, ambiguous, tone generalization stimulus following pavlovian defensive (fear) conditioning. The first experiment was designed to test a global role for IL in generalization using chemogenetic manipulations. Results show IL regulates defensive behavior in response to ambiguous stimuli. IL silencing led to a switch in defensive state, from vigilant scanning to generalized freezing, while IL stimulation reduced freezing in favor of scanning. Leveraging activity-dependent "tagging" technology (ArcCreER<sup>T2</sup> <FONT FACE="arial,helvetica">x</FONT> eYFP system), an engram, preferentially located in IL Layer 2/3, was associated with the generalization stimulus. Remarkably, in the identical discrete location, fewer reactivated neurons were associated with the generalization stimulus at the remote timepoint (30&nbsp;d) following learning. When an IL engram established during learning was selectively chemogenetically silenced, freezing increased. Conversely, IL engram stimulation reduced freezing, suggesting attenuated fear generalization. Overall, these data identify a crucial role for IL in suppressing generalized conditioned responses. Further, an IL engram formed during learning functions to later attenuate a conditioned response in the presence of ambiguous threat stimuli.</p>

                <p>The intrinsic timescales of single neurons are thought to be hierarchically organized across the cortex, but whether hierarchical variation in timescales is a general brain organizing principle across mammalian species remains unclear. Here, we took a cross-species approach and estimated neuronal timescales of thousands of single neurons recorded across frontal cortex, amygdala, and hippocampus in mice, monkeys, and humans of both sexes using a task-agnostic method. We identify largely consistent hierarchies of timescales in frontal and limbic regions across species: hippocampus had the shortest timescale whereas anterior cingulate cortex had the longest. Within this scheme, variability across species was found, most notably in amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex. We show that variation in timescales is not simply related to differences in spiking statistics nor the result of cytoarchitectonic features such as cortical granularity. Thus, hierarchically organized timescales are a consistent organizing principle across species and appear to be related to a combination of intrinsic and extrinsic factors.</p>

                <p>Opioid use disorder occurs alongside impaired risk-related decision-making, but the underlying neural correlates are unclear. We developed an approach-avoidance conflict task using a modified conditioned place preference (CPP) procedure to study neural signals of risky opioid seeking in the prefrontal cortex, a region implicated in executive decision-making. Following morphine CPP, rats underwent a conflict test in which fear-inducing cat odor was introduced in the previously drug-paired side of the apparatus. While the saline-exposed control group avoided cat odor, the morphine group included two subsets of rats that either maintained a preference for the paired side despite the presence of cat odor (risk-takers) or exhibited increased avoidance (risk-avoiders), as revealed by <I>k</I>-means clustering. Single-unit recordings from the prelimbic cortex (PL) demonstrated decreased neuronal activity upon acute morphine exposure in both risk-takers and risk-avoiders, but this firing rate suppression was absent after repeated morphine administration. Risk-avoiders also displayed distinct post-morphine excitation in PL which persisted across conditioning. During the preference test, subpopulations of PL neurons in all groups were either excited or inhibited when rats entered the paired side. Interestingly, the inhibition in PL activity was lost during the subsequent conflict test in both saline and risk-avoider groups but persisted in risk-takers. Additionally, risk-takers showed an increase in the proportion of PL neurons displaying location-specific firing in the drug-paired side from the preference to the conflict test. Together, our results suggest that persistent PL inhibitory signaling in the drug-associated context during motivational conflict may underlie increased risk-taking behavior following opioid exposure.</p>

                Background Measurement is essential for methods of instruction to be successful. Having an instrument that is reliable and validated in the given setting is vital. The primary goal of this research project is to validate the instructional practice scale (IPS) for university instructors in the Ethiopian context. Methods By implementing a cross-sectional descriptive survey research design, 1,254 participants across four public universities – Arbaminch, Dilla, Wachamo, and Jinka representing the first, second, third, and fourth generations, respectively were randomly selected and participated. The data was split in half and underwent an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). Results The three components of the EFA were alternately filled with seventeen items that satisfied certain standards, had a loading value of > .5, and a Cronbach alpha of ≥ .874. The factors identified in the EFA have been confirmed to be the thirteen items with loading, Cronbach alpha, Raykov’s rho coefficient (rho_A), composite reliability (CR) value of >.7, and Average Variance Explained (AVE) value of > .5. Tests of measurement and structural models showed a good fit. The Fornell-Larcker criterion, which is employed in discriminant validity analysis, demonstrates that the square root of the AVE for each construct is higher than the correlation it exhibits with other constructs. The correlations’ heterotrait–monotrait (HTMT) ratio is getting close to zero, and there isn’t one in the confidence interval at the.05 significance level. Both guaranteed strong discriminant validity. Conclusion For university instructors, the 13 items generally have powerful psychometric properties. The three subsections of the instruction practice scale—planning (4 indicators), delivering (4 indicators), and assessment (5 indicators) — are meant to measure the instructional practice effectively. Implications of the findings were further discussed.

                Background Empirical studies on the impact of devaluation in developing countries, including Ethiopia, have revealed diverse and mixed results. The effects can be positive or negative depending on the specific economic context and policies in place.This study addresses the devaluation puzzle by providing a more comprehensive and nuanced understanding of how devaluation affects the balance of payments and output. Methods To achieve this, we employ a recursive structural vector autoregressive (SVAR) model focusing on Ethiopia from 2001Q1 to 2023Q4. Results The estimation results indicate that the real effective exchange rate channel effectively influences both the balance of payments and output in Ethiopia. Additionally, while foreign asset reserves, money supply, and inflation channels have a stronger impact on output, their effect on the balance of payments is relatively weak. The analysis further indicates that currency depreciation can improve the BOP in the short period by enhancing export competitiveness; however, it may have negative long-period effects due to rising import prices. Similarly, although an increased money supply can stimulate economic activity and strengthen the BOP, excessive expansion risks inflation and trade deficits. Furthermore, inflation negatively impacts both the BOP and GDP by escalating import costs and diminishing competitiveness. Foreign exchange reserves play a crucial role in supporting external liquidity and investor confidence, essential for economic stability. Conclusion The interconnectedness of these factors emphasizes the need for policymakers to implement effective management strategies, including enhancing foreign reserve management, controlling inflation, and adopting a balanced exchange rate policy. Continuous monitoring of these policies will help address emerging challenges and improve Ethiopia’s competitiveness in the global market.

[version 1; peer review: awaiting peer revi</a></h4>

              
                Background Pleural mesothelioma is a cancer of the lung lining associated with asbestos exposure. Platinum/pemetrexed chemotherapy has been used for many years but provides little benefit and, despite recent immunotherapy advances, prognosis remains poor underpinning the need for development of novel therapeutics or drug repurposing. Fertilized hens’ eggs provide a rapid and cost-effective alternative to murine models of pleural mesothelioma which are commonly used in preclinical studies, with chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) xenografts being a partial replacement for mouse flank xenografts. Here we describe methods to generate mesothelioma patient-derived xenografts on the CAM (CAM-PDX), and to subsequently assess these PDX nodules by preclinical imaging and histology. Methods Fragments of surplus mesothelioma tissue obtained from patient biopsies were implanted onto the CAM on embryonic day 7 (E7), fresh or following cryopreservation, with the established PDX dissected on E14 and fixed for histological/immunohistochemical analysis. The optimal freezing method was determined by comparing tissue integrity and cellular content of cryopreserved tissue fragments with paired fresh samples via histological/immunohistochemical analyses. [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (FDG-PET/CT) was used to assess viability of PDXs in ovo. Results Methodologies for processing, cryopreservation, re-animation, and engraftment of mesothelioma tissue fragments were established. Cryopreservation of biopsy samples and parallel processing of contiguous sections allows for assessment of mesothelioma cellularity. CAM-PDXs, generated from fresh or slow-frozen tissue, were well vascularized whilst maintaining the architecture and cellular composition of the patient tissue. Furthermore, uptake of [18F]-FDG following intravenous injection could be visualized and quantified. Conclusions The CAM is a rapid platform for engrafting patient-derived tissue, maintaining elements of the tumor microenvironment and recapitulating heterogeneity observed in mesothelioma. Combining the CAM-PDX model and FDG-PET/CT provides a quantitative in vivo platform for pre-screening of novel treatment strategies and drug combinations, with the potential for development of patient tumor avatars for predicting clinical response.

                <p>by Ori Hendler, Ronen Segev, Maoz Shamir</p>

Visual search involves active scanning of the environment to locate objects of interest against a background of irrelevant distractors. One widely accepted theory posits that pop out visual search is computed by a winner-take-all (WTA) competition between contextually modulated cells that form a saliency map. However, previous studies have shown that the ability of WTA mechanisms to accumulate information from large populations of neurons is limited, thus raising the question of whether WTA can underlie pop out visual search. To address this question, we conducted a modeling study to investigate how accurately the WTA mechanism can detect the deviant stimulus in a pop out task. We analyzed two types of WTA readout mechanisms: single-best-cell WTA, where the decision is made based on a single winning cell, and a generalized population-based WTA, where the decision is based on the winning population of similarly tuned cells. Our results show that neither WTA mechanism can account for the high accuracy found in behavioral experiments. The inherent neuronal heterogeneity prevents the single-best-cell WTA from accumulating information even from large populations, whereas the accuracy of the generalized population-based WTA algorithm is negatively affected by the widely reported noise correlations. These findings underscore the need to revisit the key assumptions explored in our theoretical analysis, particularly concerning the decoding mechanism and the statistical properties of neuronal population responses to pop out stimuli. The analysis identifies specific response statistics that require further empirical characterization to accurately predict WTA performance in biologically plausible models of visual pop out detection.

                <p>by Kathryn C. Krupinsky, Christian T. Michael, Pariksheet Nanda, Joshua T. Mattila, Denise Kirschner</p>

Tuberculosis (TB) is a disease of major public health concern with an estimated one-fourth of the world currently infected with <i>M. tuberculosis</i> (Mtb) bacilli. Mtb infection occurs after inhalation of Mtb, following which, highly structured immune structures called granulomas form within lungs to immunologically restrain and physically constrain spread of infection. Most lung granulomas are successful at controlling or even eliminating their bacterial loads, but others fail to control infection and promote disease. Granulomas also form within lung-draining lymph nodes (LNs), variably affecting immune function. Both lung and LN granulomas vary widely in ability to control infection, even within a single host, with outcomes ranging from bacterial clearance to uncontrolled bacterial growth. While lung granulomas are well-studied, data on LN granulomas are scarce; it is unknown what mechanisms drive LN Mtb infection progression and variability in severity. Recent data suggest that LN granulomas are niches for bacterial replication and can reduce control over lung infection. To identify mechanisms driving LN Mtb infection, we developed a multi-scale compartmental model that includes multiple lung-draining LNs, blood. We calibrated to data from a nonhuman primate TB model (one of the only models that parallels human TB infection). Our model predicts temporal trajectories for LN macrophage, T-cell, and Mtb populations during simulated Mtb infection. We also predict a clinically measurable infection feature from PET/CT imaging, FDG avidity. Using uncertainty and sensitivity analysis methods, we identify key mechanisms driving LN granuloma fate, T-cell efflux rates from LNs, and a role for LNs in pulmonary infection control.

                <p>by Chenchen Jia, Haiyun Wang, Jianping Zhao, Junfeng Xia, Chunhou Zheng</p>

As a fundamental characteristic of multicellular organisms, cell-cell communication is achieved through ligand-receptor (L-R) interactions, enabling the exchange of information and revealing the diversity of biological processes and cellular functions. To gain a comprehensive understanding of these complex interaction mechanisms, we constructed a manually curated L-R interaction database and developed a semi-supervised graph embedding model called scSDNE for inferring cell-cell interactions mediated by L-R interactions. scSDNE model utilizes the power of deep learning to map genes from interacting cells into a shared latent space, allowing for a nuanced representation of their relationships. Leveraging the prior information provided by database, scSDNE can infer significant L-R pairs involved in intercellular communication. Experiments on real single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets demonstrate that our method detects interactions with a high degree of reliability compared with other methods. More importantly, the model integrates gene regulation information within cells to enhance the accuracy and biological interpretability of the inferences. Our method provides a more comprehensive view of cell-cell interactions, offering new insights into complex intercellular communication.

                <p>by Quintin Pope, Rohan Varma, Christine Tataru, Maude M David, Xiaoli Fern</p>
We use open source human gut microbiome data to learn a microbial “language” model by adapting techniques from Natural Language Processing (NLP). Our microbial “language” model is trained in a self-supervised fashion (i.e., without additional external labels) to capture the interactions among different microbial taxa and the common compositional patterns in microbial communities. The learned model produces contextualized taxon representations that allow a single microbial taxon to be represented differently according to the specific microbial environment in which it appears. The model further provides a sample representation by collectively interpreting different microbial taxa in the sample and their interactions as a whole. We demonstrate that, while our sample representation performs comparably to baseline models in in-domain prediction tasks such as predicting Irritable Bowel Disease (IBD) and diet patterns, it significantly outperforms them when generalizing to test data from independent studies, even in the presence of substantial distribution shifts. Through a variety of analyses, we further show that the pre-trained, context-sensitive embedding captures meaningful biological information, including taxonomic relationships, correlations with biological pathways, and relevance to IBD expression, despite the model never being explicitly exposed to such signals.

Vertebrate photoreceptors have been studied for well over a century, but a fixed nomenclature for referring to orthologous cell types across diverse species has been lacking. Instead, photoreceptors have been variably—and often confusingly—named according to morphology, presence/absence of ‘rhodopsin’, spectral sensitivity, chromophore usage, and/or the gene family of the opsin(s) they express. Here, we propose a unified nomenclature for vertebrate rods and cones that aligns with the naming systems of other retinal cell classes and that is based on the photoreceptor type’s putative evolutionary history. This classification is informed by the functional, anatomical, developmental, and molecular identities of the neuron as a whole, including the expression of deeply conserved transcription factors required for development. The proposed names will be applicable across all vertebrates and indicative of the widest possible range of properties, including their postsynaptic wiring, and hence will allude to their common and species-specific roles in vision. Furthermore, the naming system is open-ended to accommodate the future discovery of as-yet unknown photoreceptor types.

Interferon is a central component of the vertebrate antiviral immune response, thought to act through induction of hundreds of interferon-stimulated genes, with some redundancy. Recent findings suggest a more refined ‘limited set’ model, in which distinct viruses are targeted by small subsets of the induced gene repertoire.

                Despite extensive research on technology-mediated visitor experiences, a holistic approach to the smart museum remains underexplored. This paper addresses the gap by examining novel technologies through a cultural lens, particularly their role in enhancing modern museums. We defined the concept and profile of the 21st-century smart museum based on a synthesis of findings from 83 papers and museum reports (2014–2024) on the modern museum, the museum experience, and the integration of innovative technologies. , Of these, 54 articles focused on six main technology categories—Extended Reality (XR), Artificial Intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), Robots, Fusion, and others (Blockchain, Holography)—were reviewed. From the intersection of museums and technology in the digital era, 15 key characteristics emerged, outlining the ideal smart museum.
