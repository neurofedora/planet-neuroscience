                Background Digital finance is also regarded as a significant means to help companies in emerging economies formalize and improve their performance. Mobile money in Sub-Saharan Africa has reduced transaction costs and expanded access to financial services, yet there is scant evidence on its impact on business formalization and outcomes. Methods We used firm-level data from the World Bank Enterprise Surveys and matched it with country-level datasets from the Global Findex Database, World Development Indicators, Worldwide Governance Indicators, and mobile network coverage data. Panel regressions were used to investigate the impact of digital finance on enterprise formalization and firm performance, controlling for firm-specific characteristics, macroeconomic conditions, and institutional factors. We conducted the robustness tests on the other specifications and sub-sample tests. Results The review indicates that increased mobile money penetration enhances the likelihood that an enterprise will formalize and improve firm performance, as reflected in increased sales and productivity. These advantages are greatest among micro and small companies and women-managed companies, which highlights the inclusion-promoting role of digital finance. These impacts are enhanced by strong institutional quality and robust digital infrastructure, and mitigated to some extent by weak regulatory environments. Conclusions Our results provide strong evidence that digital finance promotes formalization and performance in Sub-Saharan Africa. The developmental benefits of digital finance can be enhanced by policies that promote interoperability of mobile money, improve the quality of digital infrastructure, and strengthen regulatory quality. The article contributes to the research by associating digital financial inclusion with formalization outcomes and firm performance, using multi-source data and rigorous empirical procedures.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-77/v1?src=rss">Unseen Care, Unequal Worlds: Photovoice Narratives of Siblings Supporting Deafblind Adolescents in Indonesia [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Deafblindness is a rare and complex condition that is often accompanied by additional intellectual and mental disabilities. Research on adolescents with deafblindness during the post-school transition remains limited, with existing studies primarily focusing on parental perspectives. Sibling voices, particularly in Indonesia, where services are scarce and family-based care is the dominant approach, are underexplored. Aim This study examined how siblings in rural and urban Indonesia manage caregiving and roles during the transition of adolescents with deaf-blindness from school to family. Methods Using a participatory Photovoice approach, eight siblings (aged 15–25) documented their daily realities through photographs, semi-structured interviews, and focus group discussions over a 12-week period. Data were thematically analyzed. Results Six themes emerged: invisible care work, emotional strain, rural–urban divides, social relationships and stigma, temporal transitions, and bridging advocacy. Urban siblings reported tension between education, employment, and caregiving, whereas rural siblings encountered stigma and limited services, but experienced stronger kinship support. Across various contexts, siblings often act as hidden caregivers and advocates, yet their contributions remain undervalued. Conclusions Supporting siblings requires addressing the intersecting dynamics of geographic area, culture, and disability care. Social work professionals must recognize both their challenges and their resilience, which helps them balance caregiving and personal development in the transition phase. Longitudinal research is needed to capture evolving sibling roles across the deafblind transition landscape.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-76/v1?src=rss">Could telescreening be an alternative for referring  urgent dental cases in children?  A before-and-after study. [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Teledentistry has emerged as a promising strategy to improve access to urgent dental care for pediatric populations, particularly in underserved areas; however, evidence regarding the agreement between telescreening and in-person assessment for pediatric dental emergencies remains limited. This before-and-after study, nested within a randomized controlled clinical trial, evaluated the level of agreement between diagnoses and risk classifications obtained through telescreening and in-person consultation in children aged 3 to 13 years presenting with dental pain. All participants underwent synchronous telescreening using a standardized questionnaire and were randomized into two groups; the present analysis included 130 children allocated to telescreening followed by an in-person consultation, which was performed by a blinded examiner unaware of the telescreening results. Agreement between treatment decisions (urgent vs. elective) was assessed, and pain outcomes were monitored at baseline, 7 and 15 days using the Wong–Baker Faces Pain Scale. Agreement between telescreening and in-person evaluation was observed in 49.2% of elective cases and 26.9% of urgent cases, with infrequent changes in treatment decisions, including 6.9% of cases reclassified from urgent to elective and 0.8% from elective to urgent. Pain scores showed a significant reduction over time (p < 0.001), with median values decreasing to zero at both follow-up assessments. These findings indicate that telescreening demonstrates good agreement with in-person evaluation for the identification and management of pediatric dental appears to be a viable and effective alternative for initial screening and referral, although adherence to subsequent in-person care remains an important consideration.

                Background Coastal flood and erosion risk management increasingly requires innovative, nature-based solutions. The European project Foreshore Assessment using Space Technology (FAST) (de Vries et al., 2018) addressed this challenge by developing MI-SAFE, a viewer and software tool designed to assess the wave attenuation capacity of vegetated intertidal flats using Earth Observation (EO) data. To ensure the long-term sustainability and adoption of this technological innovation beyond the project’s lifespan, a robust, viable business model was required. This study outlines the development and evolution of the business case for the MI-SAFE service package. Methods A user-driven approach was employed to define the value proposition and market fit. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews with key stakeholders, including coastal managers, engineers, and conservationists, to identify specific technical needs and willingness to pay. The business model was iteratively developed using standard frameworks such as the Business Model Canvas, transitioning from a traditional linear product approach to a platform-based strategy. Financial projections were calculated to assess economic viability under different adoption scenarios. Results The analysis led to the definition of a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) business model. The service is structured around a freemium strategy with three distinct tiers: an Educational level (open access for general public awareness), an Expert level (standard technical features), and an Advanced level (tailored, high-resolution consulting services). Financial modelling indicates that revenue from the Advanced tier is sufficient to subsidise the free and lower-cost levels, ensuring broad accessibility. The coordinating institute was identified as the central entity for hosting, maintenance, and commercialisation, leveraging its existing infrastructure. Conclusions The study demonstrates that transitioning to a service-oriented platform model significantly enhances the scalability and sustainability of EO-based environmental tools. By bridging the gap between marine science and business management, the proposed model ensures that MI-SAFE remains a viable resource for coastal risk management. This multidisciplinary approach serves as a blueprint for commercialising research outputs in the environmental sector, balancing public utility with financial self-sufficiency.

                Matrix metallopeptidase 7 (MMP7, also known as matrilysin) is a secreted zinc-dependent endopeptidase implicated in extracellular matrix remodelling and fibrotic processes. Elevated MMP7 expression is a hallmark of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and other interstitial lung diseases, where it has emerged as a candidate biomarker for disease progression. Identifying high-quality research antibodies is therefore essential to enable robust investigation of MMP7 biology and its translational potential. In this study, we systematically evaluated ten commercial antibodies for western blot and immunoprecipitation using a standardized knockout validation approach in human A549 cells, comparing readouts in MMP7 knockout lines with isogenic parental controls. These experiments form part of a larger collaborative initiative to address antibody reproducibility by characterizing commercial antibodies for human proteins and making the results openly available to the community. While antibody use and protocol conditions will vary between laboratories, this report provides a resource to guide selection of the most suitable reagents for studies of MMP7 in health and disease.

                Alpha-1-antitrypsin (A1AT), encoded by the SERPINA1 gene, is a circulating serine protease inhibitor that protects the lung from neutrophil elastase–mediated tissue damage. Mutations in SERPINA1 cause alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency, one of the most common hereditary causes of respiratory disease, leading to early-onset emphysema and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, as well as hepatic complications. Given the clinical significance of A1AT and its widespread use as a biomarker, there is a critical need for high-quality antibodies to ensure reliable detection and mechanistic insights. Here we systematically characterised eighteen commercial antibodies for western blot, immunoprecipitation, and flow cytometry using a standardized knockout validation approach in human Hep G2 cells, comparing readouts in a SERPINA1 knockout line with its isogenic parental control. This work is part of a broader collaborative initiative aimed at addressing antibody reproducibility by characterising commercial antibodies for human proteins and openly sharing the results with the community.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10912">Graph Neural Network Reveals the Local Cortical Morphology of Brain Aging in Normal Cognition and Alzheimers Disease</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2601.10912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Estimating brain age (BA) from T1-weighted magnetic resonance images (MRIs) provides a useful approach to map the anatomic features of brain senescence. Whereas global BA (GBA) summarizes overall brain health, local BA (LBA) can reveal spatially localized patterns of aging. Although previous studies have examined anatomical contributors to GBA, no framework has been established to compute LBA using cortical morphology. To address this gap, we introduce a novel graph neural network (GNN) that uses morphometric features (cortical thickness, curvature, surface area, gray/white matter intensity ratio and sulcal depth) to estimate LBA across the cortical surface at high spatial resolution (mean inter-vertex distance = 1.37 mm). Trained on cortical surface meshes extracted from the MRIs of cognitively normal adults (N = 14,250), our GNN identifies prefrontal and parietal association cortices as early sites of morphometric aging, in concordance with biological theories of brain aging. Feature comparison using integrated gradients reveals that morphological aging is driven primarily by changes in surface area (gyral crowns and highly folded regions) and cortical thickness (occipital lobes), with additional contributions from gray/white matter intensity ratio (frontal lobes and sulcal troughs) and curvature (sulcal troughs). In Alzheimers disease (AD), as expected, the model identifies widespread, excessive morphological aging in parahippocampal gyri and related temporal structures. Significant associations are found between regional LBA gaps and neuropsychological measures descriptive of AD-related cognitive impairment, suggesting an intimate relationship between morphological cortical aging and cognitive decline. These results highlight the ability of GNN-derived gero-morphometry to provide insights into local brain aging.

                arXiv:2601.11018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exposure to psychoactive substances during pregnancy, such as cannabis, can disrupt neurodevelopment and alter large-scale brain networks, yet identifying their neural signatures remains challenging. We introduced KOCOBrain: KuramotO COupled Brain Graph Network; a unified graph neural network framework that integrates structural and functional connectomes via Kuramoto-based phase dynamics and cognition-aware attention. The Kuramoto layer models neural synchronization over anatomical connections, generating phase-informed embeddings that capture structure-function coupling, while cognitive scores modulate information routing in a subject-specific manner followed by a joint objective enhancing robustness under class imbalance scenario. Applied to the ABCD cohort, KOCOBrain improved prenatal drug exposure prediction over relevant baselines and revealed interpretable structure-function patterns that reflect disrupted brain network coordination associated with early exposure.

                arXiv:2601.11108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how neural activity gives rise to perception is a central challenge in neuroscience. We address the problem of decoding visual information from high-density intracortical recordings in primates, using the THINGS Ventral Stream Spiking Dataset. We systematically evaluate the effects of model architecture, training objectives, and data scaling on decoding performance. Results show that decoding accuracy is mainly driven by modeling temporal dynamics in neural signals, rather than architectural complexity. A simple model combining temporal attention with a shallow MLP achieves up to 70% top-1 image retrieval accuracy, outperforming linear baselines as well as recurrent and convolutional approaches. Scaling analyses reveal predictable diminishing returns with increasing input dimensionality and dataset size. Building on these findings, we design a modular generative decoding pipeline that combines low-resolution latent reconstruction with semantically conditioned diffusion, generating plausible images from 200 ms of brain activity. This framework provides principles for brain-computer interfaces and semantic neural decoding.

                arXiv:2412.04172v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neurons depend on two interdependent mechanisms-homeostasis and neuromodulation-to maintain robust and adaptable functionality. Homeostasis stabilizes neuronal activity by adjusting ionic conductances, whereas neuromodulation dynamically modifies ionic properties in response to external signals. Combining these mechanisms in conductance-based models often produces unreliable outcomes, particularly when sharp neuromodulation interferes with homeostatic tuning. This study explores how a biologically inspired neuromodulation controller can harmonize with homeostasis to ensure reliable neuronal function. Using computational models of stomatogastric ganglion and dopaminergic neurons, we demonstrate that controlled neuromodulation preserves neuronal firing patterns while maintaining intracellular calcium levels. Unlike sharp neuromodulation, the neuromodulation controller integrates activity-dependent feedback through mechanisms mimicking G-protein-coupled receptor cascades. The interaction between these controllers critically depends on the existence of an intersection in conductance space, representing a balance between target calcium levels and neuromodulated firing patterns. Maximizing neuronal degeneracy enhances the likelihood of such intersections, enabling robust modulation and compensation for channel blockades. We further show that this controller pairing extends to network-level activity, reliably modulating central pattern generators in crustaceans. These findings suggest that targeting neuromodulation pathways-rather than ion channels directly-may offer safer pharmacological strategies to manage neuronal dysfunctions. This study highlights the complementary roles of homeostasis and neuromodulation, proposing a unified control framework for maintaining robust and adaptive neural activity under physiological and pathological conditions.

                arXiv:2506.21828v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Study Objectives: Fetal sleep is a vital yet underexplored aspect of prenatal neurodevelopment. Its cyclic organization reflects the maturation of central neural circuits, and disturbances in these patterns may offer some of the earliest detectable signs of neurological compromise. This is the first review to integrate more than seven decades of research into a unified, cross-species synthesis of fetal sleep. We examine: (i) Physiology and Ontogeny-comparing human fetuses with animal models; and (ii) Methodological Evolution-transitioning from invasive neurophysiology to non-invasive monitoring and deep learning frameworks.
  Methods: A structured narrative synthesis was guided by a systematic literature search across four databases (PubMed, Scopus, IEEE Xplore, and Google Scholar). From 2,925 identified records, 171 studies involving fetal sleep-related physiology, sleep-state classification, or signal-based monitoring were included in this review.
  Results: Across the 171 studies, fetal sleep states become clearly observable as the brain matures. In fetal sheep and baboons, organized cycling between active and quiet sleep emerges at approximately 80%-90% gestation. In humans, this differentiation occurs later, around 95% gestation, with full maturation reached near term. Despite extensive animal research, no unified, clinically validated framework exists for defining fetal sleep states, limiting translation into routine obstetric practice.
  Conclusions: By integrating evidence across species, methodologies, and clinical contexts, this review provides the scientific foundation for developing objective, multimodal, and non-invasive fetal sleep monitoring technologies-tools that may ultimately support earlier detection of neurological compromise and guide timely prenatal intervention.

                arXiv:2509.15832v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Advances in brain-to-image reconstruction are enabling us to externalize the subjective visual experiences encoded in the brain as images. A key challenge in this task is data scarcity: a translator that maps brain activity to latent image features is trained on a limited number of brain-image pairs, making the translator a bottleneck for zero-shot reconstruction beyond the training stimuli. In this paper, we provide a theoretical analysis of two translator designs widely used in recent reconstruction pipelines: naive multivariate linear regression and sparse multivariate linear regression. We define the data scale as the ratio of the number of training samples to the latent feature dimensionality and characterize the behavior of each model across data scales. We first show that the naive linear regression model, which uses a shared set of input variables for all outputs, suffers from ``output dimension collapse'' at small data scales, restricting generalization beyond the training data. We then analyze sparse linear regression models in a student--teacher framework and derive expressions for the prediction error in terms of data scale and other sparsity-related parameters. Our analysis clarifies when variable selection can reduce prediction error at small data scales by exploiting the sparsity of the brain-to-feature mapping. Our findings provide quantitative guidelines for diagnosing output dimension collapse and for designing effective translators and feature representations for zero-shot reconstruction.

                arXiv:2508.08435v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in artificial neural networks for machine learning, and language modeling in particular, have established a family of recurrent neural network (RNN) architectures that, unlike conventional RNNs with vector-form hidden states, use two-dimensional (2D) matrix-form hidden states. Such 2D-state RNNs, known as Fast Weight Programmers (FWPs), can be interpreted as a neural network whose synaptic weights (called fast weights) dynamically change over time as a function of input observations, and serve as short-term memory storage; corresponding synaptic weight modifications are controlled or programmed by another network (the programmer) whose parameters are trained (e.g., by gradient descent). In this Primer, we review the technical foundations of FWPs, their computational characteristics, and their connections to transformers and state space models. We also discuss connections between FWPs and models of synaptic plasticity in the brain, suggesting a convergence of natural and artificial intelligence.

                arXiv:2601.10740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern neural networks rely on generic activation functions (ReLU, GELU, SiLU) that ignore the mathematical structure inherent in scientific data. We propose Neuro-Symbolic Activation Discovery, a framework that uses Genetic Programming to extract interpretable mathematical formulas from data and inject them as custom activation functions. Our key contribution is the discovery of a Geometric Transfer phenomenon: activation functions learned from particle physics data successfully generalize to ecological classification, outperforming standard activations (ReLU, GELU, SiLU) in both accuracy and parameter efficiency. On the Forest Cover dataset, our Hybrid Transfer model achieves 82.4% accuracy with only 5,825 parameters, compared to 83.4% accuracy requiring 31,801 parameters for a conventional heavy network -- a 5.5x parameter reduction with only 1% accuracy loss. We introduce a Parameter Efficiency Score ($E_{param} = AUC / \log_{10}(Params)$) and demonstrate that lightweight hybrid architectures consistently achieve 18-21% higher efficiency than over-parameterized baselines. Crucially, we establish boundary conditions: while Physics to Ecology transfer succeeds (both involve continuous Euclidean measurements), Physics to Text transfer fails (discrete word frequencies require different mathematical structures). Our work opens pathways toward domain-specific activation libraries for efficient scientific machine learning.

                arXiv:2601.10742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neuromorphic vision made significant progress in recent years, thanks to the natural match between spiking neural networks and event data in terms of biological inspiration, energy savings, latency and memory use for dynamic visual data processing. However, optimising its energy requirements still remains a challenge within the community, especially for embedded applications. One solution may reside in preprocessing events to optimise data quantity thus lowering the energy cost on neuromorphic hardware, proportional to the number of synaptic operations. To this end, we extend an end-to-end neuromorphic line detection mechanism to introduce line-based event data preprocessing. Our results demonstrate on three benchmark event-based datasets that preprocessing leads to an advantageous trade-off between energy consumption and classification performance. Depending on the line-based preprocessing strategy and the complexity of the classification task, we show that one can maintain or increase the classification accuracy while significantly reducing the theoretical energy consumption. Our approach systematically leads to a significant improvement of the neuromorphic classification efficiency, thus laying the groundwork towards a more frugal neuromorphic computer vision thanks to event preprocessing.

                arXiv:2601.10765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural networks are commonly trained in highly overparameterized regimes, yet empirical evidence consistently shows that many parameters become redundant during learning. Most existing pruning approaches impose sparsity through explicit intervention, such as importance-based thresholding or regularization penalties, implicitly treating pruning as a centralized decision applied to a trained model. This assumption is misaligned with the decentralized, stochastic, and path-dependent character of gradient-based training. We propose an evolutionary perspective on pruning: parameter groups (neurons, filters, heads) are modeled as populations whose influence evolves continuously under selection pressure. Under this view, pruning corresponds to population extinction: components with persistently low fitness gradually lose influence and can be removed without discrete pruning schedules and without requiring equilibrium computation. We formalize neural pruning as an evolutionary process over population masses, derive selection dynamics governing mass evolution, and connect fitness to local learning signals. We validate the framework on MNIST using a population-scaled MLP (784--512--256--10) with 768 prunable neuron populations. All dynamics reach dense baselines near 98\% test accuracy. We benchmark post-training hard pruning at target sparsity levels (35--50\%): pruning 35\% yields $\approx$95.5\% test accuracy, while pruning 50\% yields $\approx$88.3--88.6\%, depending on the dynamic. These results demonstrate that evolutionary selection produces a measurable accuracy--sparsity tradeoff without explicit pruning schedules during training.

                arXiv:2601.11029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-dimensional portfolio optimization faces significant computational challenges under complex constraints, with traditional optimization methods struggling to balance convergence speed and global exploration capability. To address this, firstly, we introduce an enhanced Sharpe ratio-based model that incorporates all constraints into the objective function using adaptive penalty terms, transforming the original constrained problem into an unconstrained single-objective formulation. This approach preserves financial interpretability while simplifying algorithmic implementation. To efficiently solve the resulting high-dimensional optimization problem, we propose a Quantum Hybrid Differential Evolution (QHDE) algorithm, which integrates Quantum-inspired probabilistic behavior into the standard DE framework. QHDE employs a Schrodinger-inspired probabilistic mechanism for population evolution, enabling more flexible and diversified solution updates. To further enhance performance, a good point set-chaos reverse learning strategy is adopted to generate a well-dispersed initial population, and a dynamic elite pool combined with Cauchy-Gaussian hybrid perturbations strengthens global exploration and mitigates premature convergence. Experimental validation on CEC benchmarks and real-world portfolios involving 20 to 80 assets demonstrates that QHDE's performance improves by up to 73.4%. It attains faster convergence, higher solution precision, and greater robustness than seven state-of-the-art counterparts, thereby confirming its suitability for complex, high-dimensional portfolio optimization and advancing quantum-inspired evolutionary research in computational finance.

Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) employing unsupervised learning methods inspired by neural plasticity are expected to be a new framework for artificial intelligence. In this study, we investigated the effect of multiple types of neural plasticity, such as spike-time-dependent plasticity (STDP) and synaptic scaling, on the learning in a winner-take-all (WTA) network composed of spiking neurons. We implemented a WTA network with multiple types of neural plasticity using Python. The MNIST and the Fashion-MNIST datasets were used for training and testing. We varied the number of neurons, the time constant of STDP, and the normalization method used in synaptic scaling to compare classification accuracy. The results demonstrated that synaptic scaling based on the L2 norm was the most effective in improving classification performance. By implementing L2-norm-based synaptic scaling and setting the number of neurons in both excitatory and inhibitory layers to 400, the network achieved classification accuracies of 88.84 % on the MNIST dataset and 68.01 % on the Fashion-MNIST dataset after one epoch of training.

                arXiv:2601.11325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The three-dimensional bin packing problem (3D-BPP) is a longstanding challenge in operations research and logistics. Classical heuristics and constructive methods can generate packings quickly, but often fail to address industrial constraints such as stability, balance, and handling feasibility. Metaheuristics such as genetic algorithms (GAs) provide flexibility and the ability to optimize across multiple objectives; however, pure GA approaches frequently struggle with efficiency, parameter sensitivity, and scalability to industrial order sizes. This gap is especially evident when scaling to real-world pallet dimensions, where even state-of-the-art algorithms often fail to achieve robust, deployable solutions. We propose a KPI-driven GA-based pipeline for industrial 3D-BPP that integrates key performance indicators directly into a multi-objective fitness function. The methodology combines a layer-based chromosome representation with domain-specific operators and constructive heuristics to balance efficiency and feasibility. On the BED-BPP benchmark of 1,500 real-world orders, our Hybrid-GA pipeline consistently outperforms heuristic- and learning-based state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to 35% higher space utilization and 15 to 20% stronger surface support, with lower variance across orders. These improvements come at a modest runtime cost but remain feasible for batch-scale deployment, yielding stable, balanced, and space-efficient packings.

                arXiv:2601.11499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study first-hitting times in Differential Evolution (DE) through a conditional hazard frame work. Instead of analyzing convergence via Markov-chain transition kernels or drift arguments, we ex press the survival probability of a measurable target set $A$ as a product of conditional first-hit probabilities (hazards) $p_t=\Prob(E_t\mid\mathcal F_{t-1})$. This yields distribution-free identities for survival and explicit tail bounds whenever deterministic lower bounds on the hazard hold on the survival event.
  For the L-SHADE algorithm with current-to-$p$best/1 mutation, we construct a checkable algorithmic witness event $\mathcal L_t$ under which the conditional hazard admits an explicit lower bound depending only on sampling rules, population size, and crossover statistics. This separates theoretical constants from empirical event frequencies and explains why worst-case constant-hazard bounds are typically conservative.
  We complement the theory with a Kaplan--Meier survival analysis on the CEC2017 benchmark suite . Across functions and budgets, we identify three distinct empirical regimes: (i) strongly clustered success, where hitting times concentrate in short bursts; (ii) approximately geometric tails, where a constant-hazard model is accurate; and (iii) intractable cases with no observed hits within the evaluation horizon. The results show that while constant-hazard bounds provide valid tail envelopes, the practical behavior of L-SHADE is governed by burst-like transitions rather than homogeneous per-generati on success probabilities.

Abstract: Complex conjugate matrix equations (CCME) are important in computation and antilinear systems. Existing research mainly focuses on the time-invariant version, while studies on the time-variant version and its solution using artificial neural networks are still lacking. This paper introduces zeroing neural dynamics (ZND) to solve the earliest time-variant CCME. Firstly, the vectorization and Kronecker product in the complex field are defined uniformly. Secondly, Con-CZND1 and Con-CZND2 models are proposed, and their convergence and effectiveness are theoretically proved. Thirdly, numerical experiments confirm their effectiveness and highlight their differences. The results show the advantages of ZND in the complex field compared with that in the real field, and further refine the related theory.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-1175/v2?src=rss">Assessment of Brachial Plexus Dose and Associated Toxicity in Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma Radiotherapy [version 2; peer review: 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction Radiation plexopathy is known to depend on various parameters, and is rarely reported in head&neck cancers. While literature suggests dose constraints of 60-66 Gy, our study aimed to evaluate late brachial plexopathy after primary chemoradiotherapy for locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma with IMRT, and determine the maximum tolerated dose. Methods Between May 2015 and March 2020, a retrospective cohort of 50 patients with a history of previously irradiated nasopharyngeal cancer was identified. All patients underwent definitive treatment using IMRT at recommended curative doses. Clinical and treatment-related characteristics were collected, and all cases were reviewed for symptoms of radiation-induced brachial plexopathy. Verbal informed consent was obtained from all patients prior to their inclusion in the study. Results Of the 50 patients, 98% received concurrent chemoradiotherapy. The mean age at treatment was 44 years. All patients received a minimum dose of ≥ 60 Gy. The median maximum dose to the BP (BPMax) was 73.57Gy (ranges: 61.47 Gy-82.64 Gy). Among patients with nodal involvement, 86% received a minimum dose of ≥ 66 Gy. A correlation study with N-category showed a significant increase in BPmax dose with increasing nodal stage. The median BPmax for patients with level III/IV lymph nodes (75.19 Gy) was higher than for those with level I/II involvement (69.19 Gy) (P = 0.0001). All patients had a minimum follow-up of two years, with a median follow-up duration of 36 months (ranges: 22 – 68 months). Five patients reported clinical symptoms of acute or late brachial plexopathy, but none had confirmation via MRI or electromyography. The analysis showed a significant difference in the dose received by 0.03 cm3 of the volume across the different nodal stages (p < 0.05). As the nodal stage increases (N2, N3), the dose to this volume tends to exceed 70 Gy (p < 0.05). Dosimetric data related to the levels of nodal involvement revealed significant differences between groups (p < 0.05). Conclusion In this cohort of nasopharyngeal cancer patients treated with IMRT and concurrent chemoradiotherapy, Higher nodal stages, especially level III/IV, were associated with increased doses, but symptomatic plexopathy remained rare. These results support careful dose planning in advanced nodal disease.

">Feeling the music: Audiotactile encoding of temporal structure in the human brain</a></h4>

              
                In everyday situations, like a rock party or an organ concert, we feel music vibrating through our bodies. How do these vibrotactile signals influence music processing? How do they aid auditory scene analysis? Combining psychophysics, fMRI and time-resolved EEG decoding, this work reveals how the brain encodes the temporal structure of music (beat and envelope) across audition and touch and uses this information to guide multisensory integration and segregation in simple and more complex perceptual scenes. Participants experienced monophonic and polyphonic piano pieces through auditory, vibrotactile and audiotactile stimulation. Vibrotactile signals improved the detection of a brief target embedded in music, establishing the functional relevance of audiotactile integration in naturalistic settings. fMRI and EEG multivariate decoding revealed that auditory and tactile beat information converged in planum temporale and parietal operculum, albeit through distinct neural dynamics and representations. Superior temporal cortices reliably encoded envelope information from audition, but only weakly from touch. Nevertheless, vibrotactile signals significantly enhanced neural encoding of auditory beat as early as 100 ms, and envelope representations from 250 ms onward. These encoding benefits were associated with superadditive interactions in primary auditory cortex, where tactile signals sharpen and amplify auditory envelope representations. In complex polyphonic music, touch further amplified the segregation and encoding of temporally coherent auditory streams. Our findings highlight the important, yet largely unexplored influence of touch on auditory processing, enriching music perception and supporting auditory scene analysis in real-world environments.

">Locus coeruleus noradrenaline elicits response profiles distinct from natural arousal in hippocampal neurons and astrocytes</a></h4>

              
                During arousal and stress, the locus coeruleus (LC) releases noradrenaline (NA) throughout the brain, including hippocampus. It remains, however, unclear how LC activity contributes to the cellular response profiles observed during natural arousal. Here we directly compared effects of natural arousal and isolated LC activation in mouse CA1 using physiologically titrated optogenetics, combined with fiber photometry of NA and calcium signals, chronic two-photon imaging, and behavioral monitoring. We found that natural arousal robustly activated all three major cell types - astrocytes, pyramidal cells, and inhibitory interneurons - on a population level. In contrast, stimulation of the LC alone exerted a slow inhibitory influence on pyramidal cells and interneurons, with only a subset of interneurons exhibiting a transient activation by LC stimulation. Interneurons, but not pyramidal cells, segregated into functionally consistent LC-responsive subpopulations (activated vs inhibited) with distinct laminar positions in CA1. However, these LC-responsive subpopulations of interneurons did not reliably map onto response subpopulations defined by activity patterns during natural arousal. Astrocytes were strongly activated by both natural arousal and LC stimulation. However, single-cell responses of astrocytes to LC stimulation only partially aligned with their activity during natural arousal responses, indicating distinct driving forces across the two conditions. Together, these results show that LC-driven NA release produces distinct, cell-specific effects that do not align with hippocampal dynamics during natural arousal. Thus, our findings highlight the need to rethink how the locus coeruleus influences the main hippocampal cell types in vivo.

">Common and distinct contributions of the dorsomedial prefrontal and posterior parietal cortices to social episodic memory</a></h4>

              
                The self-reference effect (SRE) refers to the robust mnemonic advantage for self-relevant information and is characterised by a graded pattern spanning the self, close others, and distant others. Despite extensive behavioural evidence, causal evidence for the neural mechanisms supporting the SRE remains limited, particularly during incidental encoding and across source memory, metacognition, and emotional valence. We investigated the causal contributions of the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) and posterior parietal cortex (PPC) to self-other episodic memory and metacognition using focal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). One hundred participants completed an incidental encoding task in which trait adjectives were rated with reference to the self, a close friend, or a celebrity, under anodal or sham stimulation to either region. Recognition tests assessed item and source memory sensitivity (d') and metacognitive efficiency (meta-d'/d') as a function of agent and emotional valence. Across stimulation conditions, a graded advantage for self-related information was observed in both item and source memory, extending to metacognitive efficiency. Anodal stimulation to either region enhanced recognition for celebrity-referenced items. PPC stimulation additionally biased source memory away from positive and towards negative information. These findings demonstrate shared and dissociable causal roles of dmPFC and PPC in self-other episodic memory.

">Neonatal social communication and single genes predict the variability of post-pubertal social behavior in a mouse model of paternal 15q11-13 duplication</a></h4>

              
                Mental illnesses associated with high-risk copy number variations (CNVs) are characterized by incomplete penetrance and variable severity, with their underlying mechanisms remaining inadequately understood. We hypothesized that such phenotypic variability is evident from the neonatal stage and is, at least in part, attributable to individual differences in the expression levels of CNV-encoded genes in the brain. We conducted an analysis of the quantitative and functional structure of neonatal social communication, assessed post-pubertal social interaction, and evaluated the brain expression levels of genes within the same cohort of a mouse model of paternal human 15q11-13 duplication, a high-risk factor variably associated with neurodevelopmental disorders. Subsequently, computational methods were utilized to identify predictive variables for the variability of post-pubertal social interaction. Mice harboring the 15q11-13 duplication exhibited distinctive call sequences characterized by diverse connections, which lacked the incentive value necessary for effective social communication with mother mice. The neonatal call sequences and the expression levels of Magel2, along with, to a lesser extent, Herc2 and Ndn, in the prefrontal cortex of the 15q11-13 duplication model were predictive of post-pubertal social interaction. Our findings demonstrate that variability in post-pubertal social interaction, a dimensional characteristic of neurodevelopmental disorders, can be predicted by the variability of neonatal social communication and is influenced by the expression levels of specific CNV-encoded genes in the prefrontal cortex. This computational approach has the potential to predict the developmental trajectories of various dimensions of mental illness among CNV carriers in humans and to identify CNV-encoded driver genes in preclinical models, thereby providing potential mechanistic bases for the development of gene-based therapeutic strategies

">Sequential coupling of sleep oscillations enables concept-neuron reactivation and supports information flow across the human hippocampal-cortical circuit</a></h4>

              
                Effective memory consolidation during sleep is thought to rely on the transfer of reactivated memory traces from the hippocampus to the cortex. However, the mechanisms supporting this essential dialogue across brain areas remain poorly understood. Here, we recorded single-neuron activity (n = 1097) in the medial temporal lobe (MTL) of 10 epilepsy patients across 21 nights of sleep. Before sleep, patients engaged in a memory task with stimuli eliciting concept-neuron responses. During non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, neuronal firing locked to sharp wave-ripples (SWR) revealed a directed flow of information from the hippocampus to cortical targets. Notably, within SWR-driven activity, experience-dependent concept neurons exhibited elevated co-activation both within and across MTL regions, indicating selective reactivation of behaviorally relevant information. Cross-regional co-activation of concept cells was markedly enhanced when hippocampal SWRs coincided with cortical slow oscillation-spindle complexes, suggesting an active role of the cortex in shaping interregional communication. These findings provide evidence that SWRs in humans selectively reactivate experience-related neural ensembles across the hippocampal-cortical network, while synergistic interactions with cortical slow oscillation-spindle events might facilitate effective memory consolidation.

">Cortical astrocytes control stress resilience</a></h4>

              
                Background: Chronic stress exposure is a risk factor for several psychiatric disorders, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and major depression (MDD), with the prefrontal cortex (PFC) playing a key role in mediating this stress susceptibility. However, most individuals who are exposed to chronic stress are resilient and do not develop psychopathology. Recent evidence suggests that glial cells, especially astrocytes, play an important role in controlling stress-induced anxiety- and depression-like behavior, yet their role in contributing to stress resilience is not understood. Methods: Using fiber photometry, chemogenetics, and RNA-sequencing in male mice, we establish a role for PFC astrocytes in stress resilience. Results: We demonstrate that stress-induced increases in astrocytic calcium activity are both necessary and sufficient for resilience. Bioinformatic analysis reveals robust transcriptional responses in PFC astrocytes that differ between susceptible vs. resilient mice and are unique when compared to astrocytic transcriptional changes in other limbic regions. Comparison with human RNA-sequencing data indicates that molecular changes observed in PFC astrocytes from susceptible mice converge with gene expression changes observed in MDD patients. Conclusions: Together, these data support targeting astrocytes as a potential therapy for negative behavioral consequences following stress exposure and reveal potential molecular mechanisms within PFC astrocytes that could contribute to depressive-like behaviors.

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Autophagy is a cellular protein degradation mechanism essential for neuronal function. Recent work has begun to implicate autophagy in cellular functions beyond preserving homeostasis, such as synaptic plasticity and the regulation of dendritic spines. Work from our lab and others demonstrates that synaptic plasticity in distinct dendritic compartments is in part regulated by the uneven distribution of autophagosomes in CA1 apical dendrites. However, it remains unclear whether autophagy contributes to dendritic spine regulation in different dendritic segments. Here, we investigated the role of autophagy and caspase-3, a protein inhibiting autophagy during NMDA receptor-dependent long-term depression, in the regulation of proximal and distal dendritic spines of CA1 pyramidal neurons. We conducted 3D neuron reconstruction of fluorescently labeled dendrites to analyze the volume, density, and subtype proportions of dendritic spines across compartments in ATG5 and caspase-3 knockout mice. ATG5 knockout mice had larger spines in distal dendrites as compared to proximal dendrites. Caspase-3 knockout mice did not display any difference between proximal and distal spine volume. Only ATG5 knockout mice exhibited reduced spine density as compared to controls. Both ATG5 and caspase-3 knockout mice possessed increased spine volume across all three spine subtypes: thin, stubby, and mushroom, along with a shift in spine subtypes with reduced proportions of thin and increased proportions of stubby and mushroom. These findings suggest that both autophagy and caspase-3 contribute to the regulation of spine volume and morphology. However, only autophagy appears to influence spine density. Moreover, autophagy uniquely regulates spine volume differently in proximal versus distal dendrites.</p>

                Zhao et al. found that Uhg5-derived snoRNAs regulate sleep by controlling the translation of mitochondrial genes. It is also revealed that the protein Stuxnet directly interacts with both Uhg5 and parkin transcripts. This suggests that Stuxnet coordinates mitochondrial biogenesis and quality control, providing a new link to Parkinson’s disease.

NEMO can sculpt the different brain dynamics in a fixed brain architecture to compute the rich repertoire of tasks required for surviving and thriving.

">Temporal dynamics of early somatosensory processing in goal-directed actions</a></h4>

              
                Tactile sensitivity is temporally modulated on a moving limb. Yet the functional significance of this modulation remains unclear. Using electroencephalography (EEG), we examined the temporal dynamics of early somatosensory processing in goal-directed reaching. Participants reached for their unseen left hand while brief vibrations were applied to the moving right index finger in different movement phases. Psychophysical results revealed tactile suppression during reaching, with sensitivity improving around maximum speed relative to the late movement phase. The EEG results were consistent with the psychophysical data. Specifically, the short-latency P45 component, originating in primary somatosensory cortex, was suppressed during reaching, but recovered around maximum speed. Reduced P45 amplitudes were associated with stronger tactile suppression measured behaviorally, linking early cortical activity to perceptual changes. This temporally specific modulation of tactile perception associated with early cortical processing suggests that the somatosensory system dynamically adapts its sensitivity to facilitate sensorimotor control in goal-directed actions.

                Effective speech analysis involves deconstructing the acoustic signal into identifiable linguistic units, which depends on the ability to recognize and anticipate temporal patterns within the speech stream. However, these processes may be less efficient in individuals with dyslexia. This study investigated the effects of temporal context and related temporal predictions in dyslexic adult participants and matched control participants, using an auditory oddball task with non-verbal stimuli. Pure tones were presented in sequences, and participants were requested to discriminate the pitch of target stimuli. The temporal intervals between the sounds varied in regularity across the sequences, thereby creating contexts with different levels of temporal predictability. At the end of each sequence, participants were prompted to evaluate the perceived rhythmicity of the sequence and to assess their own performance in the auditory discrimination task. Dyslexic participants demonstrated overall lower accuracy in discriminating target sounds than controls. They also showed reduced influence of the temporal context of the sequences on response times, while controls responded faster in sequences that were temporally more regular and predictable. Additionally, individuals with dyslexia perceived the rhythmicity of sound sequences less accurately, overestimating the temporal regularity in irregular sequences and underestimating it in regular sequences. They also reported lower overall confidence in their ability to perform the task compared to control participants. Altogether, these findings provide converging evidence for altered temporal prediction abilities in dyslexia, which may impact auditory perception and then impair language processing.

">In vivo Proximity & Spatial Proteomics with CRISPR Screening Identify STXBP1 as a Protective Modifier of a-synuclein Toxicity in Dopamine Neurons.</a></h4>

              
                Parkinson's disease (PD) is a disease of adults involving the loss of dopaminergic neurons after a long, asymptomatic, prodromal period. a-synuclein, LRRK2, and VPS35 are linked to familial PD, however, how these mutations predispose dopamine neurons to death during the early prodromal phases remains unclear. Here, we used in vivo native proximity proteomics (iBioID) and dopaminergic neuron-specific subcellular proteomics across multiple PD models to uncover early alterations preceding neuronal loss. Our analyses identified convergent disruptions in synaptic protein abundance, indicating that presynaptic trafficking defects are early events in PD pathogenesis. Using a targeted CRISPR-based genetic screen in dopamine neurons, we demonstrated that mimicking this misregulation of STXBP1 amplifies vulnerability to a-synuclein, implicating it as a previously underappreciated toxicity buffering factor. These findings highlight convergent mechanisms that sensitize dopamine neuronal degeneration and that presynaptic vesicle SNARE-complex proteins could serve as key targets for disease-modifying therapies in PD and related neurodegenerative disorders.

">Brain-like dynamics in speech representations can emerge through self-supervised learning</a></h4>

              
                Speech representations in the human brain do not simply mirror the instantaneous speech signal; rather, they display several properties that are hypothesized to facilitate the integration of speech sounds into words. In particular, neural encodings of speech maintain information that has dissipated from the acoustics, and have also been argued to abstract over variability in how individual speech sounds are produced. Here, we investigate how such characteristics could arise. We introduce a computational framework that uses modern neural network models from speech technology to examine two factors in particular: the learning mechanism and the learning input. We find that self-supervised models trained without lexical or semantic feedback developed temporal dynamics similar to brain representations, regardless of whether they were trained on speech or non-speech audio. In contrast, only models trained on speech learn to abstract over variability due to word position and phonetic context. Overall, our results suggest that domain-general learning mechanisms can lead to several important properties of speech representations, but in some cases require domain-specific input in order to do so.

                <p>by Muyiwa S. Adegbaju, Oluwabuyikunmi Owo-Odusi, Eden T. Wirtz, Olanrewaju B. Morenikeji, Olusola Ojurongbe, Bolaji N. Thomas</p>

The concern regarding H5N1 outbreak, particularly the accelerated mutagenesis of its core genomic elements, underscores the persistent threat of influenza to global health. Neuraminidase (NA), a pivotal sialidase integral to virion egress and propagation, comprises nine distinct isoforms, exhibiting unique evolutionary trajectories and structural adaptations. Despite extensive characterization of hemagglutinin subtypes, the functional divergence of the nine NA subtypes remains inadequately understood. To address this gap, we conducted a structural analysis of NA subtypes, employing structural superimposition and motif-guided sequence alignment to delineate subtype-specific residues. Hierarchical clustering stratified the nine NA subtypes into four distinct subgroups: NA2 (subgroup I), NA1 and NA4 (subgroup II), NA9/NA7/NA6/NA3 (subgroup III), and NA8/NA5 (subgroup 4). We identified 40 highly conserved and functionally significant amino acid loci, likely modulating enzymatic activity and substrate specificity across subtypes. To investigate the structural basis of adaptation in H5N1, we generated NA1 mutants by swapping family specific position (FSP) residues and analyzed their dynamics using Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations, complemented by a deep phylogenetic analysis across six host reservoirs. MD simulation parameters reveal a dynamic paradox: the Wild-Type (WT) NA1 maintains a conserved global compactness Rg, which masks a complex, bi-modal switching mechanism essential for its catalytic function, validated by multi-basin free energy landscape (FEL) topography. We identify Lysine-207 (K207) as the master determinant of this switching mechanism and the enzyme’s dynamic fate. Substitutions at this conserved nexus produced diametrically opposite outcomes: K207W imposed structural rigidification (abolishing the switch), K207H achieved dynamic preservation, and K207I drove expanded disorder and collapse. Furthermore, dynamic correlation analysis shows that these single-point substitutions function as molecular switches that significantly re-wire the enzyme’s allosteric communication networks, extending far beyond the active site. To assess the role of NA1 in host tropism and adaptive evolution, we conducted a phylogenetic analysis of <i>NA1</i> genes from H5N1 isolates across multiple host reservoirs; <i>H. sapiens</i>, <i>G. gallus</i>, <i>Anser anser domesticus</i>, <i>M. gallopavo</i>, <i>B. taurus</i>, and <i>C. olor</i>. Notably, we observed opposing selection pressures and diversification patterns: <i>G. gallus</i> isolates showed signatures of positive selection consistent with hyper-reassortment, while human isolates displayed highly diverse, sporadic spillover events. We conclude that the evolutionary contribution of NA1 to H5N1 host adaptation is not encoded in static structure, but certain residues such as K207 defines a pivotal mechanism for regulating the enzyme’s function through dynamic states. Our MD data thus proposes a novel strategy for next-generation antivirals by targeting this dynamic vulnerability—the Nexus for Dynamic Ablation—to permanently entrain the enzyme in a non-functional conformation.

                <p>by Gaspar Cano, Richard Kempter</p>

From cortical synfire chains to hippocampal replay, the idea that neural populations can be activated sequentially with precise spike timing is thought to be essential for several brain functions. It has been shown that neuronal sequences with weak feedforward connectivity can be replayed due to amplification via intra-assembly recurrent connections. However, the mechanisms behind this phenomenon are still unclear. Here, we simulate spiking networks with different excitatory and inhibitory connectivity and find that an exclusively excitatory network is sufficient for this amplification to occur. To explain the spiking network behavior, we introduce a population model of membrane-potential distributions, and we analytically describe how different connectivity structures determine replay speed, with weaker feedforward connectivity generating slower and wider pulses that can be sustained by recurrent connections. Pulse propagation is facilitated if the neuronal membrane time constant is large compared to the pulse width. Together, our simulations and analytical results predict the conditions for replay of neuronal assemblies.

T cell receptors (TCRs) recognize peptides presented by polymorphic human leukocyte antigen (HLA) molecules, but HLA genotype data are often missing from TCR repertoire sequencing studies. To address this, we developed TCR2HLA, an open-source tool that infers HLA genotypes from TCRβ repertoires. Expanding on work linking public TRBV-CDR3 sequences to HLA genotypes, we incorporated “quasi-public” metaclonotypes – composed of rarer TCRβ sequences with shared amino acid features – enriched by HLA genotypes. Using four TCRβseq datasets from 3,150 individuals, we applied TRBV gene partitioning and locality-sensitive hashing to identify ~96,000 TCRβ features strongly associated with specific HLA alleles from 71M input TCRs. Binary HLA classifiers built with these features achieved high balanced accuracy (>0.9) across common HLA-A (9/12), B (9/12), C (6/13), DRB1 (11/11) alleles and prevalent DPA1/DPB1 (6/10), DQA1/DQB1 (8/17) heterodimers. We also introduced a high-sensitivity calibration to support predictions in samples with as few as 5,000 unique clonotypes. Calibrated predictions with confidence filtering improved reliability. Beyond genotype imputation, TCR2HLA enables the discovery of novel HLA- and exposure-associated TCRs, as shown by the identification of SARS-CoV-2 related TCRs in a large COVID-19 dataset lacking HLA data. TCR2HLA provides a scalable framework for bridging the gap between TCRseq data and HLA genotype for biomarker discovery.

                <p>by Janis Shin, James M. Carothers, Herbert M. Sauro</p>

Bayesian Metabolic Control Analysis (BMCA) is a promising framework for inferring metabolic control coefficients in data-limited scenarios, combining Bayesian inference with linear-logarithmic (lin-log) rate laws. These metabolic control coefficients quantify how changes in enzyme activities affect steady-state fluxes and metabolite concentrations across a metabolic network. However, its predictive accuracy and limitations remain underexplored. This study systematically evaluates BMCA’s ability to infer elasticity values, flux control coefficients (FCC), and concentration control coefficients (CCC) under varying data availability conditions using three synthetic metabolic network models. We demonstrate that BMCA predictions are highly dependent on the inclusion of flux and enzyme concentration data, with the omission of these datasets leading to severe inaccuracies. In our synthetic, enzyme-perturbation datasets, external metabolite concentrations had minimal impact and, in some cases, their exclusion improved predictions; when external-nutrient perturbations were introduced and those concentrations were observed, gains were at most modest. Additionally, we find that posterior estimation with both ADVI and HMC can underestimate large-magnitude elasticities in our synthetic settings, with ADVI showing somewhat higher variance under strong up-regulation; thus, recovering |elasticity| ≳1.5 remains challenging regardless of the inference engine. ADVI also fails to accurately infer allosteric interactions, even when regulatory effects are strong. While BMCA maintains reasonable accuracy in partially recovering the rankings of the highest FCC values, its estimates of absolute values remain constrained by prior assumptions and data limitations. Our findings reveal the BMCA algorithm’s strengths and weaknesses, providing guidance on its application in metabolic engineering, and highlighting the need for methodological refinements to enhance its predictive capabilities.

                <p>by Woo-Tek Lee, Eliot Hazeltine, Jiefeng Jiang</p>

Task knowledge can be encoded hierarchically such that complex tasks can be built by associating simpler tasks. This associative organization supports generalization to facilitate learning of related but novel complex tasks. To study how the brain implements generalization in hierarchical task learning, we trained human participants on two complex tasks that shared a simple task and tested them on novel complex tasks whose association could be inferred via the shared simple task. Behaviorally, we observed faster learning of the novel complex tasks than control tasks. Using electroencephalogram (EEG) data, we decoded constituent simple tasks when performing a complex task (i.e., EEG association effect). Crucially, the shared simple task, although not part of the novel complex task, could be reliably decoded from the novel complex task. This decoding strength was correlated with the EEG association effect and the behavioral generalization effect. The findings demonstrate how task learning can be accelerated by associative inference.

                <p>by Patrick M. Ferree, Jayla Cummings, Emma Garman, Jacqueline Solomon, Kassandra Soriano Martinez</p>

Many organisms carry extra, non-essential chromosomes known as B chromosomes (Bs), which are selfishly transmitted at super-mendelian levels to offspring. This heightened transmission, termed drive, occurs during gametogenesis, usually in one of the two parents. In some cases, Bs can experience an opposing process, drag, which reduces their transmission. If these processes occur together in the same organism, one in each parental sex, then they may facilitate the spread of Bs while countering their accumulation in the genome to harmful levels. While previous studies have elucidated mechanistic aspects of B drive, little is known about drag or other factors that govern the inheritance of these selfish genetic elements. Here, we examined the inheritance of Paternal Sex Ratio (PSR), a single-copy B in the jewel wasp, <i>Nasonia vitripennis</i>, which is transmitted paternally to offspring. PSR drives by converting female-destined embryos into PSR-transmitting males. Using genetic manipulation, we produced exceptional PSR-carrying females, which were used to assess B transmission potential. We found that females transmit PSR at an unexpectedly low level compared to univalent chromosomes in other organisms. This reduced transmission stems from remarkable loss of PSR from the egg’s nucleus upon entry into meiosis, an effect that may be caused by an absence of microtubule-based spindle fibers in meiosis I-arrested wasp eggs. We also found that PSR is strictly limited to a single copy per genome, likely because wasps having two PSR copies die during development. Our findings reveal the successful inheritance of this selfish B chromosome involves its restriction to a single copy and hidden female meiotic drag in addition to strong paternal drive.

                Aim To examine the determinants influencing cultural reproduction, comprehend the fundamental concepts of cultural reproduction, and evaluate the model of cultural reproduction as a manifestation of socio-cultural resilience. Materials and Methods The research employed the Systematic Literature Review (SLR) methodology, utilizing the PRISMA protocol and the PICO framework. Data were sourced from Scopus, Web of Science, ProQuest, and Google Scholar, chosen based on inclusion criteria (2015–2025, empirical articles, pertinent to socio-cultural resilience). Out of the 688 initial articles, 143 studies satisfied the criteria. The Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool (MMAT) was used to assess quality, and NVivo 14 was used for thematic synthesis to find patterns of direct relationships, mediation, and moderation between factors. Results and discussions The analysis identified eight principal factors: education, politics, family, economy, media, technology, religion, and community. Politics (15.3%) and education (17.6%) were the most important factors. Cultural reproduction operates through micro–macro interactions involving direct relationships (family, religion, community), mediation (education, media, politics, technology), and moderation (economics, technology). The resulting integrative model elucidates the way this amalgamation of factors enhances socio-cultural resilience via conservation and value adaptation. Conclusions Cultural reproduction serves both as a means of value preservation and as an adaptive mechanism that enhances social resilience. This research enhances Bourdieu’s theory by incorporating digital and participatory dimensions, providing a conceptual foundation for sustainable cultural policy.

                Background This study aims to detect the efficiency of two Artificial Intelligence (AI) translation models, ChatGPT and DeepSeek, in the translation of Yemeni San’ani Arabic (YSA) dialectical terms into English. As dialectal Arabic presents significant linguistic variability and cultural specificity, accurate translation remains a major challenge for the current ChatGPT and DeepSeek (and perhaps other AI models). Methods Fifty San’ani Arabic terms were involved in the translation process, assessing the ability of both models to capture their semantic fidelity, cultural relevance, and contextual accuracy. Results The study findings reveal that, while both models demonstrate a foundational understanding of Standard Arabic (SA), their performance diminishes considerably when faced with the nuances and idiomatic expressions of the San’ani Arabic dialect. ChatGPT displays a relatively better performance in certain cases, particularly when translating terms with dialectical connotations. However, both models exhibit limitations, such as literal translation, misinterpretation, or complete ignorance of the intended meaning. Conclusions The study concludes by highlighting the critical need for dialect-aware AI development and provides recommendations for improving the dialectical accuracy and cultural sensitivity of AI model translation.

                The proposed design of neural network in this article is based on new accurate approach for training by unconstrained optimization, especially update quasi-Newton methods are perhaps the most popular general-purpose algorithms. A limited memory BFGS algorithm is presented for solving large-scale symmetric nonlinear equations, where a line search technique without derivative information is used. On each iteration, the updated approximations of Hessian matrix satisfy the quasi-Newton form, which traditionally served as the basis for quasi-Newton methods. On the basis of the quadratic model used in this article, we add a new update of quasi-Newton form. One innovative features of this form's is its ability to estimate the energy function's or performance function with high order precision with second-order curvature while employ the given function value data and gradient. The global convergence of the proposed algorithm is established under some suitable conditions. Under some hypothesis the approach is established to be globally convergent. The updated approaches can be numerical and more efficient than the existing comparable traditional methods, as illustrated by numerical trials. Numerical results show that the given method is competitive to those of the normal BFGS methods. We show that solving a partial differential equation can be formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem, and use this formulation to propose several modifications to existing methods. Also the proposed algorithm is used to approximate the optimal scaling parameter, which can be used to eliminate the need to optimize this parameter. Our proposed update is tested on a variety of partial differential equations and compared to existing methods. These partial differential equations include the fourth order three dimensions nonlinear equation, which we solve in up to four dimensions, the convection-diffusion equation, all of which show that our proposed update lead to enhanced accuracy.

                Abstract* Background Social media marketing dynamics have been reshaped with the rise of micro-influencers, with the offering of community-driven and authentic brand engagement that goes beyond traditional celebrity endorsements and advertising. This study aims to systematically examine the micro-influencer research published between 2020 and 2025, focusing on identifying themes, research gaps, methodological characteristics, and providing future directions. Methods This paper focuses on providing a thorough systematic literature review (SLR) incorporating the PRISMA protocol on micro-influencers, while identifying interdependencies and relationships. 68 research papers that were derived from the Scopus database were analysed through bibliometric and content analysis. Bibliometric analysis was conducted using a combination of VOSviewer and Biblioshiny packages. Results were analysed through thematic clusters, co-occurrence, and bibliographic coupling analysis. Results The analysis depicts a steady growth in publications accelerated with digitalisation and post-COVID consumer shift that placed a commercial value on small-scale influencers. Research is fragmented across authenticity, trust, engagement, sponsorship disclosure, and niche-domains for micro-influencers. The literature is geographically skewed towards the West and high-income Asian countries. Less longitudinal evidence with strong methodological homogeneity was present. Algorithmic visibility, emerging platform comparisons, influencer labour, and non-commercial uses of micro-influencers were underexplored themes. Five research areas were identified from clustering. Conclusion Despite the rapid expansions, micro-influencer literature remains theoretically fragmented and unevenly distributed. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of the literature on micro-influencers and provides implications and future research directions. Most studies focused on analysing a single platform with cross-sectional designs. This study highlights the need for thorough theoretical integration with methodological diversification, considering emerging platforms to better understand how micro influencers shape digital communication.

                Background Natural resources and their pharmaceutical products play an important role in disease management because of their potential for new drug discovery and historical traditional use in healthcare. This study aimed to investigate the effects of hesperidin and its derivatives on MCF-7 human breast cancer cells and leishmaniosis. Methods The colorimetric cell viability MTT assay was used to measure the efficacy of these compounds in inhibiting MCF-7 cell growth and the promastigote forms of Leishmania tropica. Cells treated with different concentrations (3.125, 6.25, 12.5, 25, 50, 100, and 200 μg/ml) of hesperidin and their derivative, derv.1(5-amino-1,3,4-thiadiazole-2-thiol), and derv. 2 (5-(methylthio)-1,3,4-thiadiazol-2-thiol) after 24 h exposure. Results The Results showed that hesperidin was the most effective in inhibiting MCF-7 cells, with a 58.3% inhibition rate at a concentration of 100 μg/ml, whereas the derivative (derv.2) exhibited the highest antileishmanial activity, with a 50.2% inhibition rate at the same concentration. The anticancer and antileishmanial effects were concentration-dependent, with inhibition rates decreasing at lower concentrations. Conclusions These findings indicate the potential role of hesperidin and its derivatives as anti-cancer and antileishmanial agents, suggesting new ways for further research into their medical applications.

                Background Pancreatic cancer has a poor prognosis and is highly aggressive and deadly. Most pancreatic cancer diagnoses are adenocarcinomas, which account for more than 90 % of all cases. Developing effective therapeutic strategies requires an understanding of the molecular mechanisms associated with pancreatic cancer progression. Small nucleolar RNA 64 (SNORA64) was presented as a predictive marker for pancreatic cancer stages in our previous study. SNORA64 showed a gradual loss of its expression throughout the carcinogenesis process, and it inhibited metastasis by interfering with epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). In this study, we investigated the role of SNORA64 on an intrinsic apoptotic pathway in pancreatic cancers by using human pancreatic cell line derived from adenocarcinoma PK-8 with SNORA64 knockdown and the scramble to compare with. Methods QPCR techniques used to measure the gene expression level of apoptosis related genes and cell viability analyzer are implanted in this study as investigational methods. Results Pk-8 with low expression of SNORA64 shows significantly high expression of anti-apoptotic genes B-cell leukemia/lymphoma-2 (BCl2) and B-cell lymphoma-extra-large (BCL-Xl) in contrast to the scramble control cell line. Conversely, the pro-apoptotic genes BH3 interacting domain death agonist (BID), BCL2 Associated X (BAX), and BCL2 homologous antagonist/killer (BAK) show significantly low expression compared to the scramble control. However, there is no change in the expression of BAD and BIM in Pk-8 with SNORA64 knockdown compared to the scrambled control cell line. Furthermore, the Pk-8 with low expression of SNORA64 shows a significant high proliferation rate and viability percentage compared to the scramble control cell line. Conclusion The downregulation of SNORA64 affects apoptosis pathways by manipulating pro- and anti-apoptotic gene regulators. The SNORA64 interactions with apoptotic inhibitor molecules and downregulation of pro-apoptotic molecules significantly sustain cellular viability. Therefore; SNORA64 can be used to increase the cell sensitivity to death during treatment.

                Background Beta-hemolytic streptococci (BHS) constitute a significant etiology of tonsillitis and rheumatic heart disease (RHD), affecting approximately 55 million individuals and causing 360,000 deaths annually worldwide. In the Middle East and North Africa region, RHD prevalence reaches 389 per 100,000 population, though diagnostic inadequacies may obscure the true disease burden. This investigation compared polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based detection with conventional culture-based methods for BHS identification in Iraqi tonsillitis patients and assessed associated clinical, immunological, and systemic dissemination parameters. Methods A prospective cross-sectional study included 250 tonsillitis patients at Ramadi General Hospital, Iraq (April 2020–January 2025) and 25 healthy controls. Diagnostics comprised throat culture with Lancefield serogrouping, bacitracin testing, and PCR targeting the spy1258 gene. Blood specimens underwent PCR for systemic bacterial detection. Statistical analyses included chi-square testing, logistic regression, and diagnostic accuracy calculations. Results PCR detected Group A Streptococcus (GAS) in 52 of 83 (62.7%) culture-positive specimens, whereas Lancefield serogrouping identified only 19 (22.9%), representing a statistically significant threefold detection disparity (p < 0.001). PCR demonstrated 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity. Groups C and F streptococci comprised the majority of isolates. Elevated anti-streptolysin O (ASO) titers (≥200 IU/mL) were observed in 42.2% of non-GAS infections. Among severe cases, 45.7% demonstrated positive blood PCR for GAS DNA, indicating systemic dissemination. The highest disease burden occurred in the 6–15 years age cohort (54.2% of all isolates). DNA extraction optimization achieved an estimated efficiency of 90.4% compared to negligible efficiency with standard methodologies. Conclusion PCR-based diagnostics detected threefold more GAS cases than serological methods, revealing significant underdiagnosis. Non-Group A streptococci showed pathogenic potential and may cause post-infectious complications, warranting revised diagnostic paradigms.

                Protein–protein interactions play a central role in cellular signaling, immune recognition, and therapeutic development, yet they are often characterized by weak affinities, transient binding, and pronounced conformational flexibility. These features present significant challenges for conventional structural biology techniques. Biophysical approaches, particularly nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) have emerged as powerful tools for elucidating peptide interactions under near-physiological conditions. NMR offers residue-level information on interaction interfaces, conformational changes, and protein dynamics in solution, making it uniquely suited for the analysis of weak and transient interactions. In contrast, ITC provides a direct and label-free measurement of binding thermodynamics, yielding quantitative parameters such as affinity, stoichiometry, and the enthalpic and entropic contributions to binding. This review highlights the principles, applications, and limitations of NMR and ITC in protein–protein interaction research, emphasizing how their combined use enables an integrated understanding of structure, dynamics, and energetics. Representative examples from the literature are discussed, including viral peptide–host protein interactions such as those involving Epstein–Barr virus latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1). Together, these studies illustrate the unique ability of NMR and ITC to capture structural and dynamic features of peptide recognition that are critical for understanding biological function and guiding peptide-based therapeutic design.

                Background With the aim of making it easier for researchers to produce policy-relevant research, the UK Government now requires all departments and arms-length bodies to publish annually-updated statements of their evidence needs, called ‘Areas of Research Interest’ (ARIs). We describe how ARIs are produced, and how they are used to support this aim. Aims and objectives In this paper we offer a description of ARIs and their development by UK governmental departments, and an assessment of how different stakeholders, including academia and funders, have responded to or otherwise used the ARIs. Key conclusions ARIs are a mechanism for organisations to share their research interests with external audiences in the form of a published document. In addition to this primary aim, they also have a much broader set of uses, including connecting departments with each other and helping intermediaries shape engagement plans. All groups would benefit from more robust evidence to choose effective engagement mechanisms, and more can be done to make the ARIs discoverable and useable. Overall, the ARIs are a useful tool to illuminate, and begin to connect different parts of the research-policy system.

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Evidence from rodents has revealed that the hippocampus processes information in a graded manner along its long-axis, with anterior regions encoding coarse information and posterior regions encoding fine-grained information. During navigation tasks with humans, similar patterns have been shown, with granularity of representation and rate of signal varying along the long-axis. However, the stability of these signals and their relationship to navigational performance remain unclear. In this study, we conducted a 2-week training program where 26 participants (6 M; 20 F) learned to navigate through a novel city environment. We investigated inter-voxel similarity (IVS; a measure of representational granularity) and temporal auto-correlation (a measure of signal change) in the hippocampus. Specifically, we examined how these signals were influenced by navigational ability (stronger vs. weaker spatial learners), training session, and navigational dynamics. Our results suggested that stronger learners tended to exhibit an anterior–posterior distinction in IVS in the right hippocampus, whereas weaker learners showed less pronounced patterns. Additionally, lower general IVS levels in the hippocampus were linked to better early learning. These findings suggest that signal complexity in the hippocampus may play a role in successful navigation and that efficient organization of scales of representation could be beneficial for navigation.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Clot composition may offer insights into the mechanism of ischemic stroke. Radiomics, a noninvasive imaging technique, enables tissue characterization through radiomic features (RFs). We aimed to evaluate clot composition using radiomics on non-contrast computed tomography (NCCT).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In the first phase, we conducted a prospective study comparing RFs with histopathology in thrombi retrieved via mechanical thrombectomy (MT). Thrombi were imaged using micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) and analyzed histologically. Matched micro-CT and histological slices identified red blood cells (RBCs) and fibrin-rich regions. RFs were extracted, and multivariate logistic regression identified features associated with each component. Spearman's correlation was used to assess associations between RFs and percentage composition. The same clots were localized on pre-MT NCCT, and RFs were extracted. Micro-CT and NCCT RFs were correlated to enable histology-informed interpretation. Receiver operating characteristic analysis evaluated the ability of NCCT RFs to discriminate clot composition. In the second phase, radiomics was applied to a retrospective NCCT dataset from patients with ischemic stroke with varying etiologies.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Ten thrombi were analyzed using micro-CT. Total energy (odds ratio [OR] = 1.35, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.20–1.54, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and large dependence high gray level emphasis (OR = 1.18, 95% CI = 1.07–1.32, <i>p</i> = 0.01) were associated with RBCs and correlated with &gt;70% RBCs composition on NCCT (Rho = 0.752 and Rho = 0.815). Subsequently, 150 NCCT scans were analyzed, including 50 cardioembolic, 50 large artery atherosclerosis (LAA), and 50 cryptogenic strokes. Radiomic analysis indicated RBCs-predominant composition in 72% of cardioembolic, 30% of LAA, and 50% of cryptogenic clots.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.78139?af=R">Clinical and Biological Determinants of Longitudinal Cognitive Function in Patients With GBA1 Variants and Subthalamic Deep Brain Stimulation</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Whether cognitive decline in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) carrying <i>GBA1</i> variants is accelerated after subthalamic deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS) remains controversial. Clarifying long-term cognitive outcomes is essential for informed decision making.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We assembled matched cohorts of patients carrying <i>GBA1</i> variants with STN-DBS (PD<sub>GBA1+DBS+</sub>, n = 28) and without (PD<sub>G BA1+DBS−</sub>, n = 28). Additional cohorts included non-carriers with STN-DBS (PD<sub>GBA1−DBS+</sub>, n = 40) and without (PD<sub>GBA1–DBS−</sub>, n = 43). Clinical, genetic, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers (A<i>β</i>1–42, h-Tau, p181-Tau, and neurofilament light chain) were analyzed. Cognition was assessed using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Cognitive slopes were estimated using linear mixed models and the minimally detectable slope difference at 3-year follow-up was 1.33 MoCA points enabling sensitivity to clinically meaningful changes. Secondarily, conversion to dementia was analyzed with Kaplan–Meier-analysis once the MoCA was &lt; 21.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>There was no significant difference in cognitive decline between PD<sub>GBA1+DBS+</sub> and PD<sub>GBA1+DBS−</sub> (−0.24 MoCA points/year; 95% confidence interval [CI] = –1.11 to 0.70) projecting to −0.72 MoCA points at 3-year-follow-up (<i>p</i> = 0.583). Secondarily, the risk for conversion to dementia did not differ between PD<sub>GBA1+DBS+</sub> and PD<sub>GBA1+DBS−</sub> (HR = 0.55, 95% CI = 0.23–1.34, <i>p</i> = 0.119) or between PD<sub>GBA1−DBS+</sub> and PD<sub>GBA1−DBS−</sub> (HR = 1.22, 95% CI = 0.53–2.83, <i>p</i> = 0.897). Dementia risk was associated with <i>GBA1</i> status (HR = 3.04, 95% CI = 1.05–8.79, <i>p</i> = 0.041), baseline MoCA &lt; 26 (HR = 3.05, 95% CI = 1.29–7.21, <i>p</i> = 0.011), and baseline age &gt; 69 years (HR = 4.42, 95% CI = 1.79–10.89, <i>p</i> = 0.001). In <i>GBA1</i> carriers, a visuospatial/executive domain score &lt; 4/5 predicted dementia (HR = 4.71, 95% CI = 1.25–17.86, <i>p</i> = 0.022).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p><i>GBA1</i> variant carriers meeting general STN-DBS indication criteria did not show accelerated cognitive decline in the presence of STN-DBS. In addition, exploratory predictors of dementia could support counseling of DBS candidates. ANN NEUROL 2026</p>

                Streptomyces sp. BTA 1-131 was isolated from the marine sponge Melophlus sarasinorum collected in Indonesia. The crude extracts of this strain displayed antibacterial and cytotoxic activity, and therefore, to further investigate the bioactive potential of the strain, whole genome sequencing was performed in this study. The whole genome sequencing of Streptomyces sp. BTA 1-131 was conducted using both Illumina NextSeq and Oxford Nanopore platforms with a de novo hybrid assembly approach. The high-quality genome obtained is 10.23 Mbp with a GC content of 71.57%. It is organised into a single chromosomal contig, two linear plasmids, and one circular plasmid. Interestingly, a long-terminal inverted repeat (L-TIR) sequence of 1.5 Mbp has been confirmed in the strain genome. Phylogenomic analysis suggested that the strain BTA 1-131 likely represents a new species within the genus Streptomyces. To the best of our knowledge, the genome data described here would be the first report on the hybrid genome sequence of Streptomyces associated with the rarely reported sponge Melophlus sarasinorum from Indonesia, with a unique feature of L-TIR. The complete genome data generated here will provide compelling information for further analysis of the biosynthetic potential of the strain BTA 1-131 to produce new bioactive compounds.

                In cases where vaginal delivery is not feasible and the mother’s or the child’s health is in danger, a Caesarean section (CS) is medically warranted. The World Health Organization (WHO) projects that between 10% and 15% of all births will have medically justifiable CS rates. Globally, WHO estimates that 6.2 million CSs are performed each year without medical justification. The determination to proceed with or forgo a CS can be understood as the result of weighing three key categories of influence: demand-side factors, supply-side factors, and clinical factors. Each of these categories contributes uniquely to the ultimate decision of whether to perform a CS, highlighting the multifaceted nature of this healthcare challenge. Within each input, there is also, often, a complex interplay. For example, there is a local narrative of mothers seeking an elective CS being “too posh to push”, inextricably linking household socioeconomic factors and maternal preferences. On the supply side there are issues of the policy within the healthcare facility (private hospitals prefer CSs) and an interplay with time management and maximizing the efficiency of the facility. Bangladesh’s CS has been on the rise; according to the most recent survey, it was 45%, far higher than the WHO recommendation. The private sector interacts with the high rates of CS in Bangladesh; MOH Bangladesh has little control over this sector. To optimize the CS rate, the nation must first recognize that needless CS is an issue and take all necessary action to address it.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-242/v3?src=rss">How walkable are our cities for older adults? Mediation of comfort, convenience, and aesthetics [version 3; peer review: 1 approved, 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background This study investigates the mediating role of comfort (CMT), convenience (CNV), and aesthetics (AST) in the relationship between the enablers of an age-friendly built environment for walkability and outcomes such as increased physical activity level (IPL), increased socialization (ISL), and improved quality of life (IQL) in older adults. The research emphasizes the importance of creating age-friendly environments to support the well-being and quality of life of older adults, with implications for urban planners and policymakers to promote sustainable and inclusive design. Methods The research follows a positivist paradigm using a quantitative approach and survey strategy with a cross-sectional design. A sample of 333 older adults was selected using the convenience sampling technique, and data were gathered through a self-administered questionnaire. Results Findings from hypothesis testing indicate that, among the enablers, age-friendly urban design policies are the most significant construct, positively impacting all three mediating variables. Aesthetics was found to have a significant positive effect on increased physical activity level and increased socialization, while comfort and convenience significantly influenced increased physical activity level and improved quality of life, respectively. Conclusion These results suggest implications for urban planners and policymakers to enhance the contribution of built environment for walkability toward increased physical activity level, increased socialization, and improved quality of life for older adults. The research offers valuable insights for academics and practitioners, emphasizing the importance of sustainable design while ensuring inclusivity to promote the well-being and quality of life of older adults.

                In a district of the Lambayeque province, considerable levels of political disaffection are evident, manifesting not only in the alienation from power but also in a significant gap between citizens and government institutions. Although efforts have been made to continue the participatory trend in democratic institutions, innovative proposals for social intervention in political processes and decision-making are still needed. The study aimed to propose a model of conventional participation to mitigate political disaffection in Lambayeque, Peru. The research was quantitative, with a non-experimental, descriptive-propositional design. It employed a survey technique applied to a randomly selected sample of 506 citizens from a total universe of 19,342 voters. The results indicate that the implementation of a conventional participatory practice, tailored to the sociocultural peculiarities of the district, positively impacts the political perception of the population. The findings reveal that a large portion of the Lambayeque population has disconnected from politics in everyday life, registering a general malaise that may reflect in future elections, as interest that does not translate into action is meaningless. General distrust in institutions, particularly the sentiment of corruption, has fostered this detachment; moreover, the results reflect a rejection of the political system. Despite many being informed about politics, the feeling of participation remains impotent.

                Background Cardiac hydatid cysts are uncommon presentation of heart disease that most often affects the left ventricle of the heart. The clinical picture may be quite different and may include arrhythmias and myocarditis up to a potentially life-threatening embolism of the cystic contents in cases of rupture into a cardiac chamber. Early and proper diagnosis is very important to avoid serious complications, such as infection and rupture of cysts. Even though medical treatment can bring certain control, surgery is the preferred type of treatment, which has good results and a low possibility of recurrence in cases where it is performed early. Methodology This retrospective case-series study examined five patients diagnosed with cardiac hydatid cysts between January 2018 and July 2024. All cases were handled by a qualified cardiac surgeon at Al-Anbar Governorate in Iraq. The effectiveness and safety of surgical management were evaluated based on clinical information, radiographic findings, surgical procedures, and post-operative experiences. Results All five patients successfully underwent successful excision of the cardiac hydatid cysts. In all cases, the post-operative course was uneventful, except for one patient who developed significant post-operatve bleeding requiring re-exploration. There were no deaths, and high-quality clinical recovery was achieved. No incidence of cyst rupture, secondary infection, or cyst reccurrence was reported during the follow-up period. Conclusions Although uncommon, cardiac hydatid cysts should be included in the diagnosis of cardiac masses, particularly in endemic areas. Echocardiography and high-tech imaging should be used to diagnose heart disease early to prevent severe complications. Surgery has been the pillar of treatment as it offers high success rates with low risk in case it is performed in a timely and careful manner. The positive results in this series prove the necessity of timely surgical referral and multidisciplinary treatment.

                Background The anabolic-androgenic steroid boldenone is widely abused and is strongly linked to nephrotoxicity, primarily mediated through oxidative stress and inflammation. Curcumin, a natural polyphenol, is renowned for its potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, but its protective role against boldenone-induced renal injury is not fully elucidated. This study aimed to investigate the potential nephroprotective effects of curcumin against boldenone-induced kidney damage in a rat model, focusing on biochemical parameters, oxidative stress markers, inflammatory response, and histological changes. Methods Thirty-two male Wistar rats were divided into four groups (n=8): control, curcumin-only (300 mg/kg/day), boldenone-only (5 mg/kg/week), and boldenone + curcumin. Over the experimental period, body weight, kidney weight, food/water intake, and serum renal function markers (urea, creatinine, electrolytes) were monitored. Renal tissue was analyzed for oxidative stress markers (MDA, GSH, CAT, SOD), the inflammatory cytokine TNF-α, and histological alterations. Results Boldenone administration significantly increased body and kidney weights, serum urea, creatinine, potassium, and chloride, while decreasing sodium and calcium. It induced marked oxidative stress (elevated MDA, depleted GSH, CAT, SOD) and inflammation (elevated TNF-α), resulting in significant tubular necrosis and hypertrophy. Co-treatment with curcumin substantially mitigated these abnormalities, normalizing serum markers, restoring antioxidant defenses and electrolyte balance, reducing TNF-α expression, and ameliorating histological damage. Conclusion Curcumin exerts significant nephroprotection against boldenone-induced toxicity through its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and cytoprotective mechanisms. These findings justify its exploration as a potential adjunct therapy to prevent steroid-associated kidney injury. Future studies should focus on elucidating the precise molecular signaling pathways involved and validating these effects in clinical scenarios of AAS abuse.

                Introduction Tuberculous pleural effusion (TPE) is the second most frequent manifestation of extrapulmonary tuberculosis (TB), predominantly characterised by mononuclear (MN) cells in pleural fluid. However, approximately 6.7% of cases show polymorphonuclear (PMN) cell predominance in pleural fluid, often causing delayed diagnosis and treatment, as these cases may not be initially recognised as tuberculosis. This study aimed to compare the clinical characteristics of PMN- and MN-predominant TPE. Methods This cross-sectional analytical study included 60 patients with bacteriologically confirmed TB with pleural effusion at Wahidin Sudirohusodo Hospital, Makassar, Indonesia. Primary data were collected from patient interviews, physical examinations, and pleural fluid analysis of thoracentesis samples. The diagnosis of pleural effusion was confirmed by radiological imaging and thoracentesis. Patients were classified as PMN-predominant (≥50% PMN) or MN-predominant (≥50% MN) based on pleural fluid cell counts. Results Among the patients, 24 (40%) had PMN-predominant and 36 (60%) had MN-predominant pleural effusion. Significant differences were found between cell predominance and clinical features, including weight loss (p < 0.001), symptom duration (p = 0.034), clinical severity (p = 0.033), pleural fluid leukocyte and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels (p < 0.001). PMN predominance was associated with severe clinical presentation and higher pleural leukocyte and LDH levels in pleural fluid than MN predominance. Conclusions PMN-predominant TPE reflects an early, more severe inflammatory phase characterised by severe clinical manifestations and elevated leukocyte and LDH levels. While MN predominance suggests a more chronic disease phase with longer symptoms and mild to moderate clinical

                Background The objective of this systematic review was to analyze the effects of physical activity (PA) intervention as an adjuvant strategy to pharmacological treatment in people with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) and non-remitted depression (NRD). Methods A search strategy was conducted from five databases: PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Scopus, SPORTDiscus, and Web of Science. The Physiotherapy Evidence Database and Oxford’s Evidence Levels were used to classify the quality appraisal. Results Of the 10777 records, 11 randomized controlled studies met the inclusion criteria. The main outcome for this analysis was the effect of physical activity (PA) or exercise on depressive symptoms in people with TRD and NRD diagnosis. According to the FITT (Frequency, Intensity, Time, and Type) principle, there was some variability in the PA intervention. However, except for one article, all were classified as excellent in terms of quality description. Conclusions This review highlights the potential of PA intervention as an adjuvant program to improve various traits in TRD and NRD. The remission of depression seems to be higher after PA intervention, showing improvements in quality of life, sleep quality, executive function, and vitality.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-62/v1?src=rss">Why Kyphoplasty for Osteoporotic Vertebral Fractures? [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (OVCFs) are frequent reasons behind painful, spinal deformity, and low-quality of life among the aged. Percutaneous balloon kyphoplasty (KP) is a minimally invasive procedure aimed at stabilizing fractured vertebrae, regaining vertebral height, and correcting kyphotic deformity. The purpose of this study was to compare the radiological and functional outcome of unilateral percutaneous kyphoplasty in patients with OVCFs that are not responding to conservative therapy. Methods This retrospective case study was conducted on 32 adult patients with vertebral compression fracture as a result of osteoporosis who received percutaneous kyphoplasty in the Department of Neurosurgery, Hatay Mustafa Kemal University, Turkey, between 2022 and 2024. Radiological evaluation was conducted before surgery, in the 24 hours after surgery and 1 month after surgery. The heights of anterior, middle, and posterior vertebral bodies and kyphosis angles were measured on the lateral radiographs using Cobb method. The Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) of pain was used as a measure of functional outcomes. Paired statistical tests were conducted to statistically compare pre and postoperative values and the significance was set at p < 0.05. Results The sample population was a group of 24 females (75% of the total population) and 8 males (25% of the total population) with the mean age of the sample population equal to 63.09 years. The number of kyphoplasties carried out was 36. The mean VAS pain scores reduced significantly by the 8.56 at preoperative stage to 5.83 in the early postoperative stage and further to 0.63 at 1 month postoperative, which is a 92.64% pain reduction. Anterior and middle height of vertebral bodies was significantly better after operation and there was no significant change of the height of the posterior walls. Mean kyphosis angle dropped to 10.73 owing to surgery as compared to 18.44 owing to surgery, and was maintained at 1 month. No significant complications such as cement leakage, pulmonary embolism or neurological deficit were observed. Conclusions Percutaneous balloon kyphoplasty is safe and effective, minimally invasive therapy of osteoporotic compression fracture of the vertebra. The surgery offers quick and lasting analgesia, considerable recovery of vertebral stature, and lasting remedy of kyphotic deformity at a low complication rate. These results justify using kyphoplasty as a useful treatment measure to patients with symptomatic OVCFs.

                Jia et al. show that the antiseizure effects of Bacteroides fragilis are mediated by enhanced cholinergic signaling along the gut-vagus-brain axis and reinforced by the gut colonization of Lactobacillus. These findings reveal a microbiota-neural circuit interaction with translational implications for pediatric refractory epilepsy.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/107671">Targeted computational design of an interleukin-7 superkine with enhanced folding efficiency and immunotherapeutic efficacy</a></h4>

              
                Interleukin-7 (IL-7) plays a central role in maintaining T cell development and immune homeostasis, and enhancing the cytokine’s immune-stimulatory functionality has broad therapeutic implications against various oncological malignancies. Herein, we show a computationally designed IL7 superkine, Neo-7, which exhibits enhanced folding efficiency and superior binding affinity to its cognate receptors. To streamline the protein candidate prediction and validation process, the loop region of IL7 was strategically targeted for redesign while most of the receptor-interacting regions were preserved. Leveraging advanced computational tools such as AlphaFold2, we show loop remodeling to rectify structural irregularities that allow for iterative stabilization of protein backbone and lead to identification of beneficial mutations conducive to receptor engagement. Neo-7 superkine shows improved thermostability and production yield, and it exhibits heightened immune-stimulatory and anticancer effect in C57BL/6 J mice. Neo-7 addresses intrinsic developability limitations of IL-7, including inefficient folding, aggregation propensity, and suboptimal receptor engagement, while in vivo pharmacokinetic limitations of wild-type IL-7 were addressed separately through Fc fusion. These findings underscore the utility of a targeted computational approach for de novo cytokine development.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96032">Stratification of viral shedding patterns in saliva of COVID-19 patients</a></h4>

              
                Living with COVID-19 requires continued vigilance against the spread and emergence of variants of concern (VOCs). Rapid and accurate saliva diagnostic testing, alongside basic public health responses, is a viable option contributing to effective transmission control. Nevertheless, our knowledge regarding the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 infection in saliva is not as advanced as our understanding of the respiratory tract. Here, we analyzed longitudinal viral load data of SARS-CoV-2 in saliva samples from 144 patients with mild COVID-19 (a combination of our collected data and published data). Using a mathematical model, we quantified individual-level viral dynamics and stratified them into three groups using a clustering approach. Notably, the three groups exhibited distinct differences in viral RNA detection durations: 11.5 days (95% CI: 10.6–12.4), 17.4 days (16.6–18.2), and 30.0 days (28.1–31.8), respectively. Surprisingly, this stratified grouping remained unexplained despite our analysis of 47 types of clinical data, including basic demographic information, clinical symptoms, results of blood tests, and vital signs. Additionally, we quantified the expression levels of 92 micro-RNAs in a subset of saliva samples, but these also failed to explain the observed stratification, although the mir-1846 level may have been weakly correlated with peak viral load. Our study provides insights into SARS-CoV-2 infection dynamics in saliva, highlighting the challenges in predicting the duration of viral RNA detection without indicators that directly reflect an individual’s immune response, such as antibody induction. Given the significant individual heterogeneity in the kinetics of saliva viral shedding, identifying biomarker(s) for viral shedding patterns will be crucial for improving public health interventions in the era of living with COVID-19.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/106665">Glial betaPix is essential for blood vessel development in the zebrafish brain</a></h4>

              
                The formation of blood–brain barrier and vascular integrity depends on the coordinated development of different cell types in the brain. Previous studies have shown that zebrafish <i>bubblehead</i> (<i>bbh</i>) mutant, which has mutation in the <i>betaPix</i> locus, develops spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage during early development. However, it remains unclear in which brain cells <i>betaPix</i> may function. Here, we established a highly efficient conditional knockout method in zebrafish by using homology-directed repair-mediated knockin and knockout technology and generated <i>betaPix</i> conditional trap (<i>betaPix<sup>ct</sup></i>) allele in zebrafish. We found that <i>betaPix</i> in glia, but neither neurons, endothelial cells, nor pericytes was critical for glial and vascular development and integrity, thus contributing to the formation of blood–brain barrier. Single-cell transcriptome profiling revealed that microtubule aggregation signaling stathmins and pro-angiogenic transcription factors <i>Zfhx3/4</i> were downregulated in glial and neuronal progenitors, and further genetic analysis suggested that betaPix may act upstream on the PAK1-Stathmin and Zfhx3/4-Vegfaa signaling to regulate glia migration and angiogenesis. Therefore, this work reveals that glial <i>betaPix</i> plays an important role in brain vascular development in zebrafish embryos and possibly human cells.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/106827">Biologically informed cortical models predict optogenetic perturbations</a></h4>

              
                A recurrent neural network fitted to large electrophysiological datasets may help us understand the chain of cortical information transmission. In particular, successful network reconstruction methods should enable a model to predict the response to optogenetic perturbations. We test recurrent neural networks (RNNs) fitted to electrophysiological datasets on unseen optogenetic interventions and measure that generic RNNs used predominantly in the field generalize poorly on these perturbations. Our alternative RNN model adds biologically informed inductive biases like structured connectivity of excitatory and inhibitory neurons and spiking neuron dynamics. We measure that some biological inductive biases improve the model prediction on perturbed trials in a simulated dataset and a dataset recorded in mice in vivo. Furthermore, we show in theory and simulations that gradients of the fitted RNN can be used to target micro-perturbations in the recorded circuits and discuss the potential utility to bias an animal’s behavior and study cortical circuit mechanisms.

">A Preoptic Neurocircuit That Modulates Metabolic Flexibility</a></h4>

              
                Precise, dynamic control of metabolic fuel usage in response to environmental challenges such as altered food availability or temperature change is essential for animal survival. In mammals, metabolic flexibility -- the capacity to shift cellular metabolism between carbohydrate and fatty acid oxidation -- is understood to be largely regulated by circulating hormones such as insulin and glucagon. However, the role of the central nervous system in coordinating fuel selection and tissue metabolic tuning remains underexplored. Here, we investigated the mechanisms that mediate metabolic reprogramming following the acute activation of torpor-associated glutamatergic Adcyap1+ torpor-regulating neurons in the anteroventral preoptic area (avPOAVglut2/PACAP). The activation of these neurons rapidly shifts whole-body fuel use from glucose to fatty acids, irrespective of fuel/food availability. This shift is associated with reduced glucose utilization stemming from the transient induction of selective insulin resistance in skeletal muscle. We find that this reduction in skeletal muscle glucose metabolism does not require direct muscle innervation but is rather mediated via adrenal hormones. In contrast to their activation, avPOAVglut2/PACAP neuronal silencing results in improved glucose tolerance, demonstrating powerful bidirectional control of tissue-specific glucose metabolism, whole-body glucose levels, and fuel usage. Together, our findings uncover a novel POA-adrenal-skeletal muscle pathway that dynamically controls glucose utilization and metabolic flexibility.

">Reliability and validity of multi-band multi-echo fMRI</a></h4>

              
                Precision mapping of individual differences in human brain spontaneous activity is critical for characterizing brain function and guiding clinical translation. Multi-echo resting-state functional MRI (ME-rfMRI) has the potential to provide more reliable mapping of inter-individual differences in intrinsic brain function than conventional single-echo rfMRI (SE-rfMRI). However, the psychometric benefits of ME-rfMRI for mapping individual differences in spontaneous brain activity (SBA) have not been systematically investigated, which is fundamental for understanding the human brain in health and disease. To quantify the psychometric performance of ME-rfMRI in precisely mapping inter-individual variations in SBA, we employed a psychometric design. We scanned 27 healthy adults with both ME-rfMRI and SE-rfMRI to assess short-term (minutes) test-retest reliability, as well as validity across eyes-open (EO) and eyes-closed (EC) resting states. Our results demonstrate that ME-rfMRI improves reliability relative to SE-rfMRI by 10.8% for amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF), 4.4% for regional homogeneity (ReHo), and 8.0% for voxel-mirrored homotopic connectivity (VMHC) in cortical regions, and by 12.5% for ALFF, 8.3% for ReHo, and 4.0% for VMHC in subcortical regions. This enhancement is achieved by increasing inter-individual variability while reducing intra-individual variability. Notably, ME-rfMRI accentuates inter-individual variability in the unimodal cortex and clearly delineates two parallel systems with distinct variability patterns within the motor cortex. Concurrently, ME-rfMRI increases effect sizes (4%-8%) for detecting individual differences between EO and EC resting states. Interestingly, ME-rfMRI reveals differential effects of eye closure on two intertwined systems in the primary motor and sensory cortices, extending previous findings. Computational simulations indicate that, compared to SE-rfMRI, ME-rfMRI facilitates experimental designs with reduced costs (i.e., 4%-11% smaller sample sizes) for precise mapping of individual differences. These findings establish, for the first time, the psychometric performance of ME-rfMRI measurements, supporting its potential utility in personalized neuroscience applications, including neurodevelopment and brain disorders.

">THIK-1 channel mediates microglial glucose sensing and modulates AgRP neurons</a></h4>

              
                Microglia play essential roles in maintaining energy homeostasis, and their dysfunction contributes to metabolic disease. Although high-fat diet (HFD) exposure induces microglial activation, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly defined. Here, we identified a previously unrecognized role for THIK-1 channel in mediating glucose sensing of microglia in arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus (ARH), during HFD-induced obesity. Pharmacological inhibition of THIK-1 channel with tetrapentylammonium (TPA) suppresses feeding and attenuates body-weight gain in diet induced obese mice. Mechanistically, inhibition of agouti-related peptide (AgRP) neurons is indispensable for TPA-induced hypophagia. Moreover, THIK-1 inhibition promotes microglial phagocytosis of perineuronal nets (PNNs), leading to reduced AgRP neuronal activity and feeding suppression. Together, these findings establish THIK-1 as a critical glucose sensor in hypothalamic microglia and uncover a microglia-dependent pathway through which overnutrition modulates AgRP neuronal activity via PNN remodeling to regulate energy balance, highlighting THIK-1 as a potential therapeutic target for treatment of diet-induced obesity.

">Respiratory suppression enhances voluntary control of human action</a></h4>

              
                Athletes often regulate their breathing to optimize motor performance, suggesting a close link between respiration and movement control. Previous studies have shown that respiration modulates neuronal oscillations and influences behavior. However, how respiratory control directly affects motor behavior remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that breath holding during the preparatory period facilitates voluntary movement. We examined respiratory patterns while participants performed two types of eye movement tasks: pro-saccade and anti-saccade tasks. In the anti-saccade task, participants were required to suppress a reflexive saccade toward a visual target and instead generate a voluntary saccade in the opposite direction. To assess whether motivation modulates respiratory control, the tasks were conducted under two motivational conditions. Most participants suppressed their breath during the anticipatory period preceding saccade initiation, regardless of task type, and this tendency was more pronounced under high motivation. In the anti-saccade task, stronger respiratory adjustments were associated with shorter reaction times, whereas no such relationship was observed in the pro-saccade task. Moreover, intentional breath holding during the preparatory period selectively reduced reaction times in the anti-saccade task. These findings indicate that individuals spontaneously hold their breath to facilitate voluntary actions in highly motivated situations, and that this effect can be reproduced through intentional breath holding. We propose that anticipatory breath holding may play a functional role in proactively modulating neural processes underlying voluntary movement control.

">A sensorimotor brain circuit for transforming aversive experiences into emotional states</a></h4>

              
                Innately aversive experiences produce emotional states which control behavior as well as long term associative memories1-3. Brainstem regions engage innate defensive reactions1,3-7, but it is unclear how the nervous system transduces external aversive experiences into higher order, emotional representations in the forebrain to instruct learning and modulate behavior. The prevailing view is that the sensory properties of aversive experiences activate forebrain emotional processing1,3,8-10, but classical theories proposed that internal bodily reactions to unpleasant events produce feeling states11,12. Here we identify a brainstem cuneiform (CnF) circuit which conveys information about both the external sensory causes and internal motor reactions related to aversive events to the lateral/basal nuclei of the amygdala (LA/B), a brain region which stores emotional memories, to enhance ongoing defensive behaviors and regulate associative memory formation. Glutamatergic CnF neurons project directly to LA/B and receive afferent inputs from aversive-sensory and aversive-motor brain regions. Notably, LA/B neurons encode a sensorimotor state in response to noxious stimuli, with both sensory and motor features transmitted through the CnF-to-LA/B pathway. Finally, optogenetic perturbation experiments showed that during aversive experiences, the CnF-LA/B circuit instructs emotional memory formation and enhances the intensity of ongoing defensive behaviors. These findings reveal how the nervous system constructs an aversive sensorimotor state in the amygdala used for regulating the strength of emotional behaviors and producing memory formation. This demonstrates a clinically relevant brain mechanism for the regulation of emotional processing by both external traumatic events and the accompanying bodily reactions.

">A generalized scaling law to characterize coordinated brain activity</a></h4>

              
                Complex ecological systems obey universal scaling laws such as the Taylor law, which links population variance to the sample mean. A natural question is whether other complex systems with integrated and segregated functional networks, such as the human brain, follow analogous scaling laws, and how these laws behave under synchronized activity. Addressing this is challenging because neural signals at all measurement scales contain both positive and negative values, whereas the Taylor law was developed for non-negative ecological data. To overcome this limitation, we replace the sample mean with the root mean square (RMS) of detrended neural activity and formulate a generalized spatial scaling law applicable to signed data. This framework extends spatial scaling obeying the Taylor law to neural systems and other complex systems across disciplines and allows examination of how coordinated, synchronized activity shapes these laws. Synchrony is quantified using a dedicated metric of functional coordination. Analytical derivations and numerical simulations using multivariate Poisson, binomial, uniform, and gamma distributions demonstrate that the scaling exponent is inversely related to synchrony. Applying this framework to human fMRI data from three large lifespan cohorts (N=840, ages 18 to 88) reveals distinct age-associated trajectories of the scaling exponent. Healthy aging is characterized by a substantial synchrony-induced reduction in the exponent. The synchrony and scaling relationship is stable during resting-state activity but progressively shifts during naturalistic tasks across the lifespan. Limbic, subcortical, and cerebellar regions show particularly strong synchrony and scaling coupling, indicating preservation at subnetwork levels. Finally, individuals with ADHD exhibit disrupted synchrony and scaling relationships, underscoring the potential clinical utility of this novel metric.

">Simultaneous Real-time Imaging of Neurofluid and Neurovascular Dynamics Using Ultrafast Flow-weighted Echo-Planar Imaging</a></h4>

              
                Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) circulation is tightly coupled to cerebral blood flow under the fixed-volume constraint of the cranial vault, with cardiac pulsations and respiration acting as dominant physiological drivers. Disruption of these flow dynamics has been implicated in various neurological disorders, motivating the need for imaging methods that capture CSF and vascular flow simultaneously and in real time. Conventional phase contrast MRI (PC-MRI) provides quantitative CSF velocity measurements but relies on cardiac gating and velocity encoding, which limit temporal resolution, dynamic range, and sensitivity to non-cardiac fluctuations. Here, we introduce self-gated ultrafast real-time flow-weighted echo-planar imaging (SURF-EPI), an inflow-weighted approach in which signal intensity reflects the replacement of saturated spins by freshly inflowing, unsaturated water molecules, yielding higher signal with higher flow. This allows simultaneous assessment of arterial inflow, venous outflow, and CSF motion at high temporal resolution. SURF-EPI was acquired at the C2-C3 spinal level, enabling real-time imaging of CSF flow dynamics in the cervical spinal canal alongside arterial and venous blood flow in major cervical vessels (frame-rate: 21.7 Hz). In addition to frequency-domain analyses, we leveraged intrinsic arterial signal fluctuations as a timing reference to reconstruct cardiac-resolved CSF dynamics for individual cardiac cycles without external physiological recordings. Frequency-domain analysis revealed distinct spectral signatures in CSF flow compared with neurovascular flow, including broadened cardiac peaks and enhanced respiratory modulation, particularly within the ventral spinal canal. In contrast, dorsal CSF showed increased power within the cardiac frequency band, higher coherence with cervical vasculature at the cardiac frequency, and reduced non-cardiac contributions. Time-domain analysis showed strong correlation between CSF flow waveforms derived from SURF-EPI and PC-MRI. Beyond ensemble-averaged waveforms, SURF-EPI enabled beat-to-beat analysis, revealing substantial cycle-to-cycle variability in CSF flow that is not captured by time-averaged gated approaches. Together, these findings establish SURF-EPI as a rapid, complementary framework to PC-MRI, enabling real-time neurofluid imaging with integrated time- and frequency-domain characterization of CSF and neurovascular flow dynamics.

">Differential TDP-43 interactomes between the cortex and cerebellum in the mouse</a></h4>

              
                TAR DNA binding protein 43 (TDP-43) is the core pathogenic protein across a spectrum of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) cases, but its pathological deposition shows regional selectivity, with abundant TDP-43 positive aggregates in the frontal cortex and spinal cord, and a much lower burden in the cerebellum. In health, TDP-43 expression in the cerebellum is higher than in cortex, hence what underpins this differential vulnerability to TDP-43 aggregation is unclear. Here we demonstrate that in healthy C57Bl/6J mice not only is TDP-43 expression higher in the cerebellum than the cortex, but that this expression difference is driven primarily by differences in cytoplasmic load. Mass spectrometry analysis of TDP-43 pull downs from the cortex and cerebellum of healthy mice identified TDP-43 interactors across a number of core functional pathways, with numerous differences between the two brain regions. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD062532. Notably, there were more interactors identified in both nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions within the cortex than the cerebellum. Putative interactions with four core paraspeckle proteins; SFPQ, NONO, FUS and PSPC1 were confirmed using immunoprecipitation and western blot analysis. Follow up validation using proximity ligation assay showed abundant perinuclear cytoplasmic interactions between TDP-43 and all four paraspeckle proteins in both large motor cortex neurons and purkinje cells, with significantly reduced nuclear interactions detected in the motor cortex for SFPQ, FUS and PSPC1. These findings suggest that TDP-43-protein interactions markedly differ between the TDP-43 pathogenesis vulnerable cortex and relatively resistant cerebellum and exploring these differences may yield new insight into disease mechanisms within ALS/FTD.

">Direction-dependent bias in the perceived approach speed and its implications for robot motion design</a></h4>

              
                Humans frequently interact with robots that approach from different directions; however, how the approach direction systematically biases the perceived speed remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate a robust direction-dependent bias in the perceived approach speed, whereby objects approaching from behind are consistently perceived as moving faster than those approaching from the front are. Across five experiments using both physical robots and immersive virtual reality, this bias manifests as a systematic shift in the point of subjective equality without corresponding changes in discrimination sensitivity, indicating a perceptual bias rather than altered precision. We further show that this effect can be explained by body-induced differences in interocular velocity that arise when observers orient themselves toward stimuli approaching from behind. This bias persists in virtual environments and for nonrobotic objects, suggesting that it is driven primarily by visual factors rather than multisensory cues or robot-specific appearance. Together, these findings provide a perceptual foundation for incorporating approach direction into the design and evaluation of the motion behavior of robots in human-centered environments.

">Efferent projections of topographically distinct relaxin family peptide receptor-3 (RXFP3) lateral hypothalamus/zona incerta cells</a></h4>

              
                Relaxin family peptide receptor-3 (RXFP3) is a ligand-activated G-protein coupled receptor and the cognate receptor for the conserved neuropeptide relaxin-3. We recently demonstrated that chemogenetically activating an RXFP3-expressing population in the lateral hypothalamus and zona incerta (LH/ZIRXFP3) induced escape-like jumping behaviour following fear conditioning, but only in a subset of mice. Given the diverse hodology of the LH and ZI, we hypothesised that LH/ZIRXFP3 cells may consist of discrete subpopulations with unique connectivity patterns that govern different aspects of defensive behaviour. To explore this possibility, we unilaterally injected small volumes of a Cre-dependent anterograde viral tracer into four distinct sites of the LH/ZI in RXFP3-Cre mice and analysed their brain-wide efferent connectivity patterns. Each injection site group produced unique projection patterns, particularly to nuclei involved in threat and defensive behaviour. Of note were strong projections from the rostral ZI and anterior LH to the lateral habenula, and projections from the intermediate and caudal ZI to the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray. By combining retrograde tracing and RNAscope fluorescent in situ hybridisation, we identified that most LH/ZIRXFP3 projections to the lateral habenula arose from a subset of vGlut2-expressing lateral hypothalamus neurons, while most projections to the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray arose from a subset of GAD1-expressing zona incerta neurons. Taken together, our results strongly suggest that LH/ZIRXFP3 cells exhibit distinct efferent projection patterns throughout the brain depending on their topographical location within these nuclei, likely reflecting the functional diversity of these neurons.

">Small RNA sequencing of human sural nerves identifies widespread microRNA dysregulation and Schwann cell-localized miR-21-5p in diabetic peripheral neuropathy</a></h4>

              
                Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is a common complication of diabetes with no disease modifying treatments. Despite the prevalence, the molecular mechanisms of DPN are not fully characterized. Among the various molecular regulators, microRNAs (miRNAs) control protein synthesis and are essential for normal development and homeostasis, with dysregulation implicated in cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. In this study, we performed small RNA-sequencing to profile the miRNA landscape of human sural nerves from individuals with and without DPN. Our analysis revealed that nearly 10% of all miRNAs detected are dysregulated and among those 74% are significantly downregulated in DPN. Target gene enrichment analysis of the differentially expressed miRNAs yielded pathways significantly associated with nerve regeneration, metabolic dysfunction, and immune cell activity. In particular, miR-21-5p is significantly upregulated in DPN, showed a positive association with axonal loss severity, and localizes to Schwann cells, consistent with its broader role as an injury- and inflammation-responsive miRNA that shifts from early pro-regenerative functions to maladaptive, inflammation-amplifying effects that impair Schwann cell mediated nerve repair. These results suggest that miRNAs may contribute to peripheral nerve degeneration by promoting inflammation, apoptosis, oxidative stress, and impaired nerve regeneration, while also opening potential avenues for biomarker discovery and therapeutic intervention.

">Systematic fMRI signal differences across cohorts alter lifespan connectome trajectories</a></h4>

              
                Large-scale lifespan neuroimaging studies increasingly integrate data across distinct cohorts to characterize trajectories of brain development and aging. However, systematic differences in acquisition protocols and hardware across cohorts can alter signal characteristics in ways that bias downstream analyses. Here we examine three cohorts from the Human Connectome Project (HCP), spanning development (HCP-D), young adulthood (HCP-YA) and aging samples (HCP-A), to illustrate this issue and evaluate existing strategies to mitigate it. HCP has set standards for open, deeply phenotyped, high-resolution human neuroimaging, which are frequently used as high-quality reference datasets in tool validation, replication studies, and cross-cohort meta-analyses. Because of HCP's widespread usage, even modest protocol differences between cohorts-and their downstream effects-can have outsized impacts on the field of neuroscience research. Our analysis reveals that the HCP-YA cohort exhibits systematically weaker temporal signal-to-noise-ratio (tSNR) relative to HCP-D/A. These signal quality discrepancies propagate to downstream analyses, leading to differences in overall resting-state functional correlations, and whole-brain and node-level measures of resting-state network organization (e.g., system segregation, modularity, participation coefficient). Consistent with protocol-driven signal differences, resting-state network measures derived from HCP-YA depart from expected lifespan trajectories, as confirmed by examination of two other lifespan datasets. Harmonization approaches accounting for protocol and scanner-model differences alleviate some of the artifactual differences in brain network measurement. Our findings underscore that signal differences do not merely introduce noise, but can qualitatively alter estimated lifespan trajectories of functional network organization, including partially inverting expected lifespan patterns. Without appropriate harmonization, analyses that combine HCP cohorts can therefore result in biologically misleading inferences about development and aging. We demonstrate how small acquisition differences bias resting-state-derived network metrics, and how these effects can be mitigated. This work advances best practices for valid inferences in multi-cohort lifespan neuroscience research.

">Reproductive history differentially shapes the neural response of middle-aged females to estradiol therapy after a metabolic challenge</a></h4>

              
                Background: Advancing age, the APOEe4 allele, and female sex are the top nonmodifiable risk factors for Alzheimers disease (AD). Female-specific experiences, such as parity and hormone therapy (HT) affect aging biomarkers such as metabolism and immune signaling and may even affect AD risk. Estradiol (E2), a common component of many HTs, affects cognition and brain health in aging females although this may vary depending on parity, genotype, and metabolic status. We hypothesized that prior parity influences brain and metabolic health, including response to E2, depending on APOE genotype. Methods: Middle-aged female (10 month) wildtype (WT) or humanized (h) APOEe3 or e4 expressing rats, with different reproductive experience (nulliparous or primiparous) were fed a Western (WD) or standard diet (SD) for 2 months. In the second month, rats were given E2 or vehicle (oil) injections daily. Fear associative learning, plasma metabolic hormones, hippocampal inflammatory signalling, and neuroplasticity (neurogenesis, synaptic protein) were assessed. Results: Females fed a WD gained weight and displayed metabolic dysregulation, regardless of genotype. E2 treatment reduced WD-induced weight gain and reduced metabolic hormones, with stronger effects in WT rats. E2 treatment increased dorsal hippocampal inflammatory signalling selectively in primiparous hAPOEe4 females fed a WD. Previous parity increased neurogenesis and reduced certain cytokines in the hippocampus of middle-aged WT rats under a SD. Both E2 treatment and previous parity decreased dorsal neurogenesis in hippocampus of hAPOEe4 rats. In hAPOEe4 females, higher weight was associated with reduced contextual fear memory, an effect driven by primiparous females. In the cued fear conditioning task, hAPOEe4 females displayed better cued fear memory than WT, however, WD exposure reduced cued fear memory in this group. Together, this indicates that diet and weight gain may be more detrimental to associative memory in hAPOEe4 females and that E2 treatment has more favourable outcomes in WT rats. Conclusions: Previous parity alters how females respond to E2 and metabolic stress in midlife. Primiparous hAPOEe4 females were especially vulnerable to the effects of WD and E2, exhibiting more inflammation, impaired memory, and reduced weight-loss. These findings highlight the importance of considering parity and genotype when evaluating midlife metabolic and cognitive risk.

">Aerobic Exercise Preserves Capillary Oxygen Homeostasis and Neurovascular Function in a Mouse Model of Alzheimer's Disease</a></h4>

              
                Age-related cerebrovascular dysfunction is increasingly recognized as a critical contributor to cognitive decline and Alzheimers disease (AD) progression, yet the extent to which lifestyle interventions preserve microvascular oxygen delivery remains poorly defined. Physical activity (PA) improves vascular health and cognition in humans, but its impact on capillary-level oxygenation and functional hyperemia during aging and amyloid pathology is unknown. Here, we longitudinally quantified microvascular oxygen tension and stimulus-evoked oxygen dynamics in awake APP/PS1 mice and wild-type littermates using two-photon phosphorescence lifetime microscopy. Chronic aerobic PA initiated in early adulthood preserved basal arteriolar, capillary, and venular oxygenation, prevented age-dependent increases in microvascular heterogeneity, and mitigated excessive oxygen extraction in preclinical AD mice. While amyloid pathology impaired stimulus-evoked oxygen responses across vascular compartments, PA selectively enhanced capillary dilation and accelerated hyperemic kinetics without altering vascular density or architecture. Notably, sedentary AD mice developed widespread capillary hypoxia and bimodal oxygen distributions, hallmarks of malignant microvascular dysfunction, which were largely absent in physically active animals. These findings demonstrate that routine aerobic PA preserves microvascular oxygen homeostasis and functional responsiveness during aging and amyloid accumulation, supporting a capillary-centric mechanism through which exercise confers neurovascular resilience in preclinical AD.

">Joint Pupillometry and Heart Rate Monitoring Identify Zone-Like High Performance in Esports</a></h4>

              
                Zone-like states, defined as high objective performance with low subjective workload, are sought in esports and other demanding digital activities, yet subjective flow does not consistently index efficient performance. We hypothesized that zone-like high performance is supported by regulated arousal dynamics rather than strongly elevated arousal responses, and that such episodes can be detected from the combined dynamics of heart rate and pupil diameter. Fourteen healthy young adult men completed repeated sessions of a one-versus-one fighting game under three contexts: passive watching, play against a computer-controlled opponent, and competition against a human opponent. Heart rate and pupil diameter were recorded continuously, and subjective flow (Sports Flow Scale), subjective workload (NASA Task Load Index), and in-game performance metrics were assessed. Two-dimensional k-means clustering of heart rate and pupil changes relative to the watching condition revealed three arousal-reactivity profiles. Sessions with larger physiological deviations showed higher flow and higher workload but poorer performance. Sessions with smaller deviations showed higher performance with lower workload despite only moderate flow. Nonlinear analyses indicated inverted-U relationships between physiological deviations and performance, with peak performance occurring when heart rate and pupil responses remained close to the watching baseline during active play. These findings indicate that combined heart rate and pupillometry measures provide a useful multimodal physiological marker for identifying efficient high-performance states and for informing strategies to support performance while managing workload in cognitively demanding digital activities.

">Temporal Patterns of Brain Network Plasticity During the Onset and Maintenance of Neuropathic Pain in Male Mice</a></h4>

              
                Neuropathic pain arises from complex peripheral and central mechanisms and induces long-lasting maladaptive changes in the brain. To investigate the temporal dynamics of these changes, we examined resting-state functional connectivity (FC) in a mouse model of neuropathic pain across its initiation and maintenance phases. Using functional ultrasound imaging to capture whole-brain FC over disease progression, we conducted two complementary studies: a longitudinal assessment in anesthetized animals and an analysis of awake cohorts at distinct disease stages. Both exploratory and literature-guided analyses revealed that FC across most large-scale networks remained remarkably stable during pain maintenance. In contrast, pain onset was marked by enhanced FC between key regions involved in sensory, emotional, and motivational processing, including the motor cortex and nucleus accumbens, the prelimbic and insular cortices, and the infralimbic cortex and hypothalamus. As pain persisted, we observed reduced FC within the somatomotor network, reflecting functional disconnection. Additionally, postsurgical pain alone produced enduring FC changes within the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and insula, indicating long-term central plasticity independent of neuropathic injury. Together, these findings reveal dynamic, network-specific adaptations that distinguish the onset and maintenance phases of neuropathic pain and surgery-related plasticity.

">Neuronal cell line expressing full-length mutant huntingtin exhibits alterations in proteolysis</a></h4>

              
                Polyglutamine diseases are incurable genetic neurodegenerative disorders characterized by the accumulation of mutant proteins with extended polyglutamine fragments, which are prone to the formation of poorly soluble aggregates. The establishment of adequate cellular models is crucial in uncovering the pathological mechanisms responsible for neurotoxicity in HD, screening for therapeutic molecules and elucidation of the molecular mechanisms impacted by particular compound. In the present study, genetic constructs based on the Sleeping Beauty system were created for the stable inducible expression of full-length normal and mutant huntingtin in eukaryotic cells. These constructs were then employed to develop model neuronal cells using Neuro-2a cell line. The expression of huntingtin as well as the accumulation of Htt-immunopositive intracellular aggregates (most characteristic features of HD) was demonstrated, and these aggregates mostly colocalized with the proteasome. The activation of the proteasome, as well as changes in the expression of proteasome regulators, components of the autophagy system, and the protease cathepsin D, reflect the versatility of cellular responses to the destructive mutant Htt pathological forms.

">Microglial epigenetic memory is associated with accelerated resolution of inflammatory pain induced by prophylactic macrophage-derived small extracellular vesicles</a></h4>

              
                Small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) including exosomes play an important role in intercellular communication and can exert immunomodulatory effects in recipient cells. We have shown that a single prophylactic intrathecal injection of sEVs from RAW 264.7 macrophages two weeks prior, promotes faster resolution of mechanical and thermal hypersensitivity in the complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) mouse model of inflammatory pain. How this long-term memory develops, and how sEVs regulate immune responses are unknown. Recent studies have shown that priming microglia with inflammatory stimuli can enhance or suppress responses to a delayed secondary insult via epigenetic modifications. We hypothesized that prophylactic intrathecal administration of macrophage-derived sEVs confers accelerated resolution of inflammatory pain by reprogramming epigenetic memory in spinal microglia in recipient CFA model mice. To determine whether prophylactic sEVs could attenuate pain in the absence of microglia when administering sEVs, we ablated microglia using a colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) inhibitor, PLX5622. sEV-induced pain prophylaxis was completely abolished in PLX5622-fed mice, indicating that microglia are required to be present during sEV administration to confer early resolution of inflammatory pain hypersensitivity. ChIP-seq analysis in spinal microglia 14 days after sEV administration (prior to CFA) revealed an increased number of gene loci enriched for H3K4me1, a hallmark of innate immune memory. Furthermore, inhibiting the H3K4 mono-methyltransferase SETD7 abolished sEV-induced pain attenuation. Our findings indicate that both microglia and its epigenetic reprogramming contribute to pain prophylaxis induced by macrophage-derived sEVs, providing novel insights into the development of non-addictive preventive analgesia.

">A Cell-Based Assay to Categorize Variants of Human Succinate Semialdehyde Dehydrogenase Associated with Autism Spectrum Disorder</a></h4>

              
                Many genes are implicated in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) as a result of sequencing the genomes of individuals with ASD, however in most cases it remains unclear which genes are playing causative roles. ALDH5A1, which encodes the enzyme succinate semialdehyde dehydrogenase (SSADH), an important regulator of GABA metabolism, is causative in the syndrome SSADH deficiency and is also implicated in ASD. However, it is unknown how variants found in ASD affect SSADH function. We developed a yeast growth assay that models SSADH deficiency to quantify the functional impact of seven ALDH5A1 variants found in ASD. In this assay, expression of human ALDH5A1 partially complemented the growth defect caused by deletion of the ALDH5A1 ortholog UGA2. Using growth rate measurements, we calculated functional scores for 27 variants divided into calibration and ASD test variant groups. Functional scores for benign and pathogenic calibration variants segregated accordingly, validating the assay, while ASD variants displayed a range of activities from complete loss to normal function. Comparisons with published enzymatic assays and computational predictions showed broad agreement, while also identifying some limitations of these approaches.

">Guessing reveals internal models of perceptual precision</a></h4>

              
                When observers lack sufficient information to support a confident response, they often guess. Guessing plays a pervasive role in visual cognition and working memory, yet the mechanisms that govern how observers generate guesses remain poorly understood. Standard models traditionally assume that responses produced in the absence of information are either uniformly distributed over feature space or are perhaps weighted towards prevailing environmental statistics. In contrast, here we consider an intriguing alternative: that guesses incorporate observers' knowledge of their own perceptual capacities. We empirically measured guessing by eliciting responses under extreme target uncertainty (Experiment 1) as well as a novel '0ms presentation' approach in which no stimulus appeared but subjects believed one had (Experiment 2). We evaluated three accounts of guesses under these conditions: unsystematic (lapse) responding, biases toward environmental statistics, and a self-representational account in which guesses reflect observers' knowledge of their own feature-dependent precision (e.g., preferring to guess feature values they believe they would be likely to miss). Guess responses were non-uniform and systematically biased toward feature values typically encoded with the least precision (e.g., oblique orientations) - a counterintuitive bias away from high-frequency, high-fidelity feature values (e.g., cardinal orientations). This complementary relationship between guessing and perceptual fidelity held within individuals and across paradigms, and was recoverable via an empirical-guess mixture model that replaced the standard uniform assumption with empirically measured guess distributions. Our findings challenge prevailing views that guesses reflect random noise, and suggest instead that guessing behavior reflects metacognitive knowledge of internal precision. Rather than defaulting to environmental priors, observers appear to model their own sensory limitations and leverage these representations to inform decisions in the absence of evidence. These results reframe guessing as a theoretically informative behavior that expresses observers' own beliefs about their perceptual capacities.

                <p>The nigrostriatal and mesoaccumbal dopamine systems are thought to contribute to changes in behavior and learning during adolescence, yet it is unclear how the rise in gonadal hormones at puberty impacts the function of these systems. We studied the impact of prepubertal gonadectomy (GDX) on later evoked dopamine release in male <I>Mus spicilegus</I>, a mouse whose adolescent life history has been carefully characterized in the wild and laboratory. To examine how puberty impacts dopamine neuron function in <I>M. spicilegus</I> males, we removed the gonads prepubertally at postnatal day (P)25 and then examined evoked dopamine release in the dorsomedial, dorsolateral (DLS), and nucleus accumbens core regions of striatal slices at P60&ndash;70 (late adolescence/early adulthood). To measure dopamine release, we used near-infrared catecholamine nanosensors which enable study of spatial distribution of dopamine release. We found that prepubertal GDX led to a significantly reduced density of dopamine release sites and reduced dopamine release at each site in the DLS nigrostriatal system compared with sham controls. In contrast, mesoaccumbal dopamine release was comparable between sham and gonadectomized groups. Our data suggest that during adolescence, the development of the nigrostriatal dopamine system is significantly affected by the rise in gonadal hormones in males, while the mesoaccumbal system shows no detectable sensitivity at this time point. These data are consistent with molecular studies in rodents that suggest nigrostriatal neurons are sensitive to androgens at puberty and extend our understanding of how gonadal hormones could impact the spatial distribution and release potential of dopamine terminals in the striatum.</p>

                Abstract* The global environmental crisis exposes the flaws of current approaches and highlights the importance of spiritual and locally based ecological ethics. This research examines how Islamic values and Javanese traditional culture are incorporated into environmental rituals at the community level in Selorejo, Malang, Indonesia, as a local response to environmental issues. The primary aim is to illustrate how the incorporation of Islamic values and Javanese traditions constitutes dynamic ecological rituals that foster environmental conservation from both global and local points of view. Using a qualitative ethnographic method, data were collected through three primary techniques: participant observation of community ecological rituals, in-depth interviews with traditional leaders, local community, and local residents involved in conservation efforts. Thematic analysis was applied, utilizing frameworks of acculturation and ecophy. Results reveal that Selorejo’s ecological rituals include six rites: Merti Wono (Selametan Alas), Selametan Sumber, Jogo Wono Performing Arts (Wong Ireng), Jagong Alas, Boundary Marking and Reforestation, and Eco-friendly Agriculture. The rites of Selametan Alas and Sumber demonstrate the fusion of Islamic principles with Javanese traditions, viewing nature as a sacred reflection of God. This combination enhances ecological awareness and establishes a spiritual model of conservation rooted in ecosophy. Such a model presents a relevant global ecological citizenship alternative and supports the achievement of SDGs. This study confirms that spiritually based local ecological rituals can contribute to global ecological citizenship and provide an alternative approach to environmental crises.

                Power et al. identify TGF-β as the injury microenvironment signal required for neurofibroma formation, enabling the expansion of Nf1-KO SCs outside of a repairing nerve by blocking axonal interactions and re-differentiation. “Normalization” using TGF-β inhibitors blocks neurofibroma formation, providing a new therapeutic approach for patients who develop tumors throughout life.

                Guo et al. investigate IL-1 signaling in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) by analyzing multi-omic single-cell data. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) respond to IL-1 signals from myeloid cells and activate an inflammatory signature, mediated by transcription factor NFATC2. Inhibiting NFAT leads to decreased tumor weight, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target.

                Ge and Kan et al. develop and benchmark a human organoid tumor transplantation (HOTT) system to uncover how microenvironmental cues influence glioblastoma states. They identify a non-catalytic role for microenvironmental PTPRZ1 in driving mesenchymal programs and extending tumor microtubes in patient tumor cells.

                Milovanović et al. uncover a mechanism by which KZFPs restrict the activity of transposon-derived cis-regulatory elements to safeguard cardiomyocyte functionality. This work extends the classical TE-KZFP paradigm, showing that developmental gene expression programs are shaped by the restriction of CRE active in other tissues.

                Alternative polyadenylation generates transcript diversity during human urothelial differentiation. Le et al. combine single-cell sequencing, spatial in situ assays, and functional reporter analyses to reveal isoform-specific regulation of protein expression and identify primate-specific sequence motifs, highlighting an underappreciated layer of post-transcriptional control in tissue biology.
