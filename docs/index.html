              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-201/v1?src=rss">Photoinitiator Systems in Dental Resin-Based Composites: Mechanisms, Performance, and Clinical Implications [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                This review summarizes current knowledge on both the most used photoinitiator system in dental resin (camphorquinone) and the alternative photoinitiator systems employed in dentistry. The review focuses on polymerization mechanisms, in vitro evaluation techniques, and factors that influence the degree of conversion and hardness of dental resin-based materials. A comprehensive electronic literature search was performed using PubMed, Google Scholar, and Elsevier databases, covering publications from 1984 to 2025. More than 30 articles were selected based on their relevance to the scope of this review. Light-activated dental resin-based composites (RBCs) represent the most widely used restorative materials in clinical practice. However, effective polymerization of each photoinitiator system depends on the use of a compatible light-curing unit with an appropriate emission spectrum. Changes in the photoinitiator system can markedly affect the biomechanical properties of dental resins, including degree of conversion, hardness, and biocompatibility. This review provides a comparative analysis of RBCs formulated with different photoinitiators, such as camphorquinone, benzophenone, 1-phenyl-1,2-propanedione, trimethylbenzoyl-diphenylphosphine oxide, and benzoyl peroxide. The main objective of this article was to highlight alternative photoinitiators capable of overcoming the color drawbacks of camphorquinone, particularly yellow discoloration, while maintaining comparable mechanical performance. Although current evidence suggests that no alternative photoinitiator fully matches the effectiveness of camphorquinone, certain systems—such as benzoyl germanium derivatives and novel acylphosphine oxide photoinitiators used in combination with camphorquinone—appear promising for enhancing esthetic properties and increasing the degree of conversion of dental RBCs.

                E-learning has become increasingly important, especially after the pandemic and the changes it brought about, forcing educational institutions to adopt unconventional methods to accomplish their missions. We seek in this research to understand the role of the e-learning system in promoting digital culture at the University of Fallujah to help it spread and enhance its digital culture, by supporting, identifying, and establishing appropriate mechanisms that can enable it to perform its essential role in the era of digitizing human resources. The researchers used the descriptive analytical method in completing their research, for this purpose, a questionnaire was prepared consisting of 41 questions covering the research variables distributed over a sample of these academics at the university, numbering 296 teaching staff. The researchers used the method of random intentional sampling by distributing 85 questionnaires, of which 82 were retrieved, to constitute 96% of the questionnaires valid for statistical analysis. A set of statistical methods was used to analyze the study data using the statistical package (SPSS). The research reached a set of conclusions, including that e-learning systems have a major role in enhancing digital culture within the university, especially in light of the digital orientation of universities, which requires them to spread a digital culture on a large scale so that the teaching staff can perform their duties without fear or complaint about the future and the fluctuations and rapid changes it brings, thus enhancing the university’s ability to catch up with international universities that have made great strides in this field.

                High-flow priapism is a rare, non-ischemic penile erection due to unregulated arterial inflow, usually from trauma. We report a 48-year-old male who developed high-flow priapism one day after vesicolithotripsy, with no trauma history. Despite pseudoephedrine, symptoms persisted. Examination showed a rigid, non-ischemic erection; a proximal shunt was performed after conservative measures failed. This case highlights a rare iatrogenic cause, possibly due to arterial injury from instrumentation or Foley removal. In settings without embolization access, surgical shunting remains a valid treatment. Early recognition is key to prevent complications and preserve erectile function.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-198/v1?src=rss">Gender Differences in Balance Among Physically Active Young Adults: Analysis of Anterior, Posterior, and Central Stability Tendencies [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Purpose This study aimed to investigate the effect of gender on balance performance among physically active young adults by analyzing anterior, posterior, and central stability tendencies. While balance is a multifactorial ability influenced by sensory integration and neuromuscular coordination, evidence regarding gender-specific postural strategies remains inconsistent. Methods Fifty-two healthy participants (26 males and 26 females, aged 18–25 years) who engaged in regular exercise were assessed using the Sigma Balance System (CosmoGamma, Italy). Balance performance was evaluated through a dynamic limit of stability test, and the percentage of time spent in anterior, posterior, and central zones was calculated. Independent samples t-tests and Welch’s t-tests were applied depending on variance homogeneity, with a significance level of p<.05. Results No significant gender differences were observed in anterior or posterior sway tendencies (p>.05). However, females demonstrated significantly higher centering performance than males (p=.0246, R2=.1477), indicating a moderate effect size. These findings suggest that although the general mechanisms of postural control are similar across genders, central stability strategies differ, potentially reflecting distinct neuromotor adaptations. Conclusion The results highlight that females employ more precise neuromuscular control to maintain balance within the central stability zone. This advantage may offer performance benefits in sports requiring static or semi-dynamic postures, while emphasizing the need for gender-specific balance training and rehabilitation approaches. Overall, the study contributes to understanding how gender-related biomechanical and neuromotor factors shape postural control among physically active young adults.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05971">Characterizing Human Semantic Navigation in Concept Production as Trajectories in Embedding Space</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2602.05971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semantic representations can be framed as a structured, dynamic knowledge space through which humans navigate to retrieve and manipulate meaning. To investigate how humans traverse this geometry, we introduce a framework that represents concept production as navigation through embedding space. Using different transformer text embedding models, we construct participant-specific semantic trajectories based on cumulative embeddings and extract geometric and dynamical metrics, including distance to next, distance to centroid, entropy, velocity, and acceleration. These measures capture both scalar and directional aspects of semantic navigation, providing a computationally grounded view of semantic representation search as movement in a geometric space. We evaluate the framework on four datasets across different languages, spanning different property generation tasks: Neurodegenerative, Swear verbal fluency, Property listing task in Italian, and in German. Across these contexts, our approach distinguishes between clinical groups and concept types, offering a mathematical framework that requires minimal human intervention compared to typical labor-intensive linguistic pre-processing methods. Comparison with a non-cumulative approach reveals that cumulative embeddings work best for longer trajectories, whereas shorter ones may provide too little context, favoring the non-cumulative alternative. Critically, different embedding models yielded similar results, highlighting similarities between different learned representations despite different training pipelines. By framing semantic navigation as a structured trajectory through embedding space, bridging cognitive modeling with learned representation, thereby establishing a pipeline for quantifying semantic representation dynamics with applications in clinical research, cross-linguistic analysis, and the assessment of artificial cognition.

                arXiv:2505.17329v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A major goal of neuroscience is to understand brain computations during visual processing in naturalistic settings. A dominant approach is to use image-computable deep neural networks trained with different task objectives as a basis for linear encoding models. However, in addition to requiring estimation of a large number of linear encoding parameters, this approach ignores the structure of the feature maps both in the brain and the models. Recently proposed alternatives factor the linear mapping into separate sets of spatial and feature weights, thus finding static receptive fields for units, which is appropriate only for early visual areas. In this work, we employ the attention mechanism used in the transformer architecture to study how retinotopic visual features can be dynamically routed to category-selective areas in high-level visual processing. We show that this computational motif is significantly more powerful than alternative methods in predicting brain activity during natural scene viewing, across different feature basis models and modalities. We also show that this approach is inherently more interpretable as the attention-routing signals for different high-level categorical areas can be easily visualized for any input image. Given its high performance at predicting brain responses to novel images, the model deserves consideration as a candidate mechanistic model of how visual information from retinotopic maps is routed in the human brain based on the relevance of the input content to different category-selective regions.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05466">Optimization is Not Enough: Why Problem Formulation Deserves Equal Attention</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2602.05466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Black-box optimization is increasingly used in engineering design problems where simulation-based evaluations are costly and gradients are unavailable. In this context, the optimization community has largely analyzed algorithm performance in context-free setups, while not enough attention has been devoted to how problem formulation and domain knowledge may affect the optimization outcomes. We address this gap through a case study in the topology optimization of laminated composite structures, formulated as a black-box optimization problem. Specifically, we consider the design of a cantilever beam under a volume constraint, intending to minimize compliance while optimizing both the structural topology and fiber orientations. To assess the impact of problem formulation, we explicitly separate topology and material design variables and compare two strategies: a concurrent approach that optimizes all variables simultaneously without leveraging physical insight, and a sequential approach that optimizes variables of the same nature in stages. Our results show that context-agnostic strategies consistently lead to suboptimal or non-physical designs. In contrast, the sequential strategy yields better-performing and more interpretable solutions. These findings underscore the value of incorporating, when available, domain knowledge into the optimization process and motivate the development of new black-box benchmarks that reward physically informed and context-aware optimization strategies.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05675">Variable Search Stepsize for Randomized Local Search in Multi-Objective Combinatorial Optimization</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2602.05675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past two decades, research in evolutionary multi-objective optimization has predominantly focused on continuous domains, with comparatively limited attention given to multi-objective combinatorial optimization problems (MOCOPs). Combinatorial problems differ significantly from continuous ones in terms of problem structure and landscape. Recent studies have shown that on MOCOPs multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) can even be outperformed by simple randomised local search. Starting with a randomly sampled solution in search space, randomised local search iteratively draws a random solution (from an archive) to perform local variation within its neighbourhood. However, in most existing methods, the local variation relies on a fixed neighbourhood, which limits exploration and makes the search easy to get trapped in local optima. In this paper, we present a simple yet effective local search method, called variable stepsize randomized local search (VS-RLS), which adjusts the stepsize during the search. VS-RLS transitions gradually from a broad, exploratory search in the early phases to a more focused, fine-grained search as the search progresses. We demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of VS-RLS through extensive evaluations against local search and MOEAs methods on diverse MOCOPs.

                arXiv:2602.05848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: DARWIN is an evolutionary GPT model, utilizing a genetic-algorithm like optimization structure with several independent GPT agents being trained individually using unique training code. Each iteration, the GPT models are prompted to modify the training code of one another in an attempt to improve their performance in a mutation-like manner, and the best GPT agents are then benchmarked and selected for the next iteration by genetic algorithm. For demonstration purposes and due to budget and time constraints, OpenAI API is used to prompt training code improvements and the nanoGPT framework is used as the training code. DARWIN also utilizes persistent JSON-based memory files to track previous reasoning and changes to code to correlate with improvement to model performance. and a bidirectional interface for HITL intervention allowing the model to request upgrades such as additional datasets, training scripts, and restructuring of file hierarchies. In experiments, DARWIN achieved a 1.26 percent improvement in model FLOPS utilization (MFU) and a 2.07 percent improvement to perplexity in 5 iterations of training over baseline configurations, demonstrating promising capabilities as a foundation for scaling evolutionary GPT training.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04911">A logical re-conception of neural networks: Hamiltonian bitwise part-whole architecture</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2602.04911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a simple initial working system in which relations (such as part-whole) are directly represented via an architecture with operating and learning rules fundamentally distinct from standard artificial neural network methods. Arbitrary data are straightforwardly encoded as graphs whose edges correspond to codes from a small fixed primitive set of elemental pairwise relations, such that simple relational encoding is not an add-on, but occurs intrinsically within the most basic components of the system. A novel graph-Hamiltonian operator calculates energies among these encodings, with ground states denoting simultaneous satisfaction of all relation constraints among graph vertices. The method solely uses radically low-precision arithmetic; computational cost is correspondingly low, and scales linearly with the number of edges in the data. The resulting unconventional architecture can process standard ANN examples, but also produces representations that exhibit characteristics of symbolic computation. Specifically, the method identifies simple logical relational structures in these data (part-of; next-to), building hierarchical representations that enable abductive inferential steps generating relational position-based encodings, rather than solely statistical representations. Notably, an equivalent set of ANN operations are derived, identifying a special case of embedded vector encodings that may constitute a useful approach to current work in higher-level semantic representation. The very simple current state of the implemented system invites additional tools and improvements.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05737">Neuro-Inspired Visual Pattern Recognition via Biological Reservoir Computing</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2602.05737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a neuro-inspired approach to reservoir computing (RC) in which a network of in vitro cultured cortical neurons serves as the physical reservoir. Rather than relying on artificial recurrent models to approximate neural dynamics, our biological reservoir computing (BRC) system leverages the spontaneous and stimulus-evoked activity of living neural circuits as its computational substrate. A high-density multi-electrode array (HD-MEA) provides simultaneous stimulation and readout across hundreds of channels: input patterns are delivered through selected electrodes, while the remaining ones capture the resulting high-dimensional neural responses, yielding a biologically grounded feature representation. A linear readout layer (single-layer perceptron) is then trained to classify these reservoir states, enabling the living neural network to perform static visual pattern-recognition tasks within a computer-vision framework. We evaluate the system across a sequence of tasks of increasing difficulty, ranging from pointwise stimuli to oriented bars, clock-digit-like shapes, and handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. Despite the inherent variability of biological neural responses-arising from noise, spontaneous activity, and inter-session differences-the system consistently generates high-dimensional representations that support accurate classification. These results demonstrate that in vitro cortical networks can function as effective reservoirs for static visual pattern recognition, opening new avenues for integrating living neural substrates into neuromorphic computing frameworks. More broadly, this work contributes to the effort to incorporate biological principles into machine learning and supports the goals of neuro-inspired vision by illustrating how living neural systems can inform the design of efficient and biologically grounded computational models.

Abstract: We establish a theoretical connection between wavelet transforms and spiking neural networks through scale-space theory. We rely on the scale-covariant guarantees in the leaky integrate-and-fire neurons to implement discrete mother wavelets that approximate continuous wavelets. A reconstruction experiment demonstrates the feasibility of the approach and warrants further analysis to mitigate current approximation errors. Our work suggests a novel spiking signal representation that could enable more energy-efficient signal processing algorithms.

                arXiv:2504.15371v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neuromorphic event cameras possess superior temporal resolution, power efficiency, and dynamic range compared to traditional cameras. However, their asynchronous and sparse data format poses a significant challenge for conventional deep learning methods. Existing methods either convert the events into dense synchronous frame representations for processing by powerful CNNs or Transformers, but lose the asynchronous, sparse and high temporal resolution characteristics of events during the conversion process; or adopt irregular models such as sparse convolution, spiking neural networks, or graph neural networks to process the irregular event representations but fail to take full advantage of GPU acceleration. Inspired by word-to-vector models, we draw an analogy between words and events to introduce event2vec, a novel representation that allows neural networks to process events directly. This approach is fully compatible with the parallel processing capabilities of Transformers. We demonstrate the effectiveness of event2vec on the DVS Gesture, ASL-DVS, and DVS-Lip benchmarks, showing that event2vec is remarkably parameter-efficient, features high throughput and low latency, and achieves high accuracy even with an extremely low number of events or low spatial resolutions. Event2vec introduces a novel paradigm by demonstrating for the first time that sparse, irregular event data can be directly integrated into high-throughput Transformer architectures. This breakthrough resolves the long-standing conflict between maintaining data sparsity and maximizing GPU efficiency, offering a promising balance for real-time, low-latency neuromorphic vision tasks. The code is provided in https://github.com/Intelligent-Computing-Lab-Panda/event2vec.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04661">Flexible inference for animal learning rules using neural networks</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2509.04661v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding how animals learn is a central challenge in neuroscience, with growing relevance to the development of animal- or human-aligned artificial intelligence. However, existing approaches tend to assume fixed parametric forms for the learning rule (e.g., Q-learning, policy gradient), which may not accurately describe the complex forms of learning employed by animals in realistic settings. Here we address this gap by developing a framework to infer learning rules directly from behavioral data collected during de novo task learning. We assume that animals follow a decision policy parameterized by a generalized linear model (GLM), and we model their learning rule -- the mapping from task covariates to per-trial weight updates -- using a deep neural network (DNN). This formulation allows flexible, data-driven inference of learning rules while maintaining an interpretable form of the decision policy itself. To capture more complex learning dynamics, we introduce a recurrent neural network (RNN) variant that relaxes the Markovian assumption that learning depends solely on covariates of the current trial, allowing for learning rules that integrate information over multiple trials. Simulations demonstrate that the framework can recover ground-truth learning rules. We applied our DNN and RNN-based methods to a large behavioral dataset from mice learning to perform a sensory decision-making task and found that they outperformed traditional RL learning rules at predicting the learning trajectories of held-out mice. The inferred learning rules exhibited reward-history-dependent learning dynamics, with larger updates following sequences of rewarded trials. Overall, these methods provide a flexible framework for inferring learning rules from behavioral data in de novo learning tasks, setting the stage for improved animal training protocols and the development of behavioral digital twins.

                arXiv:2510.02345v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Large Language Models (LLMs) face a trilemma of load imbalance, parameter redundancy, and communication overhead. We introduce a unified framework based on dynamic expert clustering and structured compression to address these issues cohesively. Our method employs an online clustering procedure that periodically regroups experts using a fused metric of parameter and activation similarity, which stabilizes expert utilization. To our knowledge, this is one of the first frameworks to leverage the semantic embedding capability of the router to dynamically reconfigure the model's architecture during training for substantial efficiency gains. Within each cluster, we decompose expert weights into a shared base matrix and extremely low-rank residual adapters, achieving up to fivefold parameter reduction per group while preserving specialization. This structure enables a two-stage hierarchical routing strategy: tokens are first assigned to a cluster, then to specific experts within it, drastically reducing the routing search space and the volume of all-to-all communication. Furthermore, a heterogeneous precision scheme, which stores shared bases in FP16 and residual factors in INT4, coupled with dynamic offloading of inactive clusters, reduces peak memory consumption to levels comparable to dense models. Evaluated on GLUE and WikiText-103, our framework matches the quality of standard MoE models while reducing total parameters by approximately 80%, improving throughput by 10% to 20%, and lowering expert load variance by a factor of over three. Our work demonstrates that structural reorganization is a principled path toward scalable, efficient, and memory-effective MoE LLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/szdtzpj/Breaking_the_moe_trilemma

                <p>The dorsomedial striatum (DMS) is critical for both motivating and inhibiting behavioral responses. The region integrates inputs from the cortex, thalamus, and other subcortical structures including midbrain dopamine neurons. Though less studied, serotonin neurons from the dorsal raphe nucleus also richly innervate the DMS, which expresses nearly all 14 serotonin receptor subtypes. Slice electrophysiology shows that the serotonin 1B receptor (5-HT1BR) impacts DMS physiology and plasticity, and behavioral experiments show that 5-HT1BR expression modulates impulsivity and other DMS-dependent reward-related behaviors. In these studies, our goal was to investigate the effects of 5-HT1BR on the DMS in vivo. Using a genetic 5-HT1BR loss-of-function mouse model, we examined calcium activity of individual medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in the DMS of both males and females during operant tasks focusing on responses to actions, reward, and waiting. We found that knock-out of 5-HT1BRs resulted in different effects on MSN calcium activity depending on behavioral state. Specifically, mice lacking 5-HT1BRs showed significantly more inhibition of MSN calcium activity during the rewards, but more cells with excitatory calcium responses during the delay period of the trial. This suggests that serotonin, acting via 5-HT1BRs, may recruit MSN activity in response to reward but inhibit MSN activity during waiting. These results highlight the importance of in vivo studies for understanding the functional role of DMS serotonin in reward-related behavior. Overall our results demonstrate that serotonin can modulate the DMS in a behavioral state-specific manner, potentially providing a mechanism for how serotonin effects on behavior are context dependent.</p>

                <p>Gamma oscillations (40&ndash;140&nbsp;Hz) play a fundamental role in neural coordination and cognitive functions in the medial entorhinal cortex (mEC). While previous studies suggest that pyramidal&ndash;interneuron network gamma (PING) and interneuron network gamma (ING) mechanisms contribute to these oscillations, the precise role of inhibitory circuits remains unclear. Using optogenetic stimulation and whole-cell electrophysiology in acute mouse brain slices, we examined synaptic input and spike timing in neurons across layer II/III mEC. We found that fast-spiking interneurons exhibited robust gamma-frequency firing, while excitatory neurons engaged in gamma cycle skipping. Stellate and pyramidal cells received minimal recurrent excitation, whereas fast-spiking interneurons received strong excitatory input. Both excitatory neurons and fast-spiking interneurons received gamma-frequency inhibition, emphasizing the role of recurrent inhibition in gamma rhythms. Gamma activity was reduced but persisted after AMPA/kainate receptor blockade, indicating that interneurons can sustain oscillations via an ING mechanism. Selective activation of PV+ interneurons confirmed their ability to sustain fast gamma inhibition autonomously. To further assess the interplay of excitation and inhibition, we developed computational network models constrained by our experimental data. Simulations revealed that weak excitatory input to interneurons supports fast ING-dominated rhythms (~100&ndash;140&nbsp;Hz) while strengthening excitatory drive induces a transition to slower PING-dominated oscillations (60&ndash;100&nbsp;Hz), although this regime shift was not observed consistently after AMPA/kainate receptor block. These findings highlight the dominant role of inhibitory circuits in sustaining gamma rhythms, demonstrate how excitation strength tunes the oscillatory regime, and refine models of entorhinal gamma oscillations critical for spatial memory processing.</p>

In drug discovery and therapeutic research, the prediction of drug-disease associations (DDAs) holds significant scientific and clinical value. Drug molecules exert their effects by precisely identifying disease-related biological targets, systematically modulating the entire pharmacological process from absorption, distribution, and metabolism to final efficacy. Accurate prediction of drug-disease associations not only facilitates an in-depth understanding of molecular mechanisms of drug action but also provides critical theoretical foundations for drug repositioning and personalized medicine. While traditional prediction methods based on in vitro experiments and clinical statistics yield reliable results, they suffer from inherent drawbacks such as long development cycles, substantial resource consumption, and low throughput. In contrast, emerging machine learning techniques offer a promising solution to these bottlenecks, enabling the intelligent and efficient discovery of potential drug–disease association networks and significantly improving drug development efficiency. However, it is noteworthy that existing machine learning methods still face significant challenges in practical applications: the complexity of feature construction raises the threshold for data processing; data sparsity constrains the depth of information mining; and the pervasive issue of sample imbalance poses a severe challenge to the model’s predictive accuracy and generalization performance. In this study, we developed an efficient and accurate framework for drug-disease association prediction named FKSUDDAPre. The model employs a multi-modal feature fusion strategy: on one hand, it leverages an ensemble of Mol2vec and K- BERT to deeply capture the semantic features of drug molecular fingerprints; on the other hand, it integrates Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) with DeepWalk to effectively reduce the dimensionality of disease features while preserving their relational structure. To address the class imbalance problem, FKSUDDAPre designed an optimization algorithm called AMDKSU, which combined clustering with an improved distance metric strategy, significantly enhancing the discriminative power of the sample set. For data processing, F-test was employed for feature importance ranking, effectively reducing data dimensionality and improving model generalization. For the predictive architecture, FKSUDDAPre proposed a novel ensemble framework composed of XGBoost, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and HyperFast. By employing a dynamic weight allocation strategy, this ensemble effectively harnesses the complementary strengths of these models to achieve significantly enhanced predictive performance. Rigorous validation demonstrated the system’s outstanding performance across multiple evaluation metrics, with an average AUC of 0.9725, improving the AUC by approximately 3.88% compared to the best-performing baseline model. In the prediction of Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease, 80% and 60% of the top 10 candidate drugs recommended by FKSUDDAPre, respectively, had been confirmed by literature, demonstrating the model’s good practical application potential. Furthermore, we conducted a LIME-based feature importance analysis on the model’s predictions, visualizing the correlations between features and the target variable to demonstrate the model’s interpretability. A cross-platform, user-friendly visualization tool had also been developed using the PyQt5 framework.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3003600">Human newborns form musical predictions based on rhythmic but not melodic structure</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Roberta Bianco, Brigitta Tóth, Felix Bigand, Trinh Nguyen, István Sziller, Gábor P. Háden, István Winkler, Giacomo Novembre</p>

The ability to anticipate rhythmic and melodic structures in music is considered a fundamental human trait, present across all cultures and predating linguistic comprehension in human development. Yet, it remains unclear the extent to which this ability is already developed at birth. Here, we used temporal response functions to assess rhythmic and melodic neural encoding in newborns (<i>N</i> = 49) exposed to classical monophonic musical pieces (real condition) and control stimuli with shuffled tones and inter-onset intervals (shuffled condition). We computationally quantified context-based rhythmic and melodic expectations and dissociated these high-level processes from low-level acoustic tracking, such as local changes in timing and pitch. We observed encoding of probabilistic <i>rhythmic</i> expectations only in response to real but not shuffled music. This proves newborns’ ability to rely on rhythmic statistical regularities to generate musical expectations. We found no evidence for the tracking of <i>melodic</i> information, demonstrating a downweighting of this dimension compared to the rhythmic one. This study provides neurophysiological evidence that the capacity to track statistical regularities in music is present at birth and driven by rhythm. Melodic tracking, in contrast, may receive more weight through development with exposure to signals relevant to communication, such as speech and music.

                <p>by Shotaro Numano, Chris Frith, Masahiko Haruno</p>

Bargaining is a fundamental social behavior in which individuals often accept unfair offers. Traditional behavioral models, based solely on choice data, typically interpret such acceptance as simple reward-maximization. However, regulating inequity aversion may also play a critical role in these decisions. Incorporating response time alongside choice data allows us to quantify participants’ internal mental effort when deciding to accept unfair offers. We conducted functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while participants played the ultimatum game, deciding within 10 s whether to accept or reject monetary offers from a proposer. Using the drift diffusion model (DDM), we quantified decision-making dynamics based on both choice and response time. Participants with lower levels of behavioral disadvantageous inequity (DI) aversion (reflected by a lower DDM weight for DI) showed stronger neural representations of DI in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC). Functional connectivity analysis revealed a negative correlation between the dACC and bilateral ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC) when DI was high. This connectivity predicted both rejection rates and response times associated with the acceptance of DI offers. Furthermore, robust linear regression showed that only dACC-vlPFC connectivity—not reward-related activity—explained both the rejection rates and response times. Finally, right vlPFC activity correlated with amygdala activity under high DI conditions. These findings suggest that the dACC plays a key role in regulating responses to DI, thereby facilitating the acceptance of unfair offers.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-197/v1?src=rss">Financial Development, Governance, and Environmental Pressures in Health Expenditure Dynamics, Evidence from DCE and Asymmetric NARDL Models [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Rising health expenditure has become a persistent challenge in middle-income economies. Rapid industrial growth, expanding financial systems, and weak environmental controls place growing pressure on public and private healthcare budgets. Understanding how finance, governance related channels, and environmental stress interact with health spending remains limited. Motivation You need evidence that links economic structure, environmental pressure, and financial development to health expenditure over the long run. This study responds to that gap by examining lower-middle- and upper-middle-income countries over the period 1995 to 2023, with attention to asymmetric and cross-country dynamics. Findings Health expenditure rises with industrialisation, foreign direct investment, carbon dioxide emissions, financial development, and trade openness. A 10 percent increase in industrial output raises health spending by about 1.8 percent. The same increase in foreign direct investment and trade openness increases health spending by roughly 1.5 percent and 1.6 percent. Carbon dioxide emissions exert the strongest effect. A 10 percent increase raises healthcare costs by nearly 6.7 percent. Renewable energy consumption reduces health expenditure. A 10 percent increase lowers health spending by about 1.7 percent. Results remain stable under DCE, DCE-IV, and asymmetric NARDL estimations. Implications You should treat health expenditure as a downstream outcome of financial expansion, environmental stress, and governance related policy choices. Stronger environmental regulation, cleaner energy transition, and finance aligned with sustainability can ease long-run healthcare burdens. Integrating health, energy, and financial policies can support fiscal stability and sustainable development in middle-income economies.

                Abstract* Background The fashion industry is undergoing a digital transformation, creating a pressing demand for digital fashion skills in Green TVET. However, a comprehensive mapping of sustainability-oriented digital fashion skills and their relationship to vocational teacher competency frameworks is still limited. The research conducted in this paper aims to map trends in existing research and identify key digital fashion skills that should be taught in Green TVET, which will be used in designing a digital fashion skills framework for future vocational teachers. Methods The method used was a systematic literature review (SLR) using the PRISMA 2020 guidelines. Additionally, bibliometric analysis was used to examine research patterns and the evolution of themes. As a result, 62 peer-reviewed journal articles indexed in Scopus and published between 2021 and 2025 were included according to predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Results The core skill domains identified in the digital fashion world for future vocational education teachers in Green TVET resulted in eight skills: 1) Digital Design Skills, 2) Digital Pattern Skills, 3) Digital Production Skills, 4) Digital Sustainability Skills, 5) Digital Ethics & Data Security Skills, 6) Digital Learning & Pedagogy Skills, 7) Digital Communication & Marketing Skills, and 8) Digital Entrepreneurship Skills. Overall, these domains form a competency framework that encompasses the technical, cognitive, and pedagogical dimensions of sustainability-oriented vocational fashion teachers. Conclusion This study provides a robust, evidence-based foundation for transforming the fashion vocational curriculum, creating professional development schemes, and strengthening policy measures targeting the development of digital and green skills in vocational education and training (TVET). The proposed framework paves the way for training the next generation of fashion teachers who are ready to face the challenges of digitalization and sustainability.

                Background The study is intended to assess the effects of the professional development program on the competence of vocational teachers, which is implemented by the Directorate General of Vocational Education, Ministry of Primary and Secondary Education in Indonesia (MoPSE) from 2020 to 2023. The study aimed to gather teachers’ perspectives on their perceptions of motivation, skills, values, and attitudes following the training program. The participants engaged in three cycles of training development programs. This study will regard the levels of the Kirkpatrick model as equivalent, without any hierarchical distinction. Method The research employed a quantitative design utilising a longitudinal approach. The three stages of Kirkpatrick assessment were utilised to assess the program’s impacts, progressing from level 1 to level 3. The data is gathered by a survey method with a Likert-scale questionnaire. A total of 944 educators engaged in this survey. They originated from 34 provinces in Indonesia. The data was evaluated utilising percentage data analysis. Result The results indicated that, across level 1 - reaction, level 2 - skill, and level 3 - values and attitudes, the majority of participants fell within the positive spectrum (strongly agree and agree). The level of concordance among all assessed indices exceeded 90%. The conducted training programs were highly acceptable to the majority of participants. The participants believe that the training significantly enhances their motivation and skills, positively influencing their values and attitudes. Conclusion The results indicate that the programs had significant effects on the participants. Such initiatives should not be executed as one-time interventions but rather as components of a continuous, systematic strategy designed to enhance vocational teachers’ competencies over time.

                Background Many randomized trials measure a continuous outcome simultaneously at baseline and after taking the drug. For a single continuous post-treatment outcome, the sample size calculation is simple, but if there are assessments at multiple time point post-treatment then this longitudinal data may give more insights by analyzing the data using the repeated measures method. Also, if the sample size is calculated using the single time-point method for longitudinal data, it may lead to a larger than required sample size, increasing the cost and time. Methods In this research, an effort is made to determine the size of the sample for repeated measures case and then compare with the single post-baseline case. The sample sizes were examined under different scenarios for the continuous type of response variable. Under ‘Mean contrast’ and ‘Diff contrast’ the sample sizes were calculated with different correlations. These two scenarios were again examined under compound symmetry as well as discrete Auto regressive of order 1 type of correlation structure in longitudinal data. The graphical presentation is given for better visualization of the scenarios. Results The sample size required for highly correlated longitudinal data using the multi-timepoint sample size derivation method led to a smaller sample size requirement compared to the single timepoint sample size calculation method. Conclusions This study will help researchers to make better decisions in choosing the right method for sample size determination which may reduce the time and cost of conducting the experiment. Additionally, it is crucial to carefully evaluate and choose the appropriate method when the correlation is weak, as this can significantly impact the accuracy of the results. More complex correlation structures are not studied in this article but can be studied in the same fashion.

                Background Large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 are increasingly used in scientific writing, yet little is known about how AI-generated scientific titles are perceived by researchers in terms of quality. Objective To compare the perceived alignment with the abstract content (as a surrogate for perceived accuracy), appeal, and overall preference for AI-generated versus human-written scientific titles. Methods We conducted a blinded comparative study with 21 researchers from diverse academic backgrounds. A random sample of 50 original titles was selected from 10 high-impact general internal medicine journals. For each title, an alternative version was generated using GPT-4.0. Each rater evaluated 50 pairs of titles, each pair consisting of one original and one AI-generated version, without knowing the source of the titles or the purpose of the study. For each pair, raters independently assessed both titles on perceived alignment with the abstract content and appeal, and indicated their overall preference. We analyzed alignment and appeal using Wilcoxon signed-rank tests and mixed-effects ordinal logistic regressions, preferences using McNemar’s test and mixed-effects logistic regression, and inter-rater agreement with Gwet’s AC. Results AI-generated titles received significantly higher ratings for both perceived alignment with the abstract content (mean 7.9 vs. 6.7, p-value <0.001) and appeal (mean 7.1 vs. 6.7, p-value <0.001) than human-written titles. The odds of preferring an AI-generated title were 1.7 times higher (p-value =0.001), with 61.8% of 1,049 paired judgments favoring the AI version. Inter-rater agreement was moderate to substantial (Gwet’s AC: 0.54–0.70). Conclusions AI-generated titles were rated more favorably than human-written titles within the context of this study in terms of perceived alignment with the abstract content, appeal, and preference, suggesting that LLMs may enhance the effectiveness of scientific communication. These findings support the responsible integration of AI tools in research.

                Background The global shortage of primary care physicians (PCPs) poses a critical threat to healthcare accessibility and system performance in high-income countries. Previous reviews have documented a wide range of recruitment and retention (R&R) strategies, but the evidence base remains fragmented, outdated, and geographically uneven. In light of demographic transitions, the increasing burden of multimorbidity, and evolving models of care accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, an updated synthesis is needed to guide sustainable and context-sensitive workforce policies. Methods This systematic review will follow PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) 2020 guidelines and is registered with PROSPERO (International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews) (CRD420251008508). MEDLINE (via PubMed), Embase, and CENTRAL (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials), will be searched for quantitative studies published from February 2015 onward, without language restrictions. Eligible studies will evaluate interventions designed to improve the recruitment and/or retention of PCPs, medical students, or residents in high-income countries. Primary outcomes will include the number of physicians recruited or retained and the duration of retention. Secondary outcomes will cover career intentions, cost-effectiveness, physician satisfaction and well-being, and workforce stability. Two reviewers will independently conduct study selection, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment using validated NIH (National Institutes of Health) quality assessment tools. Findings will be synthesized narratively, with thematic grouping by intervention type, career stage, and contextual factors (e.g., rurality, health system model). Discussion This review will provide an updated and comprehensive assessment of R&R strategies for PCPs in high-income countries. By examining intervention logic, outcomes, and contextual modifiers, it will identify which approaches are most effective under specific conditions. The results aim to inform policymakers, educators, and workforce planners in designing targeted, scalable, and context-sensitive strategies to strengthen primary care workforce resilience.

                Background The non-coding RNAs, particularly microRNA-181a-5p target the expression of tumor necrosis factor alpha-induced protein 3 (TNFAIP3) a key negative regulator of NF-κB signaling and affect the levels of macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) and chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) in chronic myeloid leukamia (CML). Methods The study included 57 individuals with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and 33 healthy individuals. Hematological parameters (Hb, RBCs, WBCs and platelets) were assessed. The serum levels of MIF, TNFAIP3 and CXCR4 were measured using ELISA Technique. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was performed to assess miR-181a expression. The potential targets and immune associated pathways of miR-181a were predicted using bioinformatics tools including TargetScan, miRTarBase, STRING, DAVID, and Enrichr. Statistical analysis included ROC curve evaluation, Pearson correlation, and t-tests. Results Compared to controls, CML patients exhibited reduced platelets, Hb and RBC while elevated WBCs recorded. There were significantly elevated serum levels of MIF and CXCR4, and reduced levels of TNFAIP3 (p<0.01) in CML patients compared to control. Moreover, higher miR-181a expression (2.28 fold, p=0.0001) recorded in CML compared to control. Positive correlations were observed between miR-181a expression and both MIF and CXCR4 levels while TNFAIP3 exhibited a reverse correlation. ROC analysis showed that MIF (AUC = 0.873) and CXCR4 (AUC = 0.929) exhibited strong diagnostic performance while TNFAIP3 (AUC = 0.142) and miR-181a-5p (AUC = 0.201) demonstrated weak accuracy consistent with their opposite expression patterns between CML patients and healthy controls. Conclusion The findings of this study suggested that increased miR-181a expression may be associated with reduced TNFAIP3 levels and modified NF-κB related inflammatory signaling in CML. These findings support the hypothesis in which miR-181a, MIF, and CXCR4 may contribute to immune dysregulation in CML as well as diagnostic biomarkers and promising therapeutic target.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-581/v2?src=rss">Pharmacist-led prescription writing educational intervention to final-year medical students: A pre-post non-randomised longitudinal study [version 2; peer review: 3 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background Writing a medication prescription is a multifaceted skill expected of all junior doctors. However, many medical students feel a lack of preparedness and confidence after graduation. Separating the teaching of practical and clinical components may enhance understanding of the practical skills to complete a prescription. This study aimed to: (1) assess whether additional pharmacist-led multimodal education interventions change the prescribing skills of Australian final-year medical students, (2) evaluate knowledge retention a year later in the same participants as junior doctors, and (3) determine whether there is an association between self-perceived confidence to prescribe and their practical ability to write safe and legal prescriptions. This manuscript details the methods used in this novel longitudinal study. Methods This non-randomised pre-post longitudinal study was conducted in two phases. The intervention was additional pharmacist-led multimodal education on prescription writing skills for final-year medical students. The intervention group completed the pre-post and follow-up tests. This study was approved by the James Cook University Human Research Ethics Committee (approval number H9114). Discussion This paper presents the methods and protocol of an approved and funded non-randomised longitudinal study investigating the potential of additional education led by pharmacist educators to improve prescribing knowledge and skills among final-year medical students in Australia. Prescribing skills education for medical students may reduce the probability of potentially incorrect or unsafe prescribing habits as junior doctors. Education standards do not acknowledge adherence to local legal regulations when prescribing and do not recommend mandatory teaching or assessment criteria. This study reviews the effectiveness of and need for additional education on the practical skill of writing a medication prescription. If positive, the findings of this study will have practical and policy impacts that may result in long-term improvements in safe medicine practice and ultimately benefit patient care.

                Background Traumatic injuries remain critical public health concerns, placing psychosocial and economic burdens on individuals, families, and healthcare systems. Despite being a leading cause of morbidity and mortality globally, especially in low-and middle-income countries, few studies have examined predictors of injury severity in pre-hospital settings. Most research focuses on injury incidence, with limited attention to pre-hospital factors. We aimed assessing the prevalence of severe injuries and their associated factors among patients managed by pre-hospital emergency services. Methods This cross-sectional study utilized medical registry data from 1,162 RTI victims. Demographic, epidemiological, and clinical information were collected, with injuries categorized as severe or non-severe based on the Injury Severity Score. Bivariate and multivariable logistic regression models were conducted to indicate associated factors of severe injury. Results Among 1162 victims, 165 (14%) experienced severe injury. Our results showed that females were less likely to experience severe injury (aOR=0.47, 95%CI:0.26–0.79) than males. Regarding trauma mechanism, car-to-pedestrian collisions (aOR=2.3, 95%CI:1.25–4.1), car-to-motorcycle collisions considerably increased the likelihoods of severe injury (aOR=3.88, 95%CI:1.16–13.05) compared to car-only crashes. Alcohol users were more likely to experience severe injury (aOR=3.37; 95%CI: 2.04-5.56) than non-users. Those who travelled distance ranged 21-40 km had higher likelihoods (aOR=2.91, 95%CI:1.27–6.63), while those with more than 40 km faced higher likelihoods of severe injury (aOR=2.64, 95% CI:1.11–6.25) than individuals with less than 20 km to reach to a healthcare facility. Those with extremity injuries (aOR=0.28, 95% CI:0.15–0.52), chest injuries (aOR=0.40, 95%CI:0.23–0.71, p=.002) had lower likelihoods of severe injury than those with head trauma. Conclusion This study provides valuable insights into the factors influencing injury severity in the pre-hospital setting. The findings underscore the importance of strengthening early identification and rapid stabilization of high-risk patients during pre-hospital care. Future research using prospective longitudinal designs is recommended to confirm causality.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-192/v1?src=rss">Mapping Research Trends in AI-Based Tourism and Hospitality Marketing: A Bibliometric and Thematic Review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Artificial intelligence (AI) has fundamentally transformed tourism and hospitality marketing through enhanced data-driven decision-making, personalized customer experiences, and intelligent destination management. However, the field lacks a comprehensive synthesis of its intellectual landscape and thematic evolution, limiting understanding of research trajectories and emerging directions. Methods A systematic literature review following the SPAR-4-SLR procedure was conducted on 320 peer-reviewed papers published between 2003 and 2025, sourced from the Scopus database. Publication trends, leading journals, prolific authors, trending areas, and bibliographic coupling of documents and countries were visualized using bibliometric analysis tools (VOSviewer and Biblioshiny). Thematic analysis employed keyword co-occurrence networks to identify emerging research themes. Results Academic publications on AI in tourism and hospitality demonstrated a significant surge during 2017–2020, reflecting the industry’s growing emphasis on smart marketing applications. Thematic analysis identified four major research clusters: (i) Digital Influence and Tourist Behaviour Analytics; (ii) AI-Enabled Smart Tourism and Commerce Ecosystems; (iii) Technology-Driven Hospitality and Experience Innovation; and (iv) Data-Driven Decision Making in Predictive Tourism Modelling. Conclusions This bibliometric and thematic assessment reveals the evolving intellectual landscape of AI applications in tourism and hospitality marketing, documenting substantive research growth and the emergence of distinct thematic clusters that shape current and future research agendas in this dynamic field.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-189/v1?src=rss">Systematic Review of the Torsional Performance of Concrete-Filled Double Skin Steel Tube (CFDST) Members under Fire Conditions Following PRISMA Protocols [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Concrete-Filled Double Skin Steel Tubes (CFDST) have emerged as a promising composite structural system that integrates the mechanical advantages of steel and concrete while achieving enhanced energy dissipation, reduced weight, and improved post-fire resilience. Over the past two decades, substantial experimental and numerical efforts have focused on understanding the torsional and thermal performance of CFDST and related CFST members. However, an integrated synthesis of these findings under a unified systematic framework has been lacking. This study conducts a comprehensive systematic review of 37 selected experimental and analytical studies addressing the torsional and fire behavior of CFDST and CFST members, following PRISMA guidelines “the PRISMA methodology, a standardized framework for conducting systematic reviews that ensures transparency, rigorous screening, and unbiased selection of relevant studies through a structured flowchart process”. The review identifies key influencing factors, including section geometry, wall thickness, concrete type, steel grade, axial load level, and fire exposure duration. Comparative analysis reveals that torsional resistance increases with lower hollow ratios, thicker outer tubes, and confined concrete cores, while elevated temperatures significantly reduce torsional stiffness and residual strength. Despite considerable research on CFST under fire and torsion separately, the coupling effect of post-fire torsional performance remains underexplored. Based on the identified research gaps, a new experimental program is proposed to investigate the pre- and post-fire torsional performance of CFDST columns with varying cross-sections and steel thicknesses. The study concludes with future research recommendations focused on developing constitutive models, hybrid materials, and fire-torsion interaction design equations for CFDST systems.

[version</a></h4>

              
                Background Treatment-resistant chronic migraine patients constitute a heavily burdened patient population with need for novel treatment options. The sphenopalatine ganglion (SPG), located deep within the facial structures, is a synaptic junction in the trigemino-autonomic reflex that is hypothesised to play a part in migraine pathophysiology. A 2017 open-label pilot study explored the SPG as a target for onabotulinumtoxinA injections in chronic migraine using a navigation-guided injection device, demonstrating a favourable safety profile and promising response on migraine related efficacy outcomes. Methods MiBlock is a multi-centre, investigator-initiated, publicly funded, randomised, quadruple-blinded and placebo-controlled trial. Participation is voluntary and all participants must sign a written consent prior to inclusion. The study is approved by the Norwegian ethics committee and the Norwegian Medical Product Agency. Patients with treatment-resistant chronic migraine will be recruited from four Norwegian university hospitals until 170 have received study treatment. The study will investigate the efficacy of a single-session, bilateral, navigation-guided, percutaneous injection of either onabotulinumtoxinA (verum) or 0.9% NaCl (placebo) towards the SPG under local anaesthesia. The primary efficacy endpoint is the change from baseline in the frequency of moderate and severe headache days at weeks 5-8 post-injection. The primary efficacy outcome variable is collected prospectively through daily headache eDiary entries during the entire study participation. The treatment effect will be assessed by comparing the placebo and the treatment arm according to a prespecified statistical analysis plan. Discussion This trial addresses a novel treatment strategy in headache prevention. The study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of onabotulinumtoxinA injection towards the SPG in chronic migraine, but results may shed light on the feasibility of navigation-guided SPG injections in several headache disorders. Results will be published in international open-access peer-reviewed journals. Trial registration number EudraCT number: 2018-004053-24. ClinicalTrial ref: NCT04069897.

                Background The aim of this study was to investigate the knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) among scuba divers in Saudi Arabia towards equipment infection control measures, protective guidelines measures and potential post COVID-19 infection complications. Methods A cross-sectional study using a pre-validated questionnaire was conducted. The questionnaire consisted of 35 close-ended questions, which covered the scuba divers’ profile and experience, the KAP of COVID-19 precautionary measures during diving activities as well as the demographic data and background of the scuba divers. KAP scores were subjected to non-parametric tests of statistical significance (Mann Whitney and Kruskal Wallis test). Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. Results Most of the 461 participants’ answers were in agreeance on the proper KAP of infection control during the COVID-19 pandemic. There was a statistically significant difference in attitude between all the demographic and professional variables (p<0.05) except for gender and region of residence (p>0.05). In addition, there was a statistically significant practice difference among age groups, education levels, and employee status in the diving center (p<0.05). Conclusions Our findings showed that scuba divers presented a good level of KAP of infection control measures against the spread of the coronavirus disease. Local officials and diving organizations need to continue their efforts in combating and control the spread of this pandemic.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-980/v2?src=rss">Counterbalance Economics (CBE): Harnessing Aggregate Markups to Finance Voucher-Based Inequality Reduction [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background Corporate markups have risen markedly since the 1980s, widening the gap between profits and wages and fuelling income inequality. Counterbalance Economics (CBE) converts a portion of those markup rents into firm-redeemable vouchers for low-income households, promising redistribution without incurring large public budgets. This paper tests whether in-kind financed voucher scheme can neutralise the inequality effect of markups across advanced and emerging OECD economies. Methodology We assemble an unbalanced panel of 12 countries (1982–2016) that combines Study/World Bank Gini indices with De Loecker–Eeckhout aggregate markups, macro controls (log GDP per capita, terms of trade, R&D intensity, unemployment) and a newly coded CBE dummy capturing six staggered adoptions of mark-up-funded voucher programmes. A two-way fixed-effects difference-in-differences model estimates the causal impact of markups, CBE, and their interaction on inequality, controlling for country–clustered errors. Results In the absence of a policy, a 10-percentage-point rise in markups increases the Gini coefficient by 1.23 points. Where CBE is in force, the interaction term turns significantly negative implying the same markup increase now lowers the Gini by 2.9 points. Disaggregating the data reveals a more minor but still significant reduction in developed economies and a larger effect in emerging economies, consistent with higher initial inequality and weaker traditional safety nets. Placebo and pre-trend tests detect no spurious effects, and synthetic-control replications for early adopters confirm the magnitude of the effect. Conclusions Markup rents are a potent driver of inequality, yet a modest, rule-based in-kind mechanism that recycles those rents into vouchers can more than offset their distributive harm. CBE therefore emerges as a market-compatible and potentially scalable complement to progressive taxation, whose effectiveness depends on institutional capacity, regulatory oversight, and interaction with existing redistributive systems—particularly in emerging economies facing fiscal and political constraints. Future research should pair industry-level markups with micro-data on voucher use to refine targeting and assess long-run growth effects.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100966">Ly6G+ granulocytes-derived IL-17 limits protective host responses and promotes tuberculosis pathogenesis</a></h4>

              
                The protective correlates of <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> (<i>Mtb</i>) infection-elicited host immune responses are incompletely understood. Here, we report pro-pathogenic crosstalk involving Ly6G<sup>+</sup> granulocytes (Ly6G<sup>+</sup>Gra), IL-17, and COX2. We show that in the lungs of <i>Mtb</i>-infected wild-type mice, either BCG-vaccinated or not, most intracellular bacilli are Ly6G<sup>+</sup>Gra-resident 4 weeks post-infection onwards. In the genetically susceptible <i>ifng<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice, excessive Ly6G<sup>+</sup>Gra infiltration correlates with severe bacteremia. Neutralizing IL-17 (anti-IL17mAb) and COX2 inhibition by celecoxib reverse Ly6G<sup>+</sup>Gra infiltration, associated pathology, and death in <i>ifng<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice. Surprisingly, Ly6G<sup>+</sup>Gra also serves as the major source of IL-17 in the lungs of <i>Mtb</i>-infected WT or <i>ifng<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice. The IL-17-COX2-Ly6G<sup>+</sup>Gra interplay also operates in WT mice. Inhibiting RORγt, the key transcription factor for IL-17 production or COX2, reduces the bacterial burden in Ly6G<sup>+</sup>Gra, leading to reduced bacterial burden and pathology in the lungs of WT mice. In the <i>Mtb</i>-infected WT mice, COX2 inhibition abrogates IL-17 levels in the lung homogenates and significantly enhances BCG’s protective efficacy, mainly by targeting the Ly6G<sup>+</sup>Gra-resident <i>Mtb</i> pool, a phenotype also observed when IL-17 is blocked by RORγt inhibitor. Furthermore, in pulmonary TB patients, high neutrophil count and IL-17 correlated with adverse treatment outcomes. Together, our results suggest that IL-17 and PGE2 are the negative correlates of protection, and we propose targeting the pro-pathogenic IL-17-COX2-Ly6G<sup>+</sup>Gra axis for TB prevention and therapy.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/106910">A high-resolution, easy-to-build light-sheet microscope for subcellular imaging</a></h4>

              
                Although several open-source, easy-to-assemble light-sheet microscope platforms already exist—such as mesoSPIM, OpenSPIM, and OpenSpin—they are optimized for imaging large specimens and lack the resolution required to visualize subcellular features, such as organelles or cytoskeletal architectures. In contrast, lattice light-sheet microscopy (LLSM) achieves the resolution necessary to resolve such fine structures but, in its open-source implementation, can be alignment- and maintenance-intensive, often requiring specialist expertise. To address this gap, we developed Altair light-sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM), a high-resolution, open-source, sample-scanning light-sheet microscope specifically designed for subcellular imaging. By optimizing the optical pathway in silico, we created a custom baseplate that greatly simplifies alignment and assembly. The system integrates streamlined optoelectronics and optomechanics with seamless operation through our open-source software, <i>navigate</i>. Altair-LSFM achieves lateral and axial resolutions of approximately 235 and 350 nm, respectively, across a 266 µm field of view after deconvolution. We validate the system’s capabilities by imaging sub-diffraction fluorescent nanospheres and visualizing fine structural details in mammalian cells, including microtubules, actin filaments, nuclei, and Golgi apparatus. We further demonstrate its live-cell imaging capabilities by visualizing microtubules and vimentin intermediate filaments in actively migrating cells.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/106917">Dorsoventral-mediated Shh induction is required for axolotl limb regeneration</a></h4>

              
                Axolotls (<i>Ambystoma mexicanum</i>) exhibit a remarkable ability to regenerate limbs. Classical experiments have suggested that contact between cells derived from distinct orientations—dorsal, ventral, anterior, and posterior—within the regenerating blastema is necessary for accurate limb pattern formation. However, the molecular basis for this requirement has remained largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that both dorsal and ventral tissues are required for limb formation via induction of <i>Shh</i> expression, which plays a crucial role in limb patterning. Using the accessory limb model, we induced position-specific blastemas lacking cells derived from a single orientation (anterior, posterior, dorsal, or ventral). Limb patterning occurred only in blastemas containing both dorsal- and ventral-derived cells. We further observed that <i>Shh</i> expression requires dorsoventral contact within a blastema, highlighting the necessity of dorsoventral contact for inducing <i>Shh</i> expression. Additionally, we identified WNT10B and FGF2 as dorsal- and ventral-mediated signals, respectively, that create the inductive environment for <i>Shh</i> expression. Our findings clarify the role of dorsal and ventral cells in inducing <i>Shh</i>, a mechanism that has rarely been studied in the context of limb regeneration and pattern formation. This model provides new insights into how cells with different positional identities drive the regeneration process.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/108666">ZFT is the major iron and zinc transporter in Toxoplasma gondii</a></h4>

              
                Transition metals, such as iron and zinc, are indispensable trace elements for eukaryotic life, acting as co-factors in essential processes ranging from metabolism to DNA replication. These metals can be transported into cells by an evolutionary-conserved family of metal transporters; however, how the ubiquitous mammalian parasite <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i> acquires essential metals has been unknown. Here, we have identified and characterised the first iron and zinc importer in <i>T. gondii</i>. This transporter, named ZFT, localised to the parasite plasma membrane and is essential for the parasite’s life cycle. We find ZFT is regulated by iron availability and overexpression sensitises cells to excess iron and zinc. Using a conditional knockdown system, we find that knockdown of ZFT leads to reduction in mitochondrial respiration and a switch to a more quiescent lifecycle stage. To confirm transport activity, we find that knockdown of ZFT leads to a reduction in parasite-associated zinc and iron, and ZFT expression complements loss of zinc transporter activity in a yeast model. Further, expression of ZFT in <i>Xenopus</i> oocytes demonstrates direct uptake of iron, which is outcompeted in the presence of zinc. Overall, we have identified the first metal uptake transporter in <i>T. gondii</i> and demonstrated the importance of iron and zinc to the parasite. This finding advances our understanding of how this obligate intracellular parasite acquires nutrients from its host.

">Ripples precede insight in the right human hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                Insight is a sudden transition from uncertainty to awareness of a solution, often preceded by non-conscious processing. Despite the ubiquity of insights in human cognition, the neural mechanisms underlying this pre-conscious restructuring phase remain largely unknown. Recent theoretical frameworks suggest that the hippocampus, through its capacity for rapid associative retrieval and flexible recombination of stored representations, may facilitate the non-conscious exploration that precedes insight. Hippocampal ripples associated with memory replay and consolidation, represent a promising candidate mechanism for this process. We recorded intracranial local field potentials from depth electrodes in the hippocampus of ten patients with drug-resistant epilepsy while they performed non-verbal reasoning tasks. Participants indicated the moment of solution awareness via button press, enabling precise temporal alignment of neural activity to subjective insight. We observed a significant increase in ripple rate during a pre-response window. Critically, this effect was lateralized to the right hippocampus. These findings provide the first direct human electrophysiological evidence linking right-lateralized hippocampal ripples to the non-conscious phase of insight. We propose that right hippocampal ripples support rapid retrieval and flexible recombination of representations, potentially triggering cortical processes that culminate in conscious solution awareness.

">A consensus spinal cord cell type atlas across mouse, macaque, and human</a></h4>

              
                The spinal cord contains evolutionarily conserved cell types critical for motor function, sensory processing, and autonomic regulation, many of which are implicated in diverse neurological diseases and injuries. Yet the field lacks a comprehensive molecular characterization of cellular diversity in human, macaque, and mouse spinal cord. Here, we present a unified, cross-species cell type atlas based on the integration of single-nucleus gene expression, chromatin accessibility, and spatial transcriptomic data from segments within cervical, thoracic, lumbar, and sacral regions, including motor neurons (MNs) sampled across the entire rostro-caudal axis of the macaque spinal cord. Leveraging the spatial distributions of our molecularly defined cell types, we generated a cell type-guided anatomical map of spinal cord laminae and nuclei. We identified both conserved and species-specific cellular features, including gene expression patterns across distinct MN subtypes in the primate spinal cord. Cross-species cis-regulatory analysis and deep learning sequence models dissected the enhancer logic underlying viral targeting, uncovering conserved transcription factor grammar encoding cellular identity. Together, these results establish a unifying molecular and anatomical taxonomy of spinal cord cell types across species.

">Astrocyte-induced internal state transitions reshape brainwide sensory, integrative, and motor computations</a></h4>

              
                Animals rapidly adapt to changing circumstances by shifting how they perceive, integrate, and act. Such flexibility is often attributed to transitions between internal states that exert widespread influence across the brain. Yet the mechanisms that drive state transitions and how they reconfigure brainwide computation remain unclear. Larval zebrafish, when actions are rendered futile by decoupling visual flow feedback from swimming in virtual reality, enter a temporary passive, energy-preserving state. In this state, astrocyte calcium levels are elevated, and swim reinitiation requires greater accumulated visual motion. Using whole-brain, cellular-resolution activity imaging, we observed widespread circuit alterations underlying this disengaged state: neuronal visual responses weakened, visual motion integration over time became dramatically leakier, motor inhibition increased, and motor preparation slowed, together suppressing conversion of sensory evidence into action. Astrocyte calcium rose during futile swimming, tracked the emergence and resolution of these brainwide changes, and was both necessary and sufficient to drive them. Thus, astrocytes orchestrate internal states that profoundly reshape neural computations, most powerfully at intermediate integrative processing stages, to meet changing demands.

">Early face deprivation leads to long-lasting deficits in cortical face processing</a></h4>

              
                Experience-dependent plasticity in early sensory cortex is restricted to critical periods that occur early in development. In contrast, when during development higher-order cortical areas show experience-dependent plasticity remains unclear. In the primate ventral visual stream, face-selective cortex emerges with experience during development, providing a powerful system for testing how the timing of experience shapes higher-order representations. Here, we leveraged a unique macaque model of selective face deprivation followed by years of normal face exposure to causally test late plasticity in higher-order visual cortex. We found that face-deprived monkeys acquire face-directed viewing behavior and neural face selectivity after post-deprivation exposure. However, their neural representations retained lasting signatures of early experience, including mixed face and hand selectivity and impaired tuning for face identity, expression, and viewpoint. These findings demonstrate that higher-order visual cortex remains plastic beyond early development, but that the timing of experience fundamentally constrains the refinement of later-acquired neural representations.

">The Theta Paradox - Delayed Reduction of Frontal Midline Theta Following Downregulation Neurofeedback Training</a></h4>

              
                Phasic increase of frontal midline theta (Fm theta) has been described as a key indicator of cognitive processing, while relatively lower task-related Fm theta is associated with reduced cognitive strain, reflecting less intensive cognitive processing. In a previous investigation, reduced task-related Fm theta in relation to higher expertise, as well as higher setting anticipation performance in the domain of volleyball was identified. In the present study a single-session sham-controlled neurofeedback training (NFT) intervention was conducted to investigate the feasibility of Fm theta downregulation for the improvement of volleyball setting anticipation. A total of 24 volleyball novices was allocated to "Real" (n = 12) and "Sham" (n = 12) Fm theta downregulation NFT groups. NFT-related Fm theta, pre-/post-NFT setting anticipation task performance and task-related Fm theta, as well as resting EEG activity were analyzed. Incongruous with our expectations, the Real NFT group showed a tendency toward stronger Fm theta synchronization compared with the Sham group during NFT. Anticipation task performance did not change significantly from before to after NFT in both groups, yet a significant reduction of task-related Fm theta was observed in the Real NFT group following NFT. A post-NFT rebound of Fm theta could be responsible for this result. With our findings we provide further evidence for the existence of an apparent paradox of Fm theta downregulation, in which cognitive control mechanisms, associated with oscillatory Fm theta activity, appear to hinder explicit downregulation of Fm theta through classical neurofeedback learning mechanisms.

                Efforts to rejuvenate age-related cognitive decline have predominantly targeted neurons, often overlooking non-neuronal cell types in the aging brain. Here, we show that countering alterations in oligodendrocyte-derived extracellular matrix (ECM) in the aging hippocampus restores cognition. We identify broad age-associated transcriptional and proteomic changes in oligodendrocytes, including dysregulation of the matrisome, with marked upregulation of ECM components and associated regulators with age. Among these, we detect an increase in Hyaluronan and proteoglycan link protein 2 (HAPLN2), an oligodendrocyte-derived core matrisome protein that locates specifically at the nodes of Ranvier, in the hippocampus of aged mice and older humans. Hapln2 overexpression in oligodendrocytes of young mice recapitulated age-related memory impairments. Conversely, abrogating the age-related increase in Hapln2 induced synaptic plasticity-related hippocampal transcriptional signatures and improved memory in aged mice. Together, these data define oligodendrocyte-derived ECM remodeling as a hallmark of brain aging that can be targeted to rescue cognitive decline.

">Circuit organization of the forelimb-related M2-to-M1 corticocortical pathway in the mouse</a></h4>

              
                Communication from secondary (M2, premotor) to primary (M1) motor cortex is implicated in forelimb motor control. We investigated the underlying synaptic circuits in this corticocortical pathway in male and female mice using cell-type-specific optogenetic-electrophysiology methods, focusing on identifying the cell-type-specific synaptic connections in the excitatory and feedforward inhibitory circuits impinging on cervically projecting M1 corticospinal neurons. In forelimb M1 brain slices, recordings from layer 5B corticospinal neurons during brief photostimulation of M2 axons showed strong monosynaptic excitatory currents that, although accompanied by potent feedforward inhibitory currents, were capable of evoking action potentials (APs) in most neurons. In contrast, responses in layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons were generally much weaker. Parvalbumin-expressing neurons (PV), particularly in deeper layers, showed direct excitation from M2 axons without feedforward inhibition, and could fire APs robustly. Somatostatin (SST) neurons received generally weak inputs, whereas VIP and Ndnf neurons received stronger excitation and inhibition from M2 axons. Corticospinal neurons received little or no local inhibition from Ndnf and VIP interneurons, but relatively strong soma-targeting PV and dendrite-targeting SST inhibitory inputs, as functionally imaged by laser-scanning synaptic input mapping (sCRACM). The domains of PV and SST inputs were partly overlapping around the corticospinal somata, but broader for PV and more vertical for SST inputs. Collectively, the results provide a working model for the cell-type-specific synaptic circuits of this top-down corticocortical pathway, organized around direct M2 excitation and PV-mediated inhibition of M1 corticospinal neurons.

">Multi-echo BOLD fMRI improves cerebrovascular reactivity estimates in stroke</a></h4>

              
                Cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR), the ability of cerebral blood vessels to dilate or constrict in response to a vasoactive stimulus, is a clinically meaningful measure of cerebrovascular health. Head motion and other noise sources substantially impact CVR quality, particularly in clinical populations. In this study, we evaluated multi-echo fMRI techniques, including optimal combination of echoes (ME-OC) and multi-echo independent component analysis (ME-ICA), for improving CVR quality relative to single-echo fMRI in participants with stroke. In a breath-hold fMRI dataset, ME-OC significantly improved CVR quality metrics and reduced the percentage of negative CVR values in normal-appearing gray and white matter (p<0.05). ME-ICA reduced the dependence of BOLD signals on head motion but did not improve CVR quality metrics. In a separate resting-state dataset, ME-OC effects were largely consistent with the breath-hold dataset, but ME-ICA also significantly improved CVR quality metrics and reduced negative CVR values in normal-appearing gray and white matter relative to ME-OC (p<0.05). These findings demonstrate that multi-echo fMRI can improve CVR estimation in clinical populations, particularly in low signal-to-noise datasets, enhancing the feasibility of CVR analyses in stroke studies and allowing for better visualization of stroke-related CVR deficits.

">Amplified MS2 labeling reveals heterogeneous dynamics of RNA granules in the live murine brain</a></h4>

              
                Dynamics of messenger ribonucleic acids (mRNAs) and the complexes with associated proteins (RNPs), also known as RNA granules, provide post-transcriptional control of gene expression. This regulation is crucial for cell-type diversity and activity-dependent plasticity of the mammalian central nervous system (CNS). However, elucidating the physiological significance of RNA granules has been hampered by the lack of technologies for probing them in live mouse brain. Here, we describe a novel method to visualize RNA granules in native CNS tissues in vivo. To amplify the fluorescence signal from single mRNAs incorporating MS2 stem loops, MS2 capsid protein (MCP) was conjugated with 4 tandem superfolder green fluorescent proteins (sfGFPs). Using MCP-4xsfGFP, a significant population of RNPs could be detected in specific cells of the CNS, enabling new findings, e.g., remarkable heterogeneity of Actb mRNA dynamics across neurons and glial cells. The highly sensitive in vivo RNA imaging could be useful for illuminating the regulation of the dynamics of RNA granules in naive and diseased animals.

">Synergistic retinal UCHL1 dysregulation and synaptic vulnerability reflect Alzheimer's disease severity</a></h4>

              
                Synaptic failure predicts cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease (AD), yet its impact and molecular drivers in the human retina remain unclear. Leveraging the retina as an accessible central nervous system (CNS) proxy, we integrated spatially resolved histopathology of retinal cross-sections with ultrastructural, proteomic, and biochemical profiling across independent postmortem cohorts spanning normal cognition, mild cognitive impairment due to AD (MCI), and AD dementia. We uncover early, progressive degeneration of excitatory glutamatergic synapses, evidenced by losses of presynaptic vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (VGLUT1) and synaptophysin, and postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD95) and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor subunit 2A (NMDAR2A), accompanied by disruption of synaptic ultrastructure. Retinal synaptic loss tightly associates with local accumulation of amyloid-{beta}42 and immature tau species, heightened oxidative stress, and upregulation of the A{beta}-binding death receptor p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR). Notably, the synapse-enriched deubiquitinase ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase L1 (UCHL1) is profoundly dysregulated, correlates with synaptic integrity and cognition, and emerges as the strongest retinal predictor of Braak stage and cognitive status in multivariable machine-learning models. Together, these findings position retinal A{beta}/p75NTR-mediated UCHL1 imbalance as a proteostasis--synapse mechanistic hub and candidate biomarker reflecting AD severity.

">Traumatic brain injury has a lasting impact on hippocampal neurogenesis and Notch1 is involved in regulating this injury response</a></h4>

              
                Traumatic brain injury (TBI) induces a series of neuropathological changes in the brain including neurogenesis, an important cellular response involved in brain repair and regeneration. TBI-enhanced neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus is of particular importance due its contribution to learning and memory functions. In the neurogenic process, proliferation and differentiation of neural stem cells (NSCs) follow a well-characterized sequence controlled by many factors including Notch1, which plays essential roles in regulating NSC fate determination under physiological conditions in both developing and adult brains. Following TBI, the dynamic changes of NSCs and the involvement of Notch1 on their development at different stages post-injury are not fully characterized. In the current study, we examined the impact of TBI and Notch1 on NSCs proliferation, survival and neuronal differentiation. Utilizing transgenic mice with tamoxifen-induced GFP expression and Notch1 knock-out in nestin+ NSCs, we examined DG neurogenic response at acute, subacute and chronic stages following a moderate lateral fluid percussion injury. We found that TBI enhanced a proliferative response in the DG at the acute stage following injury; however, this injury response was abolished when Notch1 was conditionally deleted from nestin+ NSCs. We also found that injury and Notch1 deletion drove NSCs committing fate choice towards neuronal differentiation. The results of this study provides further knowledge regarding TBI-induced neurogenic response and Notch1 as the key regulating mechanism.

">Sensory adaptation supports flexible evidence accumulation during perceptual decision making</a></h4>

              
                Effective decision making in dynamic environments requires flexible evidence accumulation. Although models often express this flexibility as an adaptive "leak" parameter governing accumulator dynamics, its implementation in the brain may involve adaptive mechanisms operating at other stages of the decision process. We tested whether such mechanisms include adjustments in evidence encoding. We recorded single-unit activity in the middle temporal area (MT) while monkeys performed a modified random-dot motion direction-discrimination task in which an adapting stimulus with varied temporal stability preceded a behaviorally relevant test stimulus. Monkeys flexibly adjusted their decision-making behavior in a manner consistent with an adaptive leak that depended on temporal-context stability. Behavioral adjustments were reflected in context-dependent differences in sensory adaptation in MT that were independent of changes in pupil-linked arousal. These findings identify a novel role for stimulus-specific sensory adaptation in shaping the evidence available for perceptual decisions to support flexible, context-dependent evidence accumulation.

">Label-Free, Physics-Constrained Learning for Multi-Exposure Speckle Imaging Parameter Estimation</a></h4>

              
                Multi-exposure speckle imaging (MESI) estimates flow-related parameters by fitting a physics-based speckle contrast model to measurements acquired over multiple exposure times. In standard pipelines, parameters are recovered via nonlinear least-squares fitting at each pixel, which is computationally expensive and can yield spatially inconsistent maps when uncertainty in the estimated speckle contrast variance $widehat{K^2}$ (from camera noise and finite spatial/temporal sampling used to compute speckle contrast) is amplified by independent pixel wise inversion. This work reframes MESI parameter estimation as identification of a globally shared inverse operator of the analytical forward model, exploiting the fact that a single physical mapping governs all pixels while noise drives large variance in independent pixel wise inversion. Rather than solving millions of iterative optimizations, a single parameterized inverse mapping is learned directly from a single acquired MESI dataset. Physics consistency is enforced by embedding the fixed MESI forward model as an analysis-by-synthesis layer that re-synthesizes speckle contrast curves from the predicted parameters. Training is self-supervised: the inverse mapping is optimized by minimizing a reconstruction loss between measured and re-synthesized speckle contrast curves, which constrains estimates to the set of physically admissible MESI curves without requiring ground truth parameter labels. Experiments on a numerical MESI phantom with known ground truth and on textit{in vivo} mouse cortex data show that the proposed method produces more stable inverse correlation time (ICT) maps ($1/tau_c$) and improved spatial coherence relative to conventional per-pixel fitting, while substantially reducing inference time by replacing iterative optimization with a single feed-forward evaluation.

">Film Recall Reveals Intact Event Memory but Impaired Sequence Memory in Temporal Lobe Epilepsy Patients</a></h4>

              
                BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Patients with epilepsy (PWE), especially temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), experience impaired memory for personally experienced events. However, current assessments of episodic memory are limited in their ecological validity with a potential to miss detection of subtle cognitive decline. We conducted an exploratory study to determine whether a naturalistic film-viewing task with open-ended spoken recall could detect memory differences between TLE patients and healthy controls (HCs). METHODS: TLE patients (ages 18-60, fluent in English, not legally blind) were recruited from a Level 4 Epilepsy Center (2018-2024). TLE diagnosis was based on seizure semiology, MRI Brain, and EEG. TLE patients scored 22/30 on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA); HCs scored 26/30. Subjects watched 6 short films and then freely recalled film details. Spoken responses were recorded, transcribed, segmented, and scored for film- and event-level recall. Recall order was assessed using the Damerau-Levenshtein distance. Semantic and causal centrality were quantified using sentence embeddings and rater-identified causal links, respectively. Beta regression with cluster-robust standard errors assessed group and centrality effects on recall probability. Beta regression evaluated the influence of age, MOCA, and testing platform on sequence recall error. RESULTS: We recruited 51 subjects (27 TLEs; 24 HCs, 70.1% F, mean 29.9 {+/-} 8.3 years). TLE patients and HCs showed similar recall of films (HC 89% {+/-}11% vs TLE 88% {+/-}18%, p = 0.54), coarse events (HC 50% {+/-}16% vs TLE 44% {+/-}18%, p = 0.19) and fine events (HC 25%{+/-}10% vs. TLE 22%{+/-}12%, p=0.17). Both groups recalled high causal centrality events better. For coarse event sequence recall, TLE patients showed a numerical trend toward greater sequence errors compared to HCs (HC 10.8% {+/-} 10.5% vs. TLE 19.5% {+/-} 18%, p = 0.06), although this difference did not reach statistical significance. However, TLE patients showed significantly greater fine event sequence errors at recall than HCs (HC 15%{+/-}13% vs 23% {+/-}18%, p = 0.02, Hedges' g = 0.85, Cliff's {delta} = 0.51), with RTLE demonstrating more sequence errors than HCs (15%{+/-}13 vs. 29%{+/-}21% p = 0.021) Age, education, MOCA, and performance on standard verbal and visual memory tasks were unrelated to film, event, and sequence recall performance. DISCUSSION: We demonstrate that a short film task with spontaneous spoken recall can identify sequence memory impairment in TLE patients despite intact film- and event-level recall. Sequence memory may represent a subtle manifestation of memory impairment that is not detected by standard cognitive testing.

">Cerebral bases of audiovisual temporal binding window: an awake surgery study</a></h4>

              
                Background: Audiovisual integration is essential for daily functions such as speech comprehension. It relies on a temporal constraint whereby events from different sensory modalities are perceptually bound within a limited temporal window, the audiovisual temporal binding window, defining the range of stimulus onset asynchronies perceived as synchronous. While correlational neuroimaging studies (fMRI, EEG) have implicated a distributed network in audiovisual integration, the causal neural underpinnings of the temporal binding window remain largely unknown. Objective: To identify cortical regions causally supporting audiovisual simultaneity judgment. Methods: Direct electrical stimulation (DES) was prospectively applied to 62 cortical sites during awake brain surgery in 39 patients. Patients performed an audiovisual simultaneity judgment task with varying stimuli onset asynchronies alongside standard sensory-motor, language, and visuospatial tasks. Montreal Neurological Institute coordinates were obtained for all stimulated areas. Results: DES selectively impaired audiovisual simultaneity judgments while sparing other standard tasks, in 7 highly focal, right-hemispheric cortical sites (<1 cm2). Three sites were situated around the intraparietal sulcus, and four near the supplementary motor area. Stimulation of left-hemisphere sites produced non-selective impairments, also affecting language-related tasks. Conclusions: These findings provide causal evidence for a right-lateralized frontoparietal network, involving focal regions near the intraparietal sulcus and supplementary motor area, in audiovisual temporal integration. Given the established roles of these regions in attentional and decisional processes, this study refines their contribution to the temporal binding window network and underscores the clinical importance of preserving this network during awake brain surgery.

">Eye-Tracking-BIDS: the Brain Imaging Data Structure extended to gaze position and pupil data</a></h4>

              
                The Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) is a widely adopted, community-driven standard to organize neuroimaging data and metadata. Although numerous extensions have been developed to incrementally extend coverage to new modalities and data types, an unambiguous, granular specification for eye-tracking recordings is lacking. Here, we present how BIDS will structure data and metadata produced by eye-tracking devices, including gaze position and pupil data. In addition to prescribing the organization of the unprocessed (raw) recordings and associated metadata as produced by the device, BEP20 also resolves gaps in current BIDS specifications beyond the scope of eye tracking. In particular, it adds a mechanism for including asynchronous model parameters and messages, such as contextual information, statuses, and events, such as triggers, generated by the device. BEP20 includes examples that illustrate its applicability in various experimental settings. This BIDS extension provides a robust standard that supports the development of self-adaptive, open, and automated eye-tracking data structures, thereby bolstering transparency and reliability of results in this field.

">Modeling the inverse MEG problem in neuro-imaging using Physics Informed Neural Networks</a></h4>

              
                Magnetoencephalography (MEG) forward and inverse modeling is fundamental to neuroscientific discovery, yet the inversion of partial differential equations (PDEs) remains one of the most difficult challenges due to its inherent ill-posedness. While traditional numerical methods often struggle with the computational burden and regularization requirements of these problems, neural networks have recently emerged as a highly viable alternative, offering the ability to learn complex, non-linear mappings and provide efficient, real-time inference. This paper presents an framework for the MEG forward and inverse problems, integrating finite element modeling with neural network techniques. The forward problem is solved using FEniCS to model the electric potential governed by the Poisson equation on a realistic anatomical brain mesh, with magnetic fields computed via the Biot-Savart law. while for the inverse problem, we introduce a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) approach in order to deal with the ill condition of the problem. Unlike purely data-driven deep learning approaches that treat this problem as a black box learned from massive datasets, the proposed PINN framework directly embeds the governing physics---Maxwell's equations and the Biot-Savart law---into the loss function, ensuring that the reconstructed sources satisfy the fundamental electromagnetic laws even in data-scarce regimes. We validate the framework on a high-resolution anatomical mesh and comparing against the standard Minimum Norm Estimation (MNE). Results demonstrate that the PINN approach achieves a mean localization error of 0.45 cm, representing a 46% improvement over the optimized MNE baseline (0.84 cm), while effectively eliminating the long-tail error distribution.

">Defining and rescuing pathomechanisms of myotubularin and autophagy disruption in a novel human cell model of Charcot-Marie-Tooth Type 4B3</a></h4>

              
                Charcot-Marie-Tooth Type 4B3 (CMT4B3) is a genetic disorder leading to peripheral axon degeneration and clinical manifestations of distal weakness and gait impairment. CMT4B3 is caused by mutations in SBF1/MTMR5, a negative regulator of phosphoinositide signaling and autophagy. Although SBF1 mutations are ubiquitously expressed, how and why loss of SBF1/MTMR5 exerts deleterious effects predominantly in neurons of the peripheral nervous system (PNS) is unknown. To investigate the effects of mutant SBF1/MTMR5 on PNS neurons compared to non-neurons, we engineered a novel and unique model system of CMT4B3 using human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) differentiated into key components of the PNS: motor neurons (iMNs), sensory neurons (iSNs), or skeletal muscle (iMuscle). To model CMT4B3, we used iPSCs derived from a CMT43B patient, or genetically knocked down SBF1 in WT cells. Strikingly, CMT4B3 iMNs showed the highest degree of cell degeneration among all cell types, concordant with the clinical phenotype of patients. We also found that CMT4B3 iMNs and iSNs showed attenuated expression of MTMR5 and related paralogs MTMR2 and MTMR13. Knockdown of SBF1 most significantly augmented autophagy in iMNs than other cell types. Finally, we tested treatment with VPS34-IN1, a pharmacologic inhibitor of the Class III PI3-Kinase functioning in opposition to MTMR5 in regulating phosphoinositides, and found that VPS34-IN1 rescued cell death in CMT4B3 iMNs. Together, our results for the first time confirm PNS cell type-specific differences in myotubularin expression, autophagy, and vulnerabilities to SBF1 mutations, and identify a novel therapeutic strategy of high disease-modifying potential for CMT4B3.

">Accessible and reproducible mesoscale fMRI at 5.0 T: A Pulseq-based open framework for human laminar mapping</a></h4>

              
                Mesoscale, layer-specific functional MRI (fMRI) enables noninvasive access to cortical microcircuitry, yet widespread adoption has been constrained by a reliance on ultra-high field ([&ge;]7.0 T) systems and proprietary pulse sequences. To bridge this gap and enhance accessibility, we developed an open-source framework at 5.0 T for mapping laminar brain activity. This framework integrates a Pulseq-based 3D vascular space occupancy (VASO) sequence with an end-to-end data acquisition and analysis pipeline. At matched sub-millimeter resolution (0.8 mm in-plane), the Pulseq-based 3D implementation increased slab coverage by ~1.82-fold and improved temporal signal-to-noise ratio by ~1.50-fold relative to a vendor-provided 2D-VASO sequence. Validated using a finger-tapping paradigm, individual cerebral blood volume-weighted (VASO) laminar activation profiles consistently revealed the canonical "double-peak" pattern, with distinct superficial and deep peaks in the primary motor cortex. These profiles exhibited excellent cross-visit reliability (r = 0.80), and peak depths showed good spatial reliability (ICC = 0.69 for deep layers; ICC = 0.58 for superficial layers). Between-subject reproducibility was high (r = 0.86). Deploying the identical Pulseq protocol at an independent imaging site reproduced the characteristic double-peak laminar profiles (r = 0.63). At the group level, 5.0 T laminar profiles closely matched established 7.0 T findings, robustly resolving both deep and superficial peaks despite the lower field strength. Notably, for each participant, a single 13-minute VASO run was sufficient to resolve reliable laminar activation patterns that exhibited high consistency with multi-run averages (r = 0.78), highlighting the potential for high-throughput population studies or clinical research settings. The Pulseq-based 3D VASO sequence file, image reconstruction pipeline, and data analysis scripts are openly available to facilitate the adoption of this framework. This work establishes a practical route towards more accessible and reproducible mesoscale fMRI for studying human laminar functional architecture.

">Inter-token silence period spiking activity enhances selectivity of distinct groups of auditory cortical neurons to periodic and aperiodic sound sequences</a></h4>

              
                Auditory neurons, in the midbrain and beyond, detect changes in repeating acoustic patterns. Most studies focus on mechanisms underlying such sensitivity and adaptation to regularity. However, regular sound patterns are crucial in social communication, stream-segregation and grouping in different species including humans. Thus, we address cortical selectivity to periodic or aperiodic sound sequences with multiple stimulus attributes. With single unit electrophysiology and two-photon calcium imaging in anesthetized and awake mouse auditory cortex, we observe subpopulations of neurons selective to periodicity or aperiodicity that lack generalization across period-length, frequency-content or inter-token-interval durations. Comparing results with or without inter-token-interval spiking activity, shows its profound role underlying selectivity to periodic or aperiodic sequences. The whole population average rate for periodic and aperiodic stimuli is identical but not following each period and stimulus-off-period. Hence, inter-token-interval activity, post each period increases during the sequence providing information on selectivity and a prediction like signal. Highlights: Contrary to common view, subpopulations of neurons in the auditory cortex are selective to repetitive sound patterns or periodic sound sequences and another to aperiodic ones. Neither population of neurons above generalizes their selectivity across properties of tokens of the sequences. Neural activity during the inter-token interval plays an important role in enhancing the observed selectivity. Post period or pre- subsequent period activity builds up during the stimulus providing a prediction like signal for periodic sequences with respect to aperiodic sequences.

">Neural integrator and orchestrator communities shape spontaneous signaling in the human brain</a></h4>

              
                Understanding how intrinsic brain dynamics are organized is critical for explaining human cognition and sensory processing. Theoretical frameworks propose a hierarchical architecture in which some neural systems act as orchestrators, broadcasting information across the brain, whereas others serve as integrators, transforming incoming signals. Here, we quantitatively test whether this orchestration-integration framework is embedded in intrinsic brain activity, that is, in the absence of explicit cognitive/sensorial tasks. We adopt a multivariate fractional modeling framework originally developed in financial mathematics to characterize how volatility propagates across interacting markets, thereby identifying systems that act as orchestrators or integrators. We then test whether this integrator-orchestrator axis is related to human intelligence. To this end, using 7T resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data from 173 healthy young adults, we model spontaneous brain fluctuations with a multivariate fractional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process to derive directional influence indices. Consistent with our predictions, we identified a bipartite organization, stable across modeling choices. At the subcortical level, the anterior thalamus, putamen, and caudate emerged as orchestrating transmitters, whereas the posterior thalamus, globus pallidus, hippocampus, amygdala, and nucleus accumbens acted as integrating receivers. At the cortical level, attentional and sensory networks functioned as orchestrating transmitters, while higher-order cognitive networks served as integrating receivers. These findings provide support for a theoretically grounded integration-orchestration framework, demonstrating that brain signaling is organized along this axis even at rest, relevant for intelligence scores. The proposed fractional framework offers a principled tool to investigate how disruptions of this balance may contribute to brain disorders.

">Orofacial behaviors, not eye movements, govern neural activity in mouse visual cortex</a></h4>

              
                Neural activity in mouse primary visual cortex (V1) correlates strongly with orofacial movements. Such strong modulation has not been found in the primate visual cortex during eye fixation (Talluri et al 2023), which led to the suggestion that the modulation may primarily depend on eye movements in both species (Kang et al 2025). Here we examined the influence of eye movements on neural activity in mouse visual cortex both in complete darkness and in the presence of different types of visual input. In all cases, we found that eye movements explain a smaller fraction of neural activity variance compared to orofacial behaviors. Additionally, we found that eye movements were correlated to orofacial movements, such as whisking and sniffing, and thus may be indirectly correlated to neural activity. These results further emphasize the impact of movement signals on mouse visual cortex during free viewing behavior.

">Cross-Modal Scaffolding: Music Enhances Hippocampal Binding and Separation for Visual Sequential Memory</a></h4>

              
                The human brain continuously segments experience into meaningful episodes while also encoding temporal relationships between events, yet the mechanisms that optimize this dual challenge remain poorly understood. Here we tested a theoretical framework in which structured temporal context from one modality (music) can organize such memory computations in another (visual) through coordinated modulation of the hippocampus. Using fMRI and a sequence learning paradigm, we show that musical accompaniment enhanced both boundary detection and sequential organization of visual event memory. Mechanistically, musical context accelerated development of neural responses to boundaries in hippocampus and prefrontal cortex while simultaneously optimizing hippocampal representational patterns for learning: strengthening pattern similarity for within-sequence items while reducing computational demands for discriminating representations of different sequences. Critically, musical context created conditions where contextual similarity became a stronger predictor of memory success than before, transforming similarity from an interference signal into a beneficial learning mechanism. Multivariate analysis further revealed that musical scaffolding enhanced hippocampal encoding of the sequential position of visual stimuli, demonstrating cross-modal transfer of temporal structure to visual sequence learning. Finally, we demonstrate functional specificity across hippocampal subfields, revealing how temporal structure cues can coordinate distinct computational processes within the memory circuit. These findings establish a framework for understanding how structured context signals like music can simultaneously optimize multiple aspects of memory organization, and provide mechanistic insight for educational and clinical interventions that have leveraged cross-modal temporal enhancement to improve human cognitive function.

">Emergence of microglia structural and functional heterogeneity between hippocampal subregions during development into early adulthood</a></h4>

              
                Phagocytosis is a key function performed by microglia to maintain tissue homeostasis. The degree of microglial phagocytic activity differs across ages and between gross anatomical brain regions, dictated by the local environment. Here, we asked whether microglial phagocytic phenotype exhibits subregion-scale tuning by circuit-specific features within a brain region. To address this, we took advantage of the highly stereotyped architecture of the hippocampus. We examined three adjacent synaptic subregions, the CA1 stratum radiatum (SR), stratum lacunosum moleculare (SLM) and dentate gyrus molecular layer (DGML). These three subregions provide an ideal system for examining local microglia heterogeneity, as each subregion contains distinct neuropil features, creating three adjacent unique micro-environments to which the microglia are exposed. We measured the phagocytic activity and morphological properties of over 1,000 individual microglia at two developmental points, mid-postnatal (P16) and early adulthood (P60) in the CA1 SR, SLM and DGML. We found that microglial phenotype diversified with development into early adulthood. At the mid-postnatal age, phagocytic activity and morphology were homogeneous across subregions. Conversely, in young adulthood, microglia in the CA1 SR and DGML exhibited a reduction in phagocytic activity, while microglia in the CA1 SLM maintained a highly phagocytic phenotype reminiscent of an immature-like state. These findings uncover a fine-scale tuning of microglia activity that emerges during maturation and is dictated at the sub-region level of the hippocampus, uncovering a distinct population of microglia in the CA1 SLM that exhibit a persistent immature phenotype under physiological conditions. Understanding the target(s) of this phagocytosis and consequences for CA1 SLM function will provide new insight into the role of local tuning of microglia properties for circuit-specific needs in both health and disease.

">Prenatal stress interacts with embryonic loss of Fgfr2 to increase locomotor hyperactivity in mice</a></h4>

              
                Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a developmental psychiatric disorder associated with a complex interplay of genetic and environmental risk factors. We have shown embryonic dorsal forebrain loss in mice of fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (Fgfr2), which has a critical role in normal brain development, results in ADHD-relevant phenotypes: increased locomotion and sociability, and impaired working memory postnatally. How such genetic vulnerabilities interact with environmental exposures to translationally model human ADHD risk remains unclear. Here, we pair the embryonic hGFAP-cre Fgfr2 conditional knockout (Fgfr2 cKO) mouse model with prenatal repetitive restraint stress, modeling an environmental factor associated with ADHD risk, to assess adult offspring behaviors and dopamine transporter (DAT) levels. Offspring of prenatally stressed, Fgfr2 cKO mice show increased locomotion (80% compared to non-stressed, Fgfr2 cKO animals). Prenatal stress led to a trend increase in impulsivity and trend decrease in working memory but did not affect sociability. There were no interactions with Fgfr2 cKO observed in these behaviors. Neurobiologically, prenatal stress led to a trend decrease in medial frontal cortex DAT, but these changes did not correlate with behavior. Taken together, our findings implicate prenatal stress as a potential contributor to gene-environment interactions for ADHD risk, supporting its use in translational animal models of childhood psychiatric disorders.

">Diverging routes of oligodendrocyte recruitment in adaptive and regenerative myelination</a></h4>

              
                Myelination by oligodendrocytes is dynamically regulated throughout life, supporting axon and circuit function during development, activity-dependent plasticity and repair after injury. How new oligodendrocytes are recruited from their lifelong pool of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) in these distinct contexts remains unclear. Using high-resolution in vivo imaging in zebrafish, we directly compared activity-induced and demyelination-induced oligodendrogenesis under otherwise matched conditions. Although enhanced motor activity and demyelination both increased oligodendrocyte production, OPCs activated strikingly different transcriptional programmes. Demyelination, but not enhanced activity, induced acute expression of differentiation-associated genes, including the G-protein-coupled receptor Gpr17. Fate-tracking using a Gpr17 knock-in reporter revealed that all newly formed oligodendrocytes arise from Gpr17-positive states. In the healthy CNS, these states emerged exclusively through proliferation-linked OPC divisions, whereas demyelination unlocked a distinct, proliferation-independent conversion of homeostatic OPCs into Gpr17-positive, differentiation-primed cells. Our findings demonstrate the existence of diverging context-dependent routes of OPC recruitment engaged in adaptive and regenerative myelination.

">Automated Ventricle Assessment via Three-dimensional Anatomical Reconstruction (AVA-TAR): a computational toolkit for autonomous lateral ventricle assessment in preclinical hydrocephalus models</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: Current workflows for studying hydrocephalus in rodent models rely on manual segmentation or qualitative assessment of ventricular size on small animal magnetic resonance imaging, which are both inefficient and prone to variability. Atlas-based methods enable more streamlined segmentation, but their analysis is limited to morphologically normal samples. Objective: This study aimed to develop and internally validate a deep learning model that performs automated segmentation of lateral ventricles in rodent brain MRIs, allowing for 3D ventricle reconstruction, morphological analysis, and ventriculomegaly detection. Methods: Four U-Net++ neural networks, each with different encoder backbones, were trained using 307 rodent brain MRIs (262 rats, 45 mice), each with manually segmented lateral ventricles serving as the ground truth. Model performance was evaluated using the Dice coefficient, intersection over union (IoU), and Hausdorff index. The most optimal model was evaluated further for its ability to quantify ventricle volume, convexity, surface area, and symmetry. Results: The U-Net++ model with an EfficientNet-B1 encoder achieved high accuracy (Dice: 0.823 {+/-} 0.136; IoU: 0.721 {+/-} 0.85). Further assessment of its morphological predictions found strong correlations with manual measurements of ventricular morphology, with Pearson and interclass correlation coefficients exceeding 0.96 across all metrics. The full validated pipeline was packaged into a publicly available application, hosted at https://ava-tar.org. Conclusion: This study introduces a deep learning tool for automated segmentation and morphological analysis of lateral ventricles in rodent MRIs. The tool's efficiency and accuracy in quantifying ventricle morphology offers significant utility in preclinical hydrocephalus research with potential future application in the clinical setting.

">Central amygdala Isl1 neurons control biting by integrating sensory and motivational signals</a></h4>

              
                Efficient orofacial motor control is essential for adaptive interactions with the environment, yet the neural substrates that regulate the force and precision of biting remain poorly understood. Here, we identify a subpopulation of neurons in the central amygdala (CeA) expressing the transcription factor Isl1 (CeAIsl1) that plays a crucial role in modulating biting behavior in mice. In vivo calcium imaging revealed that CeAIsl1 neurons are robustly activated at the onset of biting across materials of varying physical properties, with distinct neuronal ensembles selectively encoding responses to the physical properties of the objects. CeAIsl1 neuronal activity scales positively with the hardness of the object, suggesting a role in force modulation. Optogenetic activation of CeAIsl1 neurons enhances biting behavior toward edible or non-edible objects, induces fictive feeding in the absence of physical targets and exerts a reinforcing effect on behavior, whereas inhibition of CeAIsl1 neurons impaired efficient biting of solid food by reducing jaw-closing muscle activity. Projection-specific manipulations revealed that activation of CeA Isl1 projections to the parvocellular reticular formation (PCRt) and pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus (PPtg) increased the duration and frequency of biting, with CeA Isl1-to-PPTg stimulation producing a positive motivational valence. These findings uncover a previously unrecognized sensorimotor function of the central amygdala in calibrating bite force and precision, linking motivational states to skilled motor output.

">Nociceptive activity enhances GABAA receptor mediated facilitation of proprioceptive afferent transmission to motoneurons, and is gated by serotonin.</a></h4>

              
                Sensory transmission in the monosynaptic stretch reflex (MSR) from proprioceptive Ia afferents to motoneurons is markedly inhibited by serotonin, providing a mechanism by which the brain gates spinal cord function. However, the main serotonin receptor subtype that modulates the MSR is the 5-HT1D receptor that is expressed almost exclusively on nociceptive C fibres, suggesting an unexpected gating of proprioceptive transmission by regulation of nociceptive pathways. We demonstrate here that activation of C fibres (electrically or pharmacologically by TRPM8 agonists) increases action potential propagation in proprioceptive Ia afferents by producing a very long-lasting tonic depolarization in Ia afferents (tonic primary afferent depolarization, tonic PAD). This tonic PAD is produced indirectly by C fibres augmenting axoaxonic GABAergic input onto Ia afferents (bicuculline sensitive), which activates nodal GABAA receptors that aid sodium spike initiation. In contrast, activation of 5-HT1D receptors with the anti-migraine drug zolmitriptan inhibits C fibre activity, which in turn reduces the GABAA receptor-mediated tonic PAD on Ia afferents, and reduces spike propagation to motoneurons. Overall, these findings demonstrate a mechanism by which brainstem derived serotonin not only inhibits ongoing nociceptive C fibres activity, but also indirectly inhibits GABAergic neurons and sensory transmission in large proprioceptive sensory afferents, leading to reduced motoneuron activity. Furthermore, these findings suggest that spontaneous nociceptive C fibres activity may provide a general increase in proprioception, opposite to the classical gating of nociceptive pathways by low threshold afferents, and impacting the clinical use of zolmitriptan.

">Computational modeling of head direction cells in three-dimensional space: directional encoding and visual cue manipulation</a></h4>

              
                Head direction (HD) cells can fire selectively as a function of the animal's head azimuth direction and form an internal compass for navigation. They were found in the mammalian limbic system including the dorsal presubiculum and entorhinal cortex. The underlying network updates its directional estimate in a self-organized fashion and can be recalibrated by external sensory cues. Although ring-attractor models were proposed to account for azimuth coding on horizontal planes, they cannot explain conjunctive azimuth-and-pitch tuning observed in HD cells of the presubiculum of flying bats navigating in three-dimensional (3-D) space. Based on the 3-D electrophysiological recordings, we developed a toroidal continuous attractor network that jointly encodes horizontal azimuth and vertical pitch angle of head direction. The model can reproduce the experimentally recorded tuning curves of individual HD cells, and accurately encode the 3-D dynamic head direction of bat by HD cell population. The model also simulate the influence of horizontal visual cue manipulation on the HD system in 3-D space and predicts how horizontal landmark rotation induces a sustained azimuthal offset that persists after the cue is removed, which is comparable to two-dimensional experimental findings. This research clarifies how conjunctive 3-D direction codes are generated and modified by vestibular input, visual information and recurrent connectivity. It also uncovers the computational principles and properties of the brain's navigation functions in realistic 3-D environments and offers new theoretical reference for future studies.

                <p>The cerebellum is well established in subsecond motor timing, but its role in suprasecond interval timing remains unclear. Here, we investigated how cerebellar output influences time estimation over longer timescales. Male rats performed a nose-poke interval timing task in which reward availability could be predicted either from a fixed 2.5&nbsp;s auditory cue (cued trials) or had to be estimated internally during uncued 3.5&nbsp;s trials that demanded self-timing. Chemogenetic inhibition of the lateral cerebellar nucleus (LCN) produced bidirectional effects: delayed action initiation in predictable trials and premature (~100&ndash;160&nbsp;ms) responses when self-timing was required. Despite a slowing of movement, overall task success rates remained unchanged. Because motor slowing is likely to lead to later, not earlier, action initiation, these results implicate the LCN in computing internal time estimates. These findings demonstrate that the cerebellum integrates motor and cognitive processes for suprasecond timing, with differential effects on externally guided and self-generated timing.</p>

                <p>Age-related vascular changes accompany or precede the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. The comorbidity of AD and arterial stiffening suggests that vascular changes have a pathogenic role. Carotid artery mechanics and hemodynamics have been associated with age-related cognitive decline. However, the impact of hemodynamics and vascular mechanics on regional vulnerability within the brain has not been thoroughly explored. Compared with the arterial system, brain venous circulation in cognitive impairment is less understood despite the venous system's role in transport. To study vasculature impact on biochemistry in AD models, we must first establish the differences in vasculature mechanics and hemodynamics in a common AD model compared with healthy controls. With this baseline data, future studies on manipulating vasculature integrity in mice become feasible. Young and aged female 3xTg mice and age-matched controls were imaged using a combination of ultrasound and mass spectrometry. Wall shear stress varied across age and AD models. Mean velocity and pulsatility index varied across age and AD. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry of brain tissue revealed several lipids that were statistically different<I></I> between age and AD, and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization MS imaging revealed region-specific differences between groups. Combining both ultrasound and mass spectrometry, we were able to detect significant changes in the vascular biomechanics of neck vasculature prior to observing significant changes in the brain biochemistry. Our work revealed significant vascular differences in the 3xTg compared with controls and, to our knowledge, is the first to study vascular biomechanics via ultrasound in the 3xTg AD mouse model.</p>

                <p>by Gaurav Sharma, Bernard Marius ’t Hart, Jean-Jacques Orban de Xivry, Denise Y.P. Henriques, Mireille E. Broucke</p>

A fundamental problem of visuomotor adaptation research is to understand how the brain is capable to asymptotically remove a predictable exogenous disturbance from a visual error signal using limited sensor information by re-calibration of hand movement. From a control theory perspective, the most striking aspect of this problem is that it falls squarely in the realm of the internal model principle of control theory. Despite this fact, the relationship between the internal model principle and models of visuomotor adaptation is currently not well developed.
This paper aims to close this gap by proposing an abstract discrete-time state space model of visuomotor adaptation based on the internal model principle. The proposed <i>DO Model</i>, a metonym for its most important component, a disturbance observer, addresses key modeling requirements: modular architecture, physically relevant signals, parameters tied to atomic behaviors, and capacity for abstraction. The two main computational modules are a disturbance observer, a recently developed class of internal models, and a feedforward system that learns from the disturbance observer to improve feedforward motor commands.

Phase resetting of cardiac oscillators underlies some complex arrhythmias. Here we use optogenetic stimulation to construct phase response curves (PRC) for spheroids of human induced pluripotent stem cell derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CM) and a computational cardiomyocyte model to identify ionic mechanisms shaping the PRC. The clinical utility of the human PRCs is demonstrated by adding a patient-based conduction delay to the same equations to explain complex multi-day Holter ECG dynamics and cardiac arrhythmias. Periodic stimulation of these patient-based models and the computational model of human iPSC-CM reveal similar bifurcation patterns and entrainment zones. Cell therapy by injecting iPSC-CM into diseased hearts can induce ectopic foci-based engraftment arrhythmias. The PRC analysis offers a potential strategy to entrain these foci in a parameter space that avoids such arrhythmias.

                <p>by Joel Eliason, Michele Peruzzi, Arvind Rao</p>

Motivation: Understanding how different cell types interact spatially within tissue microenvironments is critical for deciphering immune dynamics, tumor progression, and tissue organization. Many current spatial analysis methods assume symmetric associations or compute image-level summaries separately without sharing information across patients and cohorts, limiting biological interpretability and statistical power.
Results: We present SHADE (Spatial Hierarchical Asymmetry via Directional Estimation), a multilevel Bayesian framework for modeling asymmetric spatial interactions across scales. SHADE quantifies direction-specific cell-cell associations using smooth spatial interaction curves (SICs) and integrates data across tissue sections, patients, and cohorts. Through simulation studies, SHADE demonstrates improved accuracy, robustness, and interpretability over existing methods. Application to colorectal cancer multiplexed imaging data demonstrates SHADE’s ability to quantify directional spatial patterns while controlling for tissue architecture confounders and capturing substantial patient-level heterogeneity. The framework successfully identifies biologically interpretable spatial organization patterns, revealing that local microenvironmental structure varies considerably across patients within molecular subtypes.

                <p>by Nathaniel Deimler, David V. Ho, Norbert Paul, Zoë Gill, Peter Baumann</p>

Long-read sequencing has transformed many areas of biology and holds significant promise for telomere research by enabling analysis of nucleotide-level resolution chromosome arm–specific telomere length in both model organisms and humans. However, the adoption of new technologies, particularly in clinical or diagnostic contexts, requires careful validation to recognize potential technical and computational limitations. We present TARPON (Telomere Analysis and Research Pipeline Optimized for Nanopore), a best-practices Nextflow pipeline designed for the analysis of telomeres sequenced on the Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) platform. TARPON can be executed via the command line or integrated into ONT’s EPI2ME agent, providing a user-friendly graphical interface for those without computational training. Nextflow’s container-based architecture eliminates dependency conflicts, thereby streamlining deployment across platforms. TARPON isolates telomeric repeat–containing reads, assigns strand specificity, and identifies enrichment probes that can be used both for demultiplexing and for confirming capture-based library preparation. To ensure that the analysis is restricted to full-length telomeres, reads lacking a capture probe or non-telomeric sequence on the opposite end are excluded. A sliding-window approach defines the subtelomere-to-telomere boundary, followed by quality filtering to remove low-quality or subtelomeric reads that passed earlier steps. The pipeline generates customizable statistics, text-based summaries, and publication-ready visualizations (HTML, PNG, PDF). While default settings are optimized for diagnostic workflows, all parameters are easily adjustable via the GUI or command line to support diverse applications. These include telomere analyses in variant-rich samples (e.g., ALT-positive tumors) and organisms with non-canonical telomeric repeats such as some insects (GTTAG) and certain plants (GGTTTAG). TARPON is the first complete and experimentally validated pipeline for Nanopore-based telomere analysis requiring no data pre-processing or prior bioinformatics expertise, while offering flexibility for advanced users.

<p>As the population ages, certain neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) are becoming a major health issue. For this reason, this review will focus on the most common ND with onset after 65 years old; Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Lewy body dementia, and frontotemporal dementia. NDs are the results of multifactorial processes causing pleiotropic changes in molecular and protein networks linking a host of biological processes that lead to protein dysregulation and aggregation that ultimately leads to neurodegeneration. Genetic, transcriptomic, and proteomic studies have been instrumental to identify novel genes and proteins implicated on diseases that point to novel disease mechanism, as well as the identification of disease biomarkers. Here, we provide a review of the genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic studies on ND so far, as well as future opportunities and challenges. ANN NEUROL 2026</p>

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Hippocampal subfields differentially develop and age, and they vary in vulnerability to neurodegenerative diseases. Innovation in high-resolution imaging has accelerated clinical research on human hippocampal subfields, but substantial differences in segmentation protocols impede comparisons of results across laboratories. The Hippocampal Subfields Group (HSG) is an international organization seeking to address this issue by developing a histologically valid, reliable, and freely available segmentation protocol for high-resolution <i>T</i>
<sub>2</sub>-weighted 3 T MRI (<a target="_blank"
   title="Link to external resource"
   href="http://www.hippocampalsubfields.com">http://www.hippocampalsubfields.com</a>). Here, we report the first portion of the protocol focused on subfields in the hippocampal body; protocols for the head and tail are in development. The body protocol includes definitions of the internal boundaries between subiculum, Cornu Ammonis (CA) 1–3 subfields, and dentate gyrus, in addition to the external boundaries of the hippocampus apart from surrounding white matter and cerebrospinal fluid. The segmentation protocol is based on a novel histological reference dataset labeled by multiple expert neuroanatomists. With broad participation of the research community, we voted on the segmentation protocol via an online survey, which included detailed protocol information, feasibility testing, demonstration videos, example segmentations, and labeled histology. All boundary definitions were rated as having high clarity and reached consensus agreement by Delphi procedure. The harmonized body protocol yielded high inter- and intra-rater reliability. In the present paper we report the procedures to develop and test the protocol, as well as the detailed procedures for manual segmentation using the harmonized protocol. The harmonized protocol will significantly facilitate cross-study comparisons and provide increased insight into the structure and function of hippocampal subfields across the lifespan and in neurodegenerative diseases.</p>

                Background This study explores how sensory experiences within hospital environments influence the emotional responses of pediatric cancer patients, particularly those undergoing palliative chemotherapy. Pediatric journeys through healthcare spaces are not solely defined by clinical interactions but are shaped by continuous sensory exposure. This research aims to examine how visual, auditory, tactile, and olfactory inputs during hospital stays affect emotional regulation, stress, and readiness for treatment among children. Methods A qualitative, exploratory design was used, applying an interpretive approach to capture nuanced emotional experiences. Data collection involved semi-structured interviews with pediatric patients and caregivers, direct environmental observation, and multisensory journey mapping. Emotional responses were coded and interpreted using thematic analysis, supported by the Pleasure-Arousal-Dominance (PAD) emotional framework to identify patterns of engagement and disengagement across different sensory touchpoints. Result Findings show that children exposed to coherent multisensory environments—those with soft lighting, comforting textures, and calming sounds—demonstrated reduced anxiety and enhanced emotional coping. In contrast, fragmented environments with clinical noises, sterile visuals, and abrupt transitions intensified emotional distress, confusion, and behavioral withdrawal. Key friction points were not associated with medical procedures alone but often emerged from sensory overload or absence of meaningful sensory stimuli during waiting or transitional phases. Conclusion Hospital environments in pediatric oncology settings significantly contribute to the emotional quality of care. Sensory design that integrates adaptable, trauma-informed, and child-centered features can reduce stress and foster emotional resilience. This study suggests the need for multisensory design frameworks that move beyond aesthetics to support children’s agency and well-being throughout their treatment journey.

                Background Chronic migraine is frequently refractory to available preventive therapies. Image-guided cryoneurolysis of the greater occipital nerve (CryoGON) may provide longer-lasting relief than conventional greater occipital nerve (GON) blocks. This Stage 1 Registered Report describes a prospective, exploratory study evaluating whether response to a conventional GON block predicts subsequent response to CryoGON, and assesses open-label safety, tolerability, feasibility and efficacy of CryoGON. Methods The study is planned as a single-site, investigator-initiated, open-label clinical investigation. Adults with chronic migraine will complete a ≥28-day electronic baseline diary before receiving bilateral conventional GON blocks, followed by a ≥28-day observation. Eligible participants then undergo navigation-guided CryoGON with 12-week follow-up. The primary endpoint is the association between change in moderate-to-severe headache days after GON block (weeks 1–4) and after CryoGON (weeks 9–12). Key secondary endpoints estimate the diagnostic performance of GON-block response applying a ≥30% reduction threshold for treatment effect to identify CryoGON responders, including sensitivity, specificity and predictive values. Additional endpoints include change in migraine days, patient-reported global impression of change, Migraine-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire v2.1, procedure tolerability, technical success, and safety (treatment-emergent adverse events and adverse device effects). Women of childbearing potential, including pregnant and breastfeeding participants, are eligible for participation. Discussion This study will provide the first systematic evaluation of whether a simple, widely available GON block can guide patient selection for CryoGON and will generate foundational open-label data on its clinical performance and safety. Findings will inform the design and justification of a subsequent sham-controlled trial. Trial registration and approvals The study will preregister at ClinicalTrials.gov. and obtain all necessary ethical approvals before study initiation.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-186/v1?src=rss">Transmedia Storytelling Research Trends: A Bibliometric Analysis (2020–2025) [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Transmedia storytelling has emerged as an essential strategy for connecting content across multiple formats, languages, and platforms, particularly in educational, cultural, and social domains. Despite growing interest, there is still a lack of comprehensive bibliometric syntheses that map global research trends and the intellectual structure of the field. Methods A descriptive and retrospective bibliometric study was conducted using the Scopus database to identify scientific production on transmedia storytelling between 2020 and 2025. The study followed the PRISMA methodology under a mixed post-positivist and constructivist approach and applied the ARA framework (Authors, Journals, Contributions) as the main analytical model. Thirty Scopus-indexed journal articles were selected after applying inclusion and exclusion criteria. VOSviewer (2025) was used to generate co-occurrence maps and identify conceptual clusters. Results The analysis revealed a predominance of qualitative studies, with strong contributions from Spain, Brazil, Ecuador, Colombia, and Portugal. Spanish and Brazilian authors accounted for more than 60% of the output, confirming an Ibero-American dominance. Thematic analysis identified five major domains: education, cultural heritage, social activism, media innovation, and psychosocial health. Ten main conceptual categories were detected, including transmedia storytelling, adaptation, transmediality, interactive narrative, convergence, higher education, and media convergence. Articles were mainly published in Q1–Q2 Scopus journals in communication, digital education, and cultural studies. Conclusions Although still a relatively young field, transmedia storytelling research shows clear interdisciplinary expansion and diversification. The findings highlight the growing academic and social relevance of transmedia storytelling as a driver of social transformation, meaningful learning, and critical participation. Future studies should deepen methodological diversification, promote international collaboration, and strengthen the empirical assessment of social impact, particularly in underrepresented regions of the Global South.

                The mechanisms linking hypertension to cognitive decline remain unclear. Schaeffer et al. show that angiotensin II damages endothelium, oligodendrocyte precursors, and interneurons via AT1 signaling, independent of blood pressure. Targeting this pathway may protect the brain beyond pressure control alone.

The mechanism reveals microglial-astrocyte-neutrophil crosstalk driving cerebral edema, highlighting C5aR1 as a therapeutic target and raising new questions about complement-glial interactions.

                Traditionally considered as a uniform broadcaster of the “fight-or-flight” response, the sympathetic nervous system is emerging as an amalgamation of distinct and functionally complementary neuronal units. In this issue of Neuron, Wei, Ma et al. uncover new aspects of the organizational principles of the sympathetic celiac-superior mesenteric ganglion.

                Battista et al. use biologically plausible RNNs to uncover the circuit mechanisms of economic choice. They propose a two-stage framework where feedforward inputs compute offer values and recurrent inhibition drives comparison. This architecture explains how the brain generalizes preferences and multitasks using compositional neural codes, offering a unified theory of decision-making.

                Liu et al. demonstrate that expanded C9orf72 G4C2 repeat RNAs bind gene promoters across the genome and form HQ structures with DNA. These structures obstruct key transcription machinery, repress gene expression, and heighten neuronal vulnerability, providing mechanistic insights into neurodegeneration in ALS and FTD.
