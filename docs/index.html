	<p>The clinical differential diagnosis between Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD) and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is often challenging. The description of milder PSP phenotypes strongly resembling PD, such as PSP-Parkinsonism, further increased the diagnostic challenge and the need for reliable neuroimaging biomarkers to enhance the diagnostic certainty. This review aims to summarize the contribution of a relatively simple and widely available imaging technique such as MR planimetry in the differential diagnosis between PD and PSP, focusing on the recent advancements in this field. The development of accurate MR planimetric biomarkers, together with the implementation of automated algorithms, led to robust and objective measures for the differential diagnosis of PSP and PD at the individual level. Evidence from longitudinal studies also suggests a role of MR planimetry in predicting the development of the PSP clinical signs, allowing to identify PSP patients before they meet diagnostic criteria when their clinical phenotype can be indistinguishable from PD. Finally, promising evidence exists on the possible association between MR planimetric measures and the underlying pathology, with important implications for trials with new disease-modifying target therapies.</p>

	<p>Clinical manifestations of COVID-19 include symptoms of vertigo and dizziness, which is rather unsurprising, since SARS-CoV-2 neurotropism may inflict a broad spectrum of neuropathic effects. The widespread nature of central and peripheral audiovestibular pathways suggests that there may be several probable pathophysiological mechanisms. The cytokine storm, CNS infiltration of the virus through ACE 2 receptors, and other systemic factors can be responsible for the significant number of COVID-19 patients reported to experience symptoms of vertigo and dizziness. In this paper, we present a systematic review of clinical studies reporting the detection of dizziness and vertigo as clinical manifestations of COVID-19 and discuss their etiopathogenesis.</p>

	<p>Objective: fibromyalgia is a complex chronic pain syndrome characterized by widespread musculoskeletal pain, insomnia and autonomic alterations. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is regarded as a promising treatment in fibromyalgia, but its impact on autonomic function remains uncertain. In this research, we studied the effect of CBT on autonomic functions in fibromyalgia. Methods: Twenty-five participants underwent overnight polysomnographic recordings before and after CBT programs focused on pain (CBT-P) or a hybrid modality focused on pain and insomnia (CBT-C). Sleep quality, daily pain, depression and anxiety were assessed by self-reported questionnaires. We analyzed heart rate variability (HRV) using high-frequency power (HF) as a marker for parasympathetic activity, and low-frequency power (LF) and the LF/HF ratio as relative sympathetic markers during wakefulness and at each sleep stage. Results: After treatment, 14 patients (/25, 58.0%) reported improvement in their sleep: 6 in the CBT-P condition (/12, 50%), and 8 in the CBT-C condition (/13, 61.5%). We found that, regardless of the type of CBT, patients who reported improvement in sleep quality (n = 14, 58%) had an increase in HF during stages N2 (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05) and N3 (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). These changes were related to improvement in sleep quality (N2, r = &amp;amp;minus;0.43, p = 0.033) but not to pain, depression or anxiety. Conclusions: This study showed an improvement in parasympathetic cardiac control during non-rapid-eye-movement sleep following CBT in fibromyalgia participants who reported better sleep after this therapy. CBT may have a cardio-protective effect and HRV could be used as a sleep monitoring tool in fibromyalgia.</p>

     alt="Sex differences in morphine sensitivity are associated with differential glial expression in the brainstem of rats with neuropathic pain"/>
<p>It is well known that males and females show significant differences in both the analgesic and emetic effects of opiates. Our data provide evidence that changes in the morphology and activity of astrocytes in morphine sensitive and pain modulatory medullary regions might underlie these clinically important effects.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Chronic pain is more prevalent and reported to be more severe in women. Opioid analgesics are less effective in women and result in stronger nauseant effects. The neurobiological mechanisms underlying these sex differences have yet to be clearly defined, though recent research has suggested neuronal–glial interactions are likely involved. We have previously shown that similar to people, morphine is less effective at reducing pain behaviors in female rats. In this study, we used the immunohistochemical detection of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) expression to investigate sex differences in astrocyte density and morphology in six medullary regions known to be modulated by pain and/or opioids. Morphine administration had small sex-dependent effects on overall GFAP expression, but not on astrocyte morphology, in the rostral ventromedial medulla, the subnucleus reticularis dorsalis, and the area postrema. Significant sex differences in the density and morphology of GFAP immunopositive astrocytes were detected in all six regions. In general, GFAP-positive cells in females showed smaller volumes and reduced complexity than those observed in males. Furthermore, females showed lower overall GFAP expression in all regions except for the area postrema, the critical medullary region responsible for opioid-induced nausea and emesis. These data support the possibility that differences in astrocyte activity might underlie the sex differences seen in the processing of opioids in the context of chronic neuropathic pain.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Arginine vasopressin (AVP) serves as a neuromodulator in the brain. The hippocampus is one of the major targets for AVP, as it has been demonstrated that the hippocampus receives vasopressinergic innervation and expresses AVP receptors. The dentate gyrus (DG) granule cells (GCs) serve as a gate governing the inflow of information to the hippocampus. High densities of AVP receptors are expressed in the DG GCs. However, the roles and the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms of AVP in the DG GCs have not been determined. We addressed this question by recording from the DG GCs in rat hippocampal slices. Our results showed that application of AVP concentration-dependently evoked an inward holding current recorded from the DG GCs. AVP depolarized the DG GCs and increased their action potential firing frequency. The excitatory effects of AVP were mediated by activation of V<SUB>1a</SUB> receptors and required the function of phospholipase C&beta; (PLC&beta;). Whereas intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> release and protein kinase C activity were unnecessary, PLC&beta;-induced depletion of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate was involved in AVP-evoked excitation of the DG GCs. AVP excited the DG GCs by depression of the ATP-sensitive K<sup>+</sup> channels, which were required for AVP-elicited facilitation of long-term potentiation at the perforant path&ndash;GC synapses. Our results may provide a cellular and molecular mechanism to explain the physiological functions of AVP, such as learning and memory, and pathologic disorders like anxiety.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Enhancement of Motor Cortical Gamma Oscillations and Sniffing Activity by Medial Forebrain Bundle Stimulation Precedes Locomotion</a></h4>

              
                <p>The medial forebrain bundle (MFB) is a white matter pathway that traverses through mesolimbic structures and includes dopaminergic neural fibers ascending from the ventral tegmental area (VTA). Since dopaminergic signals represent hedonic responses, electrical stimulation of the MFB in animals has been used as a neural reward for operant and spatial tasks. MFB stimulation strongly motivates animals to rapidly learn to perform a variety of behavioral tasks to obtain a reward. Although the MFB is known to connect various brain regions and MFB stimulation dynamically modulates animal behavior, how central and peripheral functions are affected by MFB stimulation per se is poorly understood. To address this question, we simultaneously recorded electrocorticograms (ECoGs) in the primary motor cortex (M1), primary somatosensory cortex (S1), and olfactory bulb (OB) of behaving rats while electrically stimulating the MFB. We found that MFB stimulation increased the locomotor activity of rats. Spectral analysis confirmed that immediately after MFB stimulation, sniffing activity was facilitated and the power of gamma oscillations in the M1 was increased. After sniffing activity and motor cortical gamma oscillations were facilitated, animals started to move. These results provide insight into the importance of sniffing activity and cortical gamma oscillations for motor execution and learning facilitated by MFB stimulation.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Expert opinion on the habit forming properties of laxatives in patients with constipation [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Constipation is a commonly reported disorder in many patients. Constipation treatment using laxatives on a regular and long term basis can lead to patient dependence, especially among the elderly. However, there is scanty data on the habit-forming potential of laxatives in Indian constipated patients. This review has explored literature evidence and expert opinion on patients’ experience regarding habit-forming attributes of stimulant and osmotic laxatives. Additionally, structured face-to-face discussions were conducted with 2 key opinion leaders to understand their clinical experience on the habit-forming aspects stimulant and osmotic laxatives in patients with constipation. Based on literature evidence, lactulose is not known to lead to any habit-forming behaviors in patients. Furthermore, experts pointed out that dependence on stimulant laxatives is common, but not on osmotic laxatives, and emphasized that milk of magnesia is not habit forming. In conclusion, no habit-forming characteristics or dependence was observed with the use of osmotic laxatives in India. Nevertheless, real-world, studies exploring patient and physician perspectives are warranted to establish the dependence and habit forming attributes of laxatives.

                The web tool Adamant has been developed to systematically collect research metadata as early as the conception of the experiment. Adamant enables a continuous, consistent, and transparent research data management (RDM) process, which is a key element of good scientific practice ensuring the path to Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable (FAIR) research data. It simplifies the creation of on-demand metadata schemas and the collection of metadata according to established or new standards. The approach is based on JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) schema, where any valid schema can be presented as an interactive web-form. Furthermore, Adamant eases the integration of numerous available RDM methods and software tools into the everyday research activities of especially small independent laboratories. A programming interface allows programmatic integration with other software tools such as electronic lab books or repositories. The user interface (UI) of Adamant is designed to be as user friendly as possible. Each UI element is self-explanatory and intuitive to use, which makes it accessible for users that have little to no experience with JSON format and programming in general. Several examples of research data management workflows that can be implemented using Adamant are introduced.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Reconsidering the ethics of compulsive treatment in light of clinical psychiatry: A selective review of literature [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                The ethics of compulsive treatment (CT) is a medical, social and legal discussion that reemerged after the ratification by 181 countries of the 2007 United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN-CRPD). The optional protocol of the UN-CRPD was ratified by 86 countries aiming to promote, protect and ensure the full and equal enjoyment of all human rights. It also determined the need to review mental health laws as under this light treatment of persons with disabilities, particularly those with mental disorders, cannot accept the use of CT. This selective review of literature aims to clarify inputs from clinical psychiatry adding evidence to the multi-disciplinary discussion. It provides contradictory evidence on how patients experience CT and its impact on their mental health and treatment programs, also which are main reasons for the use of CT and what efforts in psychiatry have been made to reduce, replace and refine it.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Suboptimal human inference can invert the bias-variance trade-off for decisions with asymmetric evidence</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Tahra L. Eissa, Joshua I. Gold, Krešimir Josić, Zachary P. Kilpatrick</p>

Solutions to challenging inference problems are often subject to a fundamental trade-off between: 1) bias (being systematically wrong) that is minimized with complex inference strategies, and 2) variance (being oversensitive to uncertain observations) that is minimized with simple inference strategies. However, this trade-off is based on the assumption that the strategies being considered are optimal for their given complexity and thus has unclear relevance to forms of inference based on suboptimal strategies. We examined inference problems applied to rare, asymmetrically available evidence, which a large population of human subjects solved using a diverse set of strategies that varied in form and complexity. In general, subjects using more complex strategies tended to have lower bias and variance, but with a dependence on the form of strategy that reflected an inversion of the classic bias-variance trade-off: subjects who used more complex, but imperfect, Bayesian-like strategies tended to have lower variance but higher bias because of incorrect tuning to latent task features, whereas subjects who used simpler heuristic strategies tended to have higher variance because they operated more directly on the observed samples but lower, near-normative bias. Our results help define new principles that govern individual differences in behavior that depends on rare-event inference and, more generally, about the information-processing trade-offs that can be sensitive to not just the complexity, but also the optimality, of the inference process.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Modulation transfer functions for audiovisual speech</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Nicolai F. Pedersen, Torsten Dau, Lars Kai Hansen, Jens Hjortkjær</p>

Temporal synchrony between facial motion and acoustic modulations is a hallmark feature of audiovisual speech. The moving face and mouth during natural speech is known to be correlated with low-frequency acoustic envelope fluctuations (below 10 Hz), but the precise rates at which envelope information is synchronized with motion in different parts of the face are less clear. Here, we used regularized canonical correlation analysis (rCCA) to learn speech envelope filters whose outputs correlate with motion in different parts of the speakers face. We leveraged recent advances in video-based 3D facial landmark estimation allowing us to examine statistical envelope-face correlations across a large number of speakers (∼4000). Specifically, rCCA was used to learn modulation transfer functions (MTFs) for the speech envelope that significantly predict correlation with facial motion across different speakers. The AV analysis revealed bandpass speech envelope filters at distinct temporal scales. A first set of MTFs showed peaks around 3-4 Hz and were correlated with mouth movements. A second set of MTFs captured envelope fluctuations in the 1-2 Hz range correlated with more global face and head motion. These two distinctive timescales emerged only as a property of natural AV speech statistics across many speakers. A similar analysis of fewer speakers performing a controlled speech task highlighted only the well-known temporal modulations around 4 Hz correlated with orofacial motion. The different bandpass ranges of AV correlation align notably with the average rates at which syllables (3-4 Hz) and phrases (1-2 Hz) are produced in natural speech. Whereas periodicities at the syllable rate are evident in the envelope spectrum of the speech signal itself, slower 1-2 Hz regularities thus only become prominent when considering crossmodal signal statistics. This may indicate a motor origin of temporal regularities at the timescales of syllables and phrases in natural speech.

Suppression of recombination along the Y chromosome leads to its degeneration, so why does a process with such potentially deleterious consequences arise? In this issue of PLOS Biology, a new model reveals how and why this might be.

We know that suppression of recombination leads to degeneration of Y chromosomes, but it has remained difficult to understand how features with such strong negative effects actually arise. This Primer explores a new model published in PLOS Biology that reveals how this could happen.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Sheltering of deleterious mutations explains the stepwise extension of recombination suppression on sex chromosomes and other supergenes</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Paul Jay, Emilie Tezenas, Amandine Véber, Tatiana Giraud</p>

Many organisms have sex chromosomes with large nonrecombining regions that have expanded stepwise, generating “evolutionary strata” of differentiation. The reasons for this remain poorly understood, but the principal hypotheses proposed to date are based on antagonistic selection due to differences between sexes. However, it has proved difficult to obtain empirical evidence of a role for sexually antagonistic selection in extending recombination suppression, and antagonistic selection has been shown to be unlikely to account for the evolutionary strata observed on fungal mating-type chromosomes. We show here, by mathematical modeling and stochastic simulation, that recombination suppression on sex chromosomes and around supergenes can expand under a wide range of parameter values simply because it shelters recessive deleterious mutations, which are ubiquitous in genomes. Permanently heterozygous alleles, such as the male-determining allele in XY systems, protect linked chromosomal inversions against the expression of their recessive mutation load, leading to the successive accumulation of inversions around these alleles without antagonistic selection. Similar results were obtained with models assuming recombination-suppressing mechanisms other than chromosomal inversions and for supergenes other than sex chromosomes, including those without XY-like asymmetry, such as fungal mating-type chromosomes. However, inversions capturing a permanently heterozygous allele were found to be less likely to spread when the mutation load segregating in populations was lower (e.g., under large effective population sizes or low mutation rates). This may explain why sex chromosomes remain homomorphic in some organisms but are highly divergent in others. Here, we model a simple and testable hypothesis explaining the stepwise extensions of recombination suppression on sex chromosomes, mating-type chromosomes, and supergenes in general.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Alternative splicing of METTL3 explains apparently METTL3-independent m6A modifications in mRNA</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Hui Xian Poh, Aashiq H. Mirza, Brian F. Pickering, Samie R. Jaffrey</p>

<i>N</i><sup>6</sup>-methyladenosine (m<sup>6</sup>A) is a highly prevalent mRNA modification that promotes degradation of transcripts encoding proteins that have roles in cell development, differentiation, and other pathways. METTL3 is the major methyltransferase that catalyzes the formation of m<sup>6</sup>A in mRNA. As 30% to 80% of m<sup>6</sup>A can remain in mRNA after METTL3 depletion by CRISPR/Cas9-based methods, other enzymes are thought to catalyze a sizable fraction of m<sup>6</sup>A. Here, we reexamined the source of m<sup>6</sup>A in the mRNA transcriptome. We characterized mouse embryonic stem cell lines that continue to have m<sup>6</sup>A in their mRNA after <i>Mettl3</i> knockout. We show that these cells express alternatively spliced <i>Mettl3</i> transcript isoforms that bypass the CRISPR/Cas9 mutations and produce functionally active methyltransferases. We similarly show that other reported <i>METTL3</i> knockout cell lines express altered METTL3 proteins. We find that gene dependency datasets show that most cell lines fail to proliferate after <i>METTL3</i> deletion, suggesting that reported <i>METTL3</i> knockout cell lines express altered METTL3 proteins rather than have full knockout. Finally, we reassessed METTL3’s role in synthesizing m<sup>6</sup>A using an exon 4 deletion of <i>Mettl3</i> and found that METTL3 is responsible for >95% of m<sup>6</sup>A in mRNA. Overall, these studies suggest that METTL3 is responsible for the vast majority of m<sup>6</sup>A in the transcriptome, and that remaining m<sup>6</sup>A in putative <i>METTL3</i> knockout cell lines is due to the expression of altered but functional METTL3 isoforms.

<p>Homeostatic pH disturbance, specifically acidosis, is a trigger for panic attacks relevant to panic disorder; however, contributory mechanisms are still unclear. Here we report a role of microglial acid chemosensory G protein–coupled receptor, T-cell death-associated gene 8, within the subfornical organ in orchestrating acidosis-evoked, fear-associated behavior of relevance to panic.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>An important role of pH homeostasis has been suggested in the physiology of panic disorder, with acidosis as an interoceptive trigger leading to fear and panic. Identification of novel mechanisms that can translate acidosis into fear will promote a better understanding of panic physiology. The current study explores a role of the subfornical organ (SFO), a blood–brain barrier compromised brain area, in translating acidosis to fear-relevant behaviors. We performed SFO-targeted acidification in male, wild-type mice and mice lacking microglial acid-sensing G protein–coupled receptor—T-cell death-associated gene 8 (TDAG8). Localized SFO acidification evoked significant freezing and reduced exploration that was dependent on the presence of acid-sensor TDAG8. Acidosis promoted the activation of SFO microglia and neurons that were absent in TDAG8-deficient mice. The assessment of regional neuronal activation in wild-type and TDAG8-deficient mice following SFO acidification revealed significant acidosis and genotype-dependent alterations in the hypothalamus, amygdala, prefrontal cortex, and periaqueductal gray nuclei. Furthermore, mapping of interregional co-activation patterns revealed that SFO acidosis promoted positive hypothalamic-cortex associations and desynchronized SFO-cortex and amygdala-cortex associations, suggesting an interplay of homeostatic and fear regulatory areas. Importantly, these alterations were not evident in TDAG8-deficient mice. Overall, our data support a regulatory role of subfornical organ microglial acid sensing in acidosis-evoked fear, highlighting a centralized role of blood–brain barrier compromised nodes in interoceptive sensing and behavioral regulation. Identification of pathways by which humoral information can modulate fear behavior is relevant to panic disorder, where aberrant interoceptive signaling has been reported.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Noninvasive brain stimulation (NIBS) techniques such as transcranial magnetic stimulation and transcranial direct current stimulation are widely used to test the involvement of specific cortical regions in various domains such as cognition and emotion. Despite the capability of stimulation techniques to test causal directions, this approach has been only sparsely used to examine the cortical regulation of autonomic nervous system (ANS) functions such as heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV) and to test current models in this regard. In this preregistered (PROSPERO) systematic review and meta-analysis, we aimed to investigate, based on meta-regression, whether NIBS represents an effective method for modulating HR and HRV measures, and to evaluate whether the ANS is modulated by cortical mechanisms affected by NIBS. Here we have adhered to the PRISMA guidelines. In a series of four meta-analyses, a total of 131 effect sizes from 35 sham-controlled trials were analyzed using robust variance estimation random-effects meta-regression technique. NIBS was found to effectively modulate HR and HRV with small to medium effect sizes. Moderator analyses yielded significant differences in effects between stimulation of distinct cortical areas. Our results show that NIBS is a promising tool to investigate the cortical regulation of ANS, which may add to the existing brain imaging and animal study literature. Future research is needed to identify further factors modulating the size of effects. As many of the studies reviewed were found to be at high risk of bias, we recommend that methods to reduce potential risk of bias be used in the design and conduct of future studies.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Exercise is an effective neuroprotective intervention that preserves retinal function and structure in several animal models of retinal degeneration. However, the retinal cell types governing exercise-induced neuroprotection remain elusive. Previously, we found exercise-induced retinal neuroprotection was associated with increased levels of retinal brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and required intact signal transduction with its high-affinity receptor, tropomyosin kinase B (TrkB). Brain studies have shown astrocytes express BDNF and TrkB and that decreased BDNF–TrkB signaling in astrocytes contributes to neurodegeneration. Additionally, exercise has been shown to alter astrocyte morphology. Using a light-induced retinal degeneration (LIRD) model, we investigated how exercise influences retinal astrocytes in adult male BALB/c mice. Treadmill exercise in dim control and LIRD groups had increased astrocyte density, GFAP labeling, branching, dendritic endpoints, and arborization. Meanwhile, inactive LIRD animals had significant reductions in all measured parameters. Additionally, exercised groups had increased astrocytic BDNF expression that was visualized using proximity ligase assay. Isolated retinal astrocytes from exercised LIRD groups had significantly increased expression of a specific isoform of TrkB associated with cell survival, TrkB.FL. Conversely, inactive LIRD isolated retinal astrocytes had significantly increased expression of TrkB.T1, which has been implicated in neuronal cell death. Our data indicate exercise not only alters retinal astrocyte morphology but also promotes specific BDNF–TrkB signaling associated with cell survival and protection during retinal degeneration. These findings provide novel insights into the effects of treadmill exercise on retinal astrocyte morphology and cellular expression, highlighting retinal astrocytes as a potential cell type involved in BDNF–TrkB signaling.</p>

<p>We have determined cuprizone demyelination and remyelination is correlated with a loss and restoration of bladder continence. Interestingly, while cuprizone-induced CNS demyelination severely affected conscious (cortical) urinary behavior, the brainstem and spinal cord reflex remained unchanged.

<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, progressively debilitating demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS). Nearly 80% of MS patients experience lower urinary tract dysfunction early in their diagnosis. This significantly affects the quality of life, and in latter stages of disease is a leading cause of hospitalization. Previously, animal models have shown that inflammatory demyelination in the CNS causes profound bladder dysfunction, but the confounding influence of systemic inflammation limits the potential interpretation of the contribution of CNS demyelination to bladder dysfunction. Since the micturition circuit has myelinated neuronal connections in the cortex, brainstem, and spinal cord, we examined alterations in bladder function in the cuprizone model characterized by demyelinating lesions in the cortex and corpus callosum that are independent of T-cell–mediated autoimmunity. Herein, we report that a 4-week dietary cuprizone treatment in C57Bl/6J mice induced alterations in voiding behavior with increased micturition frequency and reduced volume voided, similar to human MS bladder dysfunction. Subsequently, recovery from cuprizone treatment restored normal bladder function. Demyelination and remyelination were confirmed by Luxol Fast Blue staining of the corpus callosum. Additionally, we also determined that an 8-week cuprizone treatment, resulting in chronic demyelination lacking spontaneous remyelination potential, is associated with an exacerbated voiding phenotype. Interestingly, while cuprizone-induced CNS demyelination severely affected conscious (cortical) urinary behavior, the brainstem and spinal cord reflex remained unchanged, as confirmed by urethane-anesthetized cystometry. This is the first study to show that cortical demyelination independent of inflammation can negatively impact urinary function.</p>

<p>NURR1 regulates the production of dopamine. Dopamine is present in dopaminergic neurons to regulate movement and emotion and in blood to control cardiac functions. Here, we demonstrated motor impairment, increased brain DA level and heart rate in old NURR1-deficient mice independently from sex, although sex affects their spontaneous locomotion.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The transcription factor NURR1 is essential to the generation and maintenance of midbrain dopaminergic (mDA) neurons and its deregulation is involved in the development of dopamine (DA)-associated brain disorders, such as Parkinson's disease (PD). The old male NURR1 heterozygous knockout (NURR1-KO) mouse has been proposed as a model of PD due to its altered motor performance that was, however, not confirmed in a subsequent study. Based on these controversial results, we explored the effects of the NURR1 deficiency on locomotor activity, motor coordination, brain and plasma DA levels, blood pressure and heart rate of old mice, also focusing on the potential effect of sex. As a probable consequence of the role of NURR1 in DA pathway, we observed that the old NURR1-KO mouse is characterized by motor impairment, and increased brain DA level and heart rate, independently from sex. However, we also observed an alteration in spontaneous locomotor activity that only affects males. In conclusion, NURR1 deficiency triggers sex- and age-specific alterations of behavioral responses, of DA levels and cardiovascular abnormalities. Further studies in simplified systems will be necessary to dissect the mechanism underlying these observations.</p>

     alt="Resveratrol inhibits the activity of acid-sensing ion channels in male rat dorsal root ganglion neurons"/>
<p>Acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) are expressed in nociceptive sensory neurons to detect changes in extracellular pH. Once ASICs are activated by H<sup>+</sup>, cation influx (largely Na<sup>+</sup>) will cause depolarization of membrane potentials and bursts of action potentials (APs), then resulting in pain. Resveratrol can inhibit ASICs, so that H<sup>+</sup> produces reduced responses in the amplitude of membrane currents and the number of APs, leading to a relief of acid-induced pain.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Resveratrol can relieve pain under various pain conditions. One of the mechanisms of resveratrol analgesia is the regulation of ion channels. Acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) are expressed predominantly in nociceptive sensory neurons to detect changes in extracellular pH. ASICs are important players in pain associated with tissue acidification. However, it is still unclear whether ASICs are resveratrol targets. Electrophysiological recordings showed that resveratrol decreased acid-induced and ASIC-mediated currents in male rat dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons in a concentration-dependent manner. Resveratrol downwardly shifted the concentration–response curve for protons, suggesting that it inhibited ASICs not by changing the pH<sub>0.5</sub>, but by suppressing the proton-induced maximum response. It also suppressed acid-triggered action potentials in the rat DRG neurons. Finally, intraplantar pretreatment with resveratrol relieved acid-induced nociceptive responses in male rats in a dose-dependent manner. These results indicated that resveratrol inhibited ASIC-mediated electrophysiological activity and nociception, suggesting a novel peripheral mechanism underlying its analgesic effect.</p>

<p>Age-related hearing loss (ARHL, formerly presbycusis) is one of the most common chronic diseases in the elderly. Our cross-sectional study examined pathophysiology of ARHL and provided evidence for impaired performance of all parts of the auditory system including central auditory processing.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Age-related hearing loss (ARHL, formerly presbycusis) is due to a variety of lifetime damages to the auditory system and is characterized by bilateral sensorineural hearing loss, impaired speech understanding in noise and central sound processing deficits. Despite its commonness, the pathogenesis has not been completely clarified yet; especially the existence of an independent central ARHL component still remains controversial. We present the results of a cross-sectional topodiagnostic test battery study which aimed at separating aging- and hearing loss-related effects on all parts of the auditory system by current test procedures. Three groups of 30 participants each underwent extensive topodiagnostic test procedures (otoscopy, tympanometry, questionnaires, pure-tone audiometry, DPOAE threshold measurements, auditory brainstem response, central auditory discrimination tests, and speech-in-noise test). By comparing the results of the normally hearing young (18–26 years) and healthy control group, the normally hearing elderly group (60–80 years) and the hearing-impaired elderly group (60–80 years), we deduced aging and hearing loss-related effects on auditory performance. All measurements indicated a significant deterioration of auditory performance in the elderly, partly associated with aging and partly with age-related hearing loss. Our study thereby contributes to a multifocal concept of ARHL. All parts of the auditory system are impaired by aging, age-related hearing loss, or a combination of both. Further evidence for an independent central ARHL component, not attributable to peripheral hearing loss, is provided by the results of the central auditory discrimination test.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Connectivity changes after spinal cord injury (SCI) appear as dynamic post-injury procedures. The present study aimed to investigate the alterations in the functional connectivity (FC) in different injury duration in complete SCI using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). A total of 30 healthy controls (HCs) and 27 complete SCI patients were recruited in this study. A seed-based connectivity analysis compared FC differences between HCs and SCI and among SCI subgroups (SCI patients with post-injury within 6 months (early stage, <i>n</i> = 13) vs. those with post-injury beyond 6 months (late stage, <i>n</i> = 14)). Compared to HCs, SCI patients showed an increase in FC between sensorimotor cortex and cognitive, visual, and auditory cortices. The FC between motor cortex and cognitive cortex increased over time after injury. The FC between sensory cortex and visual cortex increased within 6 months after SCI, while FC between the sensory cortex and auditory cortex increased beyond 6 months after injury. The FC between sensorimotor cortex and cognitive, visual, auditory regions increased in complete SCI patients. The brain FC changed dynamically, and rehabilitation might be adapted over time after SCI.</p>

Pathophysiologically, PD is characterized by an early loss of dopaminergic neurons in the <i>Substantia nigra pars compacta</i>, accompanied by the extensive aggregation of alpha-synuclein (<i>α-Syn</i>) in the form of Lewy bodies. The onset of PD has been reported to be influenced by multiple biological molecules. In this context, circular RNAs (circRNAs), as tissue-specific noncoding RNAs with closed structures, have been recently demonstrated to involve in a set of PD's pathogenic processes. These RNA molecules can either up- or downregulate the expression of <i>α-Syn</i>, as well as moderating its accumulation through different regulatory mechanisms, in which targeting microRNAs (miRNAs) is considered the most common pathway. Since circRNAs have prominent structural and biological characteristics, they could also be considered as promising candidates for PD diagnosis and treatment. Unfortunately, PD has become a global health concern, and a large number of its pathogenic processes are still unclear; thus, it is crucial to elucidate the ambiguous aspects of PD pathophysiology to improve the efficiency of diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. In line with this fact, the current review aims to highlight the interplay between circRNAs and PD pathogenesis, and then discusses the diagnostic and therapeutic potential of circRNAs in PD progression. This study will thus be the first of its kind reviewing the relationship between circRNAs and PD.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Space environment provides many challenges to pilots, astronauts, and space scientists, which are constantly subjected to unique conditions, including microgravity, radiations, hypoxic condition, absence of the day and night cycle, etc. These stressful stimuli have the potential to affect many human physiological systems, triggering physical and biological adaptive changes to re-establish the homeostatic state. A particular concern regards the risks for the effects of spaceflight on the central nervous system (CNS), as several lines of evidence reported a great impact on neuroplasticity, cognitive functions, neurovestibular system, short-term memory, cephalic fluid shift, reduction in motor function, and psychological disturbances, especially during long-term missions. Aside these potential detrimental effects, the other side of the coin reflects the potential benefit of applicating space-related conditions on Earth-based life sciences, as cancer research. Here, we focused on examining the effect of real and simulated microgravity on CNS functions, both in humans and in cellular models, browsing the different techniques to experience or mime microgravity on-ground. Increasing evidence demonstrate that cancer cells, and brain cancer cells in particular, are negatively affected by microgravity, in terms of alteration in cell morphology, proliferation, invasion, migration, and apoptosis, representing an advancing novel side of space-based investigations. Overall, deeper understandings about the mechanisms by which space environment influences CNS and tumor biology may be promisingly translated into many clinical fields, ranging from aerospace medicine to neuroscience and oncology, representing an enormous pool of knowledge for the implementation of countermeasures and therapeutic applications.</p>

<p>We demonstrate that administration of a novel selenopeptide named PSELT to a lesioned facial nerve improved its regeneration and ameliorated motor performances in rat, strongly suggesting that PSELT is a valuable therapeutic candidate to treat peripheral nerve injuries.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Peripheral nerve injury (PNI) is frequent and many patients suffer lifelong disabilities in severe cases. Although the peripheral nervous system is able to regenerate, its potential is limited. In this study, we tested in a nerve regeneration model in rat the potential beneficial effect of a short mimetic peptide, named PSELT, which derives from SELENOT, an essential thioredoxin-like selenoprotein endowed with neuroprotective and antioxidant activities. For this purpose, the right facial nerve of female Long–Evans rats was axotomized then bridged with a free femoral vein interposition graft. PSELT (1 μM) was injected into the vein immediately and 48 h after the injury, and the effects observed were compared to those found after an end-to-end suture used as a gold standard treatment. Whisking behavior, electrophysiological potential, and histological analyses were performed 3 months after injury to determine the effects of these treatments. These analyses revealed that PSELT-treated animals exhibit a better motor recovery in terms of protraction amplitude and velocity of vibrissae compared to control and end-sutured nerve animal groups. Moreover, administration of PSELT following injury enhanced muscle innervation, axonal elongation, and myelination of newly formed nerve fibers. Altogether, these results indicate that a PSELT-based treatment is sufficient to enhance facial nerve myelination and regeneration and could represent a new therapeutic tool to treat PNI.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Rett syndrome is a leading cause of intellectual disability in females primarily caused by loss of function mutations in the transcriptional regulator MeCP2. Loss of MeCP2 leads to a host of synaptic phenotypes that are believed to underlie Rett syndrome pathophysiology. Synaptic deficits vary by brain region upon MeCP2 loss, suggesting distinct molecular alterations leading to disparate synaptic outcomes. In this study, we examined the contribution of MeCP2's newly described role in miRNA regulation to regional molecular and synaptic impairments. Two miRNAs, miR-101a and miR-203, were identified and confirmed as upregulated in MeCP2 KO mice in the hippocampus and cortex, respectively. miR-101a overexpression in hippocampal cultures led to opposing effects at excitatory and inhibitory synapses and in spontaneous and evoked neurotransmission, revealing the potential for a single miRNA to broadly regulate synapse function in the hippocampus. These results highlight the importance of regional alterations in miRNA expression and the specific impact on synaptic function with potential implications for Rett syndrome.</p>

                Dysregulation of iron homeostasis contributes to aging, but little information is available about the molecular mechanisms. Here, Patnaik et al. show that the mRNA-binding protein Cth2, which is involved in regulation of iron-dependent genes, is induced during aging and links impaired iron homeostasis with an age-related decline of mitochondrial function.

                Douanne et al. demonstrate that extracellular vesicles (EVs) released by drug-resistant Leishmania are enriched in genomic regions containing drug-resistance genes. Moreover, circular amplicons containing drug-resistance genes can exploit EVs to guarantee efficient propagation into naive, sensitive parasites, leading to the emergence of drug-resistant subpopulations.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Design of an optimal combination therapy with broadly neutralizing antibodies to suppress HIV-1</a></h4>

              
                Infusion of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) has shown promise as an alternative to anti-retroviral therapy against HIV. A key challenge is to suppress viral escape, which is more effectively achieved with a combination of bNAbs. Here, we propose a computational approach to predict the efficacy of a bNAb therapy based on the population genetics of HIV escape, which we parametrize using high-throughput HIV sequence data from bNAb-naive patients. By quantifying the mutational target size and the fitness cost of HIV-1 escape from bNAbs, we predict the distribution of rebound times in three clinical trials. We show that a cocktail of three bNAbs is necessary to effectively suppress viral escape, and predict the optimal composition of such bNAb cocktail. Our results offer a rational therapy design for HIV, and show how genetic data can be used to predict treatment outcomes and design new approaches to pathogenic control.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Recruitment of clathrin to intracellular membranes is sufficient for vesicle formation</a></h4>

              
                The formation of a clathrin-coated vesicle is a major membrane remodeling process that is crucial for membrane traffic in cells. Besides clathrin, these vesicles contain at least 100 different proteins although it is unclear how many are essential for the formation of the vesicle. Here, we show that intracellular clathrin-coated formation can be induced in living cells using minimal machinery and that it can be achieved on various membranes, including the mitochondrial outer membrane. Chemical heterodimerization was used to inducibly attach a clathrin-binding fragment 'hook' to an 'anchor' protein targeted to a specific membrane. Endogenous clathrin assembled to form coated pits on the mitochondria, termed MitoPits, within seconds of induction. MitoPits are double-membraned invaginations that form preferentially on high curvature regions of the mitochondrion. Upon induction, all stages of CCV formation - initiation, invagination, and even fission - were faithfully reconstituted. We found no evidence for the functional involvement of accessory proteins in this process. In addition, fission of MitoPit-derived vesicles was independent of known scission factors including dynamins and dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1), suggesting that the clathrin cage generates sufficient force to bud intracellular vesicles. Our results suggest that, following its recruitment, clathrin is sufficient for intracellular clathrin-coated vesicle formation.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Ndc1 drives nuclear pore complex assembly independent of membrane biogenesis to promote nuclear formation and growth</a></h4>

              
                The nuclear envelope (NE) assembles and grows from bilayer lipids produced at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). How ER membrane incorporation coordinates with assembly of nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) to generate a functional NE is not well understood. Here, we use the stereotypical first division of the early <i>C. elegans</i> embryo to test the role of the membrane-associated nucleoporin Ndc1 in coupling NPC assembly to NE formation and growth. 3D-EM tomography of reforming and expanded NEs establishes that Ndc1 determines NPC density. Loss of <i>ndc1</i> results in faster turnover of the outer scaffold nucleoporin Nup160 at the NE, providing an explanation for how Ndc1 controls NPC number. NE formation fails in the absence of both Ndc1 and the inner ring component Nup53, suggesting partially redundant roles in NPC assembly. Importantly, upregulation of membrane synthesis restored the slow rate of nuclear growth resulting from loss of <i>ndc1</i> but not from loss of <i>nup53</i>. Thus, membrane biogenesis can be decoupled from Ndc1-mediated NPC assembly to promote nuclear growth. Together, our data suggest that Ndc1 functions in parallel with Nup53 and membrane biogenesis to control NPC density and nuclear size.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Both prey and predator features predict the individual predation risk and survival of schooling prey</a></h4>

              
                Predation is one of the main evolutionary drivers of social grouping. While it is well appreciated that predation risk is likely not shared equally among individuals within groups, its detailed quantification has remained difficult due to the speed of attacks and the highly-dynamic nature of collective prey response. Here, using high-resolution tracking of solitary predators (Northern pike) hunting schooling fish (golden shiners), we not only provide insights into predator decision-making, but show which key spatial and kinematic features of predator and prey predict the risk of individuals to be targeted and to survive attacks. We found that pike tended to stealthily approach the largest groups, and were often already inside the school when launching their attack, making prey in this frontal 'strike zone' the most vulnerable to be targeted. From the prey's perspective, those fish in central locations, but relatively far from, and less aligned with, neighbours, were most likely to be targeted. While the majority of attacks were successful (70%), targeted individuals that did manage to avoid being captured exhibited a higher maximum acceleration response just before the attack and were further away from the pike's head. Our results highlight the crucial interplay between predators' attack strategy and response of prey underlying the predation risk within mobile animal groups.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Impact of energy limitations on function and resilience in long-wavelength photosystem II</a></h4>

              
                Photosystem II (PSII) uses the energy from red light to split water and reduce quinone, an energy-demanding process based on chlorophyll a (Chl-a) photochemistry. Two types of cyanobacterial PSII can use chlorophyll d (Chl-d) and chlorophyll f (Chl-f) to perform the same reactions using lower energy, far-red light. PSII from <i>Acaryochloris marina</i> has Chl-d replacing all but one of its 35 Chl-a, while PSII from <i>Chroococcidiopsis thermalis</i>, a facultative far-red species, has just 4 Chl-f and 1 Chl-d and 30 Chl-a. From bioenergetic considerations, the far-red PSII were predicted to lose photochemical efficiency and/or resilience to photodamage. Here, we compare enzyme turnover efficiency, forward electron transfer, back-reactions and photodamage in Chl-f-PSII, Chl-d-PSII and Chl-a-PSII. We show that: i) all types of PSII have a comparable efficiency in enzyme turnover; ii) the modified energy gaps on the acceptor side of Chl-d-PSII favour recombination via P<sub>D1</sub><sup>+</sup>Phe<sup>-</sup> repopulation, leading to increased singlet oxygen production and greater sensitivity to high-light damage compared to Chl-a-PSII and Chl-f-PSII; iii) the acceptor-side energy gaps in Chl-f-PSII are tuned to avoid harmful back reactions, favouring resilience to photodamage over efficiency of light usage. The results are explained by the differences in the redox tuning of the electron transfer cofactors Phe and Q<sub>A</sub> and in the number and layout of the chlorophylls that share the excitation energy with the primary electron donor. PSII has adapted to lower energy in two distinct ways, each appropriate for its specific environment but with different functional penalties.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Interplay of surface interaction and magnetic torque in single-cell motion of magnetotactic bacteria in microfluidic confinement</a></h4>

              
                Swimming microorganisms often experience complex environments in their natural habitat. The same is true for microswimmers in envisioned biomedical applications. The simple aqueous conditions typically studied in the lab differ strongly from those found in these environments and often exclude the effects of small volume confinement or the influence that external fields have on their motion. In this work, we investigate magnetically steerable microswimmers, specifically magnetotactic bacteria, in strong spatial confinement and under the influence of an external magnetic field. We trap single cells in micrometer-sized microfluidic chambers and track and analyze their motion, which shows a variety of different trajectories, depending on the chamber size and the strength of the magnetic field. Combining these experimental observations with simulations using a variant of an active Brownian particle model, we explain the variety of trajectories by the interplay between the wall interactions and the magnetic torque. We also analyze the pronounced cell-to-cell heterogeneity, which makes single-cell tracking essential for an understanding of the motility patterns. In this way, our work establishes a basis for the analysis and prediction of microswimmer motility in more complex environments.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neurophysiological markers of successful learning in healthy aging</a></h4>

              
                The capacity to learn and memorize is a key determinant for the quality of life, but is known to decline to varying degrees with age. Previous ERP research methods had the limitation that their design did not allow to track the gradual memory formation process. Thus, the neural mechanisms underlying memory formation and the critical features that determine the extent to which aging affects learning are still unknown. By using a visual sequence learning task, which consists of the repeated presentation of a simple sequence of tokens, we are able to track the progress of gradual memory formation through both neurophysiological and behavioral markers. On a neurophysiological level, we focused on two learning related centroparietal ERP components: the P300 and broad positivity. Our results revealed that although both age groups showed significant learning progress, young individuals learned faster and remembered more stimuli than older participants. Successful learning was directly linked to a decrease of P300 amplitude. However, young participants showed larger P300 amplitude with a sharper decrease during the memory formation process. The P300 amplitude predicted learning success in both age groups, was associated with increased fronto-parietal brain network activation and showed good test-retest reliability. Highly, similar results were found for the broad positivity component, which raises the questions if the BP is a distinct component or just a prolonged P300. In a series of analyses, including topographic analysis of variance (TANOVA), equivalence testing and source reconstruction analysis, we addressed the unresolved questions. These analyses revealed concordant distributed brain activation patterns within parietal circuits. Thus, there is no evidence (rather evidence for equivalence) for distinct underlying neural generators for the two components. Taken together, the results highlight the importance of the P300 as a neurophysiological marker of learning, and may enable the development of preventive measures for age-related impeded learning.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Spindle-dependent memory consolidation in healthy adults: A meta-analysis</a></h4>

              
                Accumulating evidence suggests a central role for sleep spindles in the consolidation of new memories. However, no meta-analysis of the association between sleep spindles and memory performance has been conducted so far. Here, we report meta-analytical evidence for spindle-memory associations and investigate how multiple factors, including memory type, spindle type, spindle characteristics, and EEG topography affect this relationship. The literature search yielded 53 studies reporting 1424 effect sizes, resulting in a small to moderate effect for the average association. We further found that spindle-memory associations were significantly stronger for procedural memory than for declarative memory. Neither spindle types nor EEG scalp topography had an impact on the strength of the spindle-memory relation, but we observed a distinct functional role of global and fast sleep spindles, especially for procedural memory. We also found a moderation effect of spindle characteristics, with spindle frequency and power showing the largest effect sizes. Collectively, our findings suggest that sleep spindles are involved in learning and plasticity, thereby representing a general physiological mechanism for memory consolidation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">All-optical observation on activity-dependent nanoscale dynamics of myelinated axons</a></h4>

              
                In the mammalian brain, rapid conduction of neural information is supported by the myelin, whose functional efficacy shows steep dependence on its nanoscale cytoarchitecture. Although previous in vitro studies suggested that neural activity accompanies nanometer-scale cellular deformations, it has remained unexplored whether neural activity can dynamically remodel the myelinated axon due to the technical challenge in observing its nanostructural dynamics in living tissues. To this end, we introduced a novel all-optical approach combining a nanoscale dynamic readout based on spectral interferometry and optogenetic control of neural excitation on a living brain slice preparation. In response to optogenetically evoked neuronal burst firing, the myelinated axons exhibited progressive and reversible spectral redshifts, corresponding to the transient swelling at a subnanometer scale. We further revealed that the activity-dependent nanostructural dynamics was localized to the paranode. In summary, our novel all-optical studies substantiate that myelinated axon exhibits activity-dependent nanoscale swelling, which potentially serves to dynamically tune the transmission speed of neural information.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cannabidiol prevents spontaneous fear recovery after extinction and ameliorates stress-induced extinction resistance</a></h4>

              
                Cannabidiol, the main non-psychotropic constituent of cannabis, has potential as a treatment for anxiety-related disorders since it reduces learned fear expression and enhances fear extinction. The return of fear over time after successful extinction and stress-induced extinction resistance are potential barriers to the treatment of these disorders with extinction-based psychological therapy. In two experiments using rats subjected to auditory fear conditioning, we determined the effects of systemic cannabidiol treatment on (1) delayed extinction and later spontaneous fear recovery, and (2) extinction resistance caused by immediate extinction (the immediate extinction deficit (IED)). In Experiment 1, cannabidiol was given before delayed extinction occurring 24 hr after conditioning, with extinction recall and spontaneous fear recovery tested drug-free 1 and 21 days after extinction, respectively. We found that cannabidiol had no effect on extinction recall but it prevented spontaneous fear recovery. In Experiment 2, the IED procedure was first validated, with immediate extinction occurring 30 min after conditioning. We confirmed that immediate extinction impaired extinction recall, compared to delayed extinction. Next, cannabidiol was given before immediate or no extinction, with extinction recall tested drug-free the next day. We found that cannabidiol rescued the IED, which did not involve effects on fear memory consolidation. In summary, cannabidiol prevented spontaneous fear recovery after delayed extinction and ameliorated extinction resistance caused by immediate extinction. Although the pharmacological mechanisms underlying these effects remain to be determined, our results add to evidence indicating that cannabidiol might prove useful as an adjunct for potentiating the psychological treatment of anxiety-related disorders.

                Could non-pharmacological constructs, such as beliefs, impact brain activities in a dose-dependent manner as drugs do? Here, nicotine-addicted human participants were made to believe that an electronic cigarette they were about to vape contained either 'low', 'medium', or 'high' levels of nicotine, while nicotine strength was held constant. We then measured their brain signals during decision-making with functional MRI. Across the entire brain, we found that only the thalamus, a brain region rich in nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, showed a dose-dependent response to beliefs in both neural activity and connectivity with the prefrontal cortex. These findings demonstrate a dose-response relationship between beliefs and neurobiology, a mechanism previously known to only apply to pharmacological agents.

                In this paper, we propose a simplified and robust model for Place cell generation based on the Oscillatory Interference (OI) model concept. Aiming toward hardware implementation in bio-inspired Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) systems for mobile robotics, we base our model on logic operations that reduce its computational complexity. The model compensates for parameter variations in the behaviors of the population of constituent Theta cells, and allows the Theta cells to have square-wave oscillation profiles. The robustness of the model, with respect to mismatch in the Theta cell's base oscillation frequency and gain as a function of modulatory inputs is demonstrated. Place cell composed of 48 Theta cells with base frequency variations with a 25% standard deviation from the mean and a gain error with 20% standard deviation from the mean only result in a 20% deformations within the place field and 0.24% outer side lobes, and an overall pattern with 0.0015 mean squared error on average. We also present how the model can be used to achieve the localization and path-tracking functionalities of SLAM.

                Midbrain dopamine neurons are thought to play key roles in learning by conveying the difference between expected and actual outcomes. While this teaching signal is often considered to be uniform, recent evidence instead supports diversity in dopamine signaling. However, it remains poorly understood how heterogeneous signals might be organized to facilitate the role of downstream circuits mediating distinct aspects of behavior. Here we investigated the organizational logic of dopaminergic signaling by recording and labeling individual midbrain dopamine neurons during associative behavior. We defined combinations of protein expression and cellular localization to sort recorded neurons according to the striatal regions they innervate. Our findings show that reward information and task variables are not only heterogeneously encoded, with multiplexing, but also differentially distributed across populations of dopamine neurons projecting to different regions of striatum. These data, supported by computational modelling, indicate that such distributional coding can maximize dynamic range and tailor dopamine signals to facilitate the specialized roles of different striatal regions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Sensory deprivation triggers phenotypic adjustment of dopaminergic interneurons in the mouse olfactory bulb</a></h4>

              
                Neurogenesis persists in the mammalian subventricular zone after birth, producing various populations of olfactory bulb (OB) interneurons. These include GABAergic and mixed dopaminergic/GABAergic double neurotransmitter neurons for the glomerular layer. While olfactory sensory activity is one of the main factors controlling newborn neuron integration, its effect on specific neuronal subtypes is far less clear. Here we use a reversible unilateral deprivation paradigm in combination with longitudinal in vivo imaging to characterize the behavior of newborn glomerular neurons. We find that a substantial fraction of purely GABAergic neurons die after four weeks of sensory deprivation. Tyrosine Hydroxylase (TH) positive dopaminergic/ GABAergic neurons show no signifficant cell death under deprivation, but react with an important decrease in TH expression levels. Importantly, this effect reverses after naris reopening, pointing to a specific adaptation of this neuron population to the level of sensory activity. We conclude that sensory deprivation induces adjustments in the excitation/inhibition balance of the OB implicating cell death and adaptation of neurotransmitter use in specific neuron types.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">X chromosome factor Kdm6a enhances memory independent of its demethylase function in the aging XY male brain</a></h4>

              
                Males exhibit shorter lifespan and more cognitive deficits in aging human populations. In mammals, the X chromosome is enriched for neural genes and is a major source of biologic sex difference, in part, because males show decreased expression of select X factors. While each sex (XX and XY) harbors one active X due to X chromosome inactivation in females, some genes, such as Kdm6a, transcriptionally escape silencing in females - resulting in lower levels in males. Kdm6a is a known histone demethylase (H3K27me2/3) with multiple functional domains that is linked with synaptic plasticity and cognition. Whether elevating Kdm6a could benefit the aging male brain, and whether this requires its demethylase function remains unknown. We used lentiviral-mediated overexpression of the X factor in the hippocampus of aging male mice and tested their cognition and behavior in the Morris water maze. We found that acutely increasing Kdm6a - in a form without demethylase function - selectively improved learning and memory, without altering total activity or anxiety-like measures, in the aging XY brain. Further understanding the demethylase-independent downstream mechanisms of Kdm6a may lead to novel therapies for treating age-induced cognitive deficits in both sexes.

                Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) is the most common dominantly inherited ataxia. Currently, no preventative or disease-modifying treatments exist for this progressive neurodegenerative disorder, although efforts using gene silencing approaches are under clinical trial investigation. The disease is caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the mutant gene, ATXN3, which produces an abnormally enlarged polyglutamine tract in the mutant ATXN3 protein. Similar to other paradigmatic neurodegenerative diseases, studies evaluating the pathogenic mechanism focus primarily on neuronal implications. Consequently, therapeutic interventions generated to target these deficiencies often overlook non-neuronal contributions to disease. Our lab recently reported that oligodendrocytes display some of the earliest and most progressive dysfunction in SCA3 mice. Evidence of disease-associated oligodendrocyte signatures has also been reported in other neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, ALS, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disease. Here, we assess the effects of anti-ATXN3 antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) treatment on oligodendrocyte dysfunction in both premanifest and symptomatic SCA3 mouse models. We report a severe, but modifiable, deficit in oligodendrocyte maturation caused by the toxic gain-of-function of mutant ATXN3 early in SCA3 disease progression that is transcriptionally, biochemically, and functionally rescued with anti-ATXN3 ASO. Our results establish the necessity of considering non-neuronal targets in future neurodegenerative disease therapies.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Deletion induced splicing in RIC3 drives nicotinic acetylcholine receptor regulation with implications for endoplasmic reticulum stress in human astrocytes</a></h4>

              
                Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) dysregulation in astrocytes is reported in neurodegenerative disorders. Modulation of nAChRs through agonists confers protection to astrocytes from stress but regulation of chaperones is unclear. Resistance to inhibitors of cholinesterase 3 (RIC3) is a potential chaperone of nAChRs but poorly studied in humans. We characterized RIC3 in astrocytes derived from an isogenic wild-type and a Cas9 edited del human iPSC line harboring a 25bp homozygous deletion in exon2. Altered RIC3 transcript ratio due to deletion induced splicing and an unexpected gain of alpha7nAChR expression were observed in del astrocytes. Transcriptome analysis showed higher expression of neurotransmitter/G-protein coupled receptors mediated by cAMP and calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase signaling. Functional implications of these observations were examined using tunicamycin induced ER stress. Wild-type astrocyte stress model showed cell cycle arrest, RIC3 upregulation, reduction in alpha7nAChR surface levels but increased alpha4nAChR surface expression. Conversely, tunicamycin treated del astrocytes showed a comparatively higher alpha4nAChR surface expression and upsurged cAMP signaling. In addition, reduced expression of stress markers CHOP, phospho-PERK and lowered XBP1 splicing in western blot and qPCR, validated by proteome-based pathway analysis indicated lowered disease severity. These findings indicate i) a complex RNA regulatory mechanism via exonic deletion induced splicing; ii) RIC-3 as a disordered protein having contrasting effects on co-expressed nAChR subtypes under basal/stress conditions; and iii) RIC3 as a potential drug target against ER stress in astrocytes for nicotine related brain disorders. Furthermore, cellular rescue mechanism through deletion induced exon skipping possibly opens up ASO based therapies for tauopathies.

	<p>Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a neuropsychiatric disorder, with 30&amp;amp;ndash;40% of OCD patients being unresponsive to adequate trials of anti-OCD drugs and cognitive behavior therapy. The aim of this paper is to investigate the efficacy of non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) on treating refractory OCD. With PubMed, Embase, PsycInfo, and Cochrane Library used on 15 February 2022, 24 randomized controlled trials involving 663 patients were included. According to this analysis, NIBS including repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), theta-burst stimulation (TBS), and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), had a moderate effect on the reduction of Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) scores (SMD = 0.54, 95% CI: 0.26&amp;amp;ndash;0.81; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01). In the subgroup analysis, rTMS seemed to produce a better therapeutic effect (SMD = 0.73, 95% CI: 0.38&amp;amp;ndash;1.08; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01). Moreover, excitatory (SMD = 1.13, 95% CI: 0.24&amp;amp;ndash;2.01; p = 0.01) and inhibitory (SMD = 0.81, 95% CI: 0.26&amp;amp;ndash;1.36; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01) stimulation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) both alleviated OCD symptoms. In the secondary outcome of clinical response rates, NIBS treatment led to an increase in response rates (RR = 2.26, 95% CI: 1.57&amp;amp;ndash;3.25; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01).</p>

	<p>The instructor&amp;amp;rsquo;s presence on the screen has become a popular feature in the video lectures of online learning and has drawn increasing research interest. Studies on the instructor presence effect of video lectures mainly focused on the features of the instructor, and few have taken learners&amp;amp;rsquo; differences, such as gender, into consideration. The current study examined whether male and female learners differed in their learning performance and eye movement features when learning video lectures with and without the instructor&amp;amp;rsquo;s presence. All participants (N = 64) were asked to watch three different types of video lectures: audio-video without instructor presence (AV), picture-video with instructor presence (PV), and video-video with instructor presence (VV). They watched nine videos, three of each condition, and completed a reading comprehension test after each video. Their eye movement data were simultaneously collected when they watched these videos. Results showed that learners gained better outcomes after watching the videos with a talking instructor (VV) than those with the instructor&amp;amp;rsquo;s picture (PV) or without the instructor (AV). This finding suggests that the dynamic presence of the instructor in video lectures could enhance learning through increased social presence and agency. Gender differences were found in their attention allocation, but not behavioral learning performance. When watching the videos with a talking instructor (VV), female learners dwelt longer on the instructor, while males transited more between the instructor and the text. Our results highlight the value of instructor presence in video lectures and call for more comprehensive explorations of gender differences in online learning outcomes and attention distribution.</p>

	<p>Brain control by locus coeruleus (LC) neurons involves afferent glutamate (Glu) inputs. In newborns, LC Glu receptors and responses may be sparse due to immaturity of the brain circuits providing such input. However, we reported, using newborn rat brain slices, that Glu and its ionotropic receptor (iGluR) agonist NMDA transform spontaneous local field potential (LFP) rhythm. Here, we studied whether &amp;amp;alpha;-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic-acid (AMPA) and kainate (KA) iGluR subtypes also transform the LFP pattern. AMPA (0.25&amp;amp;ndash;0.5 &amp;amp;micro;M) and KA (0.5&amp;amp;ndash;2.5 &amp;amp;micro;M) merged ~0.2 s-lasting bell-shaped LFP events occurring at ~1 Hz into ~40% shorter and ~4-fold faster spindle-shaped and more regular sinusoidal oscillations. The AMPA/KA effects were associated with a 3.1/4.3-fold accelerated phase-locked single neuron spiking due to 4.0/4.2 mV depolarization while spike jitter decreased to 64/42% of the control, respectively. Raising extracellular K+ from 3 to 9 mM increased the LFP rate 1.4-fold or elicited slower multipeak events. A blockade of Cl&amp;amp;minus;-mediated inhibition with gabazine (5 &amp;amp;mu;M) plus strychnine (10 &amp;amp;mu;M) affected neither the control rhythm nor AMPA/KA oscillations. GYKI-53655 (25 &amp;amp;mu;M) blocked AMPA (but not KA) oscillations whereas UBP-302 (25 &amp;amp;mu;M) blocked KA (but not AMPA) oscillations. Our findings revealed that AMPA and KA evoke a similar novel neural network discharge pattern transformation type by acting on pharmacologically distinct AMPAR and KA receptors. This shows that already the neonatal LC can generate oscillatory network behaviors that may be important, for example, for responses to opioids.</p>

	<p>Conversations are an important part of our daily lives, enabling us to interact with others and participate in a range of activities. For people with Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s, conversation can be challenging when communication is impacted. This qualitative exploratory study investigated the experiences of people with Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s and their close communication partners in conversations. The study explored influences on conversational participation, considering perceived barriers and facilitators to participation in conversation for people with Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s. Interviews were conducted with eight dyads, with participants interviewed both jointly and separately (24 interviews). Five themes revealed that conversation appears to be influenced not only by the communication skills of the person with Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s, but also by factors associated with the communication partner, the complex nature of conversations, the communication environment, and the impact of experience in shaping participation in conversation. Specific barriers and facilitators to conversational participation were identified. This study offers important insight into the lived experience of people with Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s affected by communication difficulties. The findings support the notion that it is more than simply the communication skills of the person with Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s that influence conversations. It is important that other factors influencing conversational success should be included in interventions supporting communication for people with Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s.</p>

                Roof mounted solar panels come in form of fixed panels, unable to adjust to sun’s position during day and throughout the year. As an effect, the efficiency of such solution is usually dependent on the roof slope and position of the building in relation to sun’s day arc during seasons. These problems can be bypassed in free standing solar installations by equipping solar panels with solar tracker installations. Thanks to solar tracking, solar panels can be dynamically positioned perpendicular to the sun position and gather energy more efficiently throughout the day. This article presents a possibility of creating a roof mounted solar tracking panel to increase irradiance efficiency. A prototype of solar tracking panel with two axes of movement was designed with an intention of an easy adaptation to being mounted on sloped surfaces of building roofs. A reference stationary panel was used to compare the efficiency of both solutions. A 5-day study was carried out to determine if the proposed solution could provide any benefits. Based on the study, the authors made an attempt to draw a conclusion whether the design could considerably increase the solar energy output to be worth the extra spending associated with solar tracker installation.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Genomic prediction in plants: opportunities for ensemble machine learning based approaches [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Many studies have demonstrated the utility of machine learning (ML) methods for genomic prediction (GP) of various plant traits, but a clear rationale for choosing ML over conventionally used, often simpler parametric methods, is still lacking. Predictive performance of GP models might depend on a plethora of factors including sample size, number of markers, population structure and genetic architecture. Methods: Here, we investigate which problem and dataset characteristics are related to good performance of ML methods for genomic prediction. We compare the predictive performance of two frequently used ensemble ML methods (Random Forest and Extreme Gradient Boosting) with parametric methods including genomic best linear unbiased prediction (GBLUP), reproducing kernel Hilbert space regression (RKHS), BayesA and BayesB. To explore problem characteristics, we use simulated and real plant traits under different genetic complexity levels determined by the number of Quantitative Trait Loci (QTLs), heritability (h2 and h2e), population structure and linkage disequilibrium between causal nucleotides and other SNPs. Results: Decision tree based ensemble ML methods are a better choice for nonlinear phenotypes and are comparable to Bayesian methods for linear phenotypes in the case of large effect Quantitative Trait Nucleotides (QTNs). Furthermore, we find that ML methods are susceptible to confounding due to population structure but less sensitive to low linkage disequilibrium than linear parametric methods. Conclusions: Overall, this provides insights into the role of ML in GP as well as guidelines for practitioners.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Network resonance can be generated independently at distinct levels of neuronal organization</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Eran Stark, Amir Levi, Horacio G. Rotstein</p>

Resonance is defined as maximal response of a system to periodic inputs in a limited frequency band. Resonance may serve to optimize inter-neuronal communication, and has been observed at multiple levels of neuronal organization. However, it is unknown how neuronal resonance observed at the network level is generated and how network resonance depends on the properties of the network building blocks. Here, we first develop a metric for quantifying spike timing resonance in the presence of background noise, extending the notion of spiking resonance for in vivo experiments. Using conductance-based models, we find that network resonance can be inherited from resonances at other levels of organization, or be intrinsically generated by combining mechanisms across distinct levels. Resonance of membrane potential fluctuations, postsynaptic potentials, and single neuron spiking can each be generated independently of resonance at any other level and be propagated to the network level. At all levels of organization, interactions between processes that give rise to low- and high-pass filters generate the observed resonance. Intrinsic network resonance can be generated by the combination of filters belonging to different levels of organization. Inhibition-induced network resonance can emerge by inheritance from resonance of membrane potential fluctuations, and be sharpened by presynaptic high-pass filtering. Our results demonstrate a multiplicity of qualitatively different mechanisms that can generate resonance in neuronal systems, and provide analysis tools and a conceptual framework for the mechanistic investigation of network resonance in terms of circuit components, across levels of neuronal organization.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Drug repurposing based on a quantum-inspired method versus classical fingerprinting uncovers potential antivirals against SARS-CoV-2</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jose M. Jimenez-Guardeño, Ana Maria Ortega-Prieto, Borja Menendez Moreno, Thomas J. A. Maguire, Adam Richardson, Juan Ignacio Diaz-Hernandez, Javier Diez Perez, Mark Zuckerman, Albert Mercadal Playa, Carlos Cordero Deline, Michael H. Malim, Rocio Teresa Martinez-Nunez</p>

The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the need to identify new antiviral therapeutics at pace, including through drug repurposing. We employed a Quadratic Unbounded Binary Optimization (QUBO) model, to search for compounds similar to Remdesivir, the first antiviral against SARS-CoV-2 approved for human use, using a quantum-inspired device. We modelled Remdesivir and compounds present in the DrugBank database as graphs, established the optimal parameters in our algorithm and resolved the Maximum Weighted Independent Set problem within the conflict graph generated. We also employed a traditional Tanimoto fingerprint model. The two methods yielded different lists of lead compounds, with some overlap. While GS-6620 was the top compound predicted by both models, the QUBO model predicted BMS-986094 as second best. The Tanimoto model predicted different forms of cobalamin, also known as vitamin B12. We then determined the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) values in cell culture models of SARS-CoV-2 infection and assessed cytotoxicity. We also demonstrated efficacy against several variants including SARS-CoV-2 Strain England 2 (England 02/2020/407073), B.1.1.7 (Alpha), B.1.351 (Beta) and B.1.617.2 (Delta). Lastly, we employed an <i>in vitro</i> polymerization assay to demonstrate that these compounds directly inhibit the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) of SARS-CoV-2. Together, our data reveal that our QUBO model performs accurate comparisons (BMS-986094) that differed from those predicted by Tanimoto (different forms of vitamin B12); all compounds inhibited replication of SARS-CoV-2 via direct action on RdRP, with both models being useful. While Tanimoto may be employed when performing relatively small comparisons, QUBO is also accurate and may be well suited for very complex problems where computational resources may limit the number and/or complexity of possible combinations to evaluate. Our quantum-inspired screening method can therefore be employed in future searches for novel pharmacologic inhibitors, thus providing an approach for accelerating drug deployment.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Sample-efficient identification of high-dimensional antibiotic synergy with a normalized diagonal sampling design</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jennifer Brennan, Lalit Jain, Sofia Garman, Ann E. Donnelly, Erik Scott Wright, Kevin Jamieson</p>

Antibiotic resistance is an important public health problem. One potential solution is the development of synergistic antibiotic combinations, in which the combination is more effective than the component drugs. However, experimental progress in this direction is severely limited by the number of samples required to exhaustively test for synergy, which grows exponentially with the number of drugs combined. We introduce a new metric for antibiotic synergy, motivated by the popular Fractional Inhibitory Concentration Index and the Highest Single Agent model. We also propose a new experimental design that samples along all appropriately normalized diagonals in concentration space, and prove that this design identifies all synergies among a set of drugs while only sampling a small fraction of the possible combinations. We applied our method to screen two- through eight-way combinations of eight antibiotics at 10 concentrations each, which requires sampling only 2,560 unique combinations of antibiotic concentrations.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Single-cell network biology characterizes cell type gene regulation for drug repurposing and phenotype prediction in Alzheimer’s disease</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Chirag Gupta, Jielin Xu, Ting Jin, Saniya Khullar, Xiaoyu Liu, Sayali Alatkar, Feixiong Cheng, Daifeng Wang</p>

Dysregulation of gene expression in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) remains elusive, especially at the cell type level. Gene regulatory network, a key molecular mechanism linking transcription factors (TFs) and regulatory elements to govern gene expression, can change across cell types in the human brain and thus serve as a model for studying gene dysregulation in AD. However, AD-induced regulatory changes across brain cell types remains uncharted. To address this, we integrated single-cell multi-omics datasets to predict the gene regulatory networks of four major cell types, excitatory and inhibitory neurons, microglia and oligodendrocytes, in control and AD brains. Importantly, we analyzed and compared the structural and topological features of networks across cell types and examined changes in AD. Our analysis shows that hub TFs are largely common across cell types and AD-related changes are relatively more prominent in some cell types (e.g., microglia). The regulatory logics of enriched network motifs (e.g., feed-forward loops) further uncover cell type-specific TF-TF cooperativities in gene regulation. The cell type networks are also highly modular and several network modules with cell-type-specific expression changes in AD pathology are enriched with AD-risk genes. The further disease-module-drug association analysis suggests cell-type candidate drugs and their potential target genes. Finally, our network-based machine learning analysis systematically prioritized cell type risk genes likely involved in AD. Our strategy is validated using an independent dataset which showed that top ranked genes can predict clinical phenotypes (e.g., cognitive impairment) of AD with reasonable accuracy. Overall, this single-cell network biology analysis provides a comprehensive map linking genes, regulatory networks, cell types and drug targets and reveals cell-type gene dysregulation in AD.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">The ciliopathy protein CCDC66 controls mitotic progression and cytokinesis by promoting microtubule nucleation and organization</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Umut Batman, Jovana Deretic, Elif Nur Firat-Karalar</p>

Precise spatiotemporal control of microtubule nucleation and organization is critical for faithful segregation of cytoplasmic and genetic material during cell division and signaling via the primary cilium in quiescent cells. Microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) govern assembly, maintenance, and remodeling of diverse microtubule arrays. While a set of conserved MAPs are only active during cell division, an emerging group of MAPs acts as dual regulators in dividing and nondividing cells. Here, we elucidated the nonciliary functions and molecular mechanism of action of the ciliopathy-linked protein CCDC66, which we previously characterized as a regulator of ciliogenesis in quiescent cells. We showed that CCDC66 dynamically localizes to the centrosomes, the bipolar spindle, the spindle midzone, the central spindle, and the midbody in dividing cells and interacts with the core machinery of centrosome maturation and MAPs involved in cell division. Loss-of-function experiments revealed its functions during mitotic progression and cytokinesis. Specifically, CCDC66 depletion resulted in defective spindle assembly and orientation, kinetochore fiber stability, chromosome alignment in metaphase as well as central spindle and midbody assembly and organization in anaphase and cytokinesis. Notably, CCDC66 regulates mitotic microtubule nucleation via noncentrosomal and centrosomal pathways via recruitment of gamma-tubulin to the centrosomes and the spindle. Additionally, CCDC66 bundles microtubules in vitro and in cells by its C-terminal microtubule-binding domain. Phenotypic rescue experiments showed that the microtubule and centrosome-associated pools of CCDC66 individually or cooperatively mediate its mitotic and cytokinetic functions. Collectively, our findings identify CCDC66 as a multifaceted regulator of the nucleation and organization of the diverse mitotic and cytokinetic microtubule arrays and provide new insight into nonciliary defects that underlie ciliopathies.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Case Report: Smoking as the risk factor of persistent STEMI after primary percutaneous coronary intervention: how it could be happen? [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is a common disease. Smoking may increase the risk of ACS. The most advantageous therapy is percutaneous coronary intervention. This therapy may fail which is no-reflow phenomenon as the result. Total occlusion may increase the risk of no-reflow phenomenon which it could be worse with smoking as the habits. ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) may show in electrocardiogram (ECG). Case description A 37-year-old male came to the hospital with chest pain as the main complaint. ECG examination showed that there was wide anterior STEMI. Coronary angiography was then done and confirmed that there was total occlusion in left anterior descending artery. After two days hospitalization, the patient developed to cardiogenic shock and lead to acute decompensated heart failure. An ECG showed there was STEMI anterior after primary PCI. Discussion Many chemicals agent contain in cigarette smoking and it may induce the lipid oxidation which leads to plaque deposits. Plaque that deposits in coronary artery may rupture and make thrombus occlusion. This occlusion may partial or total, when there is total occlusion, STEMI was the result. Then, releasing the occlusion is needed for this situation ant PCI may be chosen as the therapy. Patient with wide ischemia may result the no-reflow phenomenon which may lead to heart failure and shock cardiogenic as the complication. Conclusion Smoking may induce ACS which leads to STEMI and may increase the failure of PCI therapy. No-reflow phenomenon is the evidence of miscarriage in therapy which it may increase because of smoking.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Protocol for a proof-of-concept study evaluating systematic quality improvement with Realtime event support (SQUIRES) [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: Quality improvement (QI) in healthcare results in better patient outcomes, healthcare system performance, and professional development. One target of QI initiatives in the perioperative period is surgical site infections (SSI), for which several risk factors have been identified. Reliable administration of indicated surgical antibiotic prophylaxis is a modifiable factor of particular relevance. We hypothesize that a novel telemedicine-augmented quality improvement program will improve administration of surgical antibiotic prophylaxis. Objectives: The objective of this QI study is to evaluate the utility of a telemedicine-augmented QI initiative on administration of timely surgical antibiotic prophylaxis. The incidence of SSI will also be reported for multiple surgical services. Methods: This will be a multi-center prospective before-and-after proof-of-concept study. Patients undergoing a surgical procedure across seven operating room facilities at four hospitals in the BJC Healthcare System will be included. Approximately 40,000 patients over an eight-month period will be enrolled. This eight-month period will include a baseline observational phase, an education intervention phase, an intervention phase employing real-time event detection with associated guidance from a remote telemedicine center, and a subsequent observational phase. The primary outcome will be administration of on-time surgical antibiotic prophylaxis throughout the trial. Other outcomes will include incidence of SSIs. Registration Information: This trial is registered on clinicaltrials.gov, NCT04983329 (30th July 2021).

                Dimensionality reduction of spatial omic data can reveal shared, spatially structured patterns of expression across a collection of genomic features. We studied strategies for discovering and interactively visualizing low-dimensional structure in spatial omic data based on the construction of neighborhood features. We designed quantile and network-based spatial features that result in spatially consistent embeddings. A simulation compares embeddings made with and without neighborhood-based featurization, and a re-analysis of Keren et al., 2019 illustrates the overall workflow. We provide an R package, NBFvis, to support computation and interactive visualization for the proposed dimensionality reduction approach. Code and data for reproducing experiments and analysis are available on GitHub.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Micro-shear bond strength of different surface treatments on a polymer infiltrated ceramic network [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Polymer infiltrated ceramic networks, or hybrid ceramics, are a combination of infiltrating polymerizable organic monomers into a pre-sintered porous ceramic matrix. In addition to having good mechanical properties, the polymer infiltrated ceramic network must comply with the possibility of adequate bonding to the resinous cement. The surface conditioning of this hybrid material must be carefully considered due to its organic composition and ceramic network. The purpose of this research is to evaluate the effect of hydrofluoric acid and a self-etching ceramic primer, under two different application times, on the bond strength of a polymer infiltrated ceramic network. Methods: Blocks of a polymer infiltrated ceramic network were cut to obtain sheets, and these were randomized into five groups. For the group termed AAS, airborne-particle abrasion with Al2O3 (aluminum oxide) of 50µm was used. For groups HF2 and HF6, hydrofluoric acid was used for 20 and 60 seconds respectively, and for the groups MB2 and MB6, a self-etch ceramic primer was applied for 20 and 60 seconds respectively. A silane was applied to the groups AAS, HF2, and HF6 after the treatment. After 24-hour storage in distilled water, a micro-shear bond strength test was performed using a universal mechanical testing machine. All samples were evaluated in a stereomicroscope at 40x and 50x to determine the type of failure. Results: The highest and lowest values of bond strength were reported by groups MB6 and AAS, respectively. Groups HF2, HF6, MB6, and MB2 did not report statistically significant differences. The predominant failure pattern was a mixed failure. Conclusions: With the limitations of the present investigation, the treatments of self-etching ceramic primer and hydrofluoric acid followed by silane were reported to be statistically equal at 20 and 60 seconds.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Multiparty democracy, social cohesion, and human development in Sub-Saharan Africa: A panel data analysis [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The reintroduction of multiparty democracy in Sub-Saharan Africa during the early 90s and the persistent poor human development performance of the region, have sparked several controversies regarding the need for such a political system in Africa. In the extant literature, these controversies have been characterized by fierce theoretical debates as to whether multiparty democracy influences human development and the scholarly contention that social cohesion, rather than this form of democracy, ameliorates human development. The present study examines these controversies along with the perception of Sub-Saharan African populations concerning the democratic transition and its impact on their well-being. Methods: A panel data analysis of 35 countries was conducted between 1995 to 2019 in order to determine the effect of multiparty democracy, social cohesion, and their interaction on human development. Fixed-effects and system generalized methods of moments estimations were used to control for specific characteristics. Results: The study found that, multiparty democracy, social cohesion, and the interaction between these two variables have a positive long-term effect on human development. More importantly, the study revealed that social cohesion decreases the negative influence of multiparty democracy on human development. Conclusions: Overall, the findings of this study suggest that multiparty democracy is likely to improve the well-being of the populations of Sub-Saharan Africa if the degree of social cohesion is sufficiently high. That also means that social cohesion is susceptible to dampening the negative effect of multiparty democracy on human development in the context of this study. As such, social cohesion is critical in terms of the extent to which multiparty democracy wields influence on human development outcomes in Sub-Saharan Africa. Based on these conclusions, a number of policy recommendations are discussed in the present study towards the achievement of sustained human development in the Sub-Saharan African region.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Protocol for a randomized study of the efficacy of ibandronic acid plus eldecalcitol in patients with gastric cancer after gastrectomy: A comparative study of different routes of administration of ibandronic acid [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer rev</a></h4>

              
                Background: Patients who undergo gastrectomy for gastric cancer are susceptible to osteoporosis. To prevent a decrease in bone mineral density, an appropriate prophylaxis is considered important to adjust the post-gastrectomy condition. In this study, we will compare two different routes of administration of ibandronic acid (oral or intravenous) plus eldecalcitol as a potentially more suitable treatment for patients at a high risk of fragile fracture. Protocol: This study protocol describes a randomized, active-controlled, non-blind, single-center, phase II trial. For patients in the investigational arm (Group A), sodium ibandronate hydrate will be administered intravenously once a month with daily oral intake of eldecalcitol; for those in the control arm (Group B), sodium ibandronate hydrate will be administered orally once a month with daily oral intake of eldecalcitol. We will recruit patients aged 20–85 years who have undergone gastrectomy for gastric cancer and are at a risk of fragility fractures. The study will include patients with existing vertebral fractures and/or femoral proximal fractures, or with lumbar and/or proximal femur bone mineral density of less than 80% of the young adult mean. The primary outcome of this study will be the change in lumbar bone mineral density. We will also evaluate the changes in femur bone mineral density, bone metabolism markers, health-related quality of life as evaluated using the EuroQol 5 Dimension (EQ-5D), and digestive symptoms as evaluated using the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale after 52 weeks of treatment. Conclusions: We believe that appropriate treatments that are adjusted to the condition of patients after gastrectomy are important for the prevention of bone mineral loss. Registration: This study was accepted by the Japan Registry of Clinical Trials (jRCT1041200059, November 6, 2021).

                Background: Acute swelling or cellulitis may develop within a few days after placing a definitive prosthesis or reconnecting a loose healing abutment/prosthesis, though its cause remains unclear. In this study, we propose a mechanism for the underlying pathogenesis. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the symptoms and signs, onset of symptoms, recovery duration, and laboratory data of seven women and two men (55–84 years) who exhibited acute swelling and pain around dental implants within a month of connecting definitive prosthesis or reconnecting a loose healing abutment/prosthesis between 2013 and 2021. Results: The extent of the swelling varied from the gingiva and vestibule around the implant to the face and neck regions. The swelling persisted despite removal of the connected superstructure. All patients recovered within three weeks of symptom onset. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the rapid onset of symptoms and signs, progress, duration, and etiology were consistent with the pathogenesis of deep tissue injury, which is characterized by acute inflammatory swelling that initiates from the interface between bone and subcutaneous tissue and progresses outward. Clinicians should be aware of the pathogenesis of pressure-induced injury and provide adequate treatment based on the underlying physiological process.

                Background: This article examines how current jurists can deal with a juristic division of the world into abode of "Islam” and “infidelity". The success with which jurists re-evaluate this dichotomy will have major impacts on how an Islamic state interacts with non-Muslim governments on the one hand, and Muslims residing temporarily or permanently in a non-Muslim territory on the other. Methods: Here, an attempt made to review the concepts of Dar Al-Islam and Dar Al-Harb from two perspectives: that of the dialectical limits and liberalization, as discussed in secondary material such as books, research articles, and reports. Results: this paper has explored and discussed the criteria for identifying Dar Al-Islam and Dar Al-Harb in Islamic jurisprudence. Conclusions: This article analyzes the various arguments put forward to establish new ways of peaceful coexisting and maintaining healthy international connections.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The olfactory placode (OP) of vertebrates generates several classes of migrating cells, including hypothalamic gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH)-producing neurons, which play essential roles in the reproduction system. Previous studies using OP cell labeling have demonstrated that OP-derived non-GnRH cells enter the developing forebrain; however, their final fates and phenotypes are less well understood. In chick embryos, a subpopulation of migratory cells from the OP that is distinct from GnRH neurons transiently expresses somatostatin (SS). We postulated that these cells are destined to develop into brain neurons. In this study, we examined the expression pattern of SS mRNA in the olfactory-forebrain region during development, as well as the destination of OP-derived migratory cells, including SS mRNA-expressing cells. Utilizing the Tol2 genomic integration system to induce long-term fluorescent protein expression in OP cells, we found that OP-derived migratory cells labeled at embryonic day (E) 3 resided in the olfactory nerve and medial forebrain at E17–19. A subpopulation of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-labeled GnRH neurons that remained in the olfactory nerve was considered to comprise terminal nerve neurons. In the forebrain, GFP-labeled cells showed a distribution pattern similar to that of GnRH neurons. A large proportion of GFP-labeled cells expressed the mature neuronal marker NeuN. Among the GFP-labeled cells, the percentage of GnRH neurons was low, while the remaining GnRH-negative neurons either expressed SS mRNA, neuropeptide Y, or calbindin D-28k or did not express any of them. These results indicate that a diverse population of OP-derived neuronal cells, other than GnRH neurons, integrates into the chick medial forebrain.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Mathematical relationships between spinal motoneuron properties</a></h4>

              
                Our understanding of the behaviour of spinal alpha-motoneurons (MNs) in mammals partly relies on our knowledge of the relationships between MN membrane properties, such as MN size, resistance, rheobase, capacitance, time constant, axonal conduction velocity and afterhyperpolarization period. We reprocessed the data from 40 experimental studies in adult cat, rat and mouse MN preparations, to empirically derive a set of quantitative mathematical relationships between these MN electrophysiological and anatomical properties. This validated mathematical framework, which supports past findings that the MN membrane properties are all related to each other and clarifies the nature of their associations, is besides consistent with the Henneman's size principle and Rall's cable theory. The derived mathematical relationships provide a convenient tool for neuroscientists and experimenters to complete experimental datasets, to explore relationships between pairs of MN properties never concurrently observed in previous experiments, or to investigate inter-mammalian-species variations in MN membrane properties. Using this mathematical framework, modelers can build profiles of inter-consistent MN-specific properties to scale pools of MN models, with consequences on the accuracy and the interpretability of the simulations.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Stress diminishes outcome but enhances response representations during instrumental learning</a></h4>

              
                Stress may shift behavioural control from a goal-directed system that encodes action-outcome relationships, to a habitual system that learns stimulus-response associations. Although this shift to habits is highly relevant for stress-related psychopathologies, limitations of existing behavioural paradigms hinders research from answering the fundamental question of whether the stress-induced bias to habits is due to reduced outcome processing, or enhanced response processing at the time of stimulus presentation - or both. Here, we used EEG-based multivariate pattern analysis to decode neural outcome representations crucial for goal-directed control, as well as response representations during instrumental learning. We show that stress reduced outcome representations but enhanced response representations. Both were directly associated with a behavioural index of habitual responding. Furthermore, changes in outcome and response representations were uncorrelated, suggesting that these may reflect distinct processes. Our findings indicate that habitual behaviour under stress may be the result of both enhanced stimulus-response processing and diminished outcome processing.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">AR-V7 exhibits non-canonical mechanisms of nuclear import and chromatin engagement in castrate-resistant prostate cancer</a></h4>

              
                Expression of the AR splice variant, AR-V7, in prostate cancer is correlated with poor patient survival and resistance to AR targeted therapies and taxanes. Currently, there is no specific inhibitor of AR-V7, while the molecular mechanisms regulating its biological function are not well elucidated. Here we report that AR-V7 has unique biological features that functionally differentiate it from canonical AR-fl or from the second most prevalent variant, AR-v567. First, AR-V7 exhibits fast nuclear import kinetics via a pathway distinct from the nuclear localization signal dependent importin-a/b pathway used by AR-fl and AR-v567. We also show that the dimerization box domain, known to mediate AR dimerization and transactivation, is required for AR-V7 nuclear import but not for AR-fl. Once in the nucleus, AR-V7 is transcriptionally active, yet exhibits unusually high intranuclear mobility and transient chromatin interactions, unlike the stable chromatin association of liganded AR-fl. The high intranuclear mobility of AR-V7 together with its high transcriptional output, suggest a Hit-and-Run mode of transcription. Our findings reveal unique mechanisms regulating AR-V7 activity, offering the opportunity to develop selective therapeutic interventions.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Deconstructing cold-induced brown adipocyte neogenesis in mice</a></h4>

              
                Cold exposure triggers neogenesis in classic interscapular brown adipose tissue (iBAT) that involves activation of b1-adrenergic receptors, proliferation of PDGFRA+ adipose tissue stromal cells (ASCs), and recruitment of immune cells whose phenotypes are presently unknown. Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) in mice identified three ASC subpopulations that occupied distinct tissue locations. Of these, interstitial ASC1 were found to be direct precursors of new brown adipocytes (BAs). Surprisingly, knockout of b1-adrenergic receptors in ASCs did not prevent cold-induced neogenesis, whereas pharmacological activation of the b3-adrenergic receptor on BAs was sufficient, suggesting that signals derived from mature BAs indirectly trigger ASC proliferation and differentiation. In this regard, cold exposure induced the delayed appearance of multiple macrophage and dendritic cell populations whose recruitment strongly correlated with the onset and magnitude of neogenesis across diverse experimental conditions. High resolution immunofluorescence and single molecule fluorescence <i>in situ</i> hybridization demonstrated that cold-induced neogenesis involves dynamic interactions between ASC1 and recruited immune cells that occur on the micrometer scale in distinct tissue regions. Our results indicate that neogenesis is not a reflexive response of progenitors to b-adrenergic signaling, but rather is a complex adaptive response to elevated metabolic demand within brown adipocytes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Automated and manual segmentation of the hippocampus in human infants</a></h4>

              
                The hippocampus, critical for learning and memory, undergoes substantial changes early in life. Investigating the developmental trajectory of hippocampal structure and function requires an accurate method for segmenting this region from anatomical MRI scans. Although manual segmentation is regarded as the "gold standard" approach, it is laborious and subjective. This has fueled the pursuit of automated segmentation methods in adults. However, little is known about the reliability of these protocols in human infants, particularly when anatomical scan quality is low from increased head motion or shorter sequences that minimize head motion. During a task-based fMRI protocol, we collected quiet T1-weighted anatomical scans from 42 sessions with awake infants aged 4-23 months. We first had two expert tracers manually segment the hippocampus bilaterally and assess inter-rater reliability. We then attempted to predict these manual segmentations using four protocols: average adult template, average infant template, FreeSurfer software, and Automated Segmentation of Hippocampal Subfields (ASHS) software. ASHS generated the most reliable hippocampal segmentations in infants, exceeding manual inter-rater reliability of the experts. Automated methods can thus provide robust hippocampal segmentations of noisy T1-weighted infant scans, opening new possibilities for interrogating early hippocampal development.

                Humans modulate the behavior flexibly after timely receiving and processing information from the environment. To better understand and measure human behavior in the driving process, we integrate humans and the environment as a system. The eye-movement methodologies are used to provide a bridge between humans and environment. Thus, we conduct a goal-directed task in virtual driving to investigate the law of eye-movement that could characterize the humans (internal) and environmental (external) state measured by fixation distribution and optical flows distribution. The analysis of eye-movement data combined with the information-theoretic tool, transfer entropy, active information storage, quantify the humans' cognitive effort and receiving information, and in fact, there is a balance (optimal) range between two, because of the mutual synergy and inhibition, whose quantified value is named balance of information processing. Subsequently, we update a system-level model, finding that those information measurements, transfer entropy, active information storage, and balance of information processing, all are included. This information set is information flow, which is quantified by the square root of Jensen-Shannon divergence (SRJSD), named information flow gain. What's more, results also demonstrate that the influence of system-level information flow correlated with behavioral performance stronger than the separate measurements. In conclusion, we research humans' eye-movement based on information theory to analyze behavioral performance. Besides driving, these measurements may be a predictor for other behaviors such as walking, running, etc. Still, the limitation is that the information flow may be a proxy of determinants of behavior.

                The speech envelope is considered as a major acoustic correlate of the syllable rhythm since the peak frequency in the speech modulation spectrum matches the mean syllable rate. Nevertheless, it has not been quantified whether the peak modulation frequency can track the syllable rate of individual utterances and how much variance of the speech envelope can be explained by the syllable rhythm. Here, we address these problems by analyzing large speech corpora (>1000 hours of recording of multiple languages) using advanced sequence-to-sequence modeling. It is found that, only when averaged over minutes of speech recordings, the peak modulation frequency of speech reliably correlates with the syllable rate of a speaker. In contrast, the phase-locking between speech envelope and syllable onsets is robustly observed within a few seconds of recordings. Based on speaker-independent linear and nonlinear models, the timing of syllable onsets explains about 13% and 46% variance of the speech envelope, respectively. These results demonstrate that local temporal features in the speech envelope precisely encode the syllable onsets but the modulation spectrum is not always dominated by the syllable rhythm.

                Cells throughout the human body detect mechanical forces. While it is known that the rapid (millisecond) detection of mechanical forces is mediated by force-gated ion channels, a detailed quantitative understanding of cells as sensors of mechanical energy is still lacking. Here, we combine atomic force microscopy with patch-clamp electrophysiology to determine the physical limits of cells expressing the force-gated ion channels Piezo1, Piezo2, TREK1, and TRAAK. We find that, depending on the ion channel expressed, cells can function either as proportional or nonlinear transducers of mechanical energy, detect mechanical energies as little as ~100 fJ, and with a resolution of up to ~1 fJ. These specific energetic values depend on cell size, channel density, and cytoskeletal architecture. We also make the surprising discovery that cells can transduce forces either nearly instantaneously (< 1ms), or with substantial time delay (~10 ms). Using a chimeric experimental approach and simulations we show how such delays can emerge from channel-intrinsic properties and the slow diffusion of tension in the membrane. Overall, our experiments reveal the capabilities and limits of cellular mechanosensing and provide insights into molecular mechanisms that different cell types may employ to specialize for their distinct physiological roles.

                Sleep disturbances are known to be aggravated with normal aging. Additionally, sleep disruptions have a potentially bidirectional causal relationship with dementia due to neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease. Predictive techniques that can automatically detect cognitive impairment from an individual's sleep data have broad clinical and biological significance. Here, we present a deep learning approach based on a transformer architecture to predict cognitive status from sleep electroencephalography (EEG) data. This work uses data from $N=1,502$ subjects from the Multi-Ethnic Study of 27 Atherosclerosis (MESA) cohort. Our transformer model achieves 70.22% accuracy at the binary classification task for distinguishing cognitively normal and impaired subjects based on their sleep EEG. Our method outperforms traditional feature handcrafting, which has an overall accuracy of 57.61% for the same task. We use a sparse regression model to understand and interpret the information captured by each learned feature from our transformer model. To our knowledge, this is the first effort to use deep learning to predict cognitive impairment from sleep metrics.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Proximal dendritic localization of NALCN channels underlies tonic and burst firing in nigral dopaminergic neurons</a></h4>

              
                In multipolar nigral dopamine (DA) neurons, the highly excitable proximal dendritic compartments (PDCs) and two Na+-permeable leak channels, TRPC3 and NALCN, play a key role in pacemaking. However, the causal link between them is unknown. Here we report that the proximal dendritic localization of NALCN underlies pacemaking and burst firing in DA neurons. Our morphological analysis of nigral DA neurons reveals that TRPC3 is ubiquitously expressed in the whole somatodendritic compartment, but NALCN is localized within the PDCs. Blocking either TRPC3 or NALCN channels abolished pacemaking. However, only blocking NALCN, not TRPC3, degraded burst discharges. Furthermore, local glutamate uncaging readily induced burst discharges within the PDCs, compared with other parts of the neuron, and NALCN channel inhibition dissipated burst generation, indicating the importance of NALCN to the high excitability of PDCs. Therefore, we conclude that PDCs serve as a common base for tonic and burst firing in nigral DA neurons.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Early myelination involves the dynamic and repetitive ensheathment of axons which resolves through a low and consistent stabilization rate</a></h4>

              
                Oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system exhibit significant variability in the number of myelin sheaths that are supported by each cell, ranging from just a few to about 50 (1-4). This begs the question, why does sheath number vary so widely across individual oligodendrocytes? Myelin production during development is dynamic and involves both sheath formation and loss (5-9). However, how these parameters are balanced to determine overall sheath number has not been thoroughly investigated. To explore this question, we combined extensive time-lapse and longitudinal imaging of oligodendrocytes in the developing zebrafish spinal cord to quantify sheath initiation and loss. Oligodendrocytes repetitively ensheathed the same axons multiple times before stable sheaths were formed. Interestingly, while there was a variable number of ensheathments produced by each oligodendrocyte, ~80-90% of these structures were always lost, which was an unexpectedly high, but consistent rate of sheath destabilization. The dynamics of this process indicated rapid membrane turn-over as ensheathments were formed and lost repetitively on each axon. To test whether membrane recycling impacts this sheath stabilization rate the endocytic pathway was disrupted by expressing a dominant-negative mutant form of Rab5. Oligodendrocytes over-expressing this mutant lost an even higher percentage of sheaths. Overall, oligodendrocytes initiate a highly variable number of axonal ensheathments, but these cells all exhibit a similar sheath stabilization rate, which is dependent on the endocytic recycling pathway.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A theory of orientation selectivity emerging from randomly sampling the visual field</a></h4>

              
                Selectivity for the orientation (OS) of moving gratings is also observed in the primary visual cortex (V1) of species which lack an orientation map, like mice and rats. However, the mechanism underlying the emergence of orientation selectivity in these cases is still mysterious. In the visual pathway, signals from the retina are conveyed to V1 via relay cells in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN). Here, we explore a computational model of orientation processing in dLGN and V1, where orientation selectivity emerges from random thalamocortical projections and investigate the underlying neuronal mechanism. First we demonstrate that the temporal mean (F0) of the thalamic input to cortical neurons does not depend on orientation, while the amplitude of the temporal modulations (F1) induced by the stimulus grating is indeed tuned to stimulus orientation. Second we show that the orientation tuning in the amplitudes of thalamic input can be transformed into orientation selectivity of V1 neurons by a random network, exploiting the nonlinear input-output transfer function of individual neurons. The untuned excitatory component is largely cancelled by the inhibitory component, such that the operating point is stabilized in the nonlinear regime of the transfer function. In our model, the orientation preference of V1 neurons is sensitive to the spatial frequency of the visual stimulus, very similar to what is found in neuronal recordings. Finally, we describe a non-linear firing rate model that accounts, among other things, for the F1-to-F0 transfer of oscillatory input to neurons.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">α-synucleinopathy associated calcium overload and autophagy failure is regulated by gain-of-function of Tousled-like kinase</a></h4>

              
                As a pathological hallmark in Parkinson's disease (PD), -synucleinopathy causes multiple cellular damages, including calcium overload, mitochondrial and autophagic dysfunction, and eventually dopamine neuron death. However, the hierarchy of these detrimental events is unclear. In Drosophila, we confirmed that overexpression of -synuclein could induce all these cytotoxic events. To determine the specific cytotoxic events induced by calcium overload, we established a calcium overload model in Drosophila and performed genetic screens. We found that calcium overload caused mitochondrial damage and autophagy failure and cell death, and these cytotoxic processes could be strongly rescued by loss of Tousled-like kinase (TLK). Interestingly, loss of TLK also rescued defects induced by -synuclein overexpression in Drosophila. This suggests that calcium overload acts as the crucial event upstream of mitochondrial and autophagy dysfunction. For TLK regulation of autophagy, our data indicated that a transcriptional factor REPTOR, which regulated the expression of several lysosomal genes, functioned downstream of TLK. In mammalian cells and mice, TLK2 (the homolog of Drosophila TLK) was phosphorylated under calcium overload. Upon phosphorylation, TLK2 increased its kinase activity. In addition, TLK2 could phosphorylate CREBRF (the human homolog of REPTOR) to cause its loss of transcription on the lysosomal genes. Moreover, TLK2 knockout mice rescued multi-aspect cytotoxicity induced by calcium overload and -synuclein overexpression. Our research demonstrates that TLK2 acts as a key regulator to mediate cell death and dysfunctions of mitochondria and autophagy downstream of calcium overload.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">NRN-EZ: an application to streamline biophysical modeling of synaptic integration using NEURON</a></h4>

              
                One of the fundamental goals in neuroscience is to determine how the brain processes information and ultimately controls the execution of complex behaviors. Over the past four decades, there has been a steady growth in our knowledge of the morphological and functional diversity of neurons, the building blocks of the brain. These cells clearly differ not only for their anatomy and ion channel distribution, but also for the type, strength, location and temporal pattern of activity of the many synaptic inputs they receive. Compartmental modeling programs like NEURON have become widely used in the neuroscience community to address a broad range of research questions, including how neurons integrate synaptic inputs and propagate information through complex neural networks. One of the main strengths of NEURON is its ability to incorporate user-defined information about the realistic morphology and biophysical properties of different cell types. Although the graphical user interface of the program can be used to run initial exploratory simulations, introducing a stochastic representation of synaptic weights, locations and activation times typically requires users to develop their own codes, a task that can be overwhelming for some beginner users. Here we describe NRN-EZ, an interactive application that allows users to specify complex patterns of synaptic input activity that can be integrated as part of NEURON simulations. Through its graphical user interface, NRN-EZ leverages the learning curve to run computational models in NEURON, for users that do not necessarily have a computer science background.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Local minimization of prediction errors drives learning of invariant object representations in a generative network model of visual perception</a></h4>

              
                The ventral visual processing hierarchy of the cortex needs to fulfill at least two key functions: Perceived objects must be mapped to high-level representations invariantly of the precise viewing conditions, and a generative model must be learned that allows, for instance, to fill in occluded information guided by visual experience. Here, we show how a multilayered predictive coding network can learn to recognize objects from the bottom up and to generate specific representations via a top-down pathway through a single learning rule: the local minimization of prediction errors. Trained on sequences of continuously transformed objects, neurons in the highest network area become tuned to object identity invariant of precise position, comparable to inferotemporal neurons in macaques. Drawing on this, the dynamic properties of invariant object representations reproduce experimentally observed hierarchies of timescales from low to high levels of the ventral processing stream. The predicted faster decorrelation of error-neuron activity compared to representation neurons is of relevance for the experimental search for neural correlates of prediction errors. Lastly, the generative capacity of the network is confirmed by reconstructing specific object images, robust to partial occlusion of the inputs. By learning invariance from temporal continuity within a generative model, the network goes beyond purely input-reconstructing models of predictive coding and generalizes the framework to moving inputs in a more biologically plausible way than self-supervised networks with non-local error-backpropagation.

                The Drift-Diffusion Model (DDM) is widely accepted for two-alternative forced-choice decision paradigms thanks to its simple formalism, straightforward interpretation, and close fit to behavioral and neurophysiological data. However, this formalism presents strong limitations to capture inter-trial dependency and dynamics at the single-trial level. We propose a novel model, the non-linear Drift-Diffusion Model (nl-DDM), that addresses these issues by allowing the existence of several trajectories to the decision boundary. We show that the fitting accuracy of our model is comparable to the accuracy of the DDM, with the non-linear model performing better than the drift-diffusion model for an equivalent complexity. To give better intuition on the meaning of nl-DDM parameters, we compare the DDM and the nl-DDM through correlation analysis. This paper provides evidence of the functioning of our model as an extension of the DDM. Our model paves the way toward more accurately analyzing single-trial dynamics for perceptual decisions and accounts for pre- and post-stimulus influences.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Engineered Serum Markers for Noninvasive Monitoring of Gene Expression in the Brain</a></h4>

              
                Noninvasive efforts to map brain gene expression have been hampered by low sensitivity and limited access to the brain. Here, we introduce a new platform that enables multiplexed, noninvasive, and site-specific monitoring of brain gene expression through a novel class of engineered reporters called Released Markers of Activity (RMAs). Instead of detecting gene expression in the less accessible brain, RMA reporters exit from a known brain region into the blood, where they can be easily measured with biochemical techniques. Expressing RMAs at a single brain site, typically covering ~1% of the brain volume, provides up to a 39,000-fold signal increase over the baseline in vivo. Further, expression of RMAs in as few as several hundred neurons was sufficient for their reliable detection. When placed under a promoter upregulated by neuronal activity, RMAs could be used to measure neuronal activity in specific brain regions with a simple blood draw. We found that chemogenetic activation of cells expressing Fos-responsive RMA increased serum levels of RMA over 4-fold compared to non-activated controls. By contrast, a control RMA expressed under a constitutive neuronal promoter did not show such upregulation, demonstrating multiplexed ratiometric measurement with RMAs and proving specificity of neuronal activity discrimination. Together, our study pioneers a new noninvasive paradigm for repeatable and multiplexed monitoring of gene expression in an intact brain with sensitivity that is currently unavailable through other noninvasive gene expression reporter systems.

                This report summarizes experiments on exploring non-linear functional connectivity. Using resting-state functional MRI data from the HCP1200 dataset, we define nodes as 17 functional networks and edges as the joint distribution between times series pairs. Linear dependence is removed before taking the joint distribution. We then employ a test for normality on the joint distribution to find non-normal distribution patterns. However, the result from an experimental run of 10 subjects shows that: only less than 1% of edges is non-normal distributed, and the location of such edges is not consistent across subjects. From this point of view, the non-linear part seems to be governed by random noise.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Dynamic cortical and tractography atlases of proactive and reactive alpha and high-gamma activities</a></h4>

              
                Alpha waves - posterior-dominant rhythms at 8-12 Hz reactive to eye opening and closure - are among the most fundamental EEG findings in clinical practice and research since Hans Berger first documented them in the early 20th century. Yet, the exact network dynamics of alpha waves in regard to eye movements remains unknown. High-gamma activity at 70-110 Hz is also reactive to eye movements and a summary measure of local cortical activation supporting sensorimotor or cognitive function. We aimed to build the first-ever brain atlases directly visualizing the network dynamics of eye movement-related alpha and high-gamma modulations, at cortical and white matter levels. We studied 28 patients (age: 5-20 years) who underwent intracranial EEG and electrooculography recordings. We measured alpha and high-gamma modulations at 2,170 electrode sites outside the seizure onset zone, interictal spike-generating areas, and MRI-visible structural lesions. Dynamic tractography animated white matter streamlines modulated significantly and simultaneously beyond chance, on a millisecond scale. Before eye closure onset, significant alpha augmentation occurred at the occipital and frontal cortices. After eye closure onset, alpha-based functional connectivity was strengthened, while high gamma-based connectivity was weakened extensively in both intrahemispheric and interhemispheric pathways involving the central visual areas. The inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus supported the strengthened alpha coaugmentation-based functional connectivity between occipital and frontal lobe regions, whereas the posterior corpus callosum supported the interhemispheric functional connectivity between the occipital lobes. After eye opening offset, significant high gamma augmentation and alpha attenuation occurred at occipital, fusiform, and inferior parietal cortices. High gamma coaugmentation-based functional connectivity was strengthened, whereas alpha-based connectivity was weakened in the posterior interhemispheric and intrahemispheric white matter pathways involving central and peripheral visual areas. Proactive and reactive alpha waves involve extensive, distinct white matter networks that include the frontal lobe cortices, along with low- and high-order visual areas. High-gamma co-attenuation coupled to alpha co-augmentation in shared brain circuitry after eye closure supports the notion of an idling role for alpha waves during eye closure. These dynamic tractography atlases may improve understanding of the significance of EEG alpha waves in assessing the functional integrity of brain networks in clinical practice; they also may help elucidate the effects of eye movements on task-related brain network measures observed in cognitive neuroscience research.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Imaging cortical engagement during motor imagery, mental arithmetic, and silent word generation using MEG beta rhythm</a></h4>

              
                Accurate mapping of cortical engagement during mental imagery or cognitive tasks remains a challenging brain-imaging problem with immediate relevance to the development of brain - computer interfaces (BCI). We analyzed data from fourteen individuals who performed cued motor imagery, mental arithmetic, or silent word generation tasks during MEG recordings. During the motor imagery task, participants imagined the movement of either both hands (HANDS) or both feet (FEET) after the appearance of a static visual cue. During the cognitive task, participants either mentally subtracted two numbers that were displayed on the screen (SUB) or generated words starting with a letter cue that was presented (WORD). The MEG recordings were denoised using a combination of spatiotemporal filtering, the elimination of noisy epochs, and ICA decomposition. Cortical source power in the beta-band (17 - 25 Hz) was estimated from the selected temporal windows using a frequency-resolved beamforming method applied to the sensor-level MEG signals. The task-related cortical engagement was inferred from beta power decrements within non-overlapping 400 ms temporal windows between 400 and 2800 ms after cue presentation relative to a baseline 400 ms temporal window before cue onset. We estimated the significance of these power changes within each parcel of the Desikan-Killiany atlas using a non-parametric permutation test at the group level. During the HANDS and FEET movement-imagery conditions, beta-power decreased in premotor and motor areas, consistent with a robust engagement of these cortical regions during motor imagery. During WORD and SUB tasks, beta-power decrements signaling cortical engagement were lateralized to left hemispheric brain areas that are expected to engage in language and arithmetic processing within the temporal (superior temporal gyrus), parietal (supramarginal gyrus), and (inferior) frontal regions. A leave-one-subject-out cross-validation using a support vector machine (SVM) applied to beta power decrements across brain parcels yielded accuracy rates of 74% and 68% respectively, for classifying motor-imagery (HANDS-vs-FEET) and cognitive (WORD-vs-SUB) tasks. From the motor-versus-nonmotor contrasts, accuracy rates of 85% and 80% respectively, were observed for HAND-vs-WORD and HAND-vs-SUB. A multivariate Gaussian process classifier (GPC) provided an accuracy rate of {approx}60% for a four-way (HANDS-FEET-WORD-SUB) classification problem. The regions identified by both SVM and GPC classification weight maps were largely consistent with the source modeling findings. Within-subject correlations of beta-decrements during the two task sessions provided insights into the level of engagement by individual subjects and showed moderately high correlations for most subjects. Our results show that it is possible to map the dynamics of cortical engagement during mental processes in the absence of dynamic sensory stimuli or overt behavioral outputs using task-related beta-power decrements. The ability to do so with the high spatiotemporal resolution afforded by MEG could potentially help better characterize the physiological basis of motor or cognitive impairments in neurological disorders and guide strategies for neurorehabilitation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Mixed selectivity coding of content-temporal detail by dorsomedial posterior parietal neurons</a></h4>

              
                The dorsomedial posterior parietal cortex is part of a higher-cognition network implicated in elaborate processes underpinning memory formation, recollection, episodes reconstruction, and temporal processing. Neural coding for complex episodic processing is however largely undocumented. Here we revealed a set of neural codes of 'neuroethogram' in the primate parietal cortex. Analyzing neural responses in macaque dmPPC to naturalistic videos, we discovered several groups of neurons that are sensitive to categories of ethogram-items and to low-level sensory features. The amount of information coded within these multiplex representations in turn increases our trained classifier decodability for different video-types. We further discovered that the processing of category and feature information by these neurons is sustained by accumulation of temporal information over a long timescale, corroborating its role at the apex of the cortical hierarchy of temporal receptive windows. Taken altogether, these neural findings explain how dorsomedial PPC weaves fabrics of ongoing experiences together in real-time and realize a multiplex representation of an organism's past. The high dimensionality of neural representations should motivate us to shift the focus of attention from pure selectivity neurons to mixed selectivity neurons, especially in increasingly complex naturalistic task designs.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Isolated correlates of somatosensory perception in the mouse posterior cortex</a></h4>

              
                To uncover the neural correlates of stimulus perception, experimenters commonly use tasks in which subjects are repeatedly presented with a weak stimulus and instructed to report, via movement, if they perceived the stimulus. The difference in neural activity between reported stimulus (hit) and unreported stimulus (miss) trials is then seen as potentially perception-related. However, recent studies found that activity related to the report spreads throughout the brain, calling into question to what extent such tasks conflate perception-related activity with report-related activity. To isolate perception-related activity, we developed a paradigm in which the same mice were trained on both a regular go/no-go whisker stimulus detection task and a reversed contingencies version, in which they reported the absence of a whisker stimulus. By comparing no report trials across the two tasks, we located perception-related activity within a posterior network of cortical regions contralateral to the stimulus. In addition, we found it was on average an order of magnitude lower report-related activity and began after the low-level stimulus response. In summary, our study revealed for the first time in mice the cortical areas associated with the perception of a sensory stimulus independently of a perceptual report.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">High-Resolution Spatiotemporal Analysis of Single Serotonergic Axons in an In Vitro System</a></h4>

              
                Vertebrate brains have a dual structure in that they are composed of (i) axons that can be well captured with graph-theoretical methods and (ii) axons that form a dense matrix in which neurons with precise connections operate. A core part of this matrix is formed by axons (fibers) that store and release 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT, serotonin), an ancient neurotransmitter that supports neuroplasticity and has profound implications for mental health. The self-organization of the serotonergic matrix is not well understood, despite recent advances in experimental and theoretical approaches. In particular, individual serotonergic axons produce highly stochastic trajectories, fundamental to the construction of regional fiber densities, but further advances in predictive computer simulations require more accurate experimental information. This study examined single serotonergic axons in culture systems (co-cultures and monolayers), by using a complementary set of high-resolution methods: confocal microscopy, holotomography (refractive index-based live imaging), and super-resolution (STED) microscopy. It shows that serotonergic axon walks in neural tissue may strongly reflect the stochastic geometry of this tissue and it also provides new insights into the morphology and branching properties of serotonergic axons. The proposed experimental platform can support next-generation analyses of the serotonergic matrix, including seamless integration with supercomputing approaches.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Choice-Induced Preference Change under a Sequential Sampling Model Framework</a></h4>

              
                Sequential sampling models of choice, such as the drift-diffusion model (DDM), are frequently fit to empirical data to account for a variety of effects related to choice accuracy/consistency and response time (RT). Sometimes, these models include extensions that can also account for choice confidence. However, no model in this class is able to account for the phenomenon of choice-induced preference change. Studies have reported choice-induced preference change for many decades, and the principle findings are robust: decision-makers tend to rate options higher after they choose them and lower after they reject them. This spreading of alternatives (SoA) in terms of their rated values is fundamentally incompatible with traditional sequential sampling models, which consider the rated values of the options to be stationary throughout choice deliberation. Here, we propose a simple modification of the basic DDM that allows the drift rate to vary across deliberation time depending on which attributes are attended to at which points in time. Critically, the model assumes that initial ratings are based only on the more salient attributes of the individual options, and that more attributes will be considered when decision-makers must choose between options with different salient attributes. We show that this model can account for SoA (in addition to choice consistency and RT), as well as all previously reported relationships between SoA and choice difficulty, attribute disparity, and RT.

                During navigation, the hippocampus represents physical places like coordinates on a map; similar location-like signals have been seen in sensory and concept spaces. It is unclear just how general this hippocampal place code is, however: does it map places in wholly non-perceivable spaces, without locations being instructed or reinforced and during navigation-like behavior? To search for such a signal, we imaged participants' brains while they played a naturalistic, narrative-based social interaction game, and modeled their relationships as a kind of navigation through social space. Two independent samples showed hippocampal place-like signals in both region-based and whole-brain representational similarity analyses, as well as decoding and average pattern similarity analyses; the effects were not explained by other measures of the behavior or task information. We also replicated and extended previous findings of hippocampal tracking of the egocentric angle in social space. These results are the first demonstration of complete domain generality in hippocampal place representation.

                Brain folding patterns vary within the human species, but some folding properties are common across individuals, including the Sylvian fissure's inter-hemispheric asymmetry. Contrarily to the other brain folds (sulci), the Sylvian fissure develops through the process of opercularization, with the frontal, parietal and temporal lobes growing over the insular lobe. Its asymmetry may be related to the leftward functional lateralization for language processing, but the time-course of these asymmetries' development is still poorly understood. In this study, we investigated refined shape features of the Sylvian fissure and their longitudinal development in 71 infants born extremely preterm (mean gestational age at birth: 26.5 weeks) and imaged once before and once at term-equivalent age (TEA). We additionally assessed asymmetrical sulcal patterns at TEA in the perisylvian and inferior frontal regions, neighbor to the Sylvian fissure. While reproducing renown strong asymmetries in the Sylvian fissure, we captured an early encoding of its main asymmetrical shape features, and we observed global asymmetrical shape features representative of a more pronounced opercularization in the left-hemisphere, contrasting with the previously reported right-hemisphere advance in sulcation around birth. This added novel insights about the processes governing early-life brain folding mechanisms, potentially linked to the development of language-related capacities.

                Background: Clearance of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is important for the removal of toxins from the brain, with implication for neurodegenerative diseases. Imaging evaluation of CSF outflow in humans has been limited, relying on injections of contrast agents. Objective of this study was to introduce a novel spin-labeling magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique to detect and quantify the movement of endogenously tagged CSF without administration of tracer or contrast media, and use the technique to evaluate CSF outflow in normal human subjects with varying ages. Methods: This study was performed on a clinical 3-Tesla MRI scanner in healthy subjects (10 males and 6 females; mean age, 47.6 {+/-} 18.9 years; range, 19-71 years) with informed consent. Our non-contrast spin-labeling MRI technique applies a tag pulse on the brain hemisphere, including subarachnoid space, dura mater, brain parenchyma, and images the outflow of the tagged CSF into the superior sagittal sinus. We obtained 3-dimensional images in real time, which was analyzed to determine tagged-signal changes in different regions of the brain involved in CSF outflow or clearance. Additionally, the signal changes over time were fit to a signal curve to determine quantitative flow metrics such as relative CSF flow and volume. These were correlated against subject age to determine aging effects. Results: We observed the signal of the tagged CSF moving from the subarachnoid space to the dura mater and parasagittal dura, and finally draining into the superior sagittal sinus. In addition, there was strong evidence of a direct pathway by which tagged CSF flows directly from the subarachnoid space to the superior sagittal sinus, via the lateral wall of superior sagittal sinus. Furthermore, quantitative CSF outflow metrics were shown to decrease significantly with age. Conclusions: We demonstrated a novel non-invasive MRI technique to evaluate CSF clearance in humans. In this study, we identified possible two CSF clearance pathways, and determined normative values and decline of CSF flow metrics in normal ages. Our work provides a new opportunity to better understand the relationships of these CSF clearance pathways in ages, which may be a significant factor in the age-related prevalence of neurodegenerative diseases. Funding: This study was supported by the National Institutes of Health grants: RF1AG076692 (MM) and R01HL154092 (MM); and made possible by a grant from Canon Medical Systems.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Engineered Adhesion Molecules Drive Synapse Organization</a></h4>

              
                In multicellular organisms, cell-adhesion molecules connect cells into tissues and mediate intercellular signaling between these cells. In vertebrate brains, synaptic cell-adhesion molecules (SAMs) guide the formation, specification, and plasticity of synapses. Some SAMs, when overexpressed in cultured neurons or in heterologous cells co-cultured with neurons, drive formation of synaptic specializations onto the overexpressing cells. However, genetic deletion of the same SAMs from neurons often has no effect on synapse numbers, but frequently severely impairs synaptic transmission, suggesting that most SAMs control the function and plasticity of synapses (i.e., organize synapses) instead of driving their initial establishment (i.e., make synapses). Since few SAMs were identified that mediate initial synapse formation, it is difficult to develop methods that enable experimental control of synaptic connections by targeted expression of these SAMs. To overcome this difficulty, we engineered novel SAMs from bacterial proteins with no eukaryotic homologues that drive synapse formation. We named these engineered adhesion proteins Barnoligin and Starexin because they were assembled from parts of Barnase and Neuroligin-1 or of Barstar and Neurexins, respectively. Barnoligin and Starexin robustly induce the formation of synaptic specializations in a specific and directional manner in cultured neurons. Synapse formation by Barnoligin and Starexin requires both their extracellular Barnase- and Bastar-derived interaction domains and their Neuroligin- and Neurexin-derived intracellular signaling domains. Our findings support a model of synapse formation whereby trans-synaptic interactions by SAMs drive synapse organization via adhesive interactions that activate signaling cascades.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Thalamus sends information about arousal but not valence to the amygdala</a></h4>

              
                Rationale: The basolateral amygdala (BLA) and medial geniculate nucleus of the thalamus (MGN) have both been shown to be necessary for the formation of associative learning. While the role that the BLA plays in this process has long been emphasized, the MGN has been less well-studied and surrounded by debate regarding whether the relay of sensory information is active or passive. Objectives: We seek to understand the role the MGN has within the thalamoamgydala circuit in the formation of associative learning. Methods: Here, we use optogenetics to dissect the MGN-BLA circuit and explore the specific subpopulations for evidence of learning and synthesis of information that could impact downstream BLA encoding. We employ various machine learning techniques to investigate function within neural subpopulations. We introduce a novel method to investigate tonic changes across trial-by-trial structure, which offers an alternative approach to traditional trial-averaging techniques. Results: We find that the MGN appears to encode arousal but not valence, unlike the BLA which encodes for both. We find that the MGN and the BLA appear to react differently to expected and unexpected outcomes; the BLA biased responses toward reward prediction error and the MGN focused on anticipated punishment. We uncover evidence of tonic changes by visualizing changes across trials during inter-trial intervals (baseline epochs) for a subset of cells. Conclusion: We conclude that the MGN-BLA projector population acts as both filter and transferer of information by relaying information about the salience of cues to the amygdala, but these signals are not valence-specified.

	<p>Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping (QSM) can measure iron concentration increase in the primary motor cortex (M1) of patients with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). However, such alteration is confined to only specific regions interested by upper motor neuron pathology; therefore, mean QSM values in the entire M1 have limited diagnostic accuracy in discriminating between ALS patients and control subjects. This study investigates the diagnostic accuracy of a broader set of M1 QSM distribution indices in classifying ALS patients and controls. Mean, standard deviation, skewness and kurtosis of M1 QSM values were used either individually or as combined predictors in support vector machines. The classification performance was compared to that obtained by the radiological assessment of T2* signal hypo-intensity of M1 in susceptibility-weighted MRI. The least informative index for the classification of ALS patients and controls was the subject&amp;amp;rsquo;s mean QSM value in M1. The highest diagnostic performance was obtained when all the distribution indices of positive QSM values in M1 were considered, which yielded a diagnostic accuracy of 0.90, with sensitivity = 0.89 and specificity = 1. The radiological assessment of M1 yielded a diagnostic accuracy of 0.79, with sensitivity = 0.76 and specificity = 0.90. The joint evaluation of QSM distribution indices could support the clinical examination in ALS diagnosis and patient monitoring.</p>

	<p>Migraine is a common neurological disease with a still-unclear etiology and pathogenesis. Patent foramen ovale (PFO) is a kind of congenital heart disease that leads to a right-to-left shunt (RLS). Although previous studies have shown that PFO has an effect on migraine, a clear conclusion about the link between PFO and migraine is lacking. We first summarized the PFO potential mechanisms associated with migraine, including microembolus-triggered cortical spreading depression (CSD), the vasoactive substance hypothesis, impaired cerebral autoregulation (CA), and a common genetic basis. Further, we analyzed the changes in brain structure and function in migraine patients and migraine patients with PFO. We found that in migraine patients with PFO, the presence of PFO may affect the structure of the cerebral cortex and the integrity of white matter, which is mainly locked in subcortical, deep white matter, and posterior circulation, and may lead to changes in brain function, such as cerebellum and colliculus, which are involved in the processing and transmission of pain. In summary, this paper provides neuroimaging evidence and new insights into the correlation between PFO and migraine, which will help to clarify the etiology and pathogenesis of migraine, and aid in the diagnosis and treatment of migraine in the future.</p>

	<p>Major depressive disorder is a leading cause of disability worldwide and a major contributor to the overall global burden of disease. While there are several options for antidepressant treatment, only about 40&amp;amp;ndash;60% of patients respond to initial monotherapy, while 30&amp;amp;ndash;40% of patients may even show resistance to treatment. This article offers a narrative review of those studies evaluating the predictive properties of various blood-based baseline biomarkers regarding treatment responses to the pharmacological, stimulation, or behavioral treatment of patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Our results show that overall, there is only a very limited number of studies assessing baseline peripheral biomarkers regarding treatment response in TRD. Although there is some evidence for the predictive significance of particular biomarkers (e.g., IL-6, CRP, BDNF), the majority of the results are either single-study reports or studies with conflicting results. This may contribute to the wide variety of treatment protocols and different TRD definition criteria, the small number of patients included, and the existence of different biological phenotypes of the disorder used within the various studies. Taken together, there does not yet appear to be any specific baseline peripheral biomarker with sufficient discriminative predictive validity that can be used in the routine clinical practice of TRD. The discovery of new biomarkers and the better clinical characterization of known biomarkers could support the better classification and staging of TRD, the development of personalized treatment algorithms with higher rates of remission and fewer side effects, and the development of new precision drugs for specific subgroups of patients.</p>

	<p>According to previous studies, mental status in 1-year COVID-19 survivors might range from 6&amp;amp;ndash;43%. Longer-term psychological consequences in recovered COVID-19 subjects are unknown, so we analyzed longer-term quality of life and mental status in recovered COVID-19 subjects at 2 years after infection. Among 144 recovered COVID-19 subjects in the Taizhou region, 73 and 45 completed face-to-face follow-ups at the first year and second year after infection, respectively, with a 61.7% follow-up rate. The questionnaire, which was administered at both follow-ups, included questions about quality of life, psychological health, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The Mann-Whitney U test was used to the differences of each scale between the first and second year. Among the 45 people who completed both follow-up visits, the incidence of psychological problems was 4.4% (2/45) in the first year, and no new psychological abnormalities were observed in the second year. Quality of life improved, while the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) and Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) scores did not improve over time. The incidence of mental disorders was lower than those in previous studies. Multidisciplinary management for COVID-19 in this study hospital may have reduced the frequency to a certain extent. However, among those with mental health problems, such problems may exist for a long time, and long-term attention should be given to the psychological status of recovered COVID-19 subjects.</p>

	<p>The unfavorable outcome of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) with large vessel occlusion (LVO) is related to clinical factors at multiple time points. However, predictive models used for dynamically predicting unfavorable outcomes using clinically relevant preoperative and postoperative time point variables have not been developed. Our goal was to develop a machine learning (ML) model for the dynamic prediction of unfavorable outcomes. We retrospectively reviewed patients with AIS who underwent a consecutive mechanical thrombectomy (MT) from three centers in China between January 2014 and December 2018. Based on the eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) algorithm, we used clinical characteristics on admission (&amp;amp;ldquo;Admission&amp;amp;rdquo; Model) and additional variables regarding intraoperative management and the postoperative National Institute of Health stroke scale (NIHSS) score (&amp;amp;ldquo;24-Hour&amp;amp;rdquo; Model, &amp;amp;ldquo;3-Day&amp;amp;rdquo; Model and &amp;amp;ldquo;Discharge&amp;amp;rdquo; Model). The outcome was an unfavorable outcome at the three-month mark (modified Rankin scale, mRS 3&amp;amp;ndash;6: unfavorable). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and Brier scores were the main evaluating indexes. The unfavorable outcome at the three-month mark was observed in 156 (62.0%) of 238 patients. These four models had a high accuracy in the range of 75.0% to 87.5% and had a good discrimination with AUC in the range of 0.824 to 0.945 on the testing set. The Brier scores of the four models ranged from 0.122 to 0.083 and showed a good predictive ability on the testing set. This is the first dynamic, preoperative and postoperative predictive model constructed for AIS patients who underwent MT, which is more accurate than the previous prediction model. The preoperative model could be used to predict the clinical outcome before MT and support the decision to perform MT, and the postoperative models would further improve the predictive accuracy of the clinical outcome after MT and timely adjust therapeutic strategies.</p>

	<p>Stereoscopic displays can induce visual discomfort despite their wide application. Electroencephalography (EEG) technology has been applied to assess 3D visual discomfort, because it can capture brain activities with high temporal resolution. Previous studies explored the frequency and temporal features relevant to visual discomfort in EEG data. Recently, it was demonstrated that functional connectivity between brain regions fluctuates with time. However, the relationship between 3D visual discomfort and dynamic functional connectivity (DFC) remains unknown. Although HMM showed advantages over the sliding window method in capturing the temporal fluctuations of DFC at a single time point in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data, it is unclear whether HMM works well in revealing the time-varying functional connectivity of EEG data. In this study, the hidden Markov model (HMM) was introduced to DFC analysis of EEG data for the first time and was used to investigate the DFC features that can be used to assess 3D visual discomfort. The results indicated that state 2, with strong connections between electrodes, occurred more frequently in the early period, whereas state 4, with overall weak connections between electrodes, occurred more frequently in the late period for both visual comfort and discomfort stimuli. Moreover, the 3D visual discomfort stimuli caused subjects to stay in state 4 more frequently, especially in the later period, in contrast to the 3D visual comfort stimuli. The results suggest that the increasing occurrence of state 4 was possibly related to visual discomfort and that the occurrence frequency of state 4 may be used to assess visual discomfort.</p>

                Physiological and pathological pain exhibits striking diurnal variation but the underlying mechanisms are largely unknown. We now describe an independent molecular clock in peripheral sensory neurons and satellite glial cells of sensory ganglia. We show that it is the sensory neuron transcription-translation feedback loops (TTFLs) that are responsible for diurnal pain behaviours. This clock regulates diurnal neurophysiological responses to a range of ligands, as well as synaptic activities of primary nociceptors. Furthermore we find that loss of Cry1 and Cry2, the repressive arm of the core TTFLs intensifies pain responses, associated with increased voltage gated sodium channel currents. Conversely stabilisation of CRY1 and CRY2 using the small molecule KL001 reduces pain sensitivity. Our results highlight novel opportunities to address chronic pain by directly harnessing circadian mechanisms.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Translational regulation by RACK1 in astrocytes represses KIR4.1 expression and regulates neuronal activity</a></h4>

              
                The regulation of translation in astrocytes, the main glial cells in the brain, remains poorly characterized. We developed a high-throughput proteomic screen for polysome-associated proteins in astrocytes and focused on the ribosomal protein receptor of activated protein C kinase 1 (RACK1), a critical factor in translational regulation. In astrocyte somata and perisynaptic astrocytic processes (PAPs), RACK1 preferentially bound to a number of mRNAs, including Kcnj10, encoding the inward rectifying potassium (K+) channel KIR4.1, a critical astrocytic regulator of neurotransmission. By developing an astrocyte-specific, conditional RACK1 knock-out mouse model, we showed that RACK1 repressed the production of KIR4.1 in hippocampal astrocytes and PAPs. Reporter-based assays revealed that RACK1 controlled Kcnj10 translation through the transcript s 5 untranslated region. Upregulation of KIR4.1 in the absence of RACK1 modified the astrocyte territory volume and neuronal activity attenuatin burst frequency and duration in the hippocampus. Hence, astrocytic RACK1 represses KIR4.1 translation and influences neuronal activity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Atypical hypnotic compound ML297 restores sleep architecture following emotionally-valenced learning, to promote memory consolidation and hippocampal network activation during recall</a></h4>

              
                Sleep plays a critical role in consolidating many forms of hippocampus-dependent memory. While various classes of hypnotic drugs have been developed in recent years, it remains unknown whether, or how, some of them affect sleep-dependent memory consolidation mechanisms. We find that ML297, a recently-developed candidate hypnotic agent targeting a new mechanism (activating GIRK1-subunit containing G-protein coupled inwardly rectifying potassium [GIRK] channels), alters sleep architecture in mice over the first 6 h following a single-trial learning event. Following contextual fear conditioning (CFC), ML297 reversed post-CFC reductions in NREM sleep spindle power and REM sleep amounts and architecture, renormalizing sleep features to what was observed at baseline, prior to CFC. Renormalization of post-CFC REM sleep latency, REM sleep amounts, and NREM spindle power were all associated with improved contextual fear memory (CFM) consolidation. We find that improvements in CFM consolidation due to ML297 are sleep-dependent, and are associated with increased numbers of highly activated dentate gyrus (DG), CA1, and CA3 neurons during CFM recall. Together our findings suggest that GIRK1 channel activation restores normal sleep architecture - including REM sleep, which is normally suppressed following CFC - and increases the number of hippocampal neurons incorporated into the CFM engram during memory consolidation.

	<p>Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a chronic and debilitating mental disorder. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a promising approach for refractory OCD patients. Research aiming at treatment outcome prediction is vital to provide optimized treatments for different patients. The primary purpose of this systematic review was to collect and synthesize studies on outcome prediction of OCD patients with DBS implantations in recent years. This systematic review (PROSPERO registration number: CRD42022335585) followed the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis) guidelines. The search was conducted using three different databases with the following search terms related to OCD and DBS. We identified a total of 3814 articles, and 17 studies were included in our review. A specific tract confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was predictable for DBS outcome regardless of implant targets, but inconsistencies still exist. Current studies showed various ways of successful treatment prediction. However, considering the heterogeneous results, we hope that future studies will use larger cohorts and more precise approaches for predictors and establish more personalized ways of DBS surgeries.</p>

	<p>Alcohol use confers risk for suicidal thoughts and behaviors (ideation, attempt) in early adolescents. The Research Domain Criteria provides a framework for examination of multidimensional and modifiable risk factors. We examined distinct latent profiles based on patterns of positive valence (reward responsivity) and cognitive systems (neurocognition) from the ABCD Study (age 9&amp;amp;ndash;10, N = 10,414) at baseline enrollment. Longitudinal associations were determined between baseline positive valence and cognitive profiles and group classification (alcohol use, suicidal thoughts and behaviors, or their co-occurrence) two-years after initial assessment (ages 11&amp;amp;ndash;12). Three unique profiles of positive valence, cognition, alcohol use, and suicidal thoughts and behaviors were identified. Two baseline profiles predicted alcohol use and suicidal thoughts and behaviors, two-years after initial assessment. Low positive valence with high cognition (but low impulsivity) predicted alcohol use (OR = 1.414, p&amp;amp;lt; 0.001), while high positive valence with low cognition (but high impulsivity) predicted suicidal thoughts and behaviors (OR = 1.25, p = 0.038), compared to average positive valence and cognition. Unique profiles of positive valence and cognitive systems among 9&amp;amp;ndash;12-year-olds may be predictive of alcohol use and suicidal thoughts and behaviors over a two-year period. Findings underscore the potential for trajectory research on positive valence and cognitive profiles to enhance prevention for early-adolescents.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Longitudinal Retinal Changes in MOGAD</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Patients with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody (MOG-IgG)-associated disease (MOGAD) suffer from severe optic neuritis (ON) leading to retinal neuro-axonal loss, which can be quantified by optical coherence tomography (OCT). We assessed whether ON-independent retinal atrophy can be detected in MOGAD.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Eighty patients with MOGAD and 139 healthy controls (HCs) were included. OCT data was acquired with (1) Spectralis spectral domain OCT (MOGAD: <i>N</i> = 66 and HCs: <i>N</i> = 103) and (2) Cirrus high-definition OCT (MOGAD: <i>N</i> = 14 and HCs: <i>N</i> = 36). Macular combined ganglion cell and inner plexiform layer (GCIPL) and peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (pRNFL) were quantified.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>At baseline, GCIPL and pRNFL were lower in MOGAD eyes with a history of ON (MOGAD-ON) compared with MOGAD eyes without a history of ON (MOGAD-NON) and HCs (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). MOGAD-NON eyes had lower GCIPL volume compared to HCs (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) in the Spectralis, but not in the Cirrus cohort. Longitudinally (follow-up up to 3 years), MOGAD-ON with ON within the last 6–12 months before baseline exhibited greater pRNFL thinning than MOGAD-ON with an ON greater than 12 months ago (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). The overall MOGAD cohort did not exhibit faster GCIPL thinning compared with the HC cohort.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our study suggests the absence of attack-independent retinal damage in patients with MOGAD. Yet, ongoing neuroaxonal damage or edema resolution seems to occur for up to 12 months after ON, which is longer than what has been reported with other ON forms. These findings support that the pathomechanisms underlying optic nerve involvement and the evolution of OCT retinal changes after ON is distinct in patients with MOGAD.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Benefit of Intravenous Alteplase before Thrombectomy Depends on ASPECTS</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>Baseline variables could be used to guide the administration of additional intravenous alteplase (IVT) before mechanical thrombectomy (MT). The aim of this study was to determine how baseline imaging and demographic parameters modify the effect of IVT on clinical outcomes in patients with ischemic stroke due to large vessel occlusion.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Multicenter retrospective cohort study of ischemic stroke patients triaged by multimodal-CT undergoing MT treatment after direct admission to an MT-eligible center. Inverse-probability weighting analysis (IPW) was used to assess the treatment effect of IVT adjusted for baseline variables. Multivariable logistic regression analysis with IPW-weighting and interaction terms for IVT was performed to predict functional independence (mRS 0-2 at 90-days).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>720 patients were included, of which 366 (51%) received IVT. In IPW, the treatment effect of IVT on outcome (mRS 0-2) distinctively varied according to the ASPECTS subgroup (ASPECTS 9-10: +15%, ASPECTS 6-8: +7%, ASPECTS &lt;6: −11%). In multivariable logistic regression analysis, IVT was independently associated with functional independence (aOR: 1.57, 95% CI: 1.16-2.14, <i>p</i> = 0.003) and the interaction term was significant for ASPECTS and IVT revealing that IVT was only significantly associated with better outcomes in patients with higher ASPECTS. No other significant baseline variable interaction terms were identified.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>ASPECTS was the only baseline variable that showed a significant interaction with IVT for outcome prediction. Use of IVT prior to MT in patients with an ASPECTS of &lt;6 was not associated with a treatment benefit and should be considered carefully. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/inpress.rss">Neural basis of prosocial behavior</a></h4>

              
                The ability to behave in ways that benefit other individuals’ well-being is among the most celebrated human characteristics crucial for social cohesiveness. Across mammalian species, animals display various forms of prosocial behaviors – comforting, helping, and resource sharing – to support others’ emotions, goals, and/or material needs. In this review, we provide a cross-species view of the behavioral manifestations, proximate and ultimate drives, and neural mechanisms of prosocial behaviors. We summarize key findings from recent studies in humans and rodents that have shed light on the neural mechanisms underlying different processes essential for prosocial interactions, from perception and empathic sharing of others’ states to prosocial decisions and actions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Resting State Neural Networks at Complex Visual Hallucinations in Charles Bonnet Syndrome</a></h4>

              
                BackgroundCharles Bonnet syndrome (CBS) is a prototype phenomenon for investigating complex visual hallucination. Our research focuses on resting state neural networks features of CBS patients with a comparison of patients with equally matched visual loss and healthy subjects in order to investigate the mechanism behind complex visual hallucinations.

Material and MethodsFour CBS patients CBS(+), three patients with visual loss but no visual hallucinations CBS(-) and 15 healthy individuals (HS) undergo resting state fMRI recordings and their resting state data is analyzed for Default Mode Network (DMN) changes through dual regression analysis. Cognitive functions of the participants were also evaluated through Mini Mental State Examination and University of Miami - Parkinsons Disease Hallucination Questionnaire (um-PDHQ)

ResultsAlthough we found no difference in Default Mode Networks between CBS(-) and CBS(+), and between the CBS(-) and HC groups, we detected decreased connectivity in CBS(+) compared to the HC group especially in visual heteromodal association centers (bilateral lateral occipital gyrus, bilateral lingual gyrus, occipital pole, right medial temporal cortex, right temporo-occipital cortex) when left angular gyrus was selected as ROI.

Similarly, we detected decreased connectivity in CBS(+) compared to HC in right medial frontal gyrus, right posterior cingulate gyrus, left inferior temporal gyrus, right supramarginal gyrus, and right angular gyrus when selected right superior frontal gyrus as ROI. In contrast, increased connectivity was detected in CBS +compared to HC, in bilateral occipital poles, bilateral occipital fusiform gyrus, bilateral intracalcarine cortex, right lingual gyrus and precuneus regions when left medial temporal gyrus was selected as ROI.

ConclusionOur findings suggest a combined mechanism in CBS related to increased internal created images caused by decreased visual external input causing visual hallucinations as well as impaired frontotemporal resource tracking system that together impair cognitive processing.

                An animals nervous system recognizes visual features regardless of where the visual feature is located. However, the underlying mechanisms that enable location invariant feature detection are not fully understood, particularly when visual feature information contributed by each eye needs to be resolved. Here we investigate directional invariance of looming responses in descending neurons (DN) of Drosophila melanogaster. We find multiple looming responsive DN integrate looming information across both eyes, even though their dendrites are unilateral. One DN in particular, the giant fibers (GF), generates invariant looming responses across approach directions. We confirm visual information propagates to the GF from the contralateral eye through an as of yet unidentified pathway and demonstrate the absence of this pathway alters GF responses to looming stimuli from the ipsilateral eye. Our data highlight a role for bilateral visual integration in generating consistent escape responses that are robust across a wide range of stimulus locations and parameters.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Differential disruptions in population coding along the dorsal-ventral axis of CA1 in the APP/PS1 mouse model of Aβ pathology</a></h4>

              
                Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a range of behavioral alterations including memory loss as well as cognitive and psychiatric symptoms. While there is growing evidence that cellular and molecular pathologies, such as the accumulation of amyloid beta plaques may contribute to AD, it remains unclear how this histopathology can give rise to such disparate behavioral deficits. One hypothesis for these diverse behavioral presentations is that amyloid beta plaques; accumulation has differential effects on neuronal circuits across brain regions, depending on the diverse neurophysiological properties and connections within and between the neurons in these different areas. To test this, we recorded from large neuronal populations in the dorsal and ventral CA1 regions of the hippocampus, areas that are known to be structurally and functionally diverse, in both APP/PS1 animals, a mouse model of Amyloid pathology, and age-matched C57BL/6 controls. Although we found similar levels of Amyloid pathology in the two subregions, populations of neurons in dorsal and ventral CA1 in APP/PS1 mice showed distinct signatures of disrupted neuronal activity as animals navigated a virtual reality environment. In dorsal CA1, pairwise correlations and entropy, a measure of the diversity of activity patterns, were decreased in the APP/PS1 mice. However, in ventral CA1, the opposite findings were observed; pair-wise correlations and entropy was increased in APP/PS1 mice relative to C57BL/6 controls. When we attempted to connect the microscopic features of population activity (the correlations) with the macroscopic features of the population code (the entropy) using a pairwise Ising model, we found that the models' performance decreased in predicting dorsal CA1 activity but increased in predicting vCA1 activity in APP/PS1 mice, as compared to the C57BL/6 animals. Taken together, these findings suggest that amyloid beta pathology exerts distinct effects across different hippocampal regions. Our results suggest that the diverse behavioral deficits associated with AD and the cellular pathology that arises from amyloid accumulation may be mechanistically linked by studying the dynamics of neural activity within these diverse hippocampal circuits.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Switches to rhythmic brain activity lead to a plasticity-induced reset in synaptic weights</a></h4>

              
                Brain function relies on the ability to quickly process incoming information while being capable of forming memories of past relevant events through the formation of novel synaptic connections. Synaptic connections are functionally strengthened or weakened to form new memories through synaptic plasticity rules that strongly rely on neuronal rhythmic activities. Brain information processing, on the other hand, is shaped by fluctuations in these neuronal rhythmic activities, each defining distinctive brain states, which poses the question of how such fluctuations in brain states affect the outcome of memory formation. This question is particularly relevant in the context of sleep-dependent memory consolidation, wakefulness to sleep transitions being characterized by large modifications in global neuronal activity. By combining computational models of neuronal activity switches and plasticity rules, we show that switches to rhythmic brain activity reminiscent of sleep lead to a reset in synaptic weights towards a basal value. This reset is shown to occur both in phenomenological and biophysical models of synaptic plasticity, and to be robust to neuronal and synaptic variability and network heterogeneity. Analytical analyses further show that the mechanisms of the synaptic reset are rooted in the endogenous nature of the sleep-like rhythmic activity. This sleep-dependent reset in synaptic weights permits regularizing synaptic connections during sleep, which could be a key component of sleep homeostasis and has the potential to play a central role in sleep-dependent memory consolidation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Crossmodal reorganization in deaf auditory cortices compensates for the impaired body-centered visuomotor transformation after early deafness</a></h4>

              
                Early deafness leads to the reorganization of large-scale brain networks, involving and extending beyond the auditory system. Body-centered visuomotor transformation is impaired after early auditory deprivation, associated with a hyper-crosstalk between the task-critical frontoparietal network (FPN) and the default-mode network (DMN). It remains to be elucidated, how the reorganized functional connectivity between the auditory system, the FPN, and the DMN contributes to the impaired visuomotor transformation after early deafness. In this fMRI study, we asked early deaf participants and hearing controls to judge the spatial location of a visual target, either about the middle-sagittal line of their own body (the egocentric task) or another background object (the allocentric task). The bilateral superior temporal gyrus (STG) in the deaf group exhibited cross-modal reorganization, with generally enhanced neural activity during the visual tasks, compared to hearing controls. Moreover, the STG showed significantly increased functional connectivity with both the FPN and the DMN in the deaf group compared to hearing controls, specifically during the egocentric task. The increased STG-FPN and STG-DMN coupling, however, showed antagonistic effects on the egocentric performance of the deaf participants. The increased STG-FPN connectivity was associated with improved (i.e., a beneficial role) while the increased STG-DMN with deteriorated (i.e., a detrimental role) egocentric performance in the deaf participants. No such effect was observed in hearing controls. Therefore, the auditory cortex is reorganized to functionally resemble the FPN in the deaf brain, representing compensatory neuroplasticity to mitigate the impaired visuomotor transformation after early deafness.

                Perivascular spaces (PVS) are important highways for fluid and solute transport in the brain enabling efficient waste clearance during sleep. Using two-photon imaging of naturally sleeping mice we demonstrate sleep cycle-dependent PVS dynamics - slow, large-amplitude oscillations in NREM, a reduction in REM and an enlargement upon awakening at the end of a sleep cycle. By biomechanical modeling we demonstrate that these sleep cycle-dependent PVS dynamics drive fluid flow and solute transport.

                Early-life stress (ELS) leads to increased vulnerability to psychiatric disorders including depression later in life. Neuroinflammatory processes have been implicated in ELS-induced negative health outcomes, but how ELS impacts microglia, the main tissue-resident macrophages of the central nervous system, is unknown. Here, we determined the effects of ELS induced by limited bedding and nesting material during the first week of life (postnatal days [P]2 - 9) on microglial i) morphology; ii) hippocampal gene expression; and iii) synaptosome phagocytic capacity in male pups (P9) and adult (P200) mice. The hippocampus of ELS-exposed adult mice displayed altered proportions of morphological subtypes of microglia, as well as microglial transcriptomic changes related to the tumor necrosis factor response and protein ubiquitination. ELS exposure leads to distinct gene expression profiles during microglial development from P9 to P200 and in response to an LPS challenge at P200. Functionally, synaptosomes from ELS-exposed mice were phagocytosed less by age-matched microglia. At P200, but not P9, ELS microglia showed reduced synaptosome phagocytic capacity when compared to CTRL microglia. Lastly, we confirmed the ELS-induced increased expression of the phagocytosis-related gene GAS6 that we observed in mice, in the dentate gyrus of individuals with a history of child abuse using in situ hybridization. These findings reveal persistent effects of ELS on microglial function and suggest that altered microglial phagocytic capacity is a key contributor to ELS-induced phenotypes.

                The large heterogeneity in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a major drawback for the development of therapies. Here, we apply consensus-subtyping strategies based on functional connectivity patterns to a population of N=657 quality-assured autistic subjects. We found two major subtypes (each divided hierarchically into several minor subtypes): Subtype 1 exhibited hypoconnectivity (less average connectivity than typically developing controls) and subtype 2, hyperconnectivity. The two subtypes did not differ in structural imaging metrics in any of the regions analyzed (64 cortical and 14 subcortical), nor in any of the behavioral scores (including Intelligence Quotient, ADI and ADOS). Finally, we used the Allen Human Brain Atlas of gene transcription to show that subtype 2, corresponding with about 42% of all patients, had significant enrichment (after multiple comparisons correction) to excitation-inhibition (E/I) imbalance, a leading reported mechanism in the developmental pathophysiology of ASD. Altogether, our results support a link between E/I imbalance and brain hyperconnectivity in ASD, an association that does not exist in hypoconnected autistic subjects.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Immunological contributions to age-dependent variations in behavioural responses to cutaneous inflammation</a></h4>

              
                Systemic responses to immune challenge are immature at birth. However exposure to experimental inflammogens are able to produce an immunologic response which is characterised by swelling and oedema but, unlike in adults, does not result in sensory hypersensitivity. We sought to investigate whether the lack of nociceptive hypersensitivity was as a result of altered hemapoietic immune cell recruitment to the site of inflammation and/or differences in the cytokine and chemokine profile released by tissue invading cells. Postnatal (day of birth) and young adult (40-days old) Sprague- Dawley rats were used. Inflammation was induced by s.c. injection of Complete Freunds Adjuvant (CFA) unilaterally into the one hind paw. Mechanical withdrawal thresholds were measured before and after injection (2-168hrs). In adults a significant hyperalgesia was evoked which was absent in neonates. Immunohistochemical analysis of invading immune cells present in the perfusion fixed skin showed that although total cell numbers in the paw were the same in both age groups, neonates recruited more cells positive for both cell surface markers CD68 and Mannose-receptor (MR) whereas adults recruited significantly more cells positive for MR alone. There were no differences in neutrophil recruitment (as measured with H&E staining). TaqMan qPCR demonstrated that the temporal profile of cytokine production in the skin differed between ages with neonates responding faster than adults and that neonates produced significantly more IL-1b and IL-27 then adults who expressed significantly more IL-6 and IL-10. This study illustrates that in neonates the cell recruitment and cytokine profiles are markedly different to those seen in adults; this may in part explain why behavioural responses to inflammation are suppressed relative to adults.

                Nociceptors play an essential role in both acute pain and chronic pain conditions. and have recently been classified into distinct subsets using single-cell transcriptional profiling. In this study, we examined protein levels in dorsal root ganglia using DIA Mass-spectrometry technologies with NaV1.8Cre+/-; ROSA26-flox-stop-flox-DTA (Diphtheria toxin fragment A) mutant mice (NaV1.8Cre-DTA), in which NaV1.8-expressing neurons (mainly nociceptors) in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) were ablated. The results show that 353 transcripts and 78 proteins, including nociceptor-specific sodium channels NaV1.8 (Scn10a) and NaV1.9 (Scn11a), were specifically expressed in nociceptors of DRG. A comparative analysis revealed that about 40% of nociceptor-specific proteins are shared within the nociceptor-specific transcript dataset. Scatter plots show that the proteome and transcriptome datasets in nociceptors have a moderate correlation (r = 0.4825), indicating the existence of post-transcriptional and post-translational gene regulation in nociceptors. This combined profiling study provides a unique resource for sensory studies, especially for pain research.

                To better understand fundamental constraints on the global structural organization of the brain, we apply percolation theory as a quantitative measure of global communication across a network. The largest present sub-network across which all sets of regions are able to communicate defines a giant cluster. By novel analytic solution, we prove that if constructed tracts are constrained to emanate from those regions already in the giant cluster, a giant cluster grows smoothly without requiring a critical point. The predicted structure is highly consistent with brain data, among human diffusion MRI across adults (UK Biobank, N=19,380), adolescents (Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study, N=15,593) and neonates (Developing Human Connectome Project, N=758), as well as mouse viral tracing (Allen Institute). This suggests a fundamental mechanism for neurodevelopment in which the earliest tracts also become the longest and densest.

                To explain the social difficulties in autism, a large amount of research has been conducted on the neural correlates of social perception. However, this research has mostly used basic social stimuli (e.g. eyes, faces, hands, single agent), not resembling the complexity of what we encounter in our daily social lives, and as such, the situations people with autism experience difficulties in. A more complex stimulus that we do come across often and is also highly relevant for social functioning is that of third-party social interactions. Here, we investigated if individuals with and without autism process third-party social interactions differently. More specifically, we measured neural responses to social scenes depicting either social interaction or not with an electroencephalogram (EEG) frequency tagging task and compared these responses between adults with and without autism (N = 61). The results revealed an enhanced response to social scenes with interaction, replicating previous findings in a neurotypical sample (Oomen et al., 2022). Crucially, this effect was found in both groups with no difference between them. This suggest that social interaction recognition is not anomalous in adults with autism and cannot explain the social difficulties adults with autism experience.

                Acupuncture plays a vital anti-inflammatory action on sepsis through activating autonomic nerve anti-inflammatory pathways, such as sympathoadrenal medullary pathway, but the mechanism remains unclear. This study aims to explore the optimum parameter of electroacupuncture (EA) stimulation in regulating sympathoadrenal medullary pathway and evaluate EA anti-inflammatory effect on sepsis. To explore the optimum parameter of EA at homosegmental acupoint on adrenal sympathetic activity, the left adrenal sympathetic nerve firing rate evoked by different intensities of single shock electrical stimulation (ES) at ST25 in healthy male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were evaluated by in vivo electrophysiological recording, and the levels of norepinephrine (NE) and its metabolites were also examined using mass spectrometry. To verify the role of EA at ST25 in sepsis, the rat was given intraperitoneal injection lipopolysaccharide to induce sepsis model, and survival rate, clinical score, and the level of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1{beta}, and IL-10 were evaluated after EA application. We observed that 3 mA is the optimal intensity on activating adrenal sympathetic nerve, which significantly elevated the level of NE in the peripheral blood. For LPS-treated rats, EA at the ST25 apparently increased the survival rate and improved the clinical score compared to the control group. Furthermore, 3 mA EA at ST25 significantly decreased pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-1{beta} and upregulated anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 compared to the Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated group. Overall, these data suggest that 3 mA is the optimal EA intensity at ST25 to activate the sympathoadrenal medullary pathway and exert an anti-inflammatory effect on sepsis.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The activity of deep cortical layers characterizes thecomplexity of brain responses during wakefulnessfollowing electrical stimulation</a></h4>

              
                It has been suggested that the complexity of the brain is closely related to its state of consciousness. The perturbational complexity index (PCI) has been used in humans and rodents to distinguish conscious from unconscious states based on the global cortical responses (recorded by electroencephalography; EEG) to local cortical stimulation (CS). However, it has been unclear how different cortical layers respond to CS and contribute to the resulting intra- and inter-areal cortical communication and PCI. A detailed investigation of these local dynamics is needed to understand the basis for PCI. We hypothesized that the complexity level of global cortical responses (PCI) corresponds to variations in layer-specific activity and connectivity patterns. We investigated global cortical dynamics and layer specific activity in mice, combining cortical electrical stimulation, global EEG, and local multi-electrode, laminar recordings from layers 1-6 in somatosensory cortex, during wakefulness and general anesthesia (sevoflurane). We found that transition from wake to sevoflurane anesthesia correlated with a drop in global and local PCI values (complexity). This was accompanied by a local decrease in neural firing rate, spike-field coherence, and long-range functional connectivity specific to deep layers (L5, L6). Our results suggest that deep cortical layers are mechanistically important for changes in PCI, and thereby for variations in the states of consciousness.

                Cortical neurons exhibit temporally irregular spiking patterns and heterogeneous firing rates. These features arise in model circuits operating in a 'fluctuation-driven regime', in which fluctuations in membrane potentials emerge from the network dynamics. However, it is still unclear whether the cortex operates in this regime. We evaluated the fluctuation-driven hypothesis by analyzing spiking and sub-threshold membrane potentials of neurons in the sensory and frontal cortex recorded during a decision-making task. Standard fluctuation-driven models account for spiking statistics but fail to capture the heterogeneity in sub-threshold activity. We address this issue by effectively incorporating dendritic conductances into the standard models. Our model suggests that the frontal cortex operates in a fluctuation-driven regime. In contrast, excitatory neurons in layer 4 of the barrel cortex are not fluctuation-driven; they spike in response to occasional synchronous inputs. Our work reveals fundamental differences between cortical areas, suggesting that they operate in different dynamical regimes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">ComBat Harmonization: Empirical Bayes versus Fully Bayes Approaches</a></h4>

              
                Studying small effects or subtle neuroanatomical variation requires large-scale sample size data. As a result, combining neuroimaging data from multiple datasets is necessary. Variation in acquisition protocols, magnetic field strength, scanner build, and many other non-biologically related factors can introduce undesirable bias into studies. Hence, harmonization is required to remove the bias-inducing factors from the data. ComBat, introduced by (Johnson et al., 2007), is one of the most common methods applied to features from structural images. ComBat models the data using a hierarchical Bayesian model and uses the empirical Bayes approach to infer the distribution of the unknown factors. The empirical Bayes harmonization method is computationally efficient and provides valid point estimates. However, it tends to underestimate uncertainty. This paper investigates a new approach, fully Bayesian ComBat, where Monte Carlo Sampling is used for statistical inference. Our experiments show that our new fully Bayesian approach offers more accurate harmonization, unconstrained posterior distributions, and representative uncertainty quantification at the expense of higher computation costs for the inference. This fully Bayesian approach generates a rich posterior distribution, which is also useful for generating simulated imaging features for improving classifier performance in a limited data setting. We show the generative capacity of our model for augmenting and improving the detection of patients with Alzheimer's disease. Posterior distributions for harmonized imaging measures can also be used for brain-wide uncertainty comparison and more principled downstream statistical analysis. Code for our new fully Bayesian ComBat extension is available at https://github.com/batmanlab/BayesComBat.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Information theoretic evidence for layer- and frequency-specific changes in cortical information processing under anesthesia</a></h4>

              
                Nature relies on highly distributed computation for the processing of information in nervous systems across the entire animal kingdom. Such distributed computation can be more easily understood if decomposed into the three elementary components of information processing, i.e. storage, transfer and modification, and rigorous information theoretic measures for these components exist. However, the distributed computation is often also linked to neural dynamics exhibiting distinct rhythms. Thus, it would be beneficial to associate the above components of information processing with distinct rhythmic processes where possible. Here we focus on the storage of information in neural dynamics and introduce a novel spectrally-resolved measure of active information storage (AIS). Drawing on intracortical recordings of neural activity under anesthesia before and after loss of consciousness (LOC) we show that anesthesia-related modulation of AIS is highly specific to different frequency bands and that these frequency-specific effects differ across cortical layers and brain regions. We found that in the high/low gamma band the effects of anesthesia result in AIS modulation only in the supergranular layers, while in the alpha/beta band the strongest decrease in AIS can be seen at infragranular layers. Finally, we show that the increase of spectral power at multiple frequencies, in particular at alpha and delta bands in frontal areas, that is often observed during LOC ('anteriorization') also impacts local information processing - but in a frequency specific way: Increases in isoflurane concentration induced a decrease in AIS in the alpha frequencies, while they increased AIS in the delta frequency range < 2Hz. Thus, the analysis of spectrally-resolved AIS provides valuable additional insights into changes in cortical information processing under anaesthesia.

                Cognitive control (CC) is a vital component of cognition associated with problem-solving in everyday life. Many neurological and neuropsychiatric conditions have deficits associated with CC. CC is composed of multiple behaviors including switching, inhibiting, and updating. The fronto-parietal control network B (FPCN-B), the dorsal attention network (DAN), the cingulo-opercular network (CON) and the dorsal default-mode network (dorsal-DMN) have been associated with switching and inhibiting behaviors. However, our understanding of how these brain regions interact to bring about CC behaviors is still unclear. In the current study, participants performed two in-scanner tasks that required switching and inhibiting. We then used a series of support vector regression (SVR) models containing individually-estimated functional connectivity between the networks of interest derived during tasks and at rest to predict inhibition and switching behaviors in individual subjects. We observed that the combination of between-network connectivity from these individually estimated functional networks predicted accurate and timely inhibition and switching behaviors in individuals. We also observed that the relationships between canonical task-positive and task-negative networks predicted inhibiting and switching behaviors. Finally, we observed a functional dissociation between the FPCN-A and FPCN-B during rest, and task performance predicted inhibiting and switching behaviors. These results suggest that individually estimated networks can predict individual CC behaviors, that between-network functional connectivity estimated within individuals is vital to understanding how CC arises, and that the fractionation of the FPCN and the DMN may be associated with different behaviors than their canonically accepted behaviors.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Modulatory dynamics of periodic and aperiodic activity in respiration-brain coupling</a></h4>

              
                Bodily rhythms such as respiration are increasingly acknowledged to modulate neural oscillations underlying human action, perception, and cognition. Conversely, the link between respiration and aperiodic brain activity - a non-oscillatory reflection of excitation-inhibition (E:I) balance - has remained unstudied. Aiming to disentangle potential respiration-related dynamics of periodic and aperiodic activity, we applied novel algorithms of time-resolved parameter estimation to resting-state M/EEG data from two recording sites (N = 78). Our findings highlight the role of respiration as a physiological influence on brain signalling. We provide first evidence that fluctuations of aperiodic brain activity (1/f slope) are phase-locked to the respiratory cycle which strongly suggests that spontaneous state shifts of excitation-inhibition balance are at least partly influenced by peripheral bodily signals. Moreover, differential temporal dynamics in their coupling to non-oscillatory and oscillatory activity point towards a functional distinction in the way each component is related to respiration.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Conditional degradation of UNC-31/CAPS enables spatiotemporal analysis of neuropeptide function</a></h4>

              
                Neuropeptide release from dense-core vesicles in Caenorhabditis elegans is promoted by UNC-31, ortholog of the calcium-dependent activator protein for secretion (CAPS). Loss of UNC-31 causes multiple phenotypes in C. elegans including reduced motility, retention of late-stage eggs and reduction in evoked synaptic release. However, the ability to analyze UNC-31 function over discrete timescales and in specific neurons is lacking. Here, we generated and validated a tool to enable UNC-31 expression and spatiotemporal functional analysis. We show that endogenously tagged UNC-31 is expressed in major ganglia and nerve cords from late-embryonic stages through to adult. Using the auxin-inducible degradation system, we depleted UNC-31 post-embryonically from the nervous system and revealed defects in egg-laying, locomotion and vesicle release that were comparable to unc-31 null mutant animals. In addition, we found that depleting UNC-31 specifically from the BAG sensory neurons causes increased intestinal fat storage, highlighting the spatial sensitivity of this system. Together, this protein degradation tool may be used to facilitate studies of neuropeptide function at precise cellular and temporal scales.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Changes in adenosine and neurotrophic signaling in the SOD1G93A mouse model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: modulation by chronic caffeine intake</a></h4>

              
                Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is characterized by the progressive degeneration of corticospinal tract motor neurons. Previous studies showed that adenosine-mediated neuromodulation is disturbed in ALS and that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has a neuroprotective function in ALS mouse models. We evaluated how adenosine (A1R and A2AR) and VEGF (VEGFA, VEGFB, VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2) system markers are altered in the cortex and spinal cord of pre-symptomatic and symptomatic SOD1G93A mice. We then assessed if/how chronic treatment of SOD1G93A mice with a widely consumed adenosine receptor antagonist, caffeine, modulates VEGF system and/or the levels of Brain-derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF), known to be under control of A2AR. We found out decreases in A1R and increases in A2AR levels even before disease onset. Concerning the VEGF system, we detected increases of VEGFB and VEGFR-2 levels in the spinal cord at pre-symptomatic stage, which reverses at the symptomatic stage, and decreases of VEGFA levels in the cortex, in very late disease states. Chronic treatment with caffeine rescued cortical A1R levels in SOD1G93A mice, bringing them to control levels, while rendering VEGF signaling nearly unaffected. In contrast, BDNF levels were significantly affected in SOD1G93A mice treated with caffeine, being decreased in the cortex and increased in spinal the cord. Altogether, these findings suggest an early dysfunction of the adenosinergic system in ALS and highlights the possibility that the negative influence of caffeine previously reported in ALS animal models results from interference with BDNF rather than with the VEGF signaling molecules.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A stable, distributed code for cue value in mouse cortex during reward learning</a></h4>

              
                The ability to associate reward-predicting stimuli with adaptive behavior is frequently attributed to the prefrontal cortex, but the stimulus-specificity, spatial distribution, and stability of neural cue-reward associations are unresolved. We trained headfixed mice on an olfactory Pavlovian conditioning task and measured the coding properties of individual neurons across space (prefrontal, olfactory, and motor cortices) and time (multiple days). Neurons encoding cues and licks were most common in olfactory and motor cortex, respectively. By classifying cue-encoding neurons according to their responses to the six odor cues, we unexpectedly found value coding, including coding of trial-by-trial reward history, in all regions we sampled. We further found that prefrontal cue and lick codes were preserved across days. Our results demonstrate that individual prefrontal neurons stably encode components of cue-reward learning within a larger spatial gradient of coding properties.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Identifiability analysis and noninvasive online estimation of the first-order neural activation dynamics in the brain with transcranial magnetic stimulation</a></h4>

              
                Background: Neurons demonstrate very distinct nonlinear activation dynamics, influenced by the neuron type, morphology, ion channel expression, and various other factors. The measurement of the activation dynamics can identify the neural target of stimulation and detect deviations, e.g., for diagnosis. This paper describes a tool for closed-loop sequential parameter estimation (SPE) of the activation dynamics through transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). The proposed SPE method operates in real time, selects ideal stimulus parameters, detects and processes the response, and concurrently estimates the input-output (IO) curve and the first-order approximation of the activated neural target. Objective: To develop a SPE method to concurrently estimate the first-order activation dynamics and IO curve in closed-loop electromyography-guided (EMG-guided) TMS. Method: First, identifiability of the integrated model of the first-order neural activation dynamics and IO curve is assessed, demonstrating that at least two IO curves need to be acquired with different pulse widths. Then, a two-stage SPE method is proposed. It estimates the IO curve by using Fisher information matrix optimization in the first stage and subsequently estimates the membrane time constant as well as the coupling gain in the second stage. The procedure continues in a sequential manner until a stopping rule is satisfied. Results: The results of 73 simulation cases confirm the satisfactory estimation of the membrane time constant and coupling gain with average absolute relative errors (AREs) of 6.2% and 5.3%, respectively, with an average of 344 pulses (172 pulses for each IO curve or pulse width). The method estimates the IO curves' lower and upper plateaus, mid-point, and slope with average AREs of 0.2%, 0.7%, 0.9%, and 14.5%, respectively. Conclusions: SPE of the activation dynamics requires acquiring at least two IO curves with different pulse widths, which needs a TMS device with adjustable pulse duration. Significance: The proposed SPE method enhances the cTMS functionality, which can contribute novel insights in TMS studies.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Covert shifts of attention towards the visual periphery induce pupil dilation</a></h4>

              
                Previous studies have suggested that pupil size increases with covert shifts of attention to the peripheral as compared to the (para)foveal visual field, i.e., with increasing attentional breadth. This finding is crucial because it matches the theoretical prediction that (para)foveal vision benefits more from the visual acuity provided by small pupils than peripheral vision does. However, no study has investigated this question while controlling for all possible confounds (e.g., task difficulty). Throughout three experiments (N=100) we tested whether pupil size increases with increasing attentional breadth, and if this effect depends on the shape of attention, that is, whether attention is broadly (Annulus Attention) or narrowly (Spotlight Attention) distributed. We found that pupil size increases with covert shifts of attention to the peripheral visual field, i.e., increasing attentional breadth, with no clear difference between the two shapes of attention. We further found a correlation with performance, suggesting a functional benefit of the link between attentional breadth and pupil size. Finally, we propose that cognitively driven pupil dilation is not merely a convenient marker of activity in brain areas such as the Locus Coeruleus, but rather is an adaptive response that reflects an emphasis on peripheral vision over foveal vision.

	<p>Background: Despite significant research progress surrounding precision medicine in psychiatry, there has been little tangible impact upon real-world clinical care. Objective: To identify barriers and facilitators affecting the real-world implementation of precision psychiatry. Method: A PRISMA-compliant systematic literature search of primary research studies, conducted in the Web of Science, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PsycINFO and OpenGrey databases. We included a qualitative data synthesis structured according to the &amp;amp;lsquo;Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research&amp;amp;rsquo; (CFIR) key constructs. Results: Of 93,886 records screened, 28 studies were suitable for inclusion. The included studies reported 38 barriers and facilitators attributed to the CFIR constructs. Commonly reported barriers included: potential psychological harm to the service user (n = 11), cost and time investments (n = 9), potential economic and occupational harm to the service user (n = 8), poor accuracy and utility of the model (n = 8), and poor perceived competence in precision medicine amongst staff (n = 7). The most highly reported facilitator was the availability of adequate competence and skills training for staff (n = 7). Conclusions: Psychiatry faces widespread challenges in the implementation of precision medicine methods. Innovative solutions are required at the level of the individual and the wider system to fulfil the translational gap and impact real-world care.</p>

	<p>Backgrounds: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an emerging and promising therapeutic approach for treatment-refractory obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). The most common DBS targets include the anterior limb of internal capsule (ALIC) and nucleus accumbens (NAcc). This protocol aims to explore the efficacy and safety of the combined ALIC- and NAcc-DBS for treatment-refractory OCD. Methods: We will recruit 64 patients with refractory OCD from six centers, randomly allocate them to active and sham-stimulation groups through a three-month double-blind phase, then enter a three-month open-label phase. In the open-label stage, both groups experience real stimulation. Outcome measures: The primary outcome will be the efficacy and safety of combined ALIC- and NAcc-DBS, determined by treatment response rate between the active and sham-stimulation groups at the double-blind stage and spontaneously reported adverse events. The secondary outcomes are comparisons of change in Y&amp;amp;ndash;BOCS, CGI, HAMD, and HAMA scores at the third and sixth months compared to baseline between the active and sham-control groups, as well as the scores of the third month minus the sixth month between the two groups.</p>

	<p>Repetitive neuromuscular magnetic stimulation (rNMS) for pediatric headache disorders is feasible, safe, and alleviates headache symptoms. This study assesses muscular effects and factors affecting response to rNMS. A retrospective chart review included children with headaches receiving six rNMS sessions targeting the upper trapezius muscles. Pressure pain thresholds (PPT) were measured before and after rNMS, and at 3-month follow-up (FU). Mean headache frequency, duration, and intensity within the last 3 months were documented. In 20 patients (14.1 &amp;amp;plusmn; 2.7 years), PPT significantly increased from pre- to post-treatment (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) sustaining until FU. PPT changes significantly differed between primary headache and post-traumatic headache (PTH) (p = 0.019&amp;amp;ndash;0.026). Change in headache frequency was significantly higher in patients with than without neck pain (p = 0.032). A total of 60% of patients with neck pain responded to rNMS (&amp;amp;ge;25%), while 20% of patients without neck pain responded (p = 0.048). 60% of patients receiving rNMS twice a week were responders, while 33% of patients receiving rNMS less or more frequently responded to treatment, respectively. Alleviation of muscular hyperalgesia was demonstrated sustaining for 3 months, which was emphasized in PTH. The rNMS sessions may positively modulate headache symptoms regardless of headache diagnosis. Patients with neck pain profit explicitly well. Two rNMS sessions per week led to the highest reduction in headache frequency.</p>

	<p>Eye movement abnormalities in association with cognitive and emotional deficits have been described in neurological, neurodevelopmental, and psychiatric disorders. Eye-Tracking (ET) techniques could therefore enhance cognitive interventions by contingently providing feedback to patients. Since no consensus has been reached thus far on this approach, this study aimed at systematically reviewing the current evidence. This review was performed and reported according to PRISMA guidelines. Records were searched for in PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus (1990&amp;amp;ndash;2021) through the following string: (&amp;amp;lsquo;Eye Tracking&amp;amp;rsquo; OR &amp;amp;lsquo;Eye-Tracking&amp;amp;rsquo; OR &amp;amp;lsquo;Oculomotor&amp;amp;rsquo;) AND (&amp;amp;lsquo;Neuropsychol*&amp;amp;rsquo; OR &amp;amp;lsquo;Cognitive&amp;amp;rsquo;) AND (&amp;amp;lsquo;Rehabilitation&amp;amp;rsquo; OR &amp;amp;lsquo;Training&amp;amp;rsquo; OR &amp;amp;lsquo;Stimulation&amp;amp;rsquo;). Study outcomes were thematically classified and qualitatively synthesized. A structured quality assessment was performed. A total of 24 articles were included, addressing neurodevelopmental (preterm infants and children with autism spectrum disorder, Rett syndrome, or ADHD; N = 14), psychiatric (mood and anxiety disorders or alcohol dependence; N = 7), and neurological conditions (stroke; N = 3). Overall, ET gaze-contingent training proved to be effective in improving cognitive and emotional alterations. However, population heterogeneity limits the generalizability of results. ET gaze-contingent protocols allow researchers to directly and dynamically train attentional functions; together with the recruitment of implicit, &amp;amp;ldquo;bottom-up&amp;amp;rdquo; strategies, these protocols are promising and possibly integrable with traditional cognitive approaches.</p>
