Abstract
<p>Altered cortical excitation-inhibition (E-I) balance resulting from abnormal parvalbumin interneuron (PV IN) function is a proposed pathophysiological mechanism of schizophrenia and other major psychiatric disorders. Preclinical studies have indicated that <i>disrupted-in-schizophrenia-1</i> (<i>Disc1</i>) is a useful molecular lead to address the biology of prefrontal cortex (PFC)-dependent cognition and PV IN function. To date, PFC inhibitory circuit function has not been investigated in depth in <i>Disc1</i> locus impairment (LI) mouse models. Therefore, we used a <i>Disc1</i> LI mouse model to investigate E-I balance in medial PFC (mPFC) circuits. We found that inhibition onto layer 2/3 excitatory pyramidal neurons in the mPFC was significantly reduced in <i>Disc1</i> LI mice. This reduced inhibition was accompanied by decreased GABA release from local PV, but not somatostatin (SOM) INs, and by impaired feedforward inhibition (FFI) in the mediodorsal thalamus (MD) to mPFC circuit. Our mechanistic findings of abnormal PV IN function in a <i>Disc1</i> LI model provide insight into biology that may be relevant to neuropsychiatric disorders including schizophrenia.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0374-19.2020v1?rss=1">An Indexing Theory for Working Memory based on Fast Hebbian Plasticity</a></h4>

Abstract<p>Working memory (WM) is a key component of human memory and cognition. Computational models have been used to study the underlying neural mechanisms, but neglected the important role of short- and long-term memory interactions (STM, LTM) for WM. Here, we investigate these using a novel multi-area spiking neural network model of prefrontal cortex (PFC) and two parieto-temporal cortical areas based on macaque data. We propose a WM indexing theory that explains how PFC could associate, maintain and update multi-modal LTM representations. Our simulations demonstrate how simultaneous, brief multi-modal memory cues could build a temporary joint memory representation as an "index" in PFC by means of fast Hebbian synaptic plasticity. This index can then reactivate spontaneously and thereby also the associated LTM representations. Cueing one LTM item rapidly pattern-completes the associated un-cued item via PFC. The PFC-STM network updates flexibly as new stimuli arrive thereby gradually over-writing older representations.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Most if not all computational working memory (WM) models have focused on short-term memory (STM) aspects. However, from the cognitive perspective the interaction of STM with long-term memory (LTM) bears particular relevance since the WM activated LTM representations are considered central to flexible cognition. Here we present a large-scale biologically detailed spiking neural network model accounting for three connected cortical areas to study dynamic STM-LTM interactions that reflect the underlying theoretical concept of memory indexing, adapted to support distributed cortical WM. Our cortex model is constrained by relevant experimental data about cortical neurons, synapses, modularity, and connectivity. It demonstrates encoding, maintenance and flexible updating of multiple items in WM as no single model has done before. It thereby bridges microscopic synaptic effects with macroscopic memory dynamics, and reproduces several key neural phenomena reported in WM experiments.</p>

<p>To improve the understanding of human gait and to facilitate novel
developments in gait rehabilitation, the neural correlates of human gait as
measured by means of non-invasive electroencephalography (EEG) have been
investigated recently. Particularly, gait-related event-related brain
potentials (gERPs) may provide information about the functional role of
cortical brain regions in human gait control. The purpose of this paper is to
explore possible experimental and technical solutions for time-sensitive
analysis of human gait-related ERPs during spontaneous and instructed treadmill
walking. A solution (HW/SW) for synchronous recording of gait- and EEG data was
developed, tested and piloted. The solution consists of a custom-made USB
synchronization interface, a time-synchronization module and a data merging
module, allowing temporal synchronization of recording devices for
time-sensitive extraction of gait markers for analysis of gait-related ERPs and
for the training of artificial neural networks. In the present manuscript, the
hardware and software components were tested with the following devices: A
treadmill with an integrated pressure plate for gait analysis (zebris FDM-T)
and an Acticap non-wireless 32-channel EEG-system (Brain Products GmbH). The
usability and validity of the developed solution was tested in a pilot study (n
= 3 healthy participants, n=3 females, mean age = 22.75 years). Recorded EEG
data was segmented and analyzed according to the detected gait markers for the
analysis of gait-related ERPs. Finally, EEG periods were used to train a deep
learning artificial neural network as classifier of gait phases. The results
obtained in this pilot study, although preliminary, support the feasibility of

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.00073">Preliminary Report: Cerebral blood flow mediates the relationship between progesterone and perceived stress symptoms among female club athletes after mild traumatic brain injury. (arXiv:2003.00073v1 [q-bio.NC])</a></h4>

<p>Female athletes are severely understudied in the field of concussion
research, despite higher prevalence for injuries and tendency to have longer
recovery time. Hormonal fluctuations due to normal menstrual cycle (MC) or
hormonal contraceptive (HC) use have been shown to impact both post-injury
symptoms and neuroimaging measures, but have not been accounted for in
concussion studies. In this preliminary study, we compared arterial spin
labeling measured cerebral blood flow (CBF) between concussed female club
athletes 3-10 days post injury (mTBI) and demographic, HC/MC matched controls
(CON). We test whether CBF mediates the relationship between progesterone
levels in blood and post-injury symptoms, which may be evidence for
progesterone`s role in neuroprotection. We found a significant three-way
relationship between progesterone, CBF and perceived stress score (PSS) in the
left middle temporal gyrus. Higher progesterone was associated with lower (more
normative) PSS, as well as higher (more normative) CBF. CBF mediates 100% of
the relationship between progesterone and PSS (Sobel`s p-value=0.017). These
findings suggest progesterone may have a neuroprotective role after concussion
and highlight the importance of controlling for the effects of sex hormones in
future concussion studies.

<p>The dexterity of conventional myoelectric prostheses is limited in part by
the small datasets used to train the control algorithms. Variations in surface
electrode positioning make it difficult to collect consistent data and to
estimate motor intent reliably over time. To address these challenges, we
developed an inexpensive, easy-to-don sleeve that can record robust and
repeatable surface electromyography from 32 embedded monopolar electrodes.
Embedded grommets are used to consistently align the sleeve with natural skin
markings (e.g., moles, freckles, scars). The sleeve can be manufactured in a
few hours for less than $60. Data from seven intact participants show the
sleeve provides a signal-to-noise ratio of 14, a don-time under 11 seconds, and
sub-centimeter precision for electrode placement. Furthermore, in a case study
with one intact participant, we use the sleeve to demonstrate that neural
networks can provide simultaneous and proportional control of six degrees of
freedom, even 263 days after initial algorithm training. We also highlight that
consistent recordings, accumulated over time to establish a large dataset,
significantly improve dexterity. These results suggest that deep learning with
a 74-layer neural network can substantially improve the dexterity and stability
of myoelectric prosthetic control, and that deep-learning techniques can be
readily instantiated and further validated through inexpensive sleeves/sockets
with consistent recording locations.

<p>We develop a theoretical framework for defining and identifying flows of
information in computational systems. Here, a computational system is assumed
to be a directed graph, with "clocked" nodes that send transmissions to each
other along the edges of the graph at discrete points in time. We are
interested in a definition that captures the dynamic flow of information about
a specific message, and which guarantees an unbroken "information path" between
appropriately defined inputs and outputs in the directed graph. Prior measures,
including those based on Granger Causality and Directed Information, fail to
provide clear assumptions and guarantees about when they correctly reflect
information flow about a message. We take a systematic approach---iterating
through candidate definitions and counterexamples---to arrive at a definition
for information flow that is based on conditional mutual information, and which
satisfies desirable properties, including the existence of information paths.
Finally, we describe how information flow might be detected in a noiseless
setting, and provide an algorithm to identify information paths on the
time-unrolled graph of a computational system.

<p>Neuronal circuits formed in the brain are complex with intricate connection
patterns. Such complexity is also observed in the retina as a relatively simple
neuronal circuit. A retinal ganglion cell receives excitatory inputs from
neurons in previous layers as driving forces to fire spikes. Analytical methods
are required that can decipher these components in a systematic manner.
Recently a method termed spike-triggered non-negative matrix factorization
(STNMF) has been proposed for this purpose. In this study, we extend the scope
of the STNMF method. By using the retinal ganglion cell as a model system, we
show that STNMF can detect various computational properties of upstream bipolar
cells, including spatial receptive field, temporal filter, and transfer
nonlinearity. In addition, we recover synaptic connection strengths from the
weight matrix of STNMF. Furthermore, we show that STNMF can separate spikes of
a ganglion cell into a few subsets of spikes where each subset is contributed
by one presynaptic bipolar cell. Taken together, these results corroborate that
STNMF is a useful method for deciphering the structure of neuronal circuits.

<p>How are the complex maps for orientation selectivity (OS) created in the primary visual cortex (V1)? Rodents and rabbits have a random distribution of OS preferences across V1 while in cats, ferrets, and all primates cells with similar OS preferences cluster together into relatively wide cortical columns. Given other clear similarities in the organization of the visual pathways, why is it that maps coding OS preferences are so radically different? Prominent models have been created of cortical OS mapping that incorporate Hebbian plasticity, intracortical interactions, and the properties of growing axons. However, these models suggest that the maps arise primarily through intracortical interactions. Here we focus on several other features of the visual system and brain that may influence V1 structure. These are: eye divergence, the total number of cells in V1, the thalamocortical networks, the topography of the retina and phylogeny. We outline the evidence for and against these factors contributing to map formation. One promising theory is that the central-to-peripheral ratio (CP ratio) of retinal cell density can be used to predict whether or not a species has pinwheel maps. Animals with high CP ratios (&gt;7) have orientation columns while those with low CP ratios (&lt;4) have random OS maps. The CP ratio is related to the total number of cells in cortex, which also appears to be a reasonable contributing factor. However, while these factors correlate with map structure to some extent, there is a gray area where certain species do not fit elegantly into the theory. A problem with the existing literature is that OS maps have been investigated in only a small number of mammals, from a small fraction of the mammalian phylogenetic tree. We suggest four species (agouti, fruit bat, sheep, and wallaby) that have a range of interesting characteristics, which sit at intermediate locations between primates and rodents, that make them good targets for filling in the missing gaps in the literature. We make predictions about the map structures of these species based on the organization of their brains and visual systems and, in doing so, set possible paths for future research.</p>

<p>The propensity to engage in risky behaviors including excessive alcohol consumption may impose increased medical, emotional, and psychosocial burdens. Personality and behavioral traits of individuals may contribute in part to the involvement in risky behaviors, and therefore the classification of one’s traits may help identify those who are at risk for future onset of the addictive disorder and related behavioral issues such as alcohol misuse. Personality and behavioral characteristics including impulsivity, anger, reward sensitivity, and avoidance were assessed in a large sample of healthy young adults (n = 475). Participants also underwent diffusion tensor imaging for the analysis of structural brain networks. A data-driven clustering using personality and behavioral traits of the participants identified four subtypes. As compared with individuals clustered into the neutral type, individuals with a high level of impulsivity (A subtype) and those with high levels of reward sensitivity, impulsivity, anger, and avoidance (B subtype) showed significant associations with problem drinking. In contrast, individuals with high levels of impulsivity, anger, and avoidance but not reward sensitivity (C subtype) showed a pattern of social drinking that was similar to those of the neutral subtype. Furthermore, logistic regression analysis with ridge estimators was applied to demonstrate the neurobiological relevance for the identified subtypes according to distinct patterns of structural brain connectivity within the addiction circuitry [neutral vs. A subtype, the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC) = 0.74, 95% CI = 0.67–0.81; neutral vs. B subtype, AUC = 0.74, 95% CI = 0.66–0.82; neutral vs. C subtype, AUC = 0.77, 95% CI = 0.70–0.84]. The current findings enable the characterization of individuals according to subtypes based on personality and behavioral traits that are also corroborated by neuroimaging data and may provide a platform to better predict individual risks for addictive disorders.</p>

<p>Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease with a complex and not fully understood pathogenesis. Besides brain-intrinsic hallmarks such as abnormal deposition of harmful proteins, i.e., amyloid beta in plaques and hyperphosphorylated Tau in neurofibrillary tangles, blood-derived elements, in particular, platelets have been discussed to be involved in AD pathogenesis. The underlying mechanisms, however, are rather unexplored. Here, we investigate a potential role of platelets in an AD transgenic animal model with severe amyloid plaque formation, the APP-PS1 transgenic mice, and analyzed the presence, spatial location and activation status of platelets within the brain. In APP-PS1 mice, a higher number of platelets were located within the brain parenchyma, i.e., outside the cerebral blood vessels compared to WT controls. Such platelets were activated according to the expression of the platelet activation marker CD62P and to morphological hallmarks such as membrane protrusions. In the brain, platelets were in close contact exclusively with astrocytes suggesting an interaction between these two cell types. In the bloodstream, although the percentage of activated platelets did not differ between transgenic and age-matched control animals, APP-PS1 blood-derived platelets showed remarkable ultrastructural peculiarities in platelet-specific organelles such as the open canalicular system (OCS). This work urges for further investigations on platelets and their yet unknown functional roles in the brain, which might go beyond AD pathogenesis and be relevant for various age-related neurodegenerative diseases.</p>

<p>Rapid Automatized Naming (RAN) is a strong predictor of reading aloud, though there is little agreement on what underpins RAN or how it relates to reading. Some theorize phonological skills, while others suggest that RAN reflects the “microcosm” of cognitive and attentional processes also required for reading, with more recent research using eye movements in an attempt to study this relationship. In the current study, we aimed to extend previous investigations to identify whether the temporal patterns of eye movements predict RAN and can, therefore, be established as a method to study the cognitive processes underlying RAN that could then be utilized to elucidate the relationship of RAN to reading. A Gazepoint eye tracker was used to record the eye movements of 93 learner readers aged 5–8 years (M age = 7.00) while performing a custom computerized alphabetic RAN task. Text reading accuracy, comprehension and rate; nonverbal intelligence; and phonological awareness abilities were also assessed. Regression analyses showed that, independently of phonological awareness, eye movements [Fixation Count (FC) and Fixation Duration (FD)] measured during RAN tasks were highly reflective of children’s rapid naming performance (92.8%). Both mean FC and mean FD during RAN tasks also predicted text reading accuracy (36.3%), comprehension (31.6%), and rate (36.2%) scores, and in predicting these text reading skills there was a high level of shared variance with RAN performance. In a sub-sample of participants, longer average FDs and counts independently discriminated children with reading difficulties (n = 18; aged 7–9) from neurotypical children matched for age (n = 18), but not from younger neurotypical children matched for reading level (n = 18; aged 5–6). Together, these results suggest that the analysis of eye movements recorded during RAN allows for the operationalization of many of the spatially and temporally-bound cognitive and attentional processes that underpin the RAN, and a step towards elucidating its relationship to reading.</p>

<p>Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the visual cortex can induce phosphenes as participants look at a visual target. So can non-diagnostic ultrasound (nDU), delivered in a transcranial fashion, while participants have closed their eyes during stimulation. Here, we sought to determine if DU, aimed at the visual cortex, could alter the perception of a visual target. We applied a randomized series of actual or sham DU, transcranially and towards the visual cortex of healthy participants while they stared at a visual target (a white crosshair on a light-blue background), with the ultrasound device placed where TMS elicited phosphenes. These participants observed percepts seven out of ten times, which consisted of extra or extensions of lines relative to the original crosshair, and additional colors, an average of 53.7 ± 2.6% of the time over the course of the experiment. Seven out of ten different participants exposed to sham-only DU observed comparable percepts, but only an average of 36.3 ± 1.9% of the time, a statistically significant difference (p &lt; 0.00001). Moreover, on average, participants exposed to a combination of sham and actual ultrasound reported a net increase of 47.9 percentage points in the likelihood that they would report a percept by the end of the experiment. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that a random combination of sham-only and actual DU, applied directly over the visual cortex of participants, increased the likelihood that they would observe visual effects, but not the type of effects, with that likelihood increasing over the course of the experiment. From this, we conclude that repeated exposures by DU may make the visual cortex more responsive to stimulation of their visual cortex by the visual target itself. Future studies should identify the biophysical mechanism(s) and neural pathways by which DU, in our hands and others, can generate its observed effects on brain function. These observations, consistent with other’s observation of effects of DU stimulation of the human motor cortex and amygdala, as well as the FDA approved nature of DU, may lead to increased use of DU as a means of altering brain function.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00065">Age-Dependent Asymmetry of Wrist Position Sense Is Not Influenced by Stochastic Tactile Stimulation</a></h4>

<p>Stochastic stimulation has been shown to improve movement, balance, the sense of touch, and may also improve position sense. This stimulation can be non-invasive and may be a simple technology to enhance proprioception. In this study, we investigated whether sub-threshold stochastic tactile stimulation of mechanoreceptors reduces age-related errors in wrist position estimation. Fifteen young (24.5±1.5y) and 23 elderly (71.7±7.3y) unimpaired, right-handed adults completed a wrist position gauge-matching experiment. In each trial, the participant's concealed wrist was moved to a target position between 10 and 30° of wrist flexion or extension by a robotic manipulandum. The participant then estimated the wrist's position on a virtual gauge. During half of the trials, sub-threshold stochastic tactile stimulation was applied to the wrist muscle tendon areas. Stochastic stimulation did not significantly influence wrist position sense. In the elderly group, estimation errors decreased non-significantly when stimulation was applied compared to the trials without stimulation [mean constant error reduction Δμ(θconof)=0.8° in flexion and Δμ(θconoe)=0.7° in extension direction, p = 0.95]. This effect was less pronounced in the young group [Δμ(θcony)=0.2° in flexion and in extension direction, p = 0.99]. These improvements did not yield a relevant effect size (Cohen's d &lt; 0.1). Estimation errors increased with target angle magnitude in both movement directions. In young participants, estimation errors were non-symmetric, with estimations in flexion [μ(θconyf)=1.8°, σ(θconyf)=7.0°] being significantly more accurate than in extension [μ(θconye)=8.3°, σ(θconye)=9.3°, p &lt; 0.01]. This asymmetry was not present in the elderly group, where estimations in flexion [μ(θconof)=7.5°, σ(θconof)=9.8°] were similar to extension [μ(θconoe)=7.7°, σ(θconoe)=9.3°]. Hence, young and elderly participants performed equally in extension direction, whereas wrist position sense in flexion direction deteriorated with age (p &lt; 0.01). Though unimpaired elderly adults did not benefit from stochastic stimulation, it cannot be deduced that individuals with more severe impairments of their sensory system do not profit from this treatment. While the errors in estimating wrist position are symmetric in flexion and extension in elderly adults, young adults are more accurate when estimating wrist flexion, an effect that has not been described before.</p>

<p>Interpersonal synchrony (IPS) is an important everyday behavior influencing social cognitive development; however, few studies have investigated the developmental differences and underlying neural mechanisms of IPS. functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a novel neuroimaging tool that allows the study of cortical activation in the presence of natural movements. Using fNIRS, we compared cortical activation patterns between children and adults during action observation, execution, and IPS. Seventeen school-age children and 15 adults completed a reach to cleanup task while we obtained cortical activation data from bilateral inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), superior temporal sulcus (STS), and inferior parietal lobes (IPL). Children showed lower spatial and temporal accuracy during IPS compared to adults (i.e., spatial synchrony scores (Mean ± SE) in children: 2.67 ± 0.08 and adults: 2.85 ± 0.06; temporal synchrony scores (Mean ± SE) in children: 2.74 ± 0.06 and adults: 2.88 ± 0.05). For both groups, the STS regions were more activated during action observation, while the IFG and STS were more activated during action execution and IPS. The IPS condition involved more right-sided activation compared to action execution suggesting that IPS is a higher-order process involving more bilateral cortical activation. In addition, adults showed more left lateralization compared to the children during movement conditions (execution and IPS); which indicated greater inhibition of ipsilateral cortices in the adults compared to children. These findings provide a neuroimaging framework to study imitation and IPS impairments in special populations such as children with Autism Spectrum Disorder.</p>

<p>Intracranial electroencephalography (IEEG) involves recording from electrodes placed directly onto the cortical surface or deep brain locations. It is performed on patients with medically refractory epilepsy, undergoing pre-surgical seizure localization. IEEG recordings, combined with advancements in computational capacity and analysis tools, have accelerated cognitive neuroscience. This Perspective describes a potential pitfall latent in many of these recordings by virtue of the subject population—namely interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs), which can cause spurious results due to the contamination of normal neurophysiological signals by pathological waveforms related to epilepsy. We first discuss the nature of IED hazards, and why they deserve the attention of neurophysiology researchers. We then describe four general strategies used when handling IEDs (manual identification, automated identification, manual-automated hybrids, and ignoring by leaving them in the data), and discuss their pros, cons, and contextual factors. Finally, we describe current practices of human neurophysiology researchers worldwide based on a cross-sectional literature review and a voluntary survey. We put these results in the context of the listed strategies and make suggestions on improving awareness and clarity of reporting to enrich both data quality and communication in the field.</p>

<p>Synchronization of neural activity across brain regions is critical to processes that include perception, learning, and memory. After traumatic brain injury (TBI), neuronal degeneration is one possible effect and can alter communication between neural circuits. Consequently, synchronization between neurons may change and can contribute to both lasting changes in functional brain networks and cognitive impairment in patients. However, fundamental principles relating exactly how TBI at the cellular scale affects synchronization of mesoscale circuits are not well understood. In this work, we use computational networks of Izhikevich integrate-and-fire neurons to study synchronized, oscillatory activity between clusters of neurons, which also adapt according to spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP). We study how the connections within and between these neuronal clusters change as unidirectional connections form between the two neuronal populations. In turn, we examine how neuronal deletion, intended to mimic the temporary or permanent loss of neurons in the mesoscale circuit, affects these dynamics. We determine synchronization of two neuronal circuits requires very modest connectivity between these populations; approximately 10% of neurons projecting from one circuit to another circuit will result in high synchronization. In addition, we find that synchronization level inversely affects the strength of connection between neuronal microcircuits – moderately synchronized microcircuits develop stronger intercluster connections than do highly synchronized circuits. Finally, we find that highly synchronized circuits are largely protected against the effects of neuronal deletion but may display changes in frequency properties across circuits with targeted neuronal loss. Together, our results suggest that strongly and weakly connected regions differ in their inherent resilience to damage and may serve different roles in a larger network.</p>

<p>Human intelligence is constituted by a multitude of cognitive functions activated either directly or indirectly by external stimuli of various kinds. Computational approaches to the cognitive sciences and to neuroscience are partly premised on the idea that computational simulations of such cognitive functions and brain operations suspected to correspond to them can help to further uncover knowledge about those functions and operations, specifically, how they might work together. These approaches are also partly premised on the idea that empirical neuroscience research, whether following on from such a simulation (as indeed simulation and empirical research are complementary) or otherwise, could help us build better artificially intelligent systems. This is based on the assumption that principles by which the brain seemingly operate, to the extent that it can be understood as computational, should at least be tested as principles for the operation of artificial systems. This paper explores some of the principles of the brain that seem to be responsible for its autonomous, problem-adaptive nature. The brain operating system (BrainOS) explicated here is an introduction to ongoing work aiming to create a robust, integrated model, combining the connectionist paradigm underlying neural networks and the symbolic paradigm underlying much else of AI. BrainOS is an automatic approach that selects the most appropriate model based on the (a) input at hand, (b) prior experience (a history of results of prior problem solving attempts), and (c) world knowledge (represented in the symbolic way and used as a means to explain its approach). It is able to accept diverse and mixed input data types, process histories and objectives, extract knowledge and infer a situational context. BrainOS is designed to be efficient through its ability to not only choose the most suitable learning model but to effectively calibrate it based on the task at hand.</p>

<p>Analog-digital facilitations (ADFs) have been described in local excitatory brain circuits and correspond to a class of phenomena describing how subthreshold variations of the presynaptic membrane potential influence spike-evoked synaptic transmission. In many brain circuits, ADFs rely on the propagation of somatic membrane potential fluctuations to the presynaptic bouton where they modulate ion channels availability, inducing modifications of the presynaptic spike waveform, the spike-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry, and the transmitter release. Therefore, one major requirement for ADFs to occur is the propagation of subthreshold membrane potential variations from the soma to the presynaptic bouton. To date, reported ADFs space constants are relatively short (250–500 μm) which limits their action to proximal synapses. However, ADFs have been studied either in unmyelinated axons or in juvenile animals in which myelination is incomplete. We examined here the potential gain of ADFs spatial extent caused by myelination using a realistic model of L5 pyramidal cell. Myelination of the axon was found to induce a 3-fold increase in the axonal length constant. As a result, the different forms of ADF were found to display a much longer spatial extent (up to 3,000 μm). In addition, while the internodal length displayed a mild effect, the number of myelin wraps ensheathing the internodes was found to play a critical role in the ADFs spatial extents. We conclude that axonal myelination induces an increase in ADFs spatial extent in our model, thus making ADFs plausible in long-distance connections.</p>

<p>One means of stimulating the mammalian innate immune system is via Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) being exposed to unmethylated cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) DNA, also known as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) of microbial origin. Synthetic CpG oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) with defined CpG motifs possess broad immunostimulatory properties that make CpG ODNs suitable as therapeutic interventions in a variety of human disease conditions, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Rodent models are often used to preclinically test the effectiveness of CpG ODN therapeutic agents for AD and other disorders. However, the translatability of findings in such models is limited due to the significant difference of the expression of TLR9 between primates and rodents. The squirrel monkey (SQM), a New World non-human primate (NHP), is known to be phylogenetically proximate to humans, and develops extensive age-dependent cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), a key pathological feature of AD. Hence, this model is currently being used to test AD therapeutics. In the present study, we conducted the first examination of Class C CpG ODN’s immunomodulatory role in elderly SQMs. We documented the effectiveness of CpG ODN to trigger an immune response in an aged cohort whose immune system is senescent. The specific immune response patterns detected here closely resembled CpG ODN-induced immunostimulatory patterns observed in prior human studies. Overall, our findings provide critical data regarding the immunomodulatory potential of CpG ODN in this NHP model, allowing for future translational studies of innate immunity stimulation via TLR9 agonists for diverse indications, including AD therapeutics.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/53530">New approach for membrane protein reconstitution into peptidiscs and basis for their adaptability to different proteins</a></h4>

Previously we introduced peptidiscs as an alternative to detergents to stabilize membrane proteins in solution (Carlson et al., 2018). Here, we present ‘on-gradient’ reconstitution, a new gentle approach for the reconstitution of labile membrane-protein complexes, and used it to reconstitute <i>Rhodobacter sphaeroides</i> reaction center complexes, demonstrating that peptidiscs can adapt to transmembrane domains of very different sizes and shapes. Using the conventional ‘on-bead’ approach, we reconstituted <i>Escherichia coli</i> proteins MsbA and MscS and find that peptidiscs stabilize them in their native conformation and allow for high-resolution structure determination by cryo-electron microscopy. The structures reveal that peptidisc peptides can arrange around transmembrane proteins differently, thus revealing the structural basis for why peptidiscs can stabilize such a large variety of membrane proteins. Together, our results establish the gentle and easy-to-use peptidiscs as a potentially universal alternative to detergents as a means to stabilize membrane proteins in solution for structural and functional studies.

A vaccine protective against diverse HCV variants is needed to control the HCV epidemic. Structures of E2 complexes with front layer-specific broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) isolated from HCV-infected individuals, revealed a disulfide bond-containing CDRH3 that adopts straight (individuals who clear infection) or bent (individuals with chronic infection) conformation. To investigate whether a straight versus bent disulfide bond-containing CDRH3 is specific to particular HCV-infected individuals, we solved a crystal structure of the HCV E2 ectodomain in complex with AR3X, a bNAb with an unusually long CDRH2 that was isolated from the chronically-infected individual from whom the bent CDRH3 bNAbs were derived. The structure revealed that AR3X utilizes both its ultralong CDRH2 and a disulfide motif-containing straight CDRH3 to recognize the E2 front layer. These results demonstrate that both the straight and bent CDRH3 classes of HCV bNAb can be elicited in a single individual, revealing a structural plasticity of <i>VH1-69</i>-derived bNAbs.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/52570">p16 deficiency attenuates intervertebral disc degeneration by adjusting oxidative stress and nucleus pulposus cell cycle</a></h4>

Cell cycle regulator p16 is known a biomarker and an effector of aging. However, its function in intervertebral disc degeneration (IVDD) is unclear. In this study, p16 expression levels were found positively correlated with severity of human IVDD. In a mouse tail suspension (TS)-induced IVDD model, lumbar intervertebral disc height index and matrix protein expression levels were reduced significantly were largely rescued by p16 deletion. In TS mouse discs, reactive oxygen species levels, proportions of senescent cells, and senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) were increased; cell cycling was delayed; and expression was downregulated for Sirt1, superoxide dismutase 1/2, cyclin-dependent kinases 4/6, phosphorylated retinoblastoma protein, and transcription factor E2F1/2. However, these effects were rescued by p16 deletion. Our results demonstrate that p16 plays an important role in IVDD pathogenesis and that its deletion attenuates IVDD by promoting cell cycling and inhibiting SASP, cell senescence, and oxidative stress.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/52539">SLAMF6 deficiency augments tumor killing and skews towards an effector phenotype revealing it as a novel T cell checkpoint</a></h4>

SLAMF6 is a homotypic receptor of the Ig-superfamily whose exact role in immune modulation has remained elusive. Its constitutive expression on resting and activated T cells precludes it from being a <i>bona fide</i> exhaustion marker. By breeding Pmel-1 mice with SLAMF6 -/- mice, we generated donors for T cells lacking SLAMF6 and expressing a transgenic TCR for gp100-melanoma antigen. Activated Pmel-1xSLAMF6 -/- CD8+ T cells displayed improved polyfunctionality and strong tumor cytolysis. T-bet was the dominant transcription factor in Pmel-1 x SLAMF6 -/- cells, and upon activation, they acquired an effector-memory phenotype. Adoptive transfer of Pmel-1 x SLAMF6 -/- T cells to melanoma-bearing mice resulted in lasting tumor regression in contrast to temporary responses achieved with Pmel-1 T cells. LAG-3 expression was elevated in the SLAMF6 -/- cells, and the addition of the LAG-3-blocking antibody to the adoptive transfer protocol improved the SLAMF6 -/- T cells and expedited the anti-tumor response even further. The results from this study support the notion that SLAMF6 is an inhibitory immune receptor whose absence enables powerful CD8+ T cells to eradicate tumors.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/52420">Lamina-specific AMPA receptor dynamics following visual deprivation in vivo</a></h4>

Regulation of AMPA receptor (AMPAR) expression is central to synaptic plasticity and brain function, but how these changes occur in vivo remains elusive. Here, we developed a method to longitudinally monitor the expression of synaptic AMPARs across multiple cortical layers in awake mice using two-photon imaging. We observed that baseline AMPAR expression in individual spines is highly dynamic with more dynamics in primary visual cortex (V1) layer 2/3 (L2/3) neurons than V1 L5 neurons. Visual deprivation through binocular enucleation induces a synapse-specific and depth-dependent change of synaptic AMPARs in V1 L2/3 neurons, wherein deep synapses are potentiated more than superficial synapses. The increase is specific to L2/3 neurons and absent on apical dendrites of L5 neurons, and is dependent on expression of the AMPAR-binding protein GRIP1. Our study demonstrates that specific neuronal connections, across cortical layers and even within individual neurons, respond uniquely to changes in sensory experience.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/52411">Mushroom body evolution demonstrates homology and divergence across Pancrustacea</a></h4>

Descriptions of crustacean brains have focused mainly on three highly derived lineages of malacostracans: the reptantian infraorders represented by spiny lobsters, lobsters, and crayfish. Those descriptions advocate the view that dome- or cap-like neuropils, referred to as ‘hemiellipsoid bodies,’ are the ground pattern organization of centers that are comparable to insect mushroom bodies in processing olfactory information. Here we challenge the doctrine that hemiellipsoid bodies are a derived trait of crustaceans, whereas mushroom bodies are a derived trait of hexapods. We demonstrate that mushroom bodies typify lineages that arose before Reptantia and exist in Reptantia thereby indicating that the mushroom body, not the hemiellipsoid body, provides the ground pattern for both crustaceans and hexapods. We show that evolved variations of the mushroom body ground pattern are, in some lineages, defined by extreme diminution or loss and, in others, by the incorporation of mushroom body circuits into lobeless centers. Such transformations are ascribed to modifications of the columnar organization of mushroom body lobes that, as shown in <i>Drosophila</i> and other hexapods, contain networks essential for learning and memory.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/52330">Tumors attenuating the mitochondrial activity in T cells escape from PD-1 blockade therapy</a></h4>

PD-1 blockade therapy has revolutionized cancer treatments. However, a substantial population of patients is unresponsive. To rescue unresponsive patients, the mechanism of unresponsiveness to PD-1 blockade therapy must be elucidated. Using a 'bilateral tumor model' where responsive and unresponsive tumors were inoculated into different sides of the mouse belly, we demonstrated that unresponsive tumors can be categorized into two groups: with and without systemic immunosuppressive property (SIP). The SIP-positive tumors released uncharacterized, non-proteinaceous small molecules that inhibited T cell proliferation and mitochondrial activation. By contrast, the SIP-negative B16 tumor escaped from immunity by losing MHC class I expression. Unresponsiveness of SIP-positive tumors was partially overcome by improving the mitochondrial function with a mitochondrial activator; this was not successful for B16, which employs immune ignorance. These results demonstrated that 'bilateral tumor model' was useful for stratifying tumors to investigate the mechanism of unresponsiveness and develop a strategy for proper combination therapy.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/52014">A neurobiological association of revenge propensity during intergroup conflict</a></h4>

Revenge during intergroup conflict is a human universal, but its neurobiological underpinnings remain unclear. We address this by integrating functional MRI and measurements of endogenous oxytocin in participants who view an ingroup and an outgroup member's suffering that is caused mutually (Revenge group) or respectively by a computer (Control group). We show that intergroup conflict encountered by the Revenge group is associated with an increased level of oxytocin in saliva compared to in the Control group. Furthermore, the medial prefrontal activity in response to ingroup pain in the Revenge but not Control group mediates the association between endogenous oxytocin and the propensity to give painful electric shocks to outgroup members regardless of whether they were directly involved in the conflict. Our findings highlight an important neurobiological correlate of revenge propensity which may be implicated in conflict contagion across individuals in the context of intergroup conflict.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/51784">Cortical encoding of melodic expectations in human temporal cortex</a></h4>

Humans engagement in music rests on underlying elements such as the listeners’ cultural background and interest in music. These factors modulate how listeners anticipate musical events, a process inducing instantaneous neural responses as the music confronts these expectations. Measuring such neural correlates would represent a direct window into high-level brain processing. Here we recorded cortical signals as participants listened to Bach melodies. We assessed the relative contributions of acoustic <i>versus</i> melodic components of the music to the neural signal. Melodic features included information on pitch progressions and their tempo, which were extracted from a predictive model of musical structure based on Markov chains. We related the music to brain activity with temporal response functions demonstrating, for the first time, distinct cortical encoding of pitch and note-onset expectations during naturalistic music listening. This encoding was most pronounced at response latencies up to 350 ms, and in both <i>planum temporale</i> and <i>Heschl’s gyrus</i>.

Although mTOR signaling is known as a broad regulator of cell growth and proliferation, in neurons it regulates synaptic transmission, which is thought to be a major mechanism through which altered mTOR signaling leads to neurological disease. Although previous studies have delineated postsynaptic roles for mTOR, whether it regulates presynaptic function is largely unknown. Moreover, the mTOR kinase operates in two complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2, suggesting that mTOR's role in synaptic transmission may be complex-specific. To better understand their roles in synaptic transmission, we genetically inactivated mTORC1 or mTORC2 in cultured mouse glutamatergic hippocampal neurons. Inactivation of either complex reduced neuron growth and evoked EPSCs (eEPSCs), however, the effects of mTORC1 on eEPSCs were postsynaptic and the effects of mTORC2 were presynaptic. Despite postsynaptic inhibition of evoked release, mTORC1 inactivation enhanced spontaneous vesicle fusion and replenishment, suggesting that mTORC1 and mTORC2 differentially modulate postsynaptic responsiveness and presynaptic release to optimize glutamatergic synaptic transmission.

Phylogenetic relationships among extinct hominoids (apes and humans) are controversial due to pervasive homoplasy and the incompleteness of the fossil record. The bony labyrinth might contribute to this debate, as it displays strong phylogenetic signal among other mammals. However, the potential of the vestibular apparatus for phylogenetic reconstruction among fossil apes remains understudied. Here we test and quantify the phylogenetic signal embedded in the vestibular morphology of extant anthropoids (monkeys, apes and humans) and two extinct apes (<i>Oreopithecus</i> and <i>Australopithecus</i>) as captured by a deformation-based 3D geometric morphometric analysis. We also reconstruct the ancestral morphology of various hominoid clades based on phylogenetically-informed maximum likelihood methods. Besides revealing strong phylogenetic signal in the vestibule and enabling the proposal of potential synapomorphies for various hominoid clades, our results confirm the relevance of vestibular morphology for addressing the controversial phylogenetic relationships of fossil apes.

Relapse often occurs when individuals are exposed to stimuli or cues previously associated with the drug-taking experience. The ability of drug cues to trigger relapse is believed to be a consequence of incentive salience attribution, a process in which the incentive value of reward is transferred to the reward-paired cue. Sign-tracker (ST) rats that attribute enhanced incentive value to reward cues are more prone to relapse compared to goal-tracker (GT) rats that primarily attribute predictive value to such cues. The neurobiological mechanisms underlying this individual variation in relapse propensity remains largely unexplored. The paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (PVT) has been identified as a critical node in the regulation of cue-elicited behaviors in STs and GTs, including cue-induced reinstatement of drug-seeking behavior. Here we used a chemogenetic approach to assess whether top-down cortical input from the prelimbic cortex (PrL) to the PVT plays a role in mediating individual differences in relapse propensity. Chemogenetic inhibition of the PrL-PVT pathway differentially affected neuronal activity (i.e. Fos) in the PVT in STs compared to GTs. This manipulation also selectively decreased cue-induced reinstatement of drug-seeking behavior in STs, without affecting behavior in GTs. In contrast, cocaine-primed drug-seeking behavior was unaffected in both phenotypes. These results highlight an important role for the PrL-PVT circuit in mediating individual differences in cue-induced reinstatement of drug-seeking behavior, or relapse propensity.

Rationale: Prior research suggests that inputs from the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) to the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (PVT) contribute to the attribution of incentive salience to Pavlovian-conditioned reward cues. However, a causal role for the LHA in this phenomenon has not been demonstrated. In addition, it is unknown which hypothalamic neurotransmitter or peptide system(s) are involved in mediating incentive salience attribution. Objectives: To examine: 1) the role of the LHA in the propensity to attribute incentive salience to reward cues, and 2) the role of orexinergic signaling in the PVT on the expression of Pavlovian conditioned approach (PavCA) behavior, a reflection of incentive salience attribution. Methods: Male Sprague-Dawley rats received bilateral excitotoxic lesions of the LHA prior to the acquisition of Pavlovian conditioned approach (PavCA) behavior. A separate cohort of male rats acquired PavCA behavior and were characterized as sign-trackers (STs) or goal-trackers (GTs) based on their conditioned response. The orexin 1 receptor (OX1r) antagonist SB-334867, or the orexin 2 receptor (OX2r) antagonist TCS-OX2-29, were then administered directly into the PVT to assess the effects of these pharmacological agents on the expression of PavCA behavior and on the conditioned reinforcing properties of the Pavlovian reward cue. Results: Lesions of the LHA before training attenuated the development of lever-directed (sign-tracking) behaviors in the PavCA paradigm, without affecting magazine-directed (goal-tracking) behaviors. Administration of the OX1r antagonist into the PVT reduced lever-directed behaviors and increased magazine-directed behaviors in STs; while administration of the OX2r antagonist only reduced lever-directed behaviors. Further, OX2r, but not OX1r, antagonism was able to reduce the incentive motivational value of the conditioned stimulus on a conditioned reinforcement test in STs. The behavior of GTs was unaffected by orexinergic antagonism in the PVT. Conclusions: The LHA is necessary for the attribution of incentive salience to reward cues and, thereby, the development of a sign-tracking conditioned response. Furthermore, blockade of orexin signaling in the PVT attenuates the incentive value of a Pavlovian reward cue. These data suggest that hypothalamic orexin inputs to the PVT are a key component of the circuitry that encodes the incentive motivational value of reward cues and promotes maladaptive cue-driven behaviors.

In the last years, the interpretation of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neuropeptide superfamily has changed tremendously. One main driver is the investigation of functions and evolutionary lineage of previously identified molluscan GnRH molecules. Emerging evidence suggests not only reproductive, but also diverse biological effects of these molecules and proposes they should most likely be called corazonin (CRZ). Clearly, a more global understanding necessitates further exploration of species-specific functions and structure of invGnRH/CRZ peptides. Towards this goal, we have identified the full-length cDNA of invGnRH/CRZ peptide in an invertebrate model species, the great pond snail Lymnaea stagnalis, termed ly-GnRH/CRZ, and characterized the transcript and peptide distribution in the central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral organs. Our results are consistent with previous data that molluscan GnRHs are more related to CRZs and serve diverse functions. For this, our findings support the notion that peptides originally termed molluscan GnRH are multifunctional modulators and that nomenclature change should be taken into consideration.

<p>by Barbara Bravi, Riccardo Ravasio, Carolina Brito, Matthieu Wyart</p>

In allosteric proteins, the binding of a ligand modifies function at a distant active site. Such allosteric pathways can be used as target for drug design, generating considerable interest in inferring them from sequence alignment data. Currently, different methods lead to conflicting results, in particular on the existence of long-range evolutionary couplings between distant amino-acids mediating allostery. Here we propose a resolution of this conundrum, by studying epistasis and its inference in models where an allosteric material is evolved <i>in silico</i> to perform a mechanical task. We find that in our model the four types of epistasis (Synergistic, Sign, Antagonistic, Saturation), which can be both short or long-range and have a simple mechanical interpretation. We perform a Direct Coupling Analysis (DCA) and find that DCA predicts well the cost of point mutations but is a rather poor generative model. Strikingly, it can predict short-range epistasis but fails to capture long-range epistasis, in consistence with empirical findings. We propose that such failure is generic when function requires subparts to work in concert. We illustrate this idea with a simple model, which suggests that other methods may be better suited to capture long-range effects.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/O_qve59Df_g" width="1" />

The evolution of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) poses a persistent threat to global public health. Sequencing efforts have already yielded genome sequences for thousands of resistant microbial isolates and require robust computational tools to systematically elucidate the genetic basis for AMR. Here, we present a generalizable machine learning workflow for identifying genetic features driving AMR based on constructing reference strain-agnostic pan-genomes and training random subspace ensembles (RSEs). This workflow was applied to the resistance profiles of 14 antimicrobials across three urgent threat pathogens encompassing 288 <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>, 456 <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>, and 1588 <i>Escherichia coli</i> genomes. We find that feature selection by RSE detects known AMR associations more reliably than common statistical tests and previous ensemble approaches, identifying a total of 45 known AMR-conferring genes and alleles across the three organisms, as well as 25 candidate associations backed by domain-level annotations. Furthermore, we find that results from the RSE approach are consistent with existing understanding of fluoroquinolone (FQ) resistance due to mutations in the main drug targets, <i>gyrA</i> and <i>parC</i>, in all three organisms, and suggest the mutational landscape of those genes with respect to FQ resistance is simple. As larger datasets become available, we expect this approach to more reliably predict AMR determinants for a wider range of microbial pathogens.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/xr9hwylhAMM" width="1" />

Intracellular calcium ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>) is a basic and ubiquitous cellular signal controlling a wide variety of biological processes. A remarkable example is the steering of sea urchin spermatozoa towards the conspecific egg by a spatially and temporally orchestrated series of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> spikes. Although this process has been an experimental paradigm for reproduction and sperm chemotaxis studies, the composition and regulation of the signalling network underlying the cytosolic calcium fluctuations are hitherto not fully understood. Here, we used a differential equations model of the signalling network to assess which set of channels can explain the characteristic envelope and temporal organisation of the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>-spike trains. The signalling network comprises an initial membrane hyperpolarisation produced by an Upstream module triggered by the egg-released chemoattractant peptide, via receptor activation, cGMP synthesis and decay. Followed by downstream modules leading to intraflagellar pH (pH<sub>i</sub>), voltage and [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> fluctuations. The Upstream module outputs were fitted to kinetic data on cGMP activity and early membrane potential changes measured in bulk cell populations. Two candidate modules featuring voltage-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup>-channels link these outputs to the downstream dynamics and can independently explain the typical decaying envelope and the progressive spacing of the spikes. In the first module, [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>-spike trains require the concerted action of a classical Ca<sub>V</sub>-like channel and a potassium channel, BK (Slo1), whereas the second module relies on pH<sub>i</sub>-dependent CatSper dynamics articulated with voltage-dependent neutral sodium-proton exchanger (NHE). We analysed the dynamics of these two modules alone and in mixed scenarios. We show that the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> dynamics observed experimentally after sustained alkalinisation can be reproduced by a model featuring the CatSper and NHE module but not by those including the pH-independent Ca<sub>V</sub> and BK module or proportionate mixed scenarios. We conclude in favour of the module containing CatSper and NHE and highlight experimentally testable predictions that would corroborate this conclusion.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/zuv9p2HQYTw" width="1" />

Targeted cancer therapies are powerful alternatives to chemotherapies or can be used complementary to these. Yet, the response to targeted treatments depends on a variety of factors, including mutations and expression levels, and therefore their outcome is difficult to predict. Here, we develop a mechanistic model of gastric cancer to study response and resistance factors for cetuximab treatment. The model captures the EGFR, ERK and AKT signaling pathways in two gastric cancer cell lines with different mutation patterns. We train the model using a comprehensive selection of time and dose response measurements, and provide an assessment of parameter and prediction uncertainties. We demonstrate that the proposed model facilitates the identification of causal differences between the cell lines. Furthermore, our study shows that the model provides predictions for the responses to different perturbations, such as knockdown and knockout experiments. Among other results, the model predicted the effect of MET mutations on cetuximab sensitivity. These predictive capabilities render the model a basis for the assessment of gastric cancer signaling and possibly for the development and discovery of predictive biomarkers.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/2rcnlJ9WLEM" width="1" />

Abstract<p>Sleep spindles are distinctive transient patterns of brain activity that typically occur during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep in humans and other mammals. Thought to be important for the consolidation of learning, they may also be useful for indicating the progression of aging and neurodegenerative diseases. The aim of this study was to characterise sleep spindles in sheep (<i>Ovis aries</i>). We recorded electroencephalographs (EEG) wirelessly from 6 sheep over a continuous period containing two nights and a day. We detected and characterised spindles using an automated algorithm. We found that sheep sleep spindles fell within the classical range seen in humans (10- 16 Hz), but we did not see a further separation into fast and slow bands. Spindles were detected predominantly during NREM sleep. Spindle characteristics (frequency, duration, density, topography) varied between individuals, but were similar within individuals between nights. Spindles that occurred during NREM sleep in daytime were indistinguishable from those found during NREM sleep at night. Surprisingly, we also detected numerous spindle-like events during unequivocal periods of wake during the day. These events were mainly local (detected at single sites) and their characteristics differed from spindles detected during sleep. These ‘wake spindles’ are likely to be events that are commonly categorised as ‘spontaneous alpha activity’ during wake. We speculate that wake and sleep spindles are generated via different mechanisms, and that wake spindles play a role in cognitive processes that occur during the daytime.</p><p><b>Statement of Significance</b> Sleep spindles provide an indication of brain health and function. In this study we characterise sleep spindles in sheep (<i>Ovis aries</i>) for the first time. We found that sleep spindles in sheep are similar to those found in humans in many respects (such as density, duration and frequency) and occurred mainly during NREM sleep. Interestingly however, we also saw spindles during wake in the day. Spindles detected during wake were characteristically distinct from those occurring during sleep. We suggest that wake and sleep spindles are generated via different mechanisms and may have different functional roles. Wake spindles may be a component of cognitive processes that occur during the daytime, such as memory retrieval and attention.</p>

Abstract<p>Humans have a large capacity of recognition memory (Dudai, 1997), a fundamental property of higher-order brain functions such as abstraction and generalization (Vogt &amp; Magnussen, 2007). Familiarity is the first step towards recognition memory. We have previously demonstrated using unsupervised neural network simulations that familiarity detection of complex patterns emerges in generic cortical microcircuits with bidirectional synaptic plasticity. It is therefore meaningful to conduct similar experiments on biological neuronal networks to validate these results. Studies of learning and memory in dissociated rodent neuronal cultures remain inconclusive to date. Synchronized network bursts (SNBs) that occur spontaneously and periodically have been speculated to be an intervening factor. By optogenetically stimulating cultured cortical networks with random dot movies, we were able to reduce the occurrence of SNBs, after which an ability for familiarity detection emerged: previously seen patterns elicited higher firing rates than novel ones. Differences in firing rate were distributed over the entire network, suggesting that familiarity detection is a system level property. We also studied the change in SNB patterns following familiarity encoding. Support Vector Machine classification results indicate that SNBs may be facilitating memory consolidation of the learned pattern. In addition, using a novel network connectivity probing method, we were able to trace the change in synaptic efficacy induced by familiarity encoding, providing insights on the long-term impact of having SNBs in the cultures.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Studies of memory mechanisms in neuronal networks formed by cultured neurons have been complicated by spontaneously occurring synchronized network bursts (SNBs), which prevent encoding of stimulus information. We have developed an optogenetic method to suppress SNBs using random dot stimuli, which allowed us to demonstrate the ability of cultured cortical networks to detect a familiar input. Whereas SNBs interfere with familiarity encoding, they may facilitate memory consolidation. These results indicate that generic cortical microcircuits have an innate ability for familiarity detection, a form of recognition memory.</p>

Abstract
<p>In contrast to neurons in the CNS, damaged neurons from the peripheral nervous system (PNS) regenerate, but this process can be slow and imperfect. Successful regeneration is orchestrated by cytoskeletal reorganization at the tip of the proximal axon segment and cytoskeletal disassembly of the distal segment. Collapsin response mediator protein 4 (CRMP4) is a cytosolic phospho-protein that regulates the actin and microtubule cytoskeleton. During development, CRMP4 promotes growth cone formation and dendrite development. Paradoxically, in the adult CNS, CRMP4 impedes axon regeneration. Here, we investigated the involvement of CRMP4 in peripheral nerve injury in male and female <i>Crmp4<sup>–/–</sup></i> mice following sciatic nerve injury. We find that sensory axon regeneration and Wallerian degeneration are impaired in <i>Crmp4<sup>–/–</sup></i> mice following sciatic nerve injury. <i>In vitro</i> analysis of dissociated dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons from <i>Crmp4<sup>–/–</sup></i> mice revealed that CRMP4 functions in the proximal axon segment to promote the regrowth of severed DRG neurons and in the distal axon segment where it facilitates Wallerian degeneration through calpain-dependent formation of harmful CRMP4 fragments. These findings reveal an interesting dual role for CRMP4 in proximal and distal axon segments of injured sensory neurons that coordinately facilitate PNS axon regeneration.</p>

<p>This paper shows that ResNets, NeuralODEs, and CT-RNNs, are particular neural
regulatory networks (NRNs), a biophysical model for the nonspiking neurons
encountered in small species, such as the C.elegans nematode, and in the retina
of large species. Compared to ResNets, NeuralODEs and CT-RNNs, NRNs have an
additional multiplicative term in their synaptic computation, allowing them to
adapt to each particular input. This additional flexibility makes NRNs $M$
times more succinct than NeuralODEs and CT-RNNs, where $M$ is proportional to
the size of the training set. Moreover, as NeuralODEs and CT-RNNs are $N$ times
more succinct than ResNets, where $N$ is the number of integration steps
required to compute the output $F(x)$ for a given input $x$, NRNs are in total
$M\,{\cdot}\,N$ more succinct than ResNets. For a given approximation task,
this considerable succinctness allows to learn a very small and therefore
understandable NRN, whose behavior can be explained in terms of well
established architectural motifs, that NRNs share with gene regulatory
networks, such as, activation, inhibition, sequentialization, mutual exclusion,
and synchronization. To the best of our knowledge, this paper unifies for the
first time the mainstream work on deep neural networks with the one in biology
and neuroscience in a quantitative fashion.

<p>We investigate the possible influence of poly unsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs)
in the lipid bilayer of cell membranes on the conduction properties of the
selectivity filter of voltage gated ion channels. Any change of this
conductivity can have major consequences on electrical signalling in brain and
other cells. At the microscopic level a change in the concentration of PUFAs
can cause a change in the pressure distribution within the lipid bilayer, and
this in turn can lead to a change in the length of the selectivity filter. In
order to estimate the consequences this might entail for the ion channel's
conductivity we performed high resolution molecular dynamics (MD) simulations
of the passage of K+ ions and H2O molecules through the selectivity filter of
the KcsA potassium ion channel. Our results show that a change in length of the
selectivity filter of as little as 4%, independent of whether the filter is
made longer or shorter, will reduce the K+ ion current by around 50%. And
further squeezing or stretching by about 10% can effectively stop the current.
For instructive purposes and to facilitate further interpretation of the
results, we give details of the force models employed in the MD simulations. We
finally discuss the present results in the context of possible effects of
membrane lipid compositions on Kv ion permeation.

<p>Electrical and chemical synapses shape the dynamics of neural networks and
their functional roles in information processing has been an important question
in neurobiology. In this paper, we investigate the role of synapses on the
optimization of the phenomenon of self-induced stochastic resonance in a
delayed multiplex neural network. We consider a two-layer multiplex network, in
which at the intra-layer level neurons are coupled either by electrical
synapses or by inhibitory chemical synapses. For each isolated layer, numerical
computations indicate that weaker electrical and chemical synaptic couplings
are better optimizers of self-induced stochastic resonance. In addition,
regardless of the synaptic strengths, shorter electrical synaptic delays are
found to be better optimizers of the phenomenon than shorter chemical synaptic
delays, while longer chemical synaptic delays are a better optimizers than
longer electrical synaptic delays - in both cases, the poorer optimizers are in
fact worst. It is found that electrical, inhibitory, or excitatory chemical
multiplexing of the two layers having only electrical synapses at the
intra-layer levels can each optimize the phenomenon. And only excitatory
chemical multiplexing of the two layers having only inhibitory chemical
synapses at the intra-layer levels can optimize the phenomenon. These results
should guide experiments aimed at confirming the mechanism of stochastic
self-induced resonance in real biological neural networks.

<p>Neonatal brain development relies on a combination of critical factors inclusive of genetic predisposition, attachment, and the conditions of the pre and postneonatal environment. The status of the infant’s developing brain in its most vulnerable state and the impact that physiological elements of music, silences and sounds may make in the earliest stages of brain development can enhance vitality. However, little attention has been focused on the integral aspects of the music itself. This article will support research that has hypothesized conditions of music therapeutic applications in an effort to further validate models of neurobehavioral care that have optimized conditions for growth, inclusive of recommendations leading toward the enhancement of self-regulatory behaviors.</p>

<p>Robust cross-subject emotion recognition based on multichannel EEG has always been hard work. In this work, we hypothesize that there exist default brain variables across subjects in emotional processes. Hence, the states of the latent variables that relate to emotional processing must contribute to building robust recognition models. Specifically, we propose to utilize an unsupervised deep generative model (e.g., variational autoencoder) to determine the latent factors from the multichannel EEG. Through a sequence modeling method, we examine the emotion recognition performance based on the learnt latent factors. The performance of the proposed methodology is verified on two public datasets (DEAP and SEED) and compared with traditional matrix factorization-based (ICA) and autoencoder-based approaches. Experimental results demonstrate that autoencoder-like neural networks are suitable for unsupervised EEG modeling, and our proposed emotion recognition framework achieves an inspiring performance. As far as we know, it is the first work that introduces variational autoencoder into multichannel EEG decoding for emotion recognition. We think the approach proposed in this work is not only feasible in emotion recognition but also promising in diagnosing depression, Alzheimer's disease, mild cognitive impairment, etc., whose specific latent processes may be altered or aberrant compared with the normal healthy control.</p>

<p>Dihydroartemisinin (DHA) is an active metabolite of sesquiterpene trioxane lactone extracted from Artemisia annua, which is used to treat malaria worldwide. DHA can activate autophagy, which is the main mechanism to remove the damaged cell components and recover the harmful or useless substances from eukaryotic cells and maintain cell viability through the autophagy lysosomal degradation system. Autophagy activation and autophagy flux correction are playing an important neuroprotective role in the central nervous system, as they accelerate the removal of toxic protein aggregates intracellularly and extracellularly to prevent neurodegenerative processes, such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD). In this study, we explored whether this mechanism can mediate the neuroprotective effect of DHA on the AD model in vitro and in vivo. Three months of DHA treatment improved the memory and cognitive impairment, reduced the deposition of amyloid β plaque, reduced the levels of Aβ40 and Aβ42, and ameliorated excessive neuron apoptosis in APP/PS1 mice brain. In addition, DHA treatment increased the level of LC3 II/I and decreased the expression of p62. After Bafilomycin A1 and Chloroquine (CQ) blocked the fusion of autophagy and lysosome, as well as the degradation of autolysosomes (ALs), DHA treatment increased the level of LC3 II/I and decreased the expression of p62. These results suggest that DHA treatment can correct autophagic flux, improve autophagy dysfunction, inhibit abnormal death of neurons, promote the clearance of amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) fibrils, and have a multi-target effect on the neuropathological process, memory and cognitive deficits of AD.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/54841">Enhanced ER-associated degradation of HMG CoA reductase causes embryonic lethality associated with <i>Ubiad1</i> deficiency</a></h4>

UbiA prenyltransferase domain-containing protein-1 (UBIAD1) catalyzes synthesis of the vitamin K subtype menaquinone-4 (MK-4). Previous studies in cultured cells (Schumacher et al. 2015) revealed that UBIAD1 also inhibits endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated degradation (ERAD) of ubiquitinated HMG CoA reductase (HMGCR), the rate-limiting enzyme of the mevalonate pathway that produces cholesterol and essential nonsterol isoprenoids. Gene knockout studies were previously attempted to explore the function of UBIAD1 in mice; however, homozygous germ-line elimination of the <i>Ubiad1</i> gene caused embryonic lethality. We now report that homozygous deletion of <i>Ubiad1</i> is produced in knockin mice expressing ubiquitination/ERAD-resistant HMGCR. Thus, embryonic lethality of <i>Ubiad1</i> deficiency results from depletion of mevalonate-derived products owing to enhanced ERAD of HMGCR rather than from reduced synthesis of MK-4. These findings provide genetic evidence for the significance of UBIAD1 in regulation of cholesterol synthesis and offer the opportunity in future studies for the discovery of new physiological roles of MK-4.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/54556">Different CFTR modulator combinations downregulate inflammation differently in cystic fibrosis</a></h4>

Previously we showed that serum and monocytes from patients with CF exhibit an enhanced NLRP3-inflammasome signature with increased IL-18, IL-1β, caspase-1 activity and ASC speck release (Scambler et al., eLife 2019). Here we show that CFTR modulators down regulate this exaggerated proinflammatory response following LPS/ATP stimulation. <i>In vitro</i> application of ivacaftor/lumacaftor or ivacaftor/tezacaftor to CF monocytes showed a significant reduction in IL-18, whereas IL-1β was only reduced with ivacaftor/tezacaftor. Thirteen adults starting ivacaftor/lumacaftor and eight starting ivacaftor/tezacaftor were assessed over three months. Serum IL-18 and TNF decreased significantly with treatments, but IL-1β only declined following ivacaftor/tezacaftor. In (LPS/ATP-stimulated) PBMCs, IL-18/TNF/caspase-1 were all significantly decreased and IL-10 was increased with both combinations. Ivacaftor/tezacaftor alone showed a significant reduction in IL-1β and pro-IL-1β mRNA. This study demonstrates that these CFTR modulator combinations have potent anti-inflammatory properties, in addition to their ability to stimulate CFTR function, which could contribute to improved clinical outcomes.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/53779">Structure-based discovery of potent and selective melatonin receptor agonists</a></h4>

Melatonin receptors MT<sub>1</sub> and MT<sub>2</sub> are involved in synchronizing circadian rhythms and are important targets for treating sleep and mood disorders, type-2 diabetes and cancer. Here, we performed large scale structure-based virtual screening for new ligand chemotypes using recently solved high-resolution 3D crystal structures of agonist-bound MT receptors. Experimental testing of 62 screening candidates yielded the discovery of 10 new agonist chemotypes with sub-micromolar potency at MT receptors, with compound 21 reaching EC<sub>50</sub> of 0.36 nM. Six of these molecules displayed selectivity for MT<sub>2</sub> over MT<sub>1</sub>. Moreover, two most potent agonists, including 21 and a close derivative of melatonin 28, had dramatically reduced arrestin recruitment at MT<sub>2</sub>, while compound 37 was devoid of G<sub>i</sub> signaling at MT<sub>1</sub>, implying biased signaling. This study validates the suitability of the agonist-bound orthosteric pocket in the MT receptor structures for the structure-based discovery of selective agonists.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/51685"><i>C9orf72</i> arginine-rich dipeptide repeat proteins disrupt karyopherin-mediated nuclear import</a></h4>

Disruption of nucleocytoplasmic transport is increasingly implicated in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, including ALS caused by a <i>C9orf72</i> hexanucleotide repeat expansion. However, the mechanism(s) remain unclear. Karyopherins, including importin β and its cargo adaptors, have been shown to co-precipitate with the <i>C9orf72</i> arginine-containing dipeptide repeat proteins (R-DPRs), poly-glycine arginine (GR) and poly-proline arginine (PR), and are protective in genetic modifier screens. Here, we show that R-DPRs interact with importin β, disrupt its cargo loading, and inhibit nuclear import of importin β, importin α/β, and transportin cargoes in permeabilized mouse neurons and HeLa cells, in a manner that can be rescued by RNA. Although R-DPRs induce widespread protein aggregation in this in vitro system, transport disruption is not due to nucleocytoplasmic transport protein sequestration, nor blockade of the phenylalanine-glycine (FG)-rich nuclear pore complex. Our results support a model in which R-DPRs interfere with cargo loading on karyopherins.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/51102">A novel role for lipoxin A4 in driving a lymph node-eye axis that controls autoimmunity to the neuroretina</a></h4>

The eicosanoid lipoxin A<sub>4 </sub>(LXA<sub>4</sub>) has emerging roles in lymphocyte-driven diseases. We identified reduced LXA<sub>4</sub> levels in posterior segment uveitis patients and investigated the role of LXA<sub>4</sub> in the pathogenesis of experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU). Immunization for EAU with a retinal self-antigen caused selective downregulation of LXA<sub>4</sub> in lymph nodes draining the site of immunization, while at the same time amplifying LXA<sub>4</sub> in the inflamed target tissue. T cell effector function, migration and glycolytic responses were amplified in LXA<sub>4</sub>-deficient mice, which correlated with more severe pathology, whereas LXA<sub>4</sub> treatment attenuated disease. <i>In vivo</i> deletion or supplementation of LXA<sub>4</sub> identified modulation of CC-chemokine receptor 7 (CCR7) and sphingosine 1- phosphate receptor-1 (S1PR1) expression and glucose metabolism in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells as potential mechanisms for LXA<sub>4</sub> regulation of T cell effector function and trafficking. Our results demonstrate the intrinsic lymph node LXA<sub>4</sub> pathway as a significant checkpoint in the development and severity of adaptive immunity.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/51065">A protein quality control pathway at the mitochondrial outer membrane</a></h4>

Maintaining the essential functions of mitochondria requires mechanisms to recognize and remove misfolded proteins. However, quality control (QC) pathways for misfolded mitochondrial proteins remain poorly-defined. Here, we establish temperature-sensitive (ts-) peripheral mitochondrial outer membrane (MOM) proteins as novel model QC substrates in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>. The ts- proteins sen2-1HA<sup>ts</sup> and sam35-2HA<sup>ts</sup> are degraded from the MOM by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Ubiquitination of sen2-1HA<sup>ts</sup> is mediated by the ubiquitin ligase (E3) Ubr1, while sam35-2HA<sup>ts</sup> is ubiquitinated primarily by San1. Mitochondria-associated degradation (MAD) of both substrates requires SSA family HSP70s and the HSP40 Sis1, providing the first evidence for chaperone involvement in MAD. In addition to a role for the Cdc48-Npl4-Ufd1 AAA-ATPase complex, Doa1 and a mitochondrial pool of the transmembrane Cdc48 adaptor, Ubx2, are implicated in their degradation. This study reveals a unique QC pathway comprised of a combination of cytosolic and mitochondrial factors that distinguish it from other cellular QC pathways.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/51035">Mannose receptor is an HIV restriction factor counteracted by Vpr in macrophages</a></h4>

HIV-1 Vpr is necessary for maximal HIV infection and spread in macrophages. Evolutionary conservation of Vpr suggests an important yet poorly understood role for macrophages in HIV pathogenesis. Vpr counteracts a previously unknown macrophage-specific restriction factor that targets and reduces the expression of HIV Env. Here, we report that the macrophage mannose receptor (MR), is a restriction factor targeting Env in primary human monocyte-derived macrophages. Vpr acts synergistically with HIV Nef to target distinct stages of the MR biosynthetic pathway and dramatically reduce MR expression. Silencing MR or deleting mannose residues on Env rescues Env expression in HIV-1-infected macrophages lacking Vpr. However, we also show that disrupting interactions between Env and MR reduces initial infection of macrophages by cell-free virus. Together these results reveal a Vpr-Nef-Env axis that hijacks a host mannose-MR response system to facilitate infection while evading MR’s normal role, which is to trap and destroy mannose-expressing pathogens.

Animals can respond differently to a sensory cue when in different states. Here, we show that certain odors repel well-fed Drosophila larvae but attract food-deprived larvae and how feeding state flexibly alters neural processing in an early olfactory circuit, the antennal lobe, to determine the behavioral valence of a sensory cue. Odor valence is assigned by a neuronal architecture that controls a switch between two separate projection neuron output pathways that mediate opposite behavioral responses. A uniglomerular projection neuron pathway mediates odor attraction whereas a multiglomerular projection neuron pathway mediates odor repulsion. The serotonergic CSD neuron in the antennal lobe is a critical regulator of this neuronal and behavioral switch. CSD selects an appropriate behavior by shifting patterns of serotonergic modulation and glutamatergic inhibition onto each output pathway. The antennal lobe is a decision-making circuit for innate behavioral responses that uses feeding state to determine an odor's valence.

The integration of neurons into networks relies on the formation of dendritic spines. These specialized structures arise from dynamic filopodia-like spiny protrusions. Recently, it was discovered that cortical neurons lacking the channel protein Pannexin 1 (Panx1) exhibited larger and more complicated neuronal networks, as well as, higher dendritic spine densities. Here, we expanded on those findings to investigate whether the increase in dendritic spine density associated with lack of Panx1 was due to differences in spine dynamics. Using a fluorescent membrane tag (mCherryCD9-10) to visualize spiny protrusions in developing neurons (at 10 days-in-vitro, DIV10) we confirmed that lack of Panx1 leads to higher spiny protrusion density while transient transfection of Panx1 leads to decreased spiny protrusion density. To quantify the impact of Panx1 expression on spiny protrusion formation, elimination, lability and motility, we used live cell imaging in DIV10 neurons (1 frame every 5 seconds for 10 minutes). We discovered, that at DIV10, lack of Panx1 stabilized cortical neuron spiny protrusions. Furthermore, transient expression of Panx1 in Panx1 knockout neurons resulted in a significant increase in spiny protrusion turnover and overall movement. In summary, these new data reveal that Panx1 regulates the development of dendritic spines by controlling protrusion dynamics.

KCC2 plays a critical role in determining the efficacy of synaptic inhibition and deficits in its activity lead to epilepsy and neurodevelopmental delay. Here we use unbiased proteomic analyses to demonstrate that KCC2 forms stable protein complexes in the neuronal plasma membrane with 96 autism and/or epilepsy risk gene (ASD/Epi) products including ANKB, ANKG, CNTN1, ITPR1, NCKAP1, SCN2A, SHANK3, SPTAN1, and SPTBN1. Many of these proteins are also targets of Fragile-X mental retardation protein (FMRP), the inactivation of which is the leading monogenic cause of autism. Accordingly, the expression of a subset of these KCC2-binding partners was decreased in Fmr1 knockout mice. Fmr1 knockout compromised KCC2 phosphorylation, a key regulatory mechanism for transporter activity and the postnatal development of GABAergic inhibition. Thus, KCC2 is a point of convergence for multiple ASD/Epi risk genes and therapies targeting this transporter may have broad utility in alleviating these heterogeneous disorders and their associated epilepsies.

Powerful neural measurement and perturbation tools have positioned mice as an ideal model species for probing the neural circuit mechanisms of cognition. Crucial to this success is the ability to motivate animals to perform specific behaviors. One successful strategy is to schedule their water intake, rewarding them with water during a behavioral task. However, water scheduling requires rigorous monitoring of animal's health and hydration status, and can be challenging for some animals. Here, we present an alternative that allows mice more control over their water intake: free home- cage access to water to which a small amount of Citric Acid (CA) has been added. CA makes water taste slightly sour, but still palatable. Mice reduce their intake of CA water while still maintaining a healthy weight. Home-cage access to CA water has only subtle impacts on their willingness to perform a decision-making task, in which they are rewarded with sweetened water. CA water is thus a promising alternative that allows animals more control over their water intake without interference to behavioral performance.

Alterations in the cortico-cerebellar-thalamic-cortical circuit might underlie the diversity of symptoms in schizophrenia. However, molecular changes in cerebellar neuronal circuits, part of this network, have not yet been fully determined. Using LC-MS/MS, we screened altered candidates in pooled grey matter of cerebellum from schizophrenia subjects who committed suicide (n=4) and healthy individuals (n=4). Further validation by immunoblotting of three selected candidates was performed in two cohorts comprising schizophrenia (n=20), non-schizophrenia suicide (n=6) and healthy controls (n=21). We found 99 significantly altered proteins, 31 of them previously reported in other brain areas by proteomic studies. Transport function was the most enriched category, while cell communication was the most prevalent function. For validation, we selected the vacuolar proton pump subunit 1 (VPP1), from transport, and two EF-hand calcium-binding proteins, calmodulin and parvalbumin from cell communication. All candidates showed significant changes in schizophrenia (n=7) compared to controls (n=7). VPP1 was altered in the non-schizophrenia suicide group and increased levels of parvalbumin were linked to antipsychotics. Further validation in an independent cohort of non-suicidal chronic schizophrenia subjects (n=13) and non-psychiatric controls (n=14) showed that parvalbumin was increased while calmodulin was decrease in schizophrenia. Our findings provide evidence of an dysregulation of calcium-binding proteins in the cerebellum in schizophrenia, suggesting an impact on normal calcium-dependent synaptic functioning of cerebellar circuits. Our study also links VPP1 to suicide behaviours, suggesting a possible impairment in vesicle neurotransmitter refilling and release in these phenotypes.

Data-driven parcellations are widely used for exploring the functional organization of the brain, and also for reducing the high dimensionality of fMRI data. Despite the flurry of methods proposed in the literature, functional brain parcellations are not highly reproducible at the level of individual subjects, even with very long acquisitions. Some brain areas are also more difficult to parcellate than others, with association heteromodal cortices being the most challenging. An important limitation of classical parcellations is that they are static, i.e. they neglect dynamic reconfigurations of brain networks. In this paper, we proposed a new method to identify dynamic states of parcellations, which we hypothesized would improve reproducibility over static parcellation approaches. For a series of seed voxels in the brain, we applied a cluster analysis to regroup short (3 minutes) time windows into "states" with highly similar seed parcel. We splitted individual time series of the Midnight Scan Club sample into two independent sets of 2.5 hours (test and retest). We found that average within-state parcels, called stability maps, were highly reproducible (over .9 test-retest spatial correlation in many instances) and subject specific (fingerprinting accuracy over 70% on average) between test and retest. Consistent with our hypothesis, seeds in heteromodal cortices (posterior and anterior cingulate) showed a richer repertoire of states than unimodal (visual) cortex. Taken together, our results indicate that static functional parcellations are incorrectly averaging well defined and distinct dynamic states of brain parcellations. This work calls to revisit previous methods based on static parcellations, which includes the majority of published network analyses of fMRI data. Our method may thus impact how researchers model the rich interactions between brain networks in health and disease.

Previously we showed that cryo fixation of brain tissue gave a truer representation of brain ultrastructure in comparison with a standard chemical fixation method (Korogod et al 2005). Extracellular space matched physiological measurements, there were larger numbers of docked vesicles and less glial coverage of synapses and blood capillaries. Here, using the same preservation approaches we compared the morphology of dendritic spines. We show that the length of the spine and the volume of its head is unchanged, however, the spine neck width is thinner by more than 30 % after cryo fixation. In addition, the weak correlation between spine neck width and head volume seen after chemical fixation was not present in cryo-fixed spines. Our data suggest that spine neck geometry is independent of the spine head volume, with cryo fixation showing enhanced spine head compartmentalization and a higher predicted electrical resistance between spine head and parent dendrite.

Social experiences greatly define successive social behavior. Lack of such experiences, especially during critical phases of development, can severely impede the ability to behave adequately in social contexts. To date it is not well characterized how early-life social isolation leads to social deficits and impacts development. In many model species, it is challenging to fully control social experiences, because they depend on parental care. Moreover, complex social behaviors involve multiple sensory modalities, contexts, and actions. Hence, when studying social isolation effects, it is particularly important to parse apart social deficits from general developmental effects, such as abnormal motor learning. Here, we characterized how social experiences during early development of zebrafish larvae modulate their social behavior, at one week of age, when social avoidance reactions can be measured as discrete swim events. We show that raising larvae in social isolation leads to enhanced social avoidance, in terms of reaction distance and reaction strength. Specifically, larvae raised in isolation use a high-acceleration escape swim bout, the short latency C-start, more frequently during social interactions. These behavioral differences are absent in non-social contexts. By ablating the lateral line and presenting the fish with local water vibrations, we show that lateral line inputs are both necessary and sufficient to drive enhanced social avoidance reactions. Taken together, our results show that social experience during development is a critical factor in shaping mechanosensory avoidance reactions in larval zebrafish.

Autonomous functions of the gastrointestinal tract require the combined activity of functionally distinct neurons of the enteric nervous system (ENS). However, the range of enteric neuron diversity and how it emerges during development remain largely unknown. We here make a novel molecular definition of 12 enteric neuron classes (ENCs) within the myenteric plexus of the mouse small intestine. We identify communication features and provide histochemical markers for discrete motor, sensory, and interneurons together with genetic tools for class-specific targeting. Transcriptome analysis of embryonic ENS reveals a largely post-mitotic principle of diversification, where only ENC1 or ENC8 phenotypic traits arise through a binary neurogenic trajectory, and other identities form through subsequent differentiation. We propose generic and class-specific transcriptional regulators and functionally connect the transcription factor Pbx3 to one post-mitotic identity conversion. Our results offers a conceptual and molecular resource for dissecting ENS circuits, and predicting key regulators for the directed differentiation of distinct enteric neuron classes.

Elucidating how synaptic molecules such as AMPA receptors mediate neuronal communication is crucial to understanding cognition and disease, but current technological barriers preclude large-scale exploration of molecular dynamics in vivo. We have developed a suite of innovative methodologies that break through these barriers: a transgenic mouse line with fluorescently tagged endogenous AMPA receptors, two-photon imaging of hundreds of thousands of labeled synapses in behaving mice, and machine-learning-based automatic synapse detection. Using these tools, we can longitudinally track how the strength of individual synapses changes during behavior. We used this approach to generate an unprecedentedly detailed spatiotemporal map of synaptic plasticity underlying sensory experience. More generally, these tools can be used as an optical probe capable of measuring functional synapse strength across entire brain areas during any behavioral paradigm, describing complex system-wide changes with molecular precision.

Activation of microglia and astrocytes contributes to synaptic remodeling, tissue repair and neuronal survival following traumatic brain injury (TBI). However, the consequences of the interaction between both glial cell types in rewiring neuronal networks and repairing brain functions remains poorly understood. Here, we explored how microglia-induced astrocyte activation modified synapses and cerebrovascular integrity following TBI. Calcium imaging experiments from brain slices revealed increased number of active astrocytes responding with spontaneous Ca2+ events surrounding the injury at 1 d.a.i. These changes correlated with an increase in astrocytic GFAP-reactivity and microglia activation. Blocking microglia activation with the TLR4-blocker TAK242 reduced both the number of active and reactive astrocytes, suggesting a role for microglia in mediating astrocyte excitability. To determine the physiological consequences of microglia-induced astrocyte activation, we first quantified the number of synaptic puncta in TBI-mice treated with the TLR4-blocker. PSD-95/VGlut-1 staining showed that TAK-treatment reduced by half the synaptic loss observed in TBI-mice. Similar effects were also observed in the blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity, in which blockage of microglia decreased Evans Blue extravasation, an indicative of preserved BBB. The acute effects of microglia inhibition on synapses and BBB were not observed in IP3R2-/- mice, indicating that the microglial effects depend on the subsequent astrocyte activation. In addition, acute TBI increases the release of the astrocytic-protein thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) that seems to be necessary to modulate synaptic puncta in a sub-acute phase. Together, our data demonstrate that microglia-to-astrocyte communication plays a crucial role in the pathophysiology of TBI and that its inhibition prevents the synaptic loss and BBB damage accelerating the recovery/repair of damaged tissue. Overall, our data indicates that targeting the microglia-astrocyte crosstalk might represent a therapeutic potential in CNS injuries and disorders.

Background &amp; Aims: The enteric nervous system (ENS) exists in close proximity to luminal bacteria. Intestinal microbes regulate ENS development, but little is known about their effects on adult enteric neurons. We investigated whether intestinal bacteria or their products affect the adult ENS via toll like receptors (TLRs) in mice. Methods: We performed studies with conventional C57/BL6, germ-free C57/BL6, Nestin-creERT2:tdTomato, Nestin-GFP, and ChAT-cre:tdTomato. Mice were given drinking water with ampicillin or without (controls). Germ-free mice were given drinking water with TLR2 agonist or without (controls). Some mice were given a blocking antibody against TLR2 or a TLR4 inhibitor. We performed whole-gut transit, bead latency, and geometric center studies. Feces were collected and analyzed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Longitudinal muscle myenteric plexus (LMMP) tissues were collected, analyzed by immunohistochemistry, and levels of nitric oxide were measured. Cells were isolated from colonic LMMP of Nestin-creERT2:tdTomato mice and incubated with agonists of TLR2 (receptor for Gram-positive bacteria), TLR4 (receptor for Gram-negative bacteria), or distilled water (control) andd analyzed by flow cytometry. Results: Stool from mice given ampicillin had altered composition of gut microbiota with reduced abundance of Gram-positive bacteria and increased abundance of Gram-negative bacteria, compared with mice given only water. Mice given ampicillin had reduced colon motility compared with mice given only water, and their colonic LMMP had reduced numbers of nitrergic neurons, reduced nNOS production, and reduced colonic neurogenesis. Numbers of colonic myenteric neurons increased after mice were switched from ampicillin to plain water, with increased markers of neurogenesis. Nestin-positive ENPCs expressed TLR2 and TLR4. In cells isolated from the colonic LMMP, incubation with the TLR2 agonist increased the percentage of neurons originating from ENPCs to approximately 10%, compared to approximately 0.01% in cells incubated with the TLR4 agonist or distilled water. Mice given an antibody against TLR2 had prolonged whole-gut transit times; their colonic LMMP had reduced total neurons and a smaller proportion of nitrinergic neurons per ganglion, and reduced markers of neurogenesis compared with mice given saline. Colonic LMMP of mice given the TLR4 inhibitor did not have reduced markers of neurogenesis. Colonic LMMP of germ-free mice given TLR2 agonist had increased neuronal numbers compared with control germ-free mice. Conclusions: In the adult mouse colon, TLR2 promotes colonic neurogenesis, regulated by intestinal bacteria. Our findings indicate that colonic microbiota help maintain the adult ENS via a specific signaling pathway. Pharmacologic and probiotic approaches directed towards specific TLR2 signaling processes might be developed for treatment of colonic motility disorders related to use of antibiotics or other factors.

Understanding how diverse neurons are assembled into circuits requires a framework for describing cell types and their developmental trajectories. Here, we combined genetic fate mapping and pseudo-temporal profiling to resolve the diversification of cerebellar inhibitory interneurons based on morphology. The molecular layer interneurons (MLIs) derive from a common progenitor but comprise a diverse population of dendritic-, somatic-, and axon initial segment-targeting interneurons. MLIs are classically divided into two types. However, their morphological heterogeneity suggests an alternate model of one continuously varying population. Through clustering and trajectory inference of 811 MLI reconstructions at maturity and during development, we show that MLIs divide into two discrete classes but also present significant within-class heterogeneity. Pseudotime trajectory mapping uncovered the emergence of distinct phenotypes during migration and axonogenesis, well before neurons reach their final positions. Our study illustrates the utility of quantitative single-cell methods to morphology for defining the diversification of neuronal subtypes.

Single cell transcriptomics has transformed the characterization of brain cell identity by providing quantitative molecular signatures for large, unbiased samples of brain cell populations. With the proliferation of taxonomies based on individual datasets, a major challenge is to integrate and validate results toward defining biologically meaningful cell types. We used a battery of single-cell transcriptome and epigenome measurements generated by the BRAIN Initiative Cell Census Network (BICCN) to comprehensively assess the molecular signatures of cell types in the mouse primary motor cortex (MOp). We further developed computational and statistical methods to integrate these multimodal data and quantitatively validate the reproducibility of the cell types. The reference atlas, based on more than 600,000 high quality single-cell or -nucleus samples assayed by six molecular modalities, is a comprehensive molecular account of the diverse neuronal and non-neuronal cell types in MOp. Collectively, our study indicates that the mouse primary motor cortex contains over 55 neuronal cell types that are highly replicable across analysis methods, sequencing technologies, and modalities. We find many concordant multimodal markers for each cell type, as well as thousands of genes and gene regulatory elements with discrepant transcriptomic and epigenomic signatures. These data highlight the complex molecular regulation of brain cell types and will directly enable design of reagents to target specific MOp cell types for functional analysis.

The acquisition of goal-directed action requires the encoding of specific action-outcome associations involving plasticity in the posterior dorsomedial striatum (pDMS). We first investigated the relative involvement of the major inputs to the pDMS argued to be involved in this learning-related plasticity, from prelimbic prefrontal cortex (PL) and from the basolateral amygdala (BLA). Using ex vivo optogenetic stimulation of PL or BLA terminals in pDMS, we found that goal-directed learning potentiated the PL input to direct pathway spiny projection neurons (dSPNs) bilaterally but not to indirect pathway neurons (iSPNs). In contrast, learning-related plasticity was not observed in the direct BLA-pDMS pathway. Using toxicogenetics, we ablated BLA projections to either pDMS or PL and found that only the latter was necessary for goal-directed learning. Importantly, transient inactivation of the BLA during goal-directed learning prevented the PL-pDMS potentiation of dSPNs, establishing that the BLA input to the PL is necessary for the corticostriatal plasticity underlying goal-directed learning.

Behavioral flexibility requires the prefrontal cortex and striatum. Here, we investigate neuronal ensembles in the medial frontal cortex (MFC) and the dorsomedial striatum (DMS) during one form of behavioral flexibility: learning a new temporal interval. We studied corticostriatal neuronal activity as rodents trained to respond after a 12-second fixed interval (FI12) learned to respond at a shorter 3-second fixed interval (FI3). On FI12 trials, we discovered time-related ramping was reduced in the MFC but not in the DMS in two-interval vs. one-interval sessions. We also found that more DMS neurons than MFC neurons exhibited differential interval-related activity on the first day of two-interval performance. Finally, MFC and DMS ramping was similar with successive days of two-interval performance but DMS temporal decoding increased on FI3 trials. These data suggest that the MFC and DMS play distinct roles during temporal learning and provide insight into corticostriatal circuits.

Exercise exerts a beneficial effect on the major pathological and clinical symptoms associated with Alzheimers disease in humans and mouse models of the disease. While numerous mechanisms for such benefits from exercise have been proposed, a clear understanding of the causal links remains elusive. Recent studies also suggest that cerebral blood flow in the brain of both Alzheimers patients and mouse models of the disease is decreased and that the cognitive symptoms can be improved when blood flow is restored. We therefore hypothesized that the mitigating effect of exercise on the development and progression of Alzheimers disease may be mediated through an increase in the otherwise reduced brain blood flow. To test this idea, we examined the impact of three months of voluntary wheel running in ~1-year-old APP/PS1 mice on short-term memory function, brain inflammation, amyloid deposition, and cerebral blood flow. Our findings that exercise led to improved memory function, a trend toward reduced brain inflammation, markedly increased neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus, and no changes in amyloid-beta deposits are consistent with other reports on the impact of exercise on the progression of Alzheimers related symptoms in mouse models. Notably, we did not observe any impact of wheel running on overall cortical blood flow nor on the incidence of non-flowing capillaries, a mechanism we recently identified as one contributing factor to cerebral blood flow deficits in mouse models of Alzheimers disease. Overall, our results replicate previous findings that exercise is able to ameliorate certain aspects of Alzheimers disease pathology, but show that this benefit does not appear to act through increases in cerebral blood flow.

Several of us had interacted with Bruce recently, read his recent publications, and saw no signs of his enthusiasm for science or productivity waning despite being close to his 82nd birthday. Given that Bruce had a larger-than-life capacity for generating, storing, and integrating scientific knowledge, and a seemingly never-failing enthusiasm for stress neurobiology and neuroendocrinology in general, it seemed as though he would live forever.

<p>by Lenka Stejskal, William D. Lees, David S. Moss, Machaela Palor, Richard J. Bingham, Adrian J. Shepherd, Joe Grove</p>

The glycoproteins of hepatitis C virus, E1E2, are unlike any other viral fusion machinery yet described, and are the current focus of immunogen design in HCV vaccine development; thus, making E1E2 both scientifically and medically important. We used pre-existing, but fragmentary, structures to model a complete ectodomain of the major glycoprotein E2 from three strains of HCV. We then performed molecular dynamic simulations to explore the conformational landscape of E2, revealing a number of important features. Despite high sequence divergence, and subtle differences in the models, E2 from different strains behave similarly, possessing a stable core flanked by highly flexible regions, some of which perform essential functions such as receptor binding. Comparison with sequence data suggest that this consistent behaviour is conferred by a network of conserved residues that act as hinge and anchor points throughout E2. The variable regions (HVR-1, HVR-2 and VR-3) exhibit particularly high flexibility, and bioinformatic analysis suggests that HVR-1 is a putative intrinsically disordered protein region. Dynamic cross-correlation analyses demonstrate intramolecular communication and suggest that specific regions, such as HVR-1, can exert influence throughout E2. To support our computational approach we performed small-angle X-ray scattering with purified E2 ectodomain; this data was consistent with our MD experiments, suggesting a compact globular core with peripheral flexible regions. This work captures the dynamic behaviour of E2 and has direct relevance to the interaction of HCV with cell-surface receptors and neutralising antibodies.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/hLVWNHZsJvA" width="1" />

It is well-established that people can factor into account the distribution of their errors in motor performance so as to optimize reward. Here we asked whether, in the context of motor learning where errors decrease across trials, people take into account their future, improved performance so as to make optimal decisions to maximize reward. One group of participants performed a virtual throwing task in which, periodically, they were given the opportunity to select from a set of smaller targets of increasing value. A second group of participants performed a reaching task under a visuomotor rotation in which, after performing a initial set of trials, they selected a reward structure (ratio of points for target hits and misses) for different exploitation horizons (i.e., numbers of trials they might be asked to perform). Because movement errors decreased exponentially across trials in both learning tasks, optimal target selection (task 1) and optimal reward structure selection (task 2) required taking into account future performance. The results from both tasks indicate that people anticipate their future motor performance so as to make decisions that will improve their expected future reward.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/poVDA3I9U-M" width="1" />

<p>by Bastien Berret, Frédéric Jean</p>

Understanding the underpinnings of biological motor control is an important issue in movement neuroscience. Optimal control theory is a leading framework to rationalize this problem in computational terms. Previously, optimal control models have been devised either in deterministic or in stochastic settings to account for different aspects of motor control (e.g. average behavior versus trial-to-trial variability). While these approaches have yielded valuable insights about motor control, they typically fail in explaining muscle co-contraction. Co-contraction of a group of muscles associated to a motor function (e.g. agonist and antagonist muscles spanning a joint) contributes to modulate the mechanical impedance of the neuromusculoskeletal system (e.g. joint viscoelasticity) and is thought to be mainly under the influence of descending signals from the brain. Here we present a theory suggesting that one primary goal of motor planning may be to issue feedforward (open-loop) motor commands that optimally specify both force and impedance, according to noisy neuromusculoskeletal dynamics and to optimality criteria based on effort and variance. We show that the proposed framework naturally accounts for several previous experimental findings regarding the regulation of force and impedance via muscle co-contraction in the upper-limb. Stochastic optimal (closed-loop) control, preprogramming feedback gains but requiring on-line state estimation processes through long-latency sensory feedback loops, may then complement this nominal feedforward motor command to fully determine the limb’s mechanical impedance. The proposed stochastic optimal open-loop control theory may provide new insights about the general articulation of feedforward/feedback control mechanisms and justify the occurrence of muscle co-contraction in the neural control of movement.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/c3h5yn-z-gA" width="1" />

<p>Propofol is the most common general anesthetic used for surgery in humans, yet its complete mechanism of action remains elusive. In addition to potentiating inhibitory synapses in the brain, propofol also impairs excitatory neurotransmission. We use electrophysiological recordings from individual glutamatergic boutons in male and female larval <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> motor nerve terminals to characterize this effect. We recorded from two bouton types, which have distinct presynaptic physiology and different average numbers of release sites or active zones. We show that a clinically relevant dose of propofol (3 μm) impairs neurotransmitter release similarly at both bouton types by decreasing the number of active release sites by half, without affecting release probability. In contrast, an analog of propofol has no effect on glutamate release. Coexpressing a truncated syntaxin1A protein in presynaptic boutons completely blocked this effect of propofol. Overexpressing wild-type syntaxin1A in boutons also conferred a level of resistance by increasing the number of active release sites to a physiological ceiling set by the number of active zones or T-bars, and in this way counteracting the effect of propofol. These results point to the presynaptic release machinery as a target for the general anesthetic. Proportionally equivalent effects of propofol on the number of active release sites across the different bouton types suggests that glutamatergic circuits that involve smaller boutons with fewer release sites may be more vulnerable to the presynaptic effects of the drug.</p>

ABSTRACT<p>The safety and efficacy of opioids are compromised as analgesic tolerance develops. Opioids are also ineffective against neuropathic pain. Recent reports have suggested that inhibitors of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK), may have analgesic effects in cancer patients suffering from neuropathic pain. It has been shown that the platelet-derived growth factor receptor-beta (PDGFR-), an RTK that has been shown to interact with the EGFR, mediates opioid tolerance but does not induce analgesia. Therefore, we sought to determine whether EGFR signaling was involved in opioid tolerance and if EGFR and PDGFR signaling could induce pain in rats.</p><p>We found that gefitinib, an EGFR antagonist, eliminated morphine tolerance. In addition, repeated epidermal growth factor (EGF) administration rendered animals unresponsive to subsequent analgesic doses of morphine, a phenomenon we call ‘pre-tolerance’. Using a nerve injury model, we found that gefitinib alone was not analgesic. Rather, it reversed insensitivity to morphine analgesia (‘pre-tolerance’) caused by the release of EGF by injured nerves. We also showed that repeated, but not acute EGF or platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB) administration induced mechanical hypersensitivity in rats. EGFR and PDGFR- signaling interacted to produce this sensitization. EGFR was widely expressed in primary sensory afferent cell bodies, demonstrating a neuroanatomical substrate for our findings.</p><p>Taken together, our results suggest a direct mechanistic link between opioid tolerance and mechanical sensitization. EGFR antagonism could eventually play an important clinical role in the treatment of opioid tolerance and neuropathic pain that is refractory to opioid treatment.</p><p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Opioid tolerance and associated reduced effectiveness of opioids against neuropathic pain are two major clinical problems that are prime contributors to the opioid epidemic. However, the mechanisms underlying these phenomena are not clearly understood. Here we show that EGFR antagonism not only blocks morphine tolerance but also restores the effectiveness of opioids against neuropathic pain. Chronic EGF or PDGF administration induces mechanical sensitization, a prominent component of neuropathic pain, and renders animals ‘pre-tolerant’ to subsequent analgesic doses of morphine. Taken together, these results suggest a direct mechanistic link between opioid tolerance and neuropathic pain. EGFR antagonism could eventually play an important role in the treatment of opioid tolerance and severe neuropathic pain that requires ever increasing doses of opioids.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The identification of sensitive biomarkers is essential to validate therapeutics for Huntington's disease (HD). We directly compare structural imaging markers across the largest collective imaging HD dataset, to identify a set of imaging markers robust to multi‐centre variation and to derive upper estimates on sample sizes for clinical trials in HD.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We used one post‐processing pipeline to retrospectively analyse T1‐weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans from 624 participants at three time points, from the PREDICT‐HD, TRACK‐HD and IMAGE‐HD studies. We used mixed effects models to adjust regional brain volumes for covariates, calculate effect sizes, and simulate possible treatment effects in disease‐affected anatomical regions. We used our model to estimate the statistical power of possible treatment effects for anatomical regions and clinical markers.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We identify a set of common anatomical regions that have similarly large standardised effect sizes (&gt;0.5) between healthy control and pre‐manifest (PreHD) groups. These include: sub‐cortical, white matter, and cortical regions, and non‐ventricular cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). We also observe a consistent spatial distribution of effect size by region across the whole brain. We find that multi‐centre studies are necessary to capture treatment effect variance; that for a 20% treatment effect, power &gt; 80% is achieved for the caudate (N=661), pallidum (N=687), and non‐ventricular CSF (N=939); and, crucially, that these imaging markers provide greater power than standard clinical markers.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our findings provide the first cross‐study validation of structural imaging markers in HD, supporting the use of these measurements as endpoints for both observational studies and clinical trials.</p>

<p>It is recently demonstrated that cortical activity can track the time courses
of phrases and sentences during speech listening. Here, we propose a plausible
neural processing framework to explain this phenomenon. It is argued that the
brain maintains the neural representation of a linguistic unit, i.e., a word or
a phrase, in a processing buffer until the unit is integrated into a
higher-level structure. After being integrated, the unit is removed from the
buffer and becomes activated long-term memory. In this model, the duration each
unit is maintained in the processing buffer depends on the linguistic structure
of the speech input. It is shown that the number of items retained in the
processing buffer follows the time courses of phrases and sentences, in line
with neurophysiological data, whether the syntactic structure of a sentence is
mentally parsed using a bottom-up or top-down predictive model. This model
generates a range of testable predictions about the link between linguistic
structures, their dynamic psychological representations and their neural
underpinnings.

<p>End user AI is trained on large server farms with data collected from the
users. With ever increasing demand for IOT devices, there is a need for deep
learning approaches that can be implemented (at the edge) in an energy
efficient manner. In this work we approach this using spiking neural networks.
The unsupervised learning technique of spike timing dependent plasticity (STDP)
using binary activations are used to extract features from spiking input data.
Gradient descent (backpropagation) is used only on the output layer to perform
the training for classification. The accuracies obtained for the balanced
EMNIST data set compare favorably with other approaches. The effect of
stochastic gradient descent (SGD) approximations on learning capabilities of
our network are also explored.

<p>Neurophysiological studies are typically conducted in laboratories with
limited ecological validity, scalability, and generalizability of findings.
This is a significant challenge for the development of brain-computer
interfaces (BCIs), which ultimately need to function in unsupervised settings
on consumer-grade hardware. We introduce MYND: A smartphone application for
unsupervised evaluation of BCI control strategies with consumer-grade hardware.
Subjects are guided through experiment selection, hardware fitting, recording,
and data upload in order to self-administer multi-day studies that include
neurophysiological recordings and questionnaires. As a use case, we evaluate
the BCI control strategies "Positive memories" and "Music imagery" in a
realistic scenario by combining MYND with a four-channel electroencephalogram
(EEG). Thirty subjects recorded 70 hours of EEG data with the system at home.
On average, subjects were able to fit the headset in less than one minute and
retained a signal quality of 90.2% during recordings. Neural activity in both
control strategies could be decoded with an offline accuracy of 68.5% and 64.0%
across all days. The repeated, unsupervised execution of the same strategy
affected performance, which could be tackled by implementing feedback to let
subjects switch between strategies or devise new strategies with the platform.

<p>We previously created a prosthetic hand with a tacit learning system (TLS) that automatically supports the control of forearm pronosupination. This myoelectric prosthetic hand enables sensory feedback and flexible motor output, which allows users to move efficiently with minimal burden. In this study, we investigated whether electroencephalography can be used to analyze the influence of the auxiliary function of the TLS on brain function. Three male participants who had sustained below-elbow amputations and were myoelectric prosthesis users performed a series of physical movement trials with the TLS inactivated and activated. Trials were video recorded and a sequence of videos was prepared to represent each individual’s own use while the system was inactivated and activated. In a subsequent motor imagery phase during which electroencephalography (EEG) signals were collected, each participant was asked to watch both videos of themself while actively imagining the physical movement depicted. Differences in mean cortical current and amplitude envelope correlation (AEC) values between supplementary motor areas (SMA) and each vertex were calculated. For all participants, there were differences in the mean cortical current generated by the motor imagery tasks when the TLS inactivated and activated conditions were compared. The AEC values were higher during the movement imagery task with TLS activation, although their distribution on the cortex varied between the three individuals. In both S1 and other brain areas, AEC values increased in conditions with the TLS activated. Evidence from this case series indicates that, in addition to motor control, TLS may change sensory stimulus recognition.</p>

<p>The cortex is crucial for many behaviors, ranging from sensory-based behaviors to working memory and social behaviors. To gain an in-depth understanding of the contribution to these behaviors, cellular and sub-cellular recordings from both individual and populations of cortical neurons are vital. However, techniques allowing such recordings, such as two-photon imaging and whole-cell electrophysiology, require absolute stability of the head, a requirement not often fulfilled in freely moving animals. Here, we review and compare behavioral paradigms that have been developed and adapted for the head-fixed preparation, which together offer the needed stability for live recordings of neural activity in behaving animals. We also review how the head-fixed preparation has been used to explore the function of primary sensory cortices, posterior parietal cortex (PPC) and anterior lateral motor (ALM) cortex in sensory-based behavioral tasks, while also discussing the considerations of performing such recordings. Overall, this review highlights the head-fixed preparation as allowing in-depth investigation into the neural activity underlying behaviors by providing highly controllable settings for precise stimuli presentation which can be combined with behavioral paradigms ranging from simple sensory detection tasks to complex, cross-modal, memory-guided decision-making tasks.</p>

<p>Since the discovery of TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) in 1995, our understanding of its role continues to expand as research progresses. In particular, its role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) has drawn increasing interest in recent years. TDP-43 may participate in various pathogenic mechanisms underlying AD, such as amyloid β deposition, tau hyperphosphorylation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and neuroinflammation. Because AD is complex and heterogeneous, and because of the distinct characteristics of TDP-43, mostly seen in the oldest-old and those with more severe clinical phenotype, subcategorization based on specific features or biomarkers may significantly improve diagnosis and treatment. AD-like cognitive dysfunction associated with TDP-43 pathology may therefore be a distinct encephalopathy, referred to as limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy (LATE).</p>

<p>Several approaches can be used to estimate neural activity. The main differences between them concern the a priori information used and its sensitivity to high noise levels. Empirical mode decomposition (EMD) has been recently applied to electroencephalography EEG-based neural activity reconstruction to provide a priori time-frequency information to improve the estimation of neural activity. EMD has the specific ability to identify independent oscillatory modes in non-stationary signals with multiple oscillatory components. However, attempts to use EMD in EEG analysis have not yet provided optimal reconstructions, due to the intrinsic mode-mixing problem of EMD. Several studies have used single-channel analysis, whereas others have used multiple-channel analysis for other applications. Here, we present the results of multiple-channel analysis using multivariate empirical mode decomposition (MEMD) to reduce the mode-mixing problem and provide useful a priori time-frequency information for the reconstruction of neuronal activity using several low-density EEG electrode montages. The methods were evaluated using real and synthetic EEG data, in which the reconstructions were performed using the multiple sparse priors (MSP) algorithm with EEG electrode montages of 32, 16, and 8 electrodes. The quality of the source reconstruction was assessed using the Wasserstein metric. A comparison of the solutions without pre-processing and those after applying MEMD showed the source reconstructions to be improved using MEMD as a priori information for the low-density montages of 8 and 16 electrodes. The mean source reconstruction error on a real EEG dataset was reduced by 59.42 and 66.04% for the 8 and 16 electrode montages, respectively, and that on a simulated EEG with three active sources, by 87.31 and 31.45% for the same electrode montages.</p>

<p>Current neural prostheses can restore limb movement to tetraplegic patients by translating brain signals coding movements to control a variety of actuators. Fast and accurate somatosensory feedback is essential for normal movement, particularly dexterous tasks, but is currently lacking in motor neural prostheses. Attempts to restore somatosensory feedback have largely focused on cortical stimulation which, thus far, have succeeded in eliciting minimal naturalistic sensations. Yet, a question that deserves more attention is whether the cortex is the best place to activate the central nervous system to restore somatosensation. Here, we propose that the brainstem dorsal column nuclei are an ideal alternative target to restore somatosensation. We review some of the recent literature investigating the dorsal column nuclei functional organization and neurophysiology and highlight some of the advantages and limitations of the dorsal column nuclei as a future neural prosthetic target. Recent evidence supports the dorsal column nuclei as a potential neural prosthetic target, but also identifies several gaps in our knowledge as well as potential limitations which need to be addressed before such a goal can become reality.</p>

<p>Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the most common form of dementia, is highly prevalent in older adults. The main clinical feature is the progressive decline of memory function, which eventually leads to the decline of cognitive function. At present, the pathogenesis of AD is unclear. In the disease process, synaptic changes are the key. Recent studies have shown that the dysregulation of RNA methylation is related to many biological processes, including neurodevelopment and neurodegenerative diseases. N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most abundant modification in eukaryotic RNA. In this study, RNA m6A methylation was quantified in APP/PS1 transgenic mice, which is an AD mouse model, and C57BL/6 control mice, and data showed that m6A methylation was elevated in the cortex and the hippocampus of APP/PS1 transgenic mice. Next, the alterations of m6A RNA methylation in AD and in C57BL/6 mice were investigated using high-throughput sequencing. Genome-wide maps of m6A mRNA showed that the degrees of m6A methylation were higher in many genes and lower in others in AD mice. Interestingly, the expression of the m6A methyltransferase METTL3 was elevated and that of the m6A demethylase FTO was decreased in AD mice. The data were analyzed by gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses, and pathways that might be related to synaptic or neuron development and growth were constructed. The related pathways and genes predicted the potential roles of the differentially expressed m6A methylation RNA in AD. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that the m6A methylation of RNA promotes the development of AD.</p>

<p>Studies demonstrated that spinal autophagy was impaired in spinal nerve ligation (SNL) rats. However, the relationship of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and ER-phagy and whether dexmedetomidine (DEX) modulates ER-phagy remain unclear. In this study, male Sprague–Dawley (SD) rats and the SNL animal model were used. 4-Phenylbutyric acid (4-PBA), tunicamycin (TM), rapamycin (RAP), and 3-methyladenine (3-MA) were intrathecally administered, respectively to demonstrate the relationship of ER stress and ER-phagy. Dexmedetomidine (30 μg/kg) was administered as treatment. Mechanical withdrawal threshold (MWT) and thermal withdrawal latency (TWL) tests were performed to evaluate nociceptive hypersensitivity. Protein expressions were examined by Western blot, and the location of glucose-regulated protein 78 (Grp78) was examined by immunofluorescence staining. SNL induced ER stress and ER-phagy impairment. ER stress was altered in rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM); 4-phenylbutyric acid induced analgesic effect via inhibiting ER stress and unfolded protein response (UPR) pathways to induce ER-phagy; tunicamycin led to worsening pain through enhancing ER stress and UPR pathways to further impair ER-phagy. Rapamycin provided analgesic effect through enhancing ER-phagy to relieve SNL-induced ER stress and UPR pathway activation; 3-methyladenine deteriorated pain via further impairing ER-phagy to aggravate ER stress. Dexmedetomidine provided analgesic effect through elevating ER-phagy. In conclusion, ER stress led to ER-phagy impairment in the spinal cord of SNL rats and participated in the nociceptive descending system. ER-phagy impairment was both a trigger and an effector of ER stress via UPR pathways in SNL rats. Dexmedetomidine targeted ER-phagy to provide analgesic effect.</p>

<p>Hereditary spastic paraplegias (HSP) are a group of neurodegenerative diseases sharing spasticity in lower limbs as common symptom. There is a large clinical variability in the presentation of patients, partly underlined by the large genetic heterogeneity, with more than 60 genes responsible for HSP. Despite this large heterogeneity, the proteins with known function are supposed to be involved in a limited number of cellular compartments such as shaping of the endoplasmic reticulum or endolysosomal function. Yet, it is difficult to understand why alteration of such different cellular compartments can lead to degeneration of the axons of cortical motor neurons. A common feature that has emerged over the last decade is the alteration of lipid metabolism in this group of pathologies. This was first revealed by the identification of mutations in genes encoding proteins that have or are supposed to have enzymatic activities on lipid substrates. However, it also appears that mutations in genes affecting endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria, or endolysosome function can lead to changes in lipid distribution or metabolism. The aim of this review is to discuss the role of lipid metabolism alterations in the physiopathology of HSP, to evaluate how such alterations contribute to neurodegenerative phenotypes, and to understand how this knowledge can help develop therapeutic strategy for HSP.</p>

<p>High-fidelity measurements of neural activity can enable advancements in our understanding of the neural basis of complex behaviors such as speech, audition, and language, and are critical for developing neural prostheses that address impairments to these abilities due to disease or injury. We develop a novel high resolution, thin-film micro-electrocorticography (micro-ECoG) array that enables high-fidelity surface measurements of neural activity from songbirds, a well-established animal model for studying speech behavior. With this device, we provide the first demonstration of sensory-evoked modulation of surface-recorded single unit responses. We establish that single unit activity is consistently sensed from micro-ECoG electrodes over the surface of sensorimotor nucleus HVC (used as a proper name) in anesthetized European starlings, and validate responses with correlated firing in single units recorded simultaneously at surface and depth. The results establish a platform for high-fidelity recording from the surface of subcortical structures that will accelerate neurophysiological studies, and development of novel electrode arrays and neural prostheses.</p>

<p>Automatic alignment of brain anatomy in a standard space is a key step when processing magnetic resonance imaging for group analyses. Such brain registration is prone to failure, and the results are therefore typically reviewed visually to ensure quality. There is however no standard, validated protocol available to perform this visual quality control (QC). We propose here a standardized QC protocol for brain registration, with minimal training overhead and no required knowledge of brain anatomy. We validated the reliability of three-level QC ratings (OK, Maybe, Fail) across different raters. Nine experts each rated N = 100 validation images, and reached moderate to good agreement (kappa from 0.4 to 0.68, average of 0.54 ± 0.08), with the highest agreement for “Fail” images (Dice from 0.67 to 0.93, average of 0.8 ± 0.06). We then recruited volunteers through the Zooniverse crowdsourcing platform, and extracted a consensus panel rating for both the Zooniverse raters (N = 41) and the expert raters. The agreement between expert and Zooniverse panels was high (kappa = 0.76). Overall, our protocol achieved a good reliability when performing a two level assessment (Fail vs. OK/Maybe) by an individual rater, or aggregating multiple three-level ratings (OK, Maybe, Fail) from a panel of experts (3 minimum) or non-experts (15 minimum). Our brain registration QC protocol will help standardize QC practices across laboratories, improve the consistency of reporting of QC in publications, and will open the way for QC assessment of large datasets which could be used to train automated QC systems.</p>

<p>Transcranial focused ultrasound (tFUS) is an emerging method for non-invasive neuromodulation akin to transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). tFUS offers several advantages over electromagnetic methods including high spatial resolution and the ability to reach deep brain targets. Here we describe two experiments assessing whether tFUS could modulate mood in healthy human volunteers by targeting the right inferior frontal gyrus (rIFG), an area implicated in mood and emotional regulation. In a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study, participants received 30 s of 500 kHz tFUS or a placebo control. Visual Analog Mood Scales (VAMS) assessed mood four times within an hour (baseline and three times after tFUS). Participants who received tFUS reported an overall increase in Global Affect (GA), an aggregate score from the VAMS scale, indicating a positive shift in mood. Experiment 2 examined resting-state functional (FC) connectivity using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) following 2 min of 500 kHz tFUS at the rIFG. As in Experiment 1, tFUS enhanced self-reported mood states and also decreased FC in resting state networks related to emotion and mood regulation. These results suggest that tFUS can be used to modulate mood and emotional regulation networks in the prefrontal cortex.</p>

<p>Social interactions are a crucial part of human life. Understanding the neural underpinnings of social interactions is a challenging task that the hyperscanning method has been trying to tackle over the last two decades. Here, we review the existing literature and evaluate the current state of the hyperscanning method. We review the type of methods (fMRI, M/EEG, and fNIRS) that are used to measure brain activity from more than one participant simultaneously and weigh their pros and cons for hyperscanning. Further, we discuss different types of analyses that are used to estimate brain networks and synchronization. Lastly, we present results of hyperscanning studies in the context of different cognitive functions and their relations to social interactions. All in all, we aim to comprehensively present methods, analyses, and results from the last 20 years of hyperscanning research.</p>

<p>Background and Purpose: The human supplementary motor area (SMA) contains two functional subregions of the SMA proper and preSMA; however, the reorganization patterns of the two SMA subregions after stroke remain uncertain. Meanwhile, a focal subcortical lesion may affect the overall functional reorganization of brain networks. We sought to identify the differential reorganization of the SMA subregions after subcortical stroke using the resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) analysis.</p><p>Methods: Resting-state functional MRI was conducted in 25 patients with chronic capsular stroke exhibiting well-recovered global motor function (Fugl–Meyer score &gt;90). The SMA proper and preSMA were identified by the rsFC-based parcellation, and the rsFCs of each SMA subregion were compared between stroke patients and healthy controls.</p><p>Results: Despite common rsFC with the fronto-insular cortex (FIC), the SMA proper and preSMA were mainly correlated with the sensorimotor areas and cognitive-related regions, respectively. In stroke patients, the SMA proper and preSMA exhibited completely different functional reorganization patterns: the former showed increased rsFCs with the primary sensorimotor area and caudal cingulate motor area (CMA) of the motor execution network, whereas the latter showed increased rsFC with the rostral CMA of the motor control network. Both of the two SMA subregions showed decreased rsFC with the FIC in stroke patients; the preSMA additionally showed decreased rsFC with the prefrontal cortex (PFC).</p><p>Conclusion: Although both SMA subregions exhibit functional disconnection with the cognitive-related areas, the SMA proper is implicated in the functional reorganization within the motor execution network, whereas the preSMA is involved in the functional reorganization within the motor control network in stroke patients.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2020.00005">Semaphorin-3A Promotes Degradation of Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein in Growth Cones via the Ubiquitin-Proteasome Pathway</a></h4>

<p>Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) is an RNA-binding protein that regulates local translation in dendrites and spines for synaptic plasticity. In axons, FMRP is implicated in axonal extension and axon guidance. We previously demonstrated the involvement of FMRP in growth cone collapse via a translation-dependent response to Semaphorin-3A (Sema3A), a repulsive axon guidance factor. In the case of attractive axon guidance factors, RNA-binding proteins such as zipcode binding protein 1 (ZBP1) accumulate towards the stimulated side of growth cones for local translation. However, it remains unclear how Sema3A effects FMRP localization in growth cones. Here, we show that levels of FMRP in growth cones of hippocampal neurons decreased after Sema3A stimulation. This decrease in FMRP was suppressed by the ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1 enzyme inhibitor PYR-41 and proteasome inhibitor MG132, suggesting that the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is involved in Sema3A-induced FMRP degradation in growth cones. Moreover, the E1 enzyme or proteasome inhibitor suppressed Sema3A-induced increases in microtubule-associated protein 1B (MAP1B) in growth cones, suggesting that the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway promotes local translation of MAP1B, whose translation is mediated by FMRP. These inhibitors also blocked the Sema3A-induced growth cone collapse. Collectively, our results suggest that Sema3A promotes degradation of FMRP in growth cones through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, leading to growth cone collapse via local translation of MAP1B. These findings reveal a new mechanism of axon guidance regulation: degradation of the translational suppressor FMRP via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway.</p>

<p>The plasticity of the central nervous system (CNS) in response to neuronal activity has been suggested as early as 1894 by Cajal (1894). CNS plasticity has first been studied with a focus on neuronal structures. However, in the last decade, myelin plasticity has been unraveled as an adaptive mechanism of importance, in addition to the previously described processes of myelin repair. Indeed, it is now clear that myelin remodeling occurs along with life and adapts to the activity of neuronal networks. Until now, it has been considered as a two-part dialog between the neuron and the oligodendroglial lineage. However, other glial cell types might be at play in myelin plasticity. In the present review, we first summarize the key structural parameters for myelination, we then describe how neuronal activity modulates myelination and finally discuss how other glial cells could participate in myelinic adaptivity.</p>

<p>Acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) are H<sup>+</sup>-activated neuronal Na<sup>+</sup> channels. They are involved in fear behavior, learning, neurodegeneration after ischemic stroke and in pain sensation. ASIC activation has so far been studied only with fast pH changes, although the pH changes associated with many roles of ASICs are slow. It is currently not known whether slow pH changes can open ASICs at all. Here, we investigated to which extent slow pH changes can activate ASIC1a channels and induce action potential signaling. To this end, ASIC1a current amplitudes and charge transport in transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells, and ASIC-mediated action potential signaling in cultured cortical neurons were measured in response to defined pH ramps of 1–40 s duration from pH 7.4 to pH 6.6 or 6.0. A kinetic model of the ASIC1a current was developed and integrated into the Hodgkin-Huxley action potential model. Interestingly, whereas the ASIC1a current amplitude decreased with slower pH ramps, action potential firing was higher upon intermediate than fast acidification in cortical neurons. Indeed, fast pH changes (&lt;4 s) induced short action potential bursts, while pH changes of intermediate speed (4–10 s) induced longer bursts. Slower pH changes (&gt;10 s) did in many experiments not generate action potentials. Computer simulations corroborated these observations. We provide here the first description of ASIC function in response to defined slow pH changes. Our study shows that ASIC1a currents, and neuronal activity induced by ASIC1a currents, strongly depend on the speed of pH changes. Importantly, with pH changes that take &gt;10 s to complete, ASIC1a activation is inefficient. Therefore, it is likely that currently unknown modulatory mechanisms allow ASIC activity in situations such as ischemia and inflammation.</p>

<p>Neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by chronic progressive degeneration of the structure and function of the nervous system, which brings an enormous burden on patients, their families, and society. It is difficult to make early diagnosis, resulting from the insidious onset and progressive development of neurodegenerative diseases. The drugs on the market cannot cross the blood–brain barrier (BBB) effectively, which leads to unfavorable prognosis and less effective treatments. Therefore, there is an urgent demand to develop a novel detection method and therapeutic strategies. Recently, nanomedicine has aroused considerable attention for diagnosis and therapy of central nervous system (CNS) diseases. Nanoparticles integrate targeting, imaging, and therapy in one system and facilitate the entry of drug molecules across the blood–brain barrier, offering new hope to patients. In this review, we summarize the application of iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) in the diagnosis and treatment of neurodegenerative disease, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We focus on IONPs as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agents (CAs) and drug carriers in AD. What most neurodegenerative diseases have in common is that hall marker lesions are represented by protein aggregates (Soto and Pritzkow, 2018). These diseases are of unknown etiology and unfavorable prognosis, and the treatments toward them are less effective (Soto and Pritzkow, 2018). Such diseases usually develop in aged people, and early clinical manifestations are atypical, resulting in difficulty in early diagnosis. Recently, nanomedicine has aroused considerable attention for therapy and diagnosis of CNS diseases because it integrates targeting, imaging, and therapy in one system (Gupta et al., 2019). In this review article, we first introduce the neurodegenerative diseases and commonly used MRI CAs. Then we review the application of IONPs in the diagnosis and treatment of neurodegenerative diseases with the purpose of assisting early theranostics (therapy and diagnosis).</p>

<p>Objective: To investigate the projections the cerebrospinal fluid-contacting (CSF-contacting) nucleus receives from the diencephalon and to speculate on the functional significance of these connections.</p><p>Methods: The retrograde tracer cholera toxin B subunit (CB) was injected into the CSF-contacting nucleus in SD rats according to the experimental formula of the stereotaxic coordinates.

<p>Both cognitive function and striatal dopamine function decline by normal aging. However, the relationship among these three factors remains unclear. The aim of this study was to elucidate the association among age-related changes in the striatal dopamine transporter (DAT) and cognitive function in healthy subjects. The 30 healthy volunteers were enrolled in this research, the age ranged from 41 to 82 (64.5 ± 11.5, mean ± SD). All subjects were scanned with both T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and <sup>123</sup>I-FP-CIT single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) images. The Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Third Edition (WAIS-III) was used to evaluate cognitive function. Six spherical regions of interest (ROI) using 10 mm in diameter on the caudate nucleus, anterior putamen and posterior putamen were manually drawn on MRI image which was applied onto SPECT image. The relationship between striatal occipital ratio (SOR) values and WAIS-III subscore were analyzed by multiple regression analysis. Subscores which was significant were further analyzed by path analyses. Full intelligence quotient (IQ), verbal IQ, verbal comprehension were all positively correlated with age-adjusted striatal DAT binding (P &lt; 0.01). Multiple regression analyses revealed that the coding digit symbol correlated with all striatal regions except for the left caudate (P &lt; 0.04). Picture completion and right caudate, similarities and left caudate also showed a positive correlation (P &lt; 0.04). Path analysis found that the right caudate and picture completion; the left caudate and similarities were correlated independently from age, whereas the models of coding digit symbol were not significant. These results suggest that age-based individual diversity of striatal DAT binding was associated with verbal function, and the caudate nucleus plays an important role in this association.</p>

<p>Aging results in decreased fluid intake following dehydration and other dipsogenic stimuli; similar reductions in sodium intake have also been observed with aging. Given that cyclooxygenase (COX)-derived prostanoids are elevated in aged rats in the midbrain and proinflammatory prostanoids are known to decrease fluid intake in dehydrated rats, the aim of this study was to determine if the reductions of fluid intake and sodium intake in aging are mediated by proinflammatory eicosanoid signaling. Therefore, we examined the effect of acute COX inhibition in adult (4 months-old) and aged (30 months-old) rats prior to ingestive behavior challenges. COX inhibition, using acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), increased fluid intake in aged, but not adult, rats in response to 24-h dehydration. ASA had no effect on salt intake following sodium depletion and ASA did not change basal fluid or sodium consumption in either age group. Hypothalamic COX-1 and -2, prostaglandin E synthase (PGES) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) mRNA expression were all elevated in aged animals, leading to elevated PGE<sub>2</sub> levels. COX expression in the hypothalamus was reduced by ASA treatment in rats of both ages resulting in reduced PGE<sub>2</sub> levels in aged ASA treated animals. These data indicate that the reduced fluid intake that occurs in aging is due to increased COX-PGE<sub>2</sub>-mediated inflammation. However, the reduced sodium intake in these animals appears to occur via an alternate mechanism.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/53375">Integrated analysis of H2A.Z isoforms function reveals a complex interplay in gene regulation</a></h4>

The H2A.Z histone variant plays major roles in the control of gene expression. In human, H2A.Z is encoded by two genes expressing two isoforms, H2A.Z.1 and H2A.Z.2 differing by three amino acids. Here, we undertook an integrated analysis of their functions in gene expression using endogenously-tagged proteins. RNA-Seq analysis in untransformed cells showed that they can regulate both distinct and overlapping sets of genes positively or negatively in a context-dependent manner. Furthermore, they have similar or antagonistic function depending on genes. H2A.Z.1 and H2A.Z.2 can replace each other at Transcription Start Sites, providing a molecular explanation for this interplay. Mass spectrometry analysis showed that H2A.Z.1 and H2A.Z.2 have specific interactors, which can mediate their functional antagonism. Our data indicate that the balance between H2A.Z.1 and H2A.Z.2 at promoters is critically important to regulate specific gene expression, providing an additional layer of complexity to the control of gene expression by histone variants.

<p>by Isaac Fradkin, Casimir Ludwig, Eran Eldar, Jonathan D. Huppert</p>

Obsessive compulsive (OC) symptoms involve excessive information gathering (e.g., checking, reassurance-seeking), and uncertainty about possible, often catastrophic, future events. Here we propose that these phenomena are the result of <i>excessive uncertainty regarding state transitions (transition uncertainty)</i>: a computational impairment in Bayesian inference leading to a reduced ability to use the past to predict the present and future, and to oversensitivity to feedback (i.e. prediction errors). Using a computational model of Bayesian learning under uncertainty in a reversal learning task, we investigate the relationship between OC symptoms and transition uncertainty. Individuals high and low in OC symptoms performed a task in which they had to detect shifts (i.e. transitions) in cue-outcome contingencies. Modeling subjects’ choices was used to estimate each individual participant’s transition uncertainty and associated responses to feedback. We examined both an optimal observer model and an approximate Bayesian model in which participants were assumed to attend (and learn about) only one of several cues on each trial. Results suggested the participants were more likely to distribute attention across cues, in accordance with the optimal observer model. As hypothesized, participants with higher OC symptoms exhibited increased transition uncertainty, as well as a pattern of behavior potentially indicative of a difficulty in relying on learned contingencies, with no evidence for perseverative behavior. Increased transition uncertainty compromised these individuals' ability to predict ensuing feedback, rendering them more surprised by expected outcomes. However, no evidence for excessive belief updating was found. These results highlight a potential computational basis for OC symptoms and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). The fact the OC symptoms predicted a decreased reliance on the past rather than perseveration challenges preconceptions of OCD as a disorder of inflexibility. Our results have implications for the understanding of the neurocognitive processes leading to excessive uncertainty and distrust of past experiences in OCD.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/gJ_xea_wUpc" width="1" />

Abstract
<p>Hypoxic injury to the developing human brain is a complication of premature birth and is associated with long-term impairments of motor function. Disruptions of axon and synaptic connectivity have been linked to developmental hypoxia, but the fundamental mechanisms impacting motor function from altered connectivity are poorly understood. We investigated the effects of hypoxia on locomotor development in zebrafish. We found that developmental hypoxia resulted in decreased spontaneous swimming behavior in larva, and that this motor impairment persisted into adulthood. In evaluation of the diencephalic dopaminergic neurons, which regulate early development of locomotion and constitute an evolutionarily conserved component of the vertebrate dopaminergic system, hypoxia caused a decrease in the number of synapses from the descending dopaminergic diencephalospinal tract (DDT) to spinal cord motor neurons. Moreover, dopamine signaling from the DDT was coupled jointly to motor neuron synaptogenesis and to locomotor development. Together, these results demonstrate the developmental processes regulating early locomotor development and a requirement for dopaminergic projections and motor neuron synaptogenesis. Our findings suggest new insights for understanding the mechanisms leading to motor disability from hypoxic injury of prematurity.</p>

Abstract<p>Intermittent exposure to a sensorimotor perturbation, such as a visuomotor rotation, is known to cause a directional bias on the subsequent movement that opposes the previously experienced perturbation. To date, it is unclear whether the parietal cortex is causally involved in this post-perturbation movement bias. In a recent electroencephalogram study, Savoie et al. (<i>Scientific Reports,</i> volume 8, Article number: 12513, 2018) observed increased parietal activity in response to an intermittent visuomotor perturbation, raising the possibility that the parietal cortex could subserve this change in motor behaviour. The goal of the present study was to causally test this hypothesis. Human participants (N = 28) reached toward one of two visual targets located on either side of a fixation point, while being pseudo-randomly submitted to a visuomotor rotation. On half of all rotation trials, single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was applied over the right (N = 14) or left (N = 14) parietal cortex 150 ms after visual feedback provision. To determine whether TMS influenced the post-perturbation bias, reach direction was compared on trials that followed rotation with (RS+1) and without (R+1) TMS. It was hypothesized that interfering with parietal activity would reduce the movement bias following rotated trials. Results revealed a significant and robust post-rotation directional bias compared to both rotation and null rotation trials. Contrary to our hypothesis, however, neither left nor right parietal stimulation significantly impacted the post-rotation bias. These data suggest that the parietal areas targeted here may not be critical for perturbation-induced motor output changes to emerge.</p><p><b>Significance statement</b> The parietal cortex is known to contribute to sensorimotor adaptation. Despite this, it remains unclear whether it contributes to the automatic and non-strategic changes in motor behaviour that occur following exposure to a sensorimotor perturbation. In the present study, we show that disrupting parietal activity in the vicinity of the angular gyrus using single-pulse TMS shortly after exposure to a visuomotor perturbation does not impact reach direction on a subsequent movement. Although these results must be interpreted in light of the spatiotemporal characteristics of the TMS protocol used, they suggest that the aforementioned parietal areas may not be critical for the emergence of the motor output adjustments that take place in response to a visuomotor perturbation.</p>

<p>How perception and reasoning arise from neuronal network activity is poorly
understood. This is reflected in the fundamental limitations of connectionist
artificial intelligence, typified by deep neural networks trained via
gradient-based optimization. Despite success on many tasks, such networks
remain unexplainable black boxes incapable of symbolic reasoning and concept
generalization. Here we show that a simple set of biologically consistent
organizing principles confer these capabilities to neuronal networks. To
demonstrate, we implement these principles in a novel machine learning
algorithm, based on concept construction instead of optimization, to design
deep neural networks that reason with explainable neuron activity. On a range
of tasks including NP-hard problems, their reasoning capabilities grant
additional cognitive functions, like deliberating through self-analysis,
tolerating adversarial attacks, and learning transferable rules from simple
examples to solve problems of unencountered complexity. The networks also
naturally display properties of biological nervous systems inherently absent in
current deep neural networks, including sparsity, modularity, and both
distributed and localized firing patterns. Because they do not sacrifice
performance, compactness, or training time on standard learning tasks, these
networks provide a new black-box-free approach to artificial intelligence. They
likewise serve as a quantitative framework to understand the emergence of
cognition from neuronal networks.

<p>The paper describes an algorithm for cognitive representation of triples of
related behavioral contexts two of which correspond to mutually exclusive
states of some binary situational factor while uncertainty of this factor is
the third context. The contexts are mapped to vector states in the
two-dimensional quantum Hilbert space describing a dichotomic decision
alternative in relation to which the contexts are subjectively recognized. The
obtained triad of quantum cognitive representations functions as a minimal
carrier of semantic relations between the contexts, which are quantified by
phase relations between the corresponding quantum representation states. The
described quantum model of subjective semantics supports interpretable vector
calculus which is geometrically visualized in the Bloch sphere view of quantum
cognitive states.

<p>While theories postulating a dual cognitive system take hold, quantitative
confirmations are still needed to understand and identify interactions between
the two systems or conflict events. Eye movements are among the most direct
markers of the individual attentive load and may serve as an important proxy of
information. In this work we propose a computational method, within a modified
visual version of the well-known Stroop test, for the identification of
different tasks and potential conflicts events between the two systems through
the collection and processing of data related to eye movements. A statistical
analysis shows that the selected variables can characterize the variation of
attentive load within different scenarios. Moreover, we show that Machine
Learning techniques allow to distinguish between different tasks with a good
classification accuracy and to investigate more in depth the gaze dynamics.

<p>Synchronization in neural networks is strongly tied to the implementation of
cognitive processes, but abnormal neuronal synchronization has been linked to a
number of brain disorders such as epilepsy and schizophrenia. Here we examine
the effects of channel noise on the synchronization of small Hodgkin-Huxley
neuronal networks. The principal feature of a Hodgkin-Huxley neuron is the
existence of protein channels that transition between open and closed states
with voltage dependent rate constants. The Hodgkin-Huxley model assumes
infinitely many channels, so fluctuations in the number of open channels do not
affect the voltage. However, real neurons have finitely many channels which
lead to fluctuations in the membrane voltage and modify the timing of the
spikes, which may in turn lead to large changes in the degree of
synchronization. We demonstrate that under mild conditions, neurons in the
network reach a steady state synchronization level that depends only on the
number of neurons in the network. The channel noise only affects the time it
takes to reach the steady state synchronization level.

<p>Recent experimental advances are producing an avalanche of data on both
neural connectivity and neural activity. To take full advantage of these two
emerging datasets we need a framework that links them, revealing how collective
neural activity arises from the structure of neural connectivity and intrinsic
neural dynamics. This problem of {\it structure-driven activity} has drawn
major interest in computational neuroscience. Existing methods for relating
activity and architecture in spiking networks rely on linearizing activity
around a central operating point and thus fail to capture the nonlinear
responses of individual neurons that are the hallmark of neural information
processing. Here, we overcome this limitation and present a new relationship
between connectivity and activity in networks of nonlinear spiking neurons by
developing a diagrammatic fluctuation expansion based on statistical field
theory. We explicitly show how recurrent network structure produces pairwise
and higher-order correlated activity, and how nonlinearities impact the
networks' spiking activity. Our findings open new avenues to investigating how
single-neuron nonlinearities---including those of different cell
types---combine with connectivity to shape population activity and function.

<p>Activity and expression of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) catalytic isoform, PIK3CD/p110δ, is increased in schizophrenia, autism, and intellectual delay and pro-cognitive preclinical efficacy of p110δ-inhibition has been demonstrated in pharmacological, genetic, and developmental rodent models of psychiatric disorders. Although PI3K signaling has been implicated in the development and function of neurons and glia; isoform-specific roles of the individual PI3Ks are less clear and the biological effects of increased p110δ on neuronal development are unknown. Since the pathobiological direction of p110δ changes in neurodevelopmental disorders are increased expression and activity, we hypothesized that overexpression of p110δ would impact measures of neuronal development and maturation relevant to connectivity and synaptic transmission. p110δ overexpression in primary rat hippocampal cultures significantly reduced dendritic morphogenesis and arborization and increased immature and mature dendritic spine densities, without impacting cell viability, soma size, or axon length. Together, our novel findings demonstrate the importance of homeostatic regulation of the p110δ isoform for normative neuronal development and highlight a potential pathophysiological mechanism of association to disorders of neurodevelopment.</p>

<p>Background: Stroke is a leading health issue, with high morbidity and mortality rates worldwide. Of all strokes, approximately 80% of cases are ischemic stroke (IS). However, the underlying mechanisms of the occurrence of acute IS remain poorly understood because of heterogeneous and multiple factors. More potential biomarkers are urgently needed to reveal the deeper pathogenesis of IS.</p><p>Methods: We identified potential biomarkers in rat brain tissues of IS using an iTRAQ labeling approach coupled with LC-MS/MS. Furthermore, bioinformatrics analyses including GO, KEGG, DAVID, and Cytoscape were used to present proteomic profiles and to explore the disease mechanisms. Additionally, Western blotting for target proteins was conducted for further verification.</p><p>Results: We identified 4,578 proteins using the iTRAQ-based proteomics method. Of these proteins, 282 differentiated proteins, comprising 73 upregulated and 209 downregulated proteins, were observed. Further bioinformatics analysis suggested that the candidate proteins were mainly involved in energy liberation, intracellular protein transport, and synaptic plasticity regulation during the acute period. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis indicated a series of representative pathological pathways, including energy metabolite, long-term potentiation (LTP), and neurodegenerative disease-related pathways. Moreover, Western blotting confirmed the associated candidate proteins, which refer to oxidative responses and synaptic plasticity.</p><p>Conclusions: Our findings highlight the identification of candidate protein biomarkers and provide insight into the biological processes involved in acute IS.</p>

<p>Canine adenovirus-2 (CAV) is a canine pathogen that has been used in a variety of applications, from vaccines against more infectious strains of CAV to treatments for neurological disorders. With recent engineering, CAV has become a natural choice for neuroscientists dissecting the connectivity and function of brain circuits. Specifically, as a reliable genetic vector with minimal immunogenic and cytotoxic reactivity, CAV has been used for the retrograde transduction of various types of projection neurons. Consequently, CAV is particularly useful when studying the anatomy and functions of long-range projections. Moreover, combining CAV with conditional expression and transsynaptic tracing results in the ability to study circuits with cell- and/or projection-type specificity. Lastly, with the well-documented knowledge of viral transduction, new innovations have been developed to increase the transduction efficiency of CAV and circumvent its tropism, expanding the potential of CAV for circuit analysis.</p>

<p>Selective attention plays an essential role in information acquisition and utilization from the environment. In the past 50 years, research on selective attention has been a central topic in cognitive science. Compared with unimodal studies, crossmodal studies are more complex but necessary to solve real-world challenges in both human experiments and computational modeling. Although an increasing number of findings on crossmodal selective attention have shed light on humans' behavioral patterns and neural underpinnings, a much better understanding is still necessary to yield the same benefit for intelligent computational agents. This article reviews studies of selective attention in unimodal visual and auditory and crossmodal audiovisual setups from the multidisciplinary perspectives of psychology and cognitive neuroscience, and evaluates different ways to simulate analogous mechanisms in computational models and robotics. We discuss the gaps between these fields in this interdisciplinary review and provide insights about how to use psychological findings and theories in artificial intelligence from different perspectives.</p>

<p>Background: The spinal cord’s central pattern generators (CPGs) have been explained by the symmetrical half-center hypothesis, the bursts generator, computational models, and more recently by connectome circuits. Asymmetrical models, at odds with the half-center paradigm, are composed of extensor and flexor CPG modules. Other models include not only flexor and extensor motoneurons but also motoneuron pools controlling biarticular muscles. It is unknown whether a preferred model can explain some particularities that fictive scratching (FS) in the cat presents. The first aim of this study was to investigate FS patterns considering the aiming and the rhythmic periods, and second, to examine the effects of serotonin (5HT) on and segmental inputs to FS.</p><p>Methods: The experiments were carried out first in brain cortex-ablated cats (BCAC), then spinalized (SC), and for the midcollicular (MCC) preparation. Subjects were immobilized and the peripheral nerves were used to elicit the Monosynaptic reflex (MR), to modify the scratching patterns and for electroneurogram recordings.</p><p>Results: In BCAC, FS was produced by pinna stimulation and, in some cases, by serotonin. The scratching aiming phase (AP) initiates with the activation of either flexor or extensor motoneurons. Serotonin application during the AP produced simultaneous extensor and flexor bursts. Furthermore, WAY 100635 (5HT1A antagonist) produced a brief burst in the tibialis anterior (TA) nerve, followed by a reduction in its electroneurogram (ENG), while the soleus ENG remained silent. In SC, rhythmic phase (RP) activity was recorded in the soleus motoneurons. Serotonin or WAY produced FS bouts. The electrical stimulation of Ia afferent fibers produced heteronymous MRes waxing and waning during the scratch cycle. In MCC, FS began with flexor activity. Electrical stimulation of either deep peroneus (DP) or superficial peroneus (SP) nerves increased the duration of the TA electroneurogram. Medial gastrocnemius (MG) stretching or MG nerve electrical stimulation produced a reduction in the TA electroneurogram and an initial MG extensor burst. MRes waxed and waned during the scratch cycle.</p><p>Conclusion: Descending pathways and segmental afferent fibers, as well as 5-HT and WAY, can change the FS pattern. To our understanding, the half-center hypothesis is the most suitable for explaining the AP in MCC.</p>

<p>Evidence suggests that astrocytes are not merely supportive cells in the nervous system but may actively participate in the control of neural circuits underlying cognition and behavior. In this study, we examined the role of astrocytes within the motor circuitry of the mammalian spinal cord. Pharmacogenetic manipulation of astrocytic activity in isolated spinal cord preparations obtained from neonatal mice revealed astrocyte-derived, adenosinergic modulation of the frequency of rhythmic output generated by the locomotor central pattern generator (CPG) network. Live Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging demonstrated increased activity in astrocytes during locomotor-related output and in response to the direct stimulation of spinal neurons. Finally, astrocytes were found to respond to neuronally-derived glutamate in a metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) dependent manner, which in turn drives astrocytic modulation of the locomotor network. Our work identifies bi-directional signaling mechanisms between neurons and astrocytes underlying modulatory feedback control of motor circuits, which may act to constrain network output within optimal ranges for movement.</p>

<p>This study aimed to investigate whether the midlife cognitive activity and physical activity moderate the relationship between apolipoprotein Eε4 (APOE4) and in vivo Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathologies. In total, 287 non-demented older adults (mean age 72 years) from the Korean Brain Aging Study for the Early diagnosis and prediction of Alzheimer’s disease cohort were included. Participants underwent a comprehensive clinical assessment including the evaluation for midlife CA and physical activity, [<sup>11</sup>C]-Pittsburgh-Compound-B-positron emission tomography (PET), [<sup>18</sup>F]-fluorodeoxyglucose PET, structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and APOE genotyping. We used linear regression and regression-based mediated-moderation models for statistical analyses. Neither midlife cognitive activity nor physical activity moderated the effect of APOE4 on β-amyloid (Aβ) retention itself. Midlife cognitive activity significantly moderated the effect of APOE4 on hippocampal volume [B (SE) = − 627.580 (252.327), t = −2.488, p = 0.014]: APOE4 carriers had smaller hippocampal volume than non-carriers at relatively high cognitive activity state (p = 0.004), but not at relatively low cognitive activity condition (p = 0.937). Midlife physical activity significantly moderated the effect of Aβ retention, which was closely related to APOE4, on AD-signature region cerebral glucose metabolism [AD-CM; B (SE) = 0.004 (0.002), t = 2.030, p = 0.043]: higher Aβ accumulation was associated with lower AD-CM in relatively low physical activity condition (p &lt; 0.001), whereas no such association was observed in relatively high physical activity state (p = 0.791). The findings suggest that high midlife cognitive activity may accelerate hippocampal atrophy induced by APOE4, whereas high midlife physical activity may delay AD-related cerebral hypometabolism by weakening the influence of APOE4-associated Aβ retention.</p>

Tumor-specific genomic alterations allow systematic identification of genetic interactions that promote tumorigenesis and tumor vulnerabilities, offering novel strategies for development of targeted therapies for individual patients. We develop an Individualized Network-based Co-Mutation (INCM) methodology by inspecting over 2.5 million nonsynonymous somatic mutations derived from 6,789 tumor exomes across 14 cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas. Our INCM analysis reveals a higher genetic interaction burden on the significantly mutated genes, experimentally validated cancer genes, chromosome regulatory factors, and DNA damage repair genes, as compared to human pan-cancer essential genes identified by CRISPR-Cas9 screenings on 324 cancer cell lines. We find that genes involved in the cancer type-specific genetic subnetworks identified by INCM are significantly enriched in established cancer pathways, and the INCM-inferred putative genetic interactions are correlated with patient survival. By analyzing drug pharmacogenomics profiles from the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer database, we show that the network-predicted putative genetic interactions (e.g., BRCA2-TP53) are significantly correlated with sensitivity/resistance of multiple therapeutic agents. We experimentally validated that afatinib has the strongest cytotoxic activity on BT474 (IC<sub>50</sub> = 55.5 nM, <i>BRCA2</i> and <i>TP53</i> co-mutant) compared to MCF7 (IC<sub>50</sub> = 7.7 μM, both <i>BRCA2</i> and <i>TP53</i> wild type) and MDA-MB-231 (IC<sub>50</sub> = 7.9 μM, <i>BRCA2</i> wild type but <i>TP53</i> mutant). Finally, drug-target network analysis reveals several potential druggable genetic interactions by targeting tumor vulnerabilities. This study offers a powerful network-based methodology for identification of candidate therapeutic pathways that target tumor vulnerabilities and prioritization of potential pharmacogenomics biomarkers for development of personalized cancer medicine.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/N1wXPcJfXUo" width="1" />

Glioblastomas are aggressive primary brain tumors known for their inter- and intratumor heterogeneity. This disease is uniformly fatal, with intratumor heterogeneity the major reason for treatment failure and recurrence. Just like the nature vs nurture debate, heterogeneity can arise from intrinsic or environmental influences. Whilst it is impossible to clinically separate observed behavior of cells from their environmental context, using a mathematical framework combined with multiscale data gives us insight into the relative roles of variation from different sources. To better understand the implications of intratumor heterogeneity on therapeutic outcomes, we created a hybrid agent-based mathematical model that captures both the overall tumor kinetics and the individual cellular behavior. We track single cells as agents, cell density on a coarser scale, and growth factor diffusion and dynamics on a finer scale over time and space. Our model parameters were fit utilizing serial MRI imaging and cell tracking data from ex vivo tissue slices acquired from a growth-factor driven glioblastoma murine model. When fitting our model to serial imaging only, there was a spectrum of equally-good parameter fits corresponding to a wide range of phenotypic behaviors. When fitting our model using imaging and cell scale data, we determined that environmental heterogeneity alone is insufficient to match the single cell data, and intrinsic heterogeneity is required to fully capture the migration behavior. The wide spectrum of <i>in silico</i> tumors also had a wide variety of responses to an application of an anti-proliferative treatment. Recurrent tumors were generally less proliferative than pre-treatment tumors as measured via the model simulations and validated from human GBM patient histology. Further, we found that all tumors continued to grow with an anti-migratory treatment alone, but the anti-proliferative/anti-migratory combination generally showed improvement over an anti-proliferative treatment alone. Together our results emphasize the need to better understand the underlying phenotypes and tumor heterogeneity present in a tumor when designing therapeutic regimens.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/tzZcut6hJPo" width="1" />

Abstract
<p>Progressive loss of neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) is an early event in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), preceding the global degeneration of motor axons and being accompanied by new axonal sprouting within the same axonal arbor. Some aspects of ALS onset and progression seem to be affected by sex in animal models of the disease. However, whether there are sex-specific differences in the pattern or time course of NMJ loss and repair within single motor axons remains unknown. We performed further analysis of a previously published <i>in vivo</i> dataset, obtained from male and female SOD1<sup>G37R</sup> mice. We found that NMJ losses are as frequent in male and female motor axons but, intriguingly, axonal sprouting is more frequent in female than male mice, resulting in a net increase of axonal arborization. Interestingly, these numerous new axonal branches in female mice are associated with a slightly faster decline in grip strength, increased NMJ denervation, and reduced α-motor neuron survival. Collectively, these results suggest that excessive axonal sprouting and motor-unit (MU) expansion in female SOD1<sup>G37R</sup> mice are maladaptive during ALS progression.</p>

<p>Mitochondrial dysfunction is critically involved in Parkinson's disease, characterized by loss of dopaminergic neurons (DaNs) in the substantia nigra (SNc), whereas DaNs in the neighboring ventral tegmental area (VTA) are much less affected. In contrast to VTA, SNc DaNs engage calcium channels to generate action potentials, which lead to oxidant stress by yet unknown pathways. To determine the molecular mechanisms linking calcium load with selective cell death in the presence of mitochondrial deficiency, we analyzed the mitochondrial redox state and the mitochondrial membrane potential in mice of both sexes with genetically induced, severe mitochondrial dysfunction in DaNs (MitoPark mice), at the same time expressing a redox-sensitive GFP targeted to the mitochondrial matrix. Despite mitochondrial insufficiency in all DaNs, exclusively SNc neurons showed an oxidized redox-system, i.e., a low reduced/oxidized glutathione (GSH-GSSG) ratio. This was mimicked by cyanide, but not by rotenone or antimycin A, making the involvement of reactive oxygen species rather unlikely. Surprisingly, a high mitochondrial inner membrane potential was maintained in MitoPark SNc DaNs. Antagonizing calcium influx into the cell and into mitochondria, respectively, rescued the disturbed redox ratio and induced further hyperpolarization of the inner mitochondrial membrane. Our data therefore show that the constant calcium load in SNc DaNs is counterbalanced by a high mitochondrial inner membrane potential, even under conditions of severe mitochondrial dysfunction, but triggers a detrimental imbalance in the mitochondrial redox system, which will lead to neuron death. Our findings thus reveal a new mechanism, redox imbalance, which underlies the differential vulnerability of DaNs to mitochondrial defects.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Parkinson's disease is characterized by the preferential degeneration of dopaminergic neurons (DaNs) of the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc), resulting in the characteristic hypokinesia in patients. Ubiquitous pathological triggers cannot be responsible for the selective neuron loss. Here we show that mitochondrial impairment together with elevated calcium burden destabilize the mitochondrial antioxidant defense only in SNc DaNs, and thus promote the increased vulnerability of this neuron population.</p>

<p><i>TREM2</i> is an Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk gene expressed in microglia. To study the role of <i>Trem2</i> in a mouse model of β-amyloidosis, we compared PS2APP transgenic mice versus PS2APP mice lacking <i>Trem2</i> (PS2APP;Trem2<sup>ko</sup>) at ages ranging from 4 to 22 months. Microgliosis was impaired in PS2APP;Trem2<sup>ko</sup> mice, with <i>Trem2</i>-deficient microglia showing compromised expression of proliferation/Wnt-related genes and marked accumulation of ApoE. Plaque abundance was elevated in PS2APP;Trem2<sup>ko</sup> females at 6–7 months; but by 12 or 19–22 months of age, it was notably diminished in female and male PS2APP;Trem2<sup>ko</sup> mice, respectively. Across all ages, plaque morphology was more diffuse in PS2APP;Trem2<sup>ko</sup> brains, and the Aβ42:Aβ40 ratio was elevated. The amount of soluble, fibrillar Aβ oligomers also increased in PS2APP;Trem2<sup>ko</sup> hippocampi. Associated with these changes, axonal dystrophy was exacerbated from 6 to 7 months onward in PS2APP;Trem2<sup>ko</sup> mice, notwithstanding the reduced plaque load at later ages. PS2APP;Trem2<sup>ko</sup> mice also exhibited more dendritic spine loss around plaque and more neurofilament light chain in CSF. Thus, aggravated neuritic dystrophy is a more consistent outcome of <i>Trem2</i> deficiency than amyloid plaque load, suggesting that the microglial packing of Aβ into dense plaque is an important neuroprotective activity.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Genetic studies indicate that <i>TREM2</i> gene mutations confer increased Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk. We studied the effects of <i>Trem2</i> deletion in the PS2APP mouse AD model, in which overproduction of Aβ peptide leads to amyloid plaque formation and associated neuritic dystrophy. Interestingly, neuritic dystrophies were intensified in the brains of <i>Trem2</i>-deficient mice, despite these mice displaying reduced plaque accumulation at later ages (12–22 months). Microglial clustering around plaques was impaired, plaques were more diffuse, and the Aβ42:Aβ40 ratio and amount of soluble, fibrillar Aβ oligomers were elevated in <i>Trem2</i>-deficient brains. These results suggest that the Trem2-dependent compaction of Aβ into dense plaques is a protective microglial activity, limiting the exposure of neurons to toxic Aβ species.</p>

<p>Currently, the role of transient receptor potential vanilloid type 4 (TRPV4), a nonselective cation channel in the pathology of spinal cord injury (SCI), is not recognized. Herein, we report the expression and contribution of TRPV4 in the pathology of scarring and endothelial and secondary damage after SCI. TRPV4 expression increased during the inflammatory phase in female rats after SCI and was expressed primarily by cells at endothelial-microglial junctions. Two-photon microscopy of intracellular-free Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels revealed a biphasic increase at similar time points after SCI. Expression of TRPV4 at the injury epicenter, but not intracellular-free Ca<sup>2+</sup>, progressively increases with the severity of the injury. Activation of TRPV4 with specific agonist altered the organization of endothelial cells, affected tight junctions in the hCMEC/D3 BBB cell line <i>in vitro</i>, and increases the scarring in rat spinal cord as well as induced endothelial damage. By contrast, suppression of TRPV4 with a specific antagonist or in female <i>Trpv4</i> KO mouse attenuated inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, prevented the degradation of tight junction proteins, and preserve blood–spinal cord barrier integrity, thereby attenuate the scarring after SCI. Likewise, secondary damage was reduced, and behavioral outcomes were improved in <i>Trpv4</i> KO mice after SCI. These results suggest that increased TRPV4 expression disrupts endothelial cell organization during the early inflammatory phase of SCI, resulting in tissue damage, vascular destabilization, blood–spinal cord barrier breakdown, and scarring. Thus, TRPV4 inhibition/knockdown represents a promising therapeutic strategy to stabilize/protect endothelial cells, attenuate nociception and secondary damage, and reduce scarring after SCI.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> TRPV4, a calcium-permeable nonselective cation channel, is widely expressed in both excitable and nonexcitable cells. Spinal cord injury (SCI) majorly caused by trauma/accidents is associated with changes in osmolarity, mechanical injury, and shear stress. After SCI, TRPV4 was increased and were found to be linked with the severity of injury at the epicenter at the time points that were reported to be critical for repair/treatment. Activation of TRPV4 was damaging to endothelial cells that form the blood–spinal cord barrier and thus contributes to scarring (glial and fibrotic). Importantly, inhibition/knockdown of TRPV4 prevented these effects. Thus, the manipulation of TRPV4 signaling might lead to new therapeutic strategies or combinatorial therapies to protect endothelial cells and enhance repair after SCI.</p>

Because microglia are involved in clearing amyloid and tau pathology from the central nervous system, we hypothesized that cholinergic input originating from the basal forebrain might similarly regulate inflammatory immune responses to these pathologies in the aging brain. To explore this hypothesis, we leveraged the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative dataset. Cognitively normal older male and female human adults were differentiated according to the relative concentration of phosphorylated tau and amyloid in their cerebrospinal fluid, yielding neurotypical and preclinical, cognitively healthy, subgroups. We then tracked these two groups longitudinally with structural MRI and biomarkers of inflammation, including soluble sTREM2 levels in the CSF and complement <i>C3</i> expression in the blood transcriptome. Longitudinal loss of basal forebrain volume was larger in the preclinical compared with the neurotypical subgroup. Across preclinical adults, loss of basal forebrain volume was associated with greater longitudinal accumulation of sTREM2 and higher peripheral blood <i>C3</i> expression. None of these relationships were attributable to degeneration in the whole-brain gray matter volume. Preclinical APOE e4 carriers exhibited the largest loss of basal forebrain volume and highest C3 expression. Consistent with the known anti-inflammatory influence of the peripheral cholinergic pathways on macrophages, our findings indicate that a loss of central cholinergic input originating from the basal forebrain might remove a key check on microglial inflammation induced by amyloid and tau accumulation.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> In the peripheral nervous system, cholinergic modulation holds the reactivity of macrophages to blood-based pathogens in check, promoting clearance while preventing runaway inflammation and immune-triggered cell death. Microglia are the brain's resident macrophages and play an important role in clearing accumulated amyloid and tau from neurons. Here, we demonstrate that a loss of cholinergic integrity in the CNS, indexed by longitudinal decreases of basal forebrain volume, interacts with multiple biomarkers of inflammation in cognitively normal older adults with abnormal amyloid and tau pathology. These interactions were not detected in cognitively normal older adults with "neurotypical" levels of amyloid and tau. An age-related loss of cholinergic neuromodulation may remove key checks on microglial reactivity to amyloid and tau.</p>

<p>The declarative memory system allows us to accurately recognize a countless number of items and events, particularly those strengthened by repeated exposure. However, increased familiarity due to repetition can also lead to false recognition of related but new items, particularly when mechanisms supporting fine-grain mnemonic discrimination fail. The hippocampus is thought to be particularly important in separating overlapping cortical inputs during encoding so that similar experiences can be differentiated. In the current study of male and female human subjects, we examine how neural pattern similarity between repeated exemplars of a given concept (e.g., apple) influences true and false memory for target or lure images. Consistent with past work, we found that subsequent true recognition was related to pattern similarity between concept exemplars and the entire encoding set (global encoding similarity), particularly in ventral visual stream. In addition, memory for an individual target exemplar (a specific apple) could be predicted solely by the degree of pattern overlap between the other exemplars (different apple pictures) of that concept (concept-specific encoding similarity). Critically, subsequent false memory for lures was mitigated when high concept-specific similarity in cortical areas was accompanied by differentiated hippocampal representations of the corresponding exemplars. Furthermore, both true and false memory entailed the reinstatement of concept-related information at varying levels of specificity. These results link both true and false memory to a measure of concept strength expressed in the overlap of cortical representations, and importantly, illustrate how the hippocampus serves to separate concurrent cortical overlap in the service of detailed memory.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> In some instances, the same processes that help promote memory for a general idea or concept can also hinder more detailed memory judgments, which may involve differentiating between closely related items. The current study shows that increased overlap in cortical representations for conceptually-related pictures is associated with increased recognition of repeated concept pictures. Whether similar lure items were falsely remembered as old further depended on the hippocampus, where the presence of more distinct representations protected against later false memory. This work suggests that the differentiability of brain patterns during perception is related to the differentiability of items in memory, but that fine-grain discrimination depends on the interaction between cortex and hippocampus.</p>

<p>Memory consolidation is hypothesized to involve the distribution and restructuring of memory representations across hippocampal and cortical regions. Theories suggest that, through extended hippocampal–cortical interactions, cortical ensembles come to represent more integrated, or overlapping, memory traces that prioritize commonalities across related memories. Sleep processes, particularly fast sleep spindles, are thought to support consolidation, but evidence for this relationship has been mostly limited to memory retention benefits. Whether fast spindles provide a mechanism for neural changes hypothesized to support consolidation, including the strengthening of hippocampal–cortical networks and integration across memory representations, remains unclear, as does the specificity of regions involved. Using functional connectivity analyses of human fMRI data (both sexes), we show that fast spindle density during overnight sleep is related to enhanced hippocampal–cortical functional connectivity the next day, when restudying information learned before sleep. Spindle density modulated connectivity in distinct hippocampal–cortical networks depending on the category of the consolidated stimuli. Specifically, spindle density correlated with functional connectivity between anterior hippocampus and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) for object–word pairs, and posterior hippocampus and posteromedial cortex for scene–word pairs. Using multivariate pattern analyses, we also show that fast spindle density during postlearning sleep is associated with greater pattern similarity, or representational overlap, across individual object–word memories in vmPFC the next day. Further, the relationship between fast spindle density and representational overlap in vmPFC was mediated by the degree of anterior hippocampal–vmPFC functional connectivity. Together, these results suggest that fast spindles support the network distribution of memory traces, potentially restructuring memory representations in vmPFC.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> How new experiences are transformed into long-term memories remains a fundamental question for neuroscience research. Theories suggest that memories are stabilized as they are reorganized in the brain, a process thought to be supported by sleep oscillations, particularly sleep spindles. Although sleep spindles have been associated with benefits in memory retention, it is not well understood how spindles modify neural memory traces. This study found that spindles during overnight sleep correlate with changes in neural memory traces, including enhanced functional connectivity in distinct hippocampal–cortical networks and increased pattern similarity among memories in the cortex. The results provide critical evidence that spindles during overnight sleep may act as a physiological mechanism for the restructuring of neural memory traces.</p>

<p>Recent trends in cannabis legalization have increased the necessity to better understand the effects of cannabis use. Animal models involving traditional cannabinoid self-administration approaches have been notoriously difficult to establish and differences in the drug used and its route of administration have limited the translational value of preclinical studies. To address this challenge in the field, we have developed a novel method of cannabis self-administration using response-contingent delivery of vaporized <sup>9</sup>-tetrahydrocannabinol-rich (CAN<sub>THC</sub>) or cannabidiol-rich (CAN<sub>CBD</sub>) whole-plant cannabis extracts. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were trained to nose-poke for discrete puffs of CAN<sub>THC</sub>, CAN<sub>CBD</sub>, or vehicle (VEH) in daily 1 h sessions. Cannabis vapor reinforcement resulted in strong discrimination between active and inactive operanda. CAN<sub>THC</sub> maintained higher response rates under fixed ratio schedules and higher break points under progressive ratio schedules compared with CAN<sub>CBD</sub> or VEH, and the number of vapor deliveries positively correlated with plasma THC concentrations. Moreover, metabolic phenotyping studies revealed alterations in locomotor activity, energy expenditure, and daily food intake that are consistent with effects in human cannabis users. Furthermore, both cannabis regimens produced ecologically relevant brain concentrations of THC and CBD and CAN<sub>THC</sub> administration decreased hippocampal CB1 receptor binding. Removal of CAN<sub>THC</sub> reinforcement (but not CAN<sub>CBD</sub>) resulted in a robust extinction burst and an increase in cue-induced cannabis-seeking behavior relative to VEH. These data indicate that volitional exposure to THC-rich cannabis vapor has bona fide reinforcing properties and collectively support the utility of the vapor self-administration model for the preclinical assessment of volitional cannabis intake and cannabis-seeking behaviors.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The evolving legal landscape concerning recreational cannabis use has increased urgency to better understand its effects on the brain and behavior. Animal models are advantageous in this respect; however, current approaches typically used forced injections of synthetic cannabinoids or isolated cannabis constituents that may not capture the complex effects of volitional cannabis consumption. We have developed a novel model of cannabis self-administration using response-contingent delivery of vaporized cannabis extracts containing high concentrations of <sup>9</sup> tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) or cannabidiol. Our data indicate that THC-rich cannabis vapor has reinforcing properties that support stable rates of responding and conditioned drug-seeking behavior. This approach will be valuable for interrogating effects of cannabis and delineating neural mechanisms that give rise to aberrant cannabis-seeking behavior.</p>

<p>Neuronal circuits that control motor behaviors orchestrate multiple tasks, including the inhibition of self-generated sensory signals. In the hermaphroditic leech, T and P mechanosensory neurons respond to light touch and pressure on the skin, respectively. We show that the low threshold T cells were also sensitive to topological changes of the animal surface, caused by contraction of the muscles that erect the skin annuli. P cells were unresponsive to this movement. Annuli erection is part of the contraction phase of crawling, a leech locomotive behavior. In isolated ganglia, T cells showed phase-dependent IPSPs during dopamine-induced fictive crawling, whereas P cells were unaffected. The timing and magnitude of the T-IPSPs were highly correlated with the activity of the motoneurons excited during the contraction phase. Together, the results suggest that the central network responsible for crawling sends a reafferent signal onto the T cells, concomitant with the signal to the motoneurons. This reafference is specifically targeted at the sensory neurons that are affected by the movements; and it is behaviorally relevant as excitation of T cells affected the rhythmic motor pattern, probably acting upon the rhythmogenic circuit. Corollary discharge is a highly conserved function of motor systems throughout evolution, and we provide clear evidence of the specificity of its targets and timing and of the benefit of counteracting self-generated sensory input.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Neuronal circuits that control motor behaviors orchestrate multiple tasks, including inhibition of sensory signals originated by the animal movement, a phenomenon known as corollary discharge. Leeches crawl on solid surfaces through a sequence of elongation and contraction movements. During the contraction, the skin topology changes, affecting a subpopulation of mechanosensory receptors, T (touch) neurons, but not P (pressure) sensory neurons. In the isolated nervous system, T neurons were inhibited during the contraction but not during the elongation phase, whereas P cells were unaffected throughout crawling. Excitation of T cells during the contraction phase temporarily disrupted the rhythmic pattern. Thus, corollary discharge was target (T vs P) and phase (contraction vs elongation) specific, and prevented self-generated signals to perturb motor behaviors.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/40/9/1874?rss=1">Neural Mechanisms Underlying High-Frequency Vestibulocollic Reflexes In Humans And Monkeys</a></h4>

<p>The vestibulocollic reflex is a compensatory response that stabilizes the head in space. During everyday activities, this stabilizing response is evoked by head movements that typically span frequencies from 0 to 30 Hz. Transient head impacts, however, can elicit head movements with frequency content up to 300–400 Hz, raising the question whether vestibular pathways contribute to head stabilization at such high frequencies. Here, we first established that electrical vestibular stimulation modulates human neck motor unit (MU) activity at sinusoidal frequencies up to 300 Hz, but that sensitivity increases with frequency up to a low-pass cutoff of ~70–80 Hz. To examine the neural substrates underlying the low-pass dynamics of vestibulocollic reflexes, we then recorded vestibular afferent responses to the same electrical stimuli in monkeys. Vestibular afferents also responded to electrical stimuli up to 300 Hz, but in contrast to MUs their sensitivity increased with frequency up to the afferent resting firing rate (~100–150 Hz) and at higher frequencies afferents tended to phase-lock to the vestibular stimulus. This latter nonlinearity, however, was not transmitted to neck motoneurons, which instead showed minimal phase-locking that decreased at frequencies &gt;75 Hz. Similar to human data, we validated that monkey muscle activity also exhibited low-pass filtered vestibulocollic reflex dynamics. Together, our results show that neck MUs are activated by high-frequency signals encoded by primary vestibular afferents, but undergo low-pass filtering at intermediate stages in the vestibulocollic reflex. These high-frequency contributions to vestibular-evoked neck muscle responses could stabilize the head during unexpected head transients.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Vestibular-evoked neck muscle responses rely on accurate encoding and transmission of head movement information to stabilize the head in space. Unexpected transient events, such as head impacts, are likely to push the limits of these neural pathways since their high-frequency features (0–300 Hz) extend beyond the frequency bandwidth of head movements experienced during everyday activities (0–30 Hz). Here, we demonstrate that vestibular primary afferents encode high-frequency stimuli through frequency-dependent increases in sensitivity and phase-locking. When transmitted to neck motoneurons, these signals undergo low-pass filtering that limits neck motoneuron phase-locking in response to stimuli &gt;75 Hz. This study provides insight into the neural dynamics producing vestibulocollic reflexes, which may respond to high-frequency transient events to stabilize the head.</p>

<p>Neurons in the visual system integrate over a wide range of spatial scales. This diversity is thought to enable both local and global computations. To understand how spatial information is encoded across the mouse visual system, we use two-photon imaging to measure receptive fields (RFs) and size-tuning in primary visual cortex (V1) and three downstream higher visual areas (HVAs: LM (lateromedial), AL (anterolateral), and PM (posteromedial)) in mice of both sexes. Neurons in PM, compared with V1 or the other HVAs, have significantly larger RF sizes and less surround suppression, independent of stimulus eccentricity or contrast. To understand how this specialization of RFs arises in the HVAs, we measured the spatial properties of V1 inputs to each area. Spatial integration of V1 axons was remarkably similar across areas and significantly different from the tuning of neurons in their target HVAs. Thus, unlike other visual features studied in this system, specialization of spatial integration in PM cannot be explained by specific projections from V1 to the HVAs. Further, the differences in RF properties could not be explained by differences in convergence of V1 inputs to the HVAs. Instead, our data suggest that distinct inputs from other areas or connectivity within PM may support the area's unique ability to encode global features of the visual scene, whereas V1, LM, and AL may be more specialized for processing local features.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Surround suppression is a common feature of visual processing whereby large stimuli are less effective at driving neuronal responses than smaller stimuli. This is thought to enhance efficiency in the population code and enable higher-order processing of visual information, such as figure-ground segregation. However, this comes at the expense of global computations. Here we find that surround suppression is not equally represented across mouse visual areas: primary visual cortex has substantially more surround suppression than higher visual areas, and one higher area has significantly less suppression than two others examined, suggesting that these areas have distinct functional roles. Thus, we have identified a novel dimension of specialization in the mouse visual cortex that may enable both local and global computations.</p>

<p>Severe loss of excitatory synapses in key brain regions is thought to be one of the major mechanisms underlying stress-induced cognitive impairment. To date, however, the identity of the affected circuits remains elusive. Here we examined the effect of exposure to repeated multiple concurrent stressors (RMS) on the connectivity of the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) in adolescent male mice. We found that RMS led to layer-specific elimination of excitatory synapses with the most pronounced loss observed in deeper cortical layers. Quantitative analysis of cortical projections to the PPC revealed a significant loss of sensory and retrosplenial inputs to the PPC while contralateral and frontal projections were preserved. These results were confirmed by decreased synaptic strength from sensory, but not from contralateral, projections in stress-exposed animals. Functionally, RMS disrupted visuospatial working memory performance, implicating disrupted higher-order visual processing. These effects were not observed in mice subjected to restraint-only stress for an identical period of time. The PPC is considered to be a cortical hub for multisensory integration, working memory, and perceptual decision-making. Our data suggest that sensory information streams targeting the PPC may be impacted by recurring stress, likely contributing to stress-induced cognitive impairment.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Repeated exposure to stress profoundly impairs cognitive functions like memory, attention, or decision-making. There is emerging evidence that stress not only impacts high-order regions of the brain, but may affect earlier stages of cognitive processing. Our work focuses on the posterior parietal cortex, a brain region supporting short-term memory, multisensory integration, and decision-making. We show evidence that repeated stress specifically damages sensory inputs to this region. This disruption of synaptic connectivity is linked to working memory impairment and is specific to repeated exposure to multiple stressors. Altogether, our data provide a potential alternative explanation to ailments previously attributed to downstream, cognitive brain structures.</p>

<p>Natural scenes often contain multiple objects and surfaces. However, how neurons in the visual cortex represent multiple visual stimuli is not well understood. Previous studies have shown that, when multiple stimuli compete in one feature domain, the evoked neuronal response is biased toward the stimulus that has a stronger signal strength. We recorded from two male macaques to investigate how neurons in the middle temporal cortex (MT) represent multiple stimuli that compete in more than one feature domain. Visual stimuli were two random-dot patches moving in different directions. One stimulus had low luminance contrast and moved with high coherence, whereas the other had high contrast and moved with low coherence. We found that how MT neurons represent multiple stimuli depended on the spatial arrangement. When two stimuli were overlapping, MT responses were dominated by the stimulus component that had high contrast. When two stimuli were spatially separated within the receptive fields, the contrast dominance was abolished. We found the same results when using contrast to compete with motion speed. Our neural data and computer simulations using a V1-MT model suggest that the contrast dominance found with overlapping stimuli is due to normalization occurring at an input stage fed to MT, and MT neurons cannot overturn this bias based on their own feature selectivity. The interaction between spatially separated stimuli can largely be explained by normalization within MT. Our results revealed new rules on stimulus competition and highlighted the impact of hierarchical processing on representing multiple stimuli in the visual cortex.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Previous studies have shown that the neural representation of multiple visual stimuli can be accounted for by a divisive normalization model. By using multiple stimuli that compete in more than one feature domain, we found that luminance contrast has a dominant effect in determining competition between multiple stimuli when they are overlapping but not spatially separated. Our results revealed that neuronal responses to multiple stimuli in a given cortical area cannot be simply predicted by the population neural responses elicited in that area by the individual stimulus components. To understand the neural representation of multiple stimuli, rather than considering response normalization only within the area of interest, one must consider the computations including normalization occurring along the hierarchical visual pathway.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/40/9/1819?rss=1">Conserved Tao Kinase Activity Regulates Dendritic Arborization, Cytoskeletal Dynamics, and Sensory Function in Drosophila</a></h4>

<p>Dendritic arborization is highly regulated and requires tight control of dendritic growth, branching, cytoskeletal dynamics, and ion channel expression to ensure proper function. Abnormal dendritic development can result in altered network connectivity, which has been linked to neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). How neuronal growth control programs tune dendritic arborization to ensure function is still not fully understood. Using <i>Drosophila</i> dendritic arborization (da) neurons as a model, we identified the conserved Ste20-like kinase Tao as a negative regulator of dendritic arborization. We show that Tao kinase activity regulates cytoskeletal dynamics and sensory channel localization required for proper sensory function in both male and female flies. We further provide evidence for functional conservation of Tao kinase, showing that its ASD-linked human ortholog, Tao kinase 2 (Taok2), could replace <i>Drosophila</i> Tao and rescue dendritic branching, dynamic microtubule alterations, and behavioral defects. However, several ASD-linked Taok2 variants displayed impaired rescue activity, suggesting that Tao/Taok2 mutations can disrupt sensory neuron development and function. Consistently, we show that Tao kinase activity is required in developing and as well as adult stages for maintaining normal dendritic arborization and sensory function to regulate escape and social behavior. Our data suggest an important role for Tao kinase signaling in cytoskeletal organization to maintain proper dendritic arborization and sensory function, providing a strong link between developmental sensory aberrations and behavioral abnormalities relevant for Taok2-dependent ASDs.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are linked to abnormal dendritic arbors. However, the mechanisms of how dendritic arbors develop to promote functional and proper behavior are unclear. We identified <i>Drosophila</i> Tao kinase, the ortholog of the ASD risk gene Taok2, as a regulator of dendritic arborization in sensory neurons. We show that Tao kinase regulates cytoskeletal dynamics, controls sensory ion channel localization, and is required to maintain somatosensory function <i>in vivo</i>. Interestingly, ASD-linked human Taok2 mutations rendered it nonfunctional, whereas its WT form could restore neuronal morphology and function in <i>Drosophila</i> lacking endogenous Tao. Our findings provide evidence for a conserved role of Tao kinase in dendritic development and function of sensory neurons, suggesting that aberrant sensory function might be a common feature of ASDs.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/40/9/1810?rss=1">Longitudinal Development of Brain Iron Is Linked to Cognition in Youth</a></h4>

<p>Brain iron is vital to multiple aspects of brain function, including oxidative metabolism, myelination, and neurotransmitter synthesis. Atypical iron concentration in the basal ganglia is associated with neurodegenerative disorders in aging and cognitive deficits. However, the normative development of brain iron concentration in adolescence and its relationship to cognition are less well understood. Here, we address this gap in a longitudinal sample of 922 humans aged 8–26 years at the first visit (M = 15.1, SD = 3.72; 336 males, 486 females) with up to four multiecho T2* scans each. Using this sample of 1236 imaging sessions, we assessed the longitudinal developmental trajectories of tissue iron in the basal ganglia. We quantified tissue iron concentration using R2* relaxometry within four basal ganglia regions, including the caudate, putamen, nucleus accumbens, and globus pallidus. The longitudinal development of R2* was modeled using generalized additive mixed models (GAMMs) with splines to capture linear and nonlinear developmental processes. We observed significant increases in R2* across all regions, with the greatest and most prolonged increases occurring in the globus pallidus and putamen. Further, we found that the developmental trajectory of R2* in the putamen is significantly related to individual differences in cognitive ability, such that greater cognitive ability is increasingly associated with greater iron concentration through late adolescence and young-adulthood. Together, our results suggest a prolonged period of basal ganglia iron enrichment that extends into the mid-twenties, with diminished iron concentration associated with poorer cognitive ability during late adolescence.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Brain tissue iron is essential to healthy brain function. Atypical basal ganglia tissue iron levels have been linked to impaired cognition in iron deficient children and adults with neurodegenerative disorders. However, the normative developmental trajectory of basal ganglia iron concentration during adolescence and its association with cognition are less well understood. In the largest study of tissue iron development yet reported, we characterize the developmental trajectory of tissue iron concentration across the basal ganglia during adolescence and provide evidence that diminished iron content is associated with poorer cognitive performance even in healthy youth. These results highlight the transition from adolescence to adulthood as a period of dynamic maturation of tissue iron concentration in the basal ganglia.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/40/9/1795?rss=1">The Origin of Physiological Local mGluR1 Supralinear Ca2+ Signals in Cerebellar Purkinje Neurons</a></h4>

<p>In mouse cerebellar Purkinje neurons (PNs), the climbing fiber (CF) input provides a signal to parallel fiber (PF) synapses, triggering PF synaptic plasticity. This signal is given by supralinear Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients, associated with the CF synaptic potential and colocalized with the PF Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, occurring only when PF activity precedes the CF input. Here, we unravel the biophysical determinants of supralinear Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals associated with paired PF-CF synaptic activity. We used membrane potential (<i>V</i><sub>m</sub>) and Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging to investigate the local CF-associated Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx following a train of PF synaptic potentials in two cases: (1) when the dendritic <i>V</i><sub>m</sub> is hyperpolarized below the resting <i>V</i><sub>m</sub>, and (2) when the dendritic <i>V</i><sub>m</sub> is at rest. We found that supralinear Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals are mediated by type-1 metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR1s) when the CF input is delayed by 100–150 ms from the first PF input in both cases. When the dendrite is hyperpolarized only, however, mGluR1s boost neighboring T-type channels, providing a mechanism for local coincident detection of PF-CF activity. The resulting Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevation is locally amplified by saturation of endogenous Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffers produced by the PF-associated Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx via the mGluR1-mediated nonselective cation conductance. In contrast, when the dendritic <i>V</i><sub>m</sub> is at rest, mGluR1s increase dendritic excitability by inactivating A-type K<sup>+</sup> channels, but this phenomenon is not restricted to the activated PF synapses. Thus, <i>V</i><sub>m</sub> is likely a crucial parameter in determining PF synaptic plasticity, and the occurrence of hyperpolarization episodes is expected to play an important role in motor learning.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> In Purkinje neurons, parallel fiber synaptic plasticity, determined by coincident activation of the climbing fiber input, underlies cerebellar learning. We unravel the biophysical mechanisms allowing the CF input to produce a local Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal exclusively at the sites of activated parallel fibers. We show that when the membrane potential is hyperpolarized with respect to the resting membrane potential, type-1 metabotropic glutamate receptors locally enhance Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx mediated by T-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, and that this signal is amplified by saturation of endogenous buffer also mediated by the same receptors. The combination of these two mechanisms is therefore capable of producing a Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal at the activated parallel fiber sites, suggesting a role of Purkinje neuron membrane potential in cerebellar learning.</p>

ABSTRACT<p>Nicotine use increases the risk for subsequent abuse of other addictive drugs, but the biological basis underlying this risk remains largely unknown. Interactions between nicotine and other drugs of abuse may arise from nicotine-induced neural adaptations in the mesolimbic dopamine system, a common pathway for the reinforcing effects of many addictive substances. Previous work identified nicotine-induced neuroadaptations that alter inhibitory transmission in the ventral tegmental area (VTA). Here, we test whether nicotine-induced dysregulation of GABAergic signaling within the VTA increases the vulnerability for benzodiazepine abuse that has been reported in smokers. We demonstrate in rats that nicotine exposure dysregulates diazepam-induced inhibition of VTA GABA neurons and increases diazepam consumption. In VTA GABA neurons, nicotine impaired KCC2-mediated chloride extrusion, depolarized the GABA<sub>A</sub> reversal potential, and shifted the pharmacological effect of diazepam on GABA neurons from inhibition toward excitation. In parallel, nicotine-related alterations in GABA signaling observed <i>ex vivo</i> were associated with enhanced diazepam-induced inhibition of lateral VTA DA neurons <i>in vivo</i>. Targeting KCC2 with the agonist CLP290 normalized diazepam-induced effects on VTA GABA transmission and reduced diazepam consumption following nicotine administration to the control level. Together, our results provide insights into midbrain circuit alterations resulting from nicotine exposure that contribute to the abuse of other drugs, such as benzodiazepines.</p><p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Benzodiazepines, particularly diazepam, are among the most frequently prescribed drugs for their anxiolytic, sedative, and anti-convulsant effects. In general, benzodiazepines have a relatively low abuse liability, yet misuse occurs more frequently among smokers. Pharmacologically, benzodiazepines act on the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor, enhancing the effect of the inhibitory neurotransmitter. Our work suggests that nicotine increases vulnerability to diazepam use via aberrant inhibitory signaling in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), a principle nucleus of the brain’s reward system. Specifically, we found that nicotine exposure impaired VTA GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor function, resulting in altered effects of diazepam on dopamine circuitry and increased diazepam consumption. Furthermore, we identify a novel therapeutic target, which may serve to mitigate excessive diazepam consumption in smoking or vaping individuals.</p>

<p>A large network of integrate-and-fire neurons is studied analytically when
the synaptic weights are independently randomly distributed according to a
Gaussian distribution with arbitrary mean and variance. The relevant order
parameters are identified, and it is shown that such network is statistically
equivalent to an ensemble of independent integrate-and-fire neurons with each
input signal given by the sum of a self-interaction deterministic term and a
Gaussian colored noise. The model is able to reproduce the quasi-synchronous
oscillations, and the dropout of their frequency, of the central nervous system
neurons of the swimming Xenopus tadpole. Predictions from the model are
proposed for future experiments.

<p>Neurons communicate with spikes, which are discrete events in time.
Functional network models often employ rate units that are continuously coupled
by analog signals. Is there a benefit of discrete signaling? By a unified
mean-field theory we show that large random networks of rate and binary units
have identical second order statistics. Yet their stimulus processing
properties are radically different: We discover a chaotic sub-manifold in
binary networks that does not exist in rate models. Its dimensionality
increases with time after stimulus onset and reaches a fixed point depending on
the synaptic coupling strength. Low dimensional stimuli are transiently
expanded into higher-dimensional representations within this manifold. High
noise resilience persists not only near the edge of chaos, but throughout the
chaotic regime. In rate models of spiking activity, the effective spiking noise
suppresses chaos, severely impairing classification performance. Chaotic rate
networks without effective spiking noise also show the transient performance
boost. The transition to chaos in the two models do not coincide and have
qualitatively different causes. Our theory mechanistically explains these
observations. These findings have several implications. 1) Discrete state
networks reach optimal performance with weaker synapses; implying lower
energetic costs for synaptic transmission. 2) The classification mechanism is
robust to noise, compatible with fluctuations in biophysical systems. 3)
Optimal performance is reached after only a single activation per participating
neuron; demonstrating event-based computation with short latencies. 4) The
chaotic sub-manifold predicts a transient increase of variability after
stimulus onset. Our results thus provide a hitherto unknown link between
recurrent and chaotic dynamics of functional networks, neuronal variability,
and dimensionality of neuronal responses.

<p>Malfunctioning neurons in the brain sometimes operate synchronously,
reportedly causing many neurological diseases, e.g. Parkinson's. Suppression
and control of this collective synchronous activity are therefore of great
importance for neuroscience, and can only rely on limited engineering trials
due to the need to experiment with live human brains. We present the first
Reinforcement Learning gym framework that emulates this collective behavior of
neurons and allows us to find suppression parameters for the environment of
synthetic degenerate models of neurons. We successfully suppress synchrony via
RL for three pathological signaling regimes, characterize the framework's
stability to noise, and further remove the unwanted oscillations by engaging
multiple PPO agents.

<p>Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) technology, which is amongst the most used non-invasive brain stimulation techniques currently available, has developed rapidly from 2009 to 2018. However, reports on the trends of rTMS using bibliometric analysis are rare. The goal of the present bibliometric analysis is to analyze and visualize the trends of rTMS, including general (publication patterns) and emerging trends (research frontiers), over the last 10 years by using the visual analytic tool CiteSpace V. Publications related to rTMS from 2009 to 2018 were retrieved from the Web of Science (WoS) database, including 2,986 peer-reviewed articles/reviews. Active authors, journals, institutions, and countries were identified by WoS and visualized by CiteSpace V, which could also detect burst changes to identify emerging trends. GraphPad Prism 8 was used to analyze the time trend of annual publication outputs. The USA ranked first in this field. Pascual-Leone A (author A), Fitzgerald PB (author B), George MS (author C), Lefaucheur JP (author D), and Fregni F (author E) made great contributions to this field of study. The most prolific institution to publish rTMS-related publications in the last decade was the University of Toronto. The journal Brain Stimulation published most papers. Lefaucheur et al.'s paper in 2014, and the keyword “sham controlled trial” showed the strongest citation bursts by the end of 2018, which indicates increased attention to the underlying work, thereby indicating the research frontiers. This study reveals the publication patterns and emerging trends of rTMS based on the records published from 2009 to 2018. The insights obtained have reference values for the future research and application of rTMS.</p>

<p>Decreased expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1α (PGC-1α) is implicated in the pathophysiology of Parkinson’s disease (PD). However, our understanding of the mechanism regulating the PGC-1α expression is still limited. We sought to determine whether the epigenetic modification of PPARGC1A (the gene encoding PGC-1α) could account for its diminished expression. We performed a study of PPARGC1A risk-SNP genotypes, methylation level, and the expression in blood from 171 subjects. The mean DNA methylation level of PPARGC1A intron 1 in patients with PD was higher than that in the controls (7.18 ± 1.74 vs. 6.36 ± 1.28, P = 0.007). A detailed comparison of the DNA methylation level at each CpG site showed that CpG_1, CpG_13.14, CpG_17.18, and CpG_20 were significantly hypermethylated in patients with PD. There was a significant negative correlation between PPARGC1A methylation and expression level (R = −0.404, P &lt; 0.001). We found no correlations between the PPARGC1A methylation level and the clinical features, while the CpG_13.14 site methylation level was positively correlated with H&amp;Y stage (R = 0.246, P = 0.020) and was increased in people carrying the rs2970848 AA genotype compared with that in carriers of the AG/GG genotype (7.27 ± 1.86 vs. 6.65 ± 1.92, P = 0.032). Our results support a link between PPARGC1A methylation, gene expression, and variability, which indicated that a novel epigenetic regulatory mechanism controlling PPARGC1A expression influences PD pathogenesis.</p>

<p>Previous research demonstrated that cognitive conflict could induce an affective priming effect, and the stage (detection/resolution) of conflict processing led to different directions (positive/negative) of the affective priming effect. We suggested that rewards play a critical role in the affective priming effect on conflict resolution. The present study used event-related potentials (ERPs), using the arrow flanker task as primes and choosing specific affective words as targets to investigate the affective priming effect induced by cognitive conflict during the resolution stage. Our question was whether rewards created a modulating effect. Participants were asked to judge the congruency of the prime stimuli and then evaluate the valence of the target words. For behavioral results, the conflict effect was significant, and the reward promoted the behavioral performance of participants. For ERP results, enhanced N2 amplitudes for incongruent primes indicated a significant conflict effect. More importantly, as expected, in the rewarded condition, the enhanced N400 amplitudes for positive targets following incongruent primes were found, indicating a positive priming effect. However, in the unrewarded condition, the reduced N400 amplitudes for positive targets following incongruent primes were found, indicating conflict resolution hindered the processing of positive stimuli. These findings suggested that cognitive conflict-induced the positive priming effect during the resolution stage and that rewards had a moderating effect on the positive priming effect.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00051">The Relationship Between Attentional Capture by Speech and Nonfluent Speech Under Delayed Auditory Feedback: A Pilot Examination of a Dual-Task Using Auditory or Tactile Stimulation</a></h4>

<p>Delayed auditory feedback (DAF) leads to nonfluent speech where the voice of a speaker is heard after a delay. Previous studies suggested the involvement of attention to auditory feedback in speech disfluency. To date, there are no studies that have revealed the relationship between attention and nonfluent speech by controlling the attention allocated to the delayed own voice. This study examined these issues under three conditions: a single task where the subject was asked to read aloud under DAF (single DAF task), a dual task where the subject was asked to read aloud while reacting to a pure tone (auditory DAF task), and a dual task where the subject was asked to read aloud while reacting to the vibration of their finger (tactile DAF task). The subjects also performed the single and dual tasks (auditory/tactile) under nonaltered auditory feedback where no delayed voices were involved. Results showed that the nonfluency rate under the auditory DAF task was significantly greater than that under the single DAF task. In contrast, the nonfluency rate under the tactile DAF task was significantly lower compared with that of the single DAF task. Speech became nonfluent when attention was captured by the same modality stimulus, i.e., auditory tone. In contrast, speech became fluent when attention was allocated to the stimulus that is irreverent to auditory modality, i.e., tactile vibration. This indicates that nonfluent speech under DAF is involved in attention capture owing to the delayed own voice.</p>

<p>Several neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) including Developmental Dyslexia (DD), Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), but not Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder (ADHD), are reported to show deficits in global motion processing. Such behavioral deficits have been linked to a temporal processing deficiency. However, to date, there have been few studies assessing the temporal processing efficiency of the Magnocellular M pathways through temporal modulation. Hence, we measured achromatic flicker fusion thresholds at high and low contrast in nonselective samples of NDDs and neurotypicals (mean age 10, range 7–12 years, n = 71) individually, and group matched, for both chronological age and nonverbal intelligence. Autistic tendencies were also measured using the Autism-Spectrum Quotient questionnaire as high AQ scores have previously been associated with the greater physiological amplitude of M-generated nonlinearities. The NDD participants presented with singular or comorbid combinations of DD, ASD, and ADHD. The results showed that ASD and DD, including those with comorbid ADHD, demonstrated significantly lower flicker fusion thresholds (FFTs) than their matched controls. Participants with a singular diagnosis of ADHD did not differ from controls in the FFTs. Overall, the entire NDD plus control populations showed a significant negative correlation between FFT and AQ scores (r = −0.269, p &lt; 0.02 n = 71). In conclusion, this study presents evidence showing that a temporally inefficient M pathway could be the unifying network at fault across the NDDs and particularly in ASD and DD diagnoses, but not in singular diagnosis of ADHD.</p>

<p>Sensory dysfunction is prevalent in cerebral palsy (CP). Evidence suggests that sensory deficits can contribute to manual ability impairments in children with CP, yet it is still unclear how they contribute to balance and motor performance. Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate the relationship between lower extremity (LE) somatosensation and functional performance in children with CP. Ten participants with spastic diplegia (Gross Motor Function Classification Scale: I-III) and who were able to stand independently completed the study. Threshold of light touch pressure, two-point discriminatory ability of the plantar side of the foot, duration of cutaneous vibration sensation, and error in the joint position sense of the ankle were assessed to quantify somatosensory function. The balance was tested by the Balance Evaluation System Test (BESTest) and postural sway measures during a standing task. Motor performance was evaluated by using a battery of clinical assessments: (1) Gross Motor Function Measure (GMFM-66-IS) to test gross motor ability; (2) spatiotemporal gait characteristics (velocity, step length) to evaluate walking ability; (3) Timed Up and Go (TUG) and 6 Min Walk (6MWT) tests to assess functional mobility; and (4) an isokinetic dynamometer was used to test the Maximum Volitional Isometric Contraction (MVIC) of the plantar flexor muscles. The results showed that the light touch pressure measure was strongly associated only with the 6MWT. Vibration and two-point discrimination were strongly related to balance performance. Further, the vibration sensation of the first metatarsal head demonstrated a significantly strong relationship with motor performance as measured by GMFM-66-IS, spatiotemporal gait parameters, TUG, and ankle plantar flexors strength test. The joint position sense of the ankle was only related to one subdomain of the BESTest (Postural Responses). This study provides preliminary evidence that LE sensory deficits can possibly contribute to the pronounced balance and motor impairments in CP. The findings emphasize the importance of developing a thorough LE sensory test battery that can guide traditional treatment protocols toward a more holistic therapeutic approach by combining both motor and sensory rehabilitative strategies to improve motor function in CP.</p>

Purpose<p>Epilepsy therapy is currently based on anti-seizure drugs that do not modify the course of the disease, i.e., they are not anti-epileptogenic in nature. Previously, we observed that in vivo casein kinase 2 (CK2) inhibition with 4,5,6,7-tetrabromotriazole (TBB) had anti-epileptogenic effects in the acute epilepsy slice model.</p>Methods<p>Here, we pretreated rats with TBB in vivo prior to the establishment of a pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus (SE) in order to analyze the long-term sequelae of such a preventive TBB administration.</p>Results<p>We found that TBB pretreatment delayed onset of seizures after pilocarpine and slowed down disease progression during epileptogenesis. This was accompanied with a reduced proportion of burst firing neurons in the CA1 area. Western blot analyses demonstrated that CA1 tissue from TBB-pretreated epileptic animals contained significantly less CK2 than TBB-pretreated controls. On the transcriptional level, TBB pretreatment led to differential gene expression changes of K<sub>Ca</sub>2.2, but also of HCN1 and HCN3 channels. Thus, in the presence of the HCN channel blocker ZD7288, pretreatment with TBB rescued the afterhyperpolarizing potential (AHP) as well as spike frequency adaptation in epileptic animals, both of which are prominent functions of K<sub>Ca</sub>2 channels.</p>Conclusion<p>These data indicate that TBB pretreatment prior to SE slows down disease progression during epileptogenesis involving increased K<sub>Ca</sub>2 function, probably due to a persistently decreased CK2 protein expression.</p>

<p>Age-related alterations of functional brain networks contribute to cognitive decline. Current theories indicate that age-related intrinsic brain functional reorganization may be a critical marker of cognitive aging. Yet, little is known about how intrinsic interhemispheric functional connectivity changes with age in adults, and how this relates to critical executive functions. To address this, we examined voxel-mirrored homotopic connectivity (VMHC), a metric that quantifies interhemispheric communication, in 93 healthy volunteers (age range: 19–85) with executive function assessment using the Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System (D-KEFS) scales. Resting functional MRI data were analyzed to assess VMHC, and then a multiple linear regression model was employed to evaluate the relationship between age and the whole-brain VMHC. We observed age-related reductions in VMHC of ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and hippocampus in the medial temporal lobe subsystem, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and insula in salience network, and inferior parietal lobule in frontoparietal control network. Performance on the color-word inhibition task was associated with VMHC of vmPFC and insula, and VMHC of vmPFC mediated the relationship between age and CWIT inhibition reaction times. The percent ratio of correct design scores in design fluency test correlated positively with VMHC of the inferior parietal lobule. The current study suggests that brain interhemispheric functional alterations may be a promising new avenue for understanding age-related cognitive decline.</p>

<p>by Jieyun Bai, Andy Lo, Patrick A. Gladding, Martin K. Stiles, Vadim V. Fedorov, Jichao Zhao</p>

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia and is a major cause of stroke and morbidity. Recent genome-wide association studies have shown that paired-like homeodomain transcription factor 2 (Pitx2) to be strongly associated with AF. However, the mechanisms underlying Pitx2 modulated arrhythmogenesis and variable effectiveness of antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs) in patients in the presence or absence of impaired Pitx2 expression remain unclear. We have developed multi-scale computer models, ranging from a single cell to tissue level, to mimic control and Pitx2-knockout atria by incorporating recent experimental data on Pitx2-induced electrical and structural remodeling in humans, as well as the effects of AADs. The key findings of this study are twofold. We have demonstrated that shortened action potential duration, slow conduction and triggered activity occur due to electrical and structural remodelling under Pitx2 deficiency conditions. Notably, the elevated function of calcium transport ATPase increases sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration, thereby enhancing susceptibility to triggered activity. Furthermore, heterogeneity is further elevated due to Pitx2 deficiency: 1) Electrical heterogeneity between left and right atria increases; and 2) Increased fibrosis and decreased cell-cell coupling due to structural remodelling slow electrical propagation and provide obstacles to attract re-entry, facilitating the initiation of re-entrant circuits. Secondly, our study suggests that flecainide has antiarrhythmic effects on AF due to impaired Pitx2 by preventing spontaneous calcium release and increasing wavelength. Furthermore, our study suggests that Na<sup>+</sup> channel effects alone are insufficient to explain the efficacy of flecainide. Our study may provide the mechanisms underlying Pitx2-induced AF and possible explanation behind the AAD effects of flecainide in patients with Pitx2 deficiency.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/De5Uze-Z81o" width="1" />

Correct annotation metadata is critical for reproducible and accurate RNA-seq analysis. When files are shared publicly or among collaborators with incorrect or missing annotation metadata, it becomes difficult or impossible to reproduce bioinformatic analyses from raw data. It also makes it more difficult to locate the transcriptomic features, such as transcripts or genes, in their proper genomic context, which is necessary for overlapping expression data with other datasets. We provide a solution in the form of an R/Bioconductor package tximeta that performs numerous annotation and metadata gathering tasks automatically on behalf of users during the import of transcript quantification files. The correct reference transcriptome is identified via a hashed checksum stored in the quantification output, and key transcript databases are downloaded and cached locally. The computational paradigm of automatically adding annotation metadata based on reference sequence checksums can greatly facilitate genomic workflows, by helping to reduce overhead during bioinformatic analyses, preventing costly bioinformatic mistakes, and promoting computational reproducibility. The tximeta package is available at https://bioconductor.org/packages/tximeta.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/hvnvmD4Ua98" width="1" />

Upon exposure to different stimuli, resting macrophages undergo classical or alternative polarization into distinct phenotypes that can cause fatal dysfunction in a large range of diseases, such as systemic infection leading to sepsis or the generation of an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Investigating gene regulatory and metabolic networks, we observed two metabolic switches during polarization. Most prominently, anaerobic glycolysis was utilized by M1-polarized macrophages, while the biosynthesis of inosine monophosphate was upregulated in M2-polarized macrophages. Moreover, we observed a switch in the urea cycle. Gene regulatory network models revealed E2F1, MYC, PPARγ and STAT6 to be the major players in the distinct signatures of these polarization events. Employing functional assays targeting these regulators, we observed the repolarization of M2-like cells into M1-like cells, as evidenced by their specific gene expression signatures and cytokine secretion profiles. The predicted regulators are essential to maintaining the M2-like phenotype and function and thus represent potential targets for the therapeutic reprogramming of immunosuppressive M2-like macrophages.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/zo3nGf-wEEg" width="1" />

<p>by Rok Grah, Tamar Friedlander</p>

Genes differ in the frequency at which they are expressed and in the form of regulation used to control their activity. In particular, positive or negative regulation can lead to activation of a gene in response to an external signal. Previous works proposed that the form of regulation of a gene correlates with its frequency of usage: positive regulation when the gene is frequently expressed and negative regulation when infrequently expressed. Such network design means that, in the absence of their regulators, the genes are found in their least required activity state, hence regulatory intervention is often necessary. Due to the multitude of genes and regulators, spurious binding and unbinding events, called “crosstalk”, could occur. To determine how the form of regulation affects the global crosstalk in the network, we used a mathematical model that includes multiple regulators and multiple target genes. We found that crosstalk depends non-monotonically on the availability of regulators. Our analysis showed that excess use of regulation entailed by the formerly suggested network design caused high crosstalk levels in a large part of the parameter space. We therefore considered the opposite ‘idle’ design, where the default unregulated state of genes is their frequently required activity state. We found, that ‘idle’ design minimized the use of regulation and thus minimized crosstalk. In addition, we estimated global crosstalk of <i>S. cerevisiae</i> using transcription factors binding data. We demonstrated that even partial network data could suffice to estimate its global crosstalk, suggesting its applicability to additional organisms. We found that <i>S. cerevisiae</i> estimated crosstalk is lower than that of a random network, suggesting that natural selection reduces crosstalk. In summary, our study highlights a new type of protein production cost which is typically overlooked: that of regulatory interference caused by the presence of excess regulators in the cell. It demonstrates the importance of whole-network descriptions, which could show effects missed by single-gene models.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/njnC1ArBN2k" width="1" />

<p>by Julia A. K. Chartove, Michelle M. McCarthy, Benjamin R. Pittman-Polletta, Nancy J. Kopell</p>

Striatal oscillatory activity is associated with movement, reward, and decision-making, and observed in several interacting frequency bands. Local field potential recordings in rodent striatum show dopamine- and reward-dependent transitions between two states: a “spontaneous” state involving <i>β</i> (∼15-30 Hz) and low <i>γ</i> (∼40-60 Hz), and a state involving <i>θ</i> (∼4-8 Hz) and high <i>γ</i> (∼60-100 Hz) in response to dopaminergic agonism and reward. The mechanisms underlying these rhythmic dynamics, their interactions, and their functional consequences are not well understood. In this paper, we propose a biophysical model of striatal microcircuits that comprehensively describes the generation and interaction of these rhythms, as well as their modulation by dopamine. Building on previous modeling and experimental work suggesting that striatal projection neurons (SPNs) are capable of generating <i>β</i> oscillations, we show that networks of striatal fast-spiking interneurons (FSIs) are capable of generating <i>δ</i>/<i>θ</i> (ie, 2 to 6 Hz) and <i>γ</i> rhythms. Under simulated low dopaminergic tone our model FSI network produces low <i>γ</i> band oscillations, while under high dopaminergic tone the FSI network produces high <i>γ</i> band activity nested within a <i>δ</i>/<i>θ</i> oscillation. SPN networks produce <i>β</i> rhythms in both conditions, but under high dopaminergic tone, this <i>β</i> oscillation is interrupted by <i>δ</i>/<i>θ</i>-periodic bursts of <i>γ</i>-frequency FSI inhibition. Thus, in the high dopamine state, packets of FSI <i>γ</i> and SPN <i>β</i> alternate at a <i>δ</i>/<i>θ</i> timescale. In addition to a mechanistic explanation for previously observed rhythmic interactions and transitions, our model suggests a hypothesis as to how the relationship between dopamine and rhythmicity impacts motor function. We hypothesize that high dopamine-induced periodic FSI <i>γ</i>-rhythmic inhibition enables switching between <i>β</i>-rhythmic SPN cell assemblies representing the currently active motor program, and thus that dopamine facilitates movement in part by allowing for rapid, periodic shifts in motor program execution.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/OdbxpQNuc_M" width="1" />

<p>by Daniel E. Hurtado, Javiera Jilberto, Grigory Panasenko</p>

Gap junctions are key mediators of intercellular communication in cardiac tissue, and their function is vital to sustaining normal cardiac electrical activity. Conduction through gap junctions strongly depends on the hemichannel arrangement and transjunctional voltage, rendering the intercellular conductance highly non-Ohmic, particularly under steady-state regimes of conduction. Despite this marked non-linear behavior, current tissue-level models of cardiac conduction are rooted in the assumption that gap-junctions conductance is constant (Ohmic), which results in inaccurate predictions of electrical propagation, particularly in the low junctional-coupling regime observed under pathological conditions. In this work, we present a novel non-Ohmic homogenization model (NOHM) of cardiac conduction that is suitable to tissue-scale simulations. Using non-linear homogenization theory, we develop a conductivity model that seamlessly upscales the voltage-dependent conductance of gap junctions, without the need of explicitly modeling gap junctions. The NOHM model allows for the simulation of electrical propagation in tissue-level cardiac domains that accurately resemble that of cell-based microscopic models for a wide range of junctional coupling scenarios, recovering key conduction features at a fraction of the computational complexity. A unique feature of the NOHM model is the possibility of upscaling the response of non-symmetric gap-junction conductance distributions, which result in conduction velocities that strongly depend on the direction of propagation, thus allowing to model the normal and retrograde conduction observed in certain regions of the heart. We envision that the NOHM model will enable organ-level simulations that are informed by sub- and inter-cellular mechanisms, delivering an accurate and predictive in-silico tool for understanding the heart function.

Tumor growth curves are classically modeled by means of ordinary differential equations. In analyzing the Gompertz model several studies have reported a striking correlation between the two parameters of the model, which could be used to reduce the dimensionality and improve predictive power. We analyzed tumor growth kinetics within the statistical framework of nonlinear mixed-effects (population approach). This allowed the simultaneous modeling of tumor dynamics and inter-animal variability. Experimental data comprised three animal models of breast and lung cancers, with 833 measurements in 94 animals. Candidate models of tumor growth included the exponential, logistic and Gompertz models. The exponential and—more notably—logistic models failed to describe the experimental data whereas the Gompertz model generated very good fits. The previously reported population-level correlation between the Gompertz parameters was further confirmed in our analysis (R<sup>2&gt;</sup> 0.92 in all groups). Combining this structural correlation with rigorous population parameter estimation, we propose a reduced Gompertz function consisting of a single individual parameter (and one population parameter). Leveraging the population approach using Bayesian inference, we estimated times of tumor initiation using three late measurement timepoints. The reduced Gompertz model was found to exhibit the best results, with drastic improvements when using Bayesian inference as compared to likelihood maximization alone, for both accuracy and precision. Specifically, mean accuracy (prediction error) was 12.2% versus 78% and mean precision (width of the 95% prediction interval) was 15.6 days versus 210 days, for the breast cancer cell line. These results demonstrate the superior predictive power of the reduced Gompertz model, especially when combined with Bayesian estimation. They offer possible clinical perspectives for personalized prediction of the age of a tumor from limited data at diagnosis.

Abstract
<p>Propagation of signals across the cerebral cortex is a core component of many cognitive processes and is generally thought to be mediated by direct intracortical connectivity. The thalamus, by contrast, is considered to be devoid of internal connections and organized as a collection of parallel inputs to the cortex. Here, we provide evidence that "open-loop" intrathalamic pathways involving the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) can support propagation of oscillatory activity across the cortex. Recent studies support the existence of open-loop thalamo-reticulo-thalamic (TC-TRN-TC) synaptic motifs in addition to traditional closed-loop architectures. We hypothesized that open-loop structural modules, when connected in series, might underlie thalamic and, therefore cortical, signal propagation. Using a supercomputing platform to simulate thousands of permutations of a thalamocortical network based on physiological data collected in mice, rats, ferrets, and cats and in which select synapses were allowed to vary both by class and individually, we evaluated the relative capacities of closed-loop and open-loop TC-TRN-TC synaptic configurations to support both propagation and oscillation. We observed that (1) signal propagation was best supported in networks possessing strong open-loop TC-TRN-TC connectivity; (2) intrareticular synapses were neither primary substrates of propagation nor oscillation; and (3) heterogeneous synaptic networks supported more robust propagation of oscillation than their homogeneous counterparts. These findings suggest that open-loop, heterogeneous intrathalamic architectures might complement direct intracortical connectivity to facilitate cortical signal propagation.</p>

Abstract<p>The multitude of neuronal subtypes and extensive interconnectivity of the mammalian brain presents a substantial challenge to those seeking to decipher its functions. While the molecular mechanisms of several neuronal functions remain poorly characterized, advances in Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) and gene-editing technology have begun to close this gap. The Clustered Regularly Interspaced Palindromic Repeats – CRISPR Associated Protein (CRISPR-Cas) system has emerged as a powerful genetic tool capable of manipulating the genome of essentially any organism and cell type, an attribute which has advanced our understanding of complex neurological diseases by enabling the rapid generation of novel, disease-relevant <i>in vitro</i> and transgenic animal models. In this review, we discuss recent developments in the rapidly accelerating field of CRISPR-mediated genome engineering. We begin with an overview of the canonical function of the CRISPR platform, followed by a functional review of its many adaptations, with an emphasis on its applications for genetic interrogation of the normal and diseased nervous system. Additionally, we discuss limitations of the CRISPR editing system and suggest how future modifications to existing platforms may advance our understanding of the brain.</p>

Abstract<p>Parvalbumin-expressing interneurons in cortical networks are coupled by gap-junctions, forming a syncytium that supports propagating epileptiform discharges, induced by 4-aminopyridine. It remains unclear, however, whether these propagating events occur under more natural states, without pharmacological blockade. In particular, we investigated whether propagation also happens when extracellular K<sup>+</sup> rises, as is known to occur following intense network activity, such as during seizures. We examined how increasing [K<sup>+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> affects the likelihood of propagating activity away from a site of focal (200-400µm) optogenetic activation of parvalbumin-expressing interneurons. Activity was recorded using a linear 16-electrode array placed along layer V of primary visual cortex. At baseline levels of [K<sup>+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> (3.5mM), induced activity was recorded only within the illuminated area. However, when [K<sup>+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> was increased above a threshold level (50<sup>th</sup> percentile= 8.0mM; interquartile range= 7.5-9.5mM), time-locked, fast-spiking unit activity, indicative of parvalbumin-expressing interneuron firing, was also recorded outside the illuminated area, propagating at 59.1mm/s. The propagating unit activity was unaffected by blockade of GABAergic synaptic transmission, but it was modulated by glutamatergic blockers, and was reduced, and in most cases prevented altogether, by pharmacological blockade of gap-junctions, achieved by any of three different drugs, quinine, mefloquine or carbenoxolone. Wash-out of quinine rapidly re-established the pattern of propagating activity. Computer simulations show qualitative differences between propagating discharges in high [K<sup>+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> and 4-aminopyridine, arising from differences in the electrotonic effects of these two manipulations. These interneuronal syncytial interactions are likely to affect the complex electrographic dynamics of seizures, once [K<sup>+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> is raised above this threshold level.</p><p><b>Significance statement</b> We demonstrate the spatially extended propagation of activity through a gap-junction mediated syncytium of parvalbumin(PV)-expressing interneurons, in conditions that are known to exist at times within the brain. Previous work has only shown gap-junction coordination very locally, through directly connected cells, or induced at a distance by pharmacological means. We show that cell-class specific spread is facilitated by raised extracellular K<sup>+</sup>. This is highly pertinent to what happens at the onset of, and during, seizures, when extracellular K<sup>+</sup> can rise rapidly to levels well in excess of the measured threshold for propagation. Our data suggests that interneuronal coupling will be enhanced at this time, and this has clear implications for the behaviour of these cells as seizures progress.</p>

<p>Connections between neurons called synapses are the key components underlying all nervous system functions of animals and humans. However, important genetic information on the formation and plasticity of one type, the electrical (gap junction-mediated) synapse, is understudied in many invertebrates. In the present study, we set forth to identify and characterize the gap junction-encoding gene innexin in the central nervous system (CNS) of the mollusk pond snail Lymnaea stagnalis. With PCR, 3′ and 5′ RACE, and BLAST searches, we identified eight innexin genes in the L. stagnalis genome, named Lst Inx1–Lst Inx8. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the L. stagnalis innexin genes originated from a single copy in the common ancestor of molluskan species by multiple gene duplication events and have been maintained in L. stagnalis since they were generated. The paralogous innexin genes demonstrate distinct expression patterns among tissues. In addition, one paralog, Lst Inx1, exhibits heterogeneity in cells and ganglia, suggesting the occurrence of functional diversification after gene duplication. These results introduce possibilities to study an intriguing potential relationship between innexin paralog expression and cell-specific functional outputs such as heterogenic ability to form channels and exhibit synapse plasticity. The L. stagnalis CNS contains large neurons and functionally defined networks for behaviors; with the introduction of L. stagnalis in the gap junction gene field, we are providing novel opportunities to combine genetic research with direct investigations of functional outcomes at the cellular, synaptic, and behavioral levels.</p>

<p>Rett syndrome (RTT, OMIM 312750), a severe neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by regression with loss of spoken language and hand skills, development of characteristic hand stereotypies, and gait dysfunction, is primarily caused by de novo mutations in the X-linked gene Methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MECP2). Currently, treatment options are limited to symptomatic management, however, reversal of disease phenotype is possible in mouse models by restoration of normal MECP2 gene expression. A significant challenge is the lack of biomarkers of disease state, disease severity, or treatment response. Using a non-targeted metabolomic approach we evaluated metabolite profiles in plasma from thirty-four people with RTT compared to thirty-seven unaffected age- and gender-matched siblings. We identified sixty-six significantly altered metabolites that cluster broadly into amino acid, nitrogen handling, and exogenous substance pathways. RTT disease metabolite and metabolic pathways abnormalities point to evidence of oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and alterations in gut microflora. These observed changes provide insight into underlying pathological mechanisms and the foundation for biomarker discovery of disease severity biomarkers.</p>

<p>Selection of the time-window mainly affects the effectiveness of piecewise feature extraction procedures. We present an enhanced bag-of-patterns representation that allows capturing the higher-level structures of brain dynamics within a wide window range. So, we introduce augmented instance representations with extended window lengths for the short-time Common Spatial Pattern algorithm. Based on multiple-instance learning, the relevant bag-of-patterns are selected by a sparse regression to feed a bag classifier. The proposed higher-level structure representation promotes two contributions: (i) accuracy improvement of bi-conditional tasks, (ii) A better understanding of dynamic brain behavior through the learned sparse regression fits. Using a support vector machine classifier, the achieved performance on a public motor imagery dataset (left-hand and right-hand tasks) shows that the proposed framework performs very competitive results, providing robustness to the time variation of electroencephalography recordings and favoring the class separability.</p>

<p>Heterogeneity between late-onset Parkinson’s disease (LOPD) and early-onset Parkinson’s disease (EOPD) is mainly reflected in the following aspects including genetics, disease progression, drug response, clinical manifestation, and neuropathological change. Although many studies have investigated these differences in relation to clinical significance, the functional processing circuits and underlying neural mechanisms have not been entirely understood. In this study, regional homogeneity (ReHo) and amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) maps were used to explore different spontaneous brain activity patterns in EOPD and LOPD patients. Abnormal synchronizations were found in the motor and emotional circuits of the EOPD group, as well as in the motor, emotional, and visual circuits of the LOPD group. EOPD patients showed functional activity change in the visual, emotional and motor circuits, and LOPD patients only showed increased functional activity in the emotional circuits. In summary, the desynchronization process in the LOPD group was relatively strengthened, and the brain areas with changed functional activity in the EOPD group were relatively widespread. The results might point out different impairments in the synchronization and functional activity for EOPD and LOPD patients.</p>

<p>Giant axonal neuropathy (GAN) is a very rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by abnormally large and dysfunctional neuronal axons. Mutations in the GAN gene have been identified as the cause of this disorder. In this report, we performed a detailed phenotypic assessment of a Chinese patient with GAN. An array-based exon capture test and targeted next-generation sequencing were used to detect the suspected mutation sites. Compound heterozygous mutations of p.S79L (c.236C &gt; T) in the BTB domain and p.T489S (c.1466C &gt; G) in the kelch domain were identified in the proband’s genome. S79L was a known mutation, and T489S was reported for the first time. The p.S79L and p.T489S were confirmed in the proband’s mother and father, respectively. Both mutations were located in highly conserved regions and affected the predicted protein crystal structures. The proband’s sural biopsy revealed the classical GAN phenotype of swollen axons filled with closely packed neurofilaments. The combined application of the next-generation sequencing platform and bioinformatics analyses was an effective method for diagnosing GAN. The novel compound mutations of S79L and T489S in the GAN gene were likely the cause of the patient’s GAN symptoms. Our findings enrich the spectrum of mutations associated with this rare type of axonopathy.</p>

<p>Accurate localization of complex human experiences such as emotions, dreaming, creativity, and consciousness to specific cerebral structures or neural networks has remained elusive despite technological advances. We report the use of acute deep brain stimulation (DBS) to evoke behavioral and emotional effects by applying electrical stimulation (ES) at various voltage strengths to the basolateral and central subnuclei of the amygdala in addition to the head of hippocampus (HC) for two subjects with medically refractory post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Our results suggest that the amygdala could be a node in a neural network responsible for the generation of complex vivid mental imagery and integrated sensory experiences similar to John Hughlings Jackson’s “dreamy state” and “double consciousness,” which have been classically associated with temporal lobe epilepsy during uncinate seizures. That we were able to elicit similar vivid, dynamic, complex, bizarre, and original mental imagery with ES in non-epileptic subjects suggests that Jackson’s seizure related “dreamy state” and “double consciousness” may arise from heightened innate brain mechanisms with the amygdala acting as a node in the neural network responsible for physiologic dreaming and creative functions. Furthermore, our subjects experienced different emotions with different stimulation strengths at various electrode contacts. Our results suggest that higher voltage stimulation of the amygdala and HC at 4–5 V leads to predominantly negative responses and 2–4 V stimulation showed inversely coupled positive and negative responses of the amygdala in either hemisphere which may imply hemispheric dominance of emotional valences without relation to handedness. Due to the unique and complex responses dependent on location and strength of stimulation, we advise that all patients receiving DBS of the amygdala undergo acute stimulation mapping in a monitored setting before selecting therapeutic parameters for chronic stimulation.</p>

<p>Background: Although biofeedback using electrophysiology has been explored extensively, the approach of using neurofeedback corresponding to hemodynamic response is a relatively young field. Real time functional magnetic resonance imaging-based neurofeedback (rt-fMRI-NF) uses sensory feedback to operantly reinforce patterns of neural response. It can be used, for example, to alter visual perception, increase brain connectivity, and reduce depression symptoms. Within recent years, interest in rt-fMRI-NF in both research and clinical contexts has expanded considerably. As such, building a consensus regarding best practices is of great value.</p><p>Objective: This systematic review is designed to describe and evaluate the variations in methodology used in previous rt-fMRI-NF studies to provide recommendations for rt-fMRI-NF study designs that are mostly likely to elicit reproducible and consistent effects of neurofeedback.</p><p>Methods: We conducted a database search for fMRI neurofeedback papers published prior to September 26th, 2019. Of 558 studies identified, 146 met criteria for inclusion. The following information was collected from each study: sample size and type, task used, neurofeedback calculation, regulation procedure, feedback, whether feedback was explicitly related to changing brain activity, feedback timing, control group for active neurofeedback, how many runs and sessions of neurofeedback, if a follow-up was conducted, and the results of neurofeedback training.</p><p>Results: rt-fMRI-NF is typically upregulation practice based on hemodynamic response from a specific region of the brain presented using a continually updating thermometer display. Most rt-fMRI-NF studies are conducted in healthy samples and half evaluate its effect on immediate changes in behavior or affect. The most popular control group method is to provide sham signal from another region; however, many studies do not compare use a comparison group.</p><p>Conclusions: We make several suggestions for designs of future rt-fMRI-NF studies. Researchers should use feedback calculation methods that consider neural response across regions (i.e., SVM or connectivity), which should be conveyed as intermittent, auditory feedback. Participants should be given explicit instructions and should be assessed on individual differences. Future rt-fMRI-NF studies should use clinical samples; effectiveness of rt-fMRI-NF should be evaluated on clinical/behavioral outcomes at follow-up time points in comparison to both a sham and no feedback control group.</p>

<p>Brain imaging studies of tinnitus patients have revealed marked changes in brain structure and function, but there are inconsistencies in those findings. In this meta-analysis, we investigated concurrence across studies to clarify those abnormalities in brain structure and function in tinnitus. Neuroimaging studies published up to December 6, 2019 were searched in the PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases, Chinese Nation Knowledge Infrastructure, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, the Chongqing VIP, and Wanfang Database. Study selection, quality assessment, and data extraction were performed by two independent researchers. Anisotropic effect size signed differential mapping (AES-SDM) was used to perform a multimodal analysis of available studies reporting whole-brain structural or functional data in tinnitus patients. There were 14 studies that met the inclusion criteria. The structural dataset comprised 242 tinnitus patients and 217 matched healthy subjects (HS), while the functional dataset included 130 tinnitus patients and 140 matched HS. Our analysis revealed structural alterations in the superior temporal gyrus, middle temporal gyrus (MTG), angular gyrus, caudate nucleus, superior frontal gyrus, and supplementary motor area, as well as functional differences in the MTG, middle occipital gyrus, precuneus, and right inferior parietal (excluding supramarginal and angular) gyri. The multimodal analysis revealed significant differences in the right MTG of tinnitus patients relative to HS. These findings suggest the involvement of the cortico-striatal circuits in the neuropathology of tinnitus.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00018">Neural Correlates of Vocal Pitch Compensation in Individuals Who Stutter</a></h4>

<p>Stuttering is a disorder that impacts the smooth flow of speech production and is associated with a deficit in sensorimotor integration. In a previous experiment, individuals who stutter were able to vocally compensate for pitch shifts in their auditory feedback, but they exhibited more variability in the timing of their corrective responses. In the current study, we focused on the neural correlates of the task using functional MRI. Participants produced a vowel sound in the scanner while hearing their own voice in real time through headphones. On some trials, the audio was shifted up or down in pitch, eliciting a corrective vocal response. Contrasting pitch-shifted vs. unshifted trials revealed bilateral superior temporal activation over all the participants. However, the groups differed in the activation of middle temporal gyrus and superior frontal gyrus [Brodmann area 10 (BA 10)], with individuals who stutter displaying deactivation while controls displayed activation. In addition to the standard univariate general linear modeling approach, we employed a data-driven technique (independent component analysis, or ICA) to separate task activity into functional networks. Among the networks most correlated with the experimental time course, there was a combined auditory-motor network in controls, but the two networks remained separable for individuals who stuttered. The decoupling of these networks may account for temporal variability in pitch compensation reported in our previous work, and supports the idea that neural network coherence is disturbed in the stuttering brain.</p>

<p>Purpose: Glioma cell infiltration, in which the glioma tumor cells spread long distances from the primary location using white matter (WM) or blood vessels, is known as a significant challenge for surgery or localized chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Following the World Health Organization (WHO), the glioma grading system ranges from stages I to IV, in which lower-grade gliomas represent benign tumors, and higher grade gliomas are considered the most malignant.</p><p>Materials and Methods: We gathered magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data for seven patients with right precentral gyrus-located tumors and six age- and sex-matched healthy subjects for analysis. Tract-Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS) was utilized to evaluate whole-brain WM implication due to probable tumor infiltration. Also, along-tract statistics were used in order to trace the implicated WM tracts. Finally, for cortical evaluation of probable tumor cell migration, voxel-based morphometry (VBM) was utilized, which allowed us to do whole-brain cortical estimation.</p><p>Results: The TBSS results revealed significantly higher fractional anisotropy (FA) and lower mean diffusivity (MD) in the left side superior corona radiata. Also, higher FA was observed in the right corticostriatal tract. Along-tract statistics were also compiled on the corpus callosum (CC), which is anatomically known as a hub between hemispheres. The body of the CC, which connected with the superior corona radiata anatomically, showed significantly higher FA values relative to healthy subjects, which are in line with the TBSS results. Consistent with these results, whole-brain gray matter changes were analyzed via VBM, which showed significant hypertrophy of both sides of the brainstem.</p><p>Conclusion: In future investigations, focusing on the genetic basis of the glioma patients in line with imaging studies on a larger sample size, which is known as genetics imaging, would be a suitable approach for tracing this process.</p>

<p>Modern machine learning is based on powerful algorithms running on digital computing platforms and there is great interest in accelerating the learning process and making it more energy efficient. In this paper we present a fully autonomous probabilistic circuit for fast and efficient learning that makes no use of digital computing. Specifically we use SPICE simulations to demonstrate a clockless autonomous circuit where the required synaptic weights are read out in the form of analog voltages. This allows us to demonstrate a circuit that can be built with existing technology to emulate the Boltzmann machine learning algorithm based on gradient optimization of the maximum likelihood function. Such autonomous circuits could be particularly of interest as standalone learning devices in the context of mobile and edge computing.</p>

<p>γ-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the mature brain but has the paradoxical property of depolarizing neurons during early development. Depolarization provided by GABA<sub>A</sub> transmission during this early phase regulates neural stem cell proliferation, neural migration, neurite outgrowth, synapse formation, and circuit refinement, making GABA a key factor in neural circuit development. Importantly, depending on the context, depolarizing GABA<sub>A</sub> transmission can either drive neural activity or inhibit it through shunting inhibition. The varying roles of depolarizing GABA<sub>A</sub> transmission during development, and its ability to both drive and inhibit neural activity, makes it a difficult developmental cue to study. This is particularly true in the later stages of development when the majority of synapses form and GABA<sub>A</sub> transmission switches from depolarizing to hyperpolarizing. Here, we addressed the importance of depolarizing but inhibitory (or shunting) GABA<sub>A</sub> transmission in glutamatergic synapse formation in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons. We first showed that the developmental depolarizing-to-hyperpolarizing switch in GABA<sub>A</sub> transmission is recapitulated in organotypic hippocampal slice cultures. Based on the expression profile of K<sup>+</sup>−Cl<sup>−</sup> co-transporter 2 (KCC2) and changes in the GABA reversal potential, we pinpointed the timing of the switch from depolarizing to hyperpolarizing GABA<sub>A</sub> transmission in CA1 neurons. We found that blocking depolarizing but shunting GABA<sub>A</sub> transmission increased excitatory synapse number and strength, indicating that depolarizing GABA<sub>A</sub> transmission can restrain glutamatergic synapse formation. The increase in glutamatergic synapses was activity-dependent but independent of BDNF signaling. Importantly, the elevated number of synapses was stable for more than a week after GABA<sub>A</sub> inhibitors were washed out. Together these findings point to the ability of immature GABAergic transmission to restrain glutamatergic synapse formation and suggest an unexpected role for depolarizing GABA<sub>A</sub> transmission in shaping excitatory connectivity during neural circuit development.</p>

<p>Forkhead Box G1 (FOXG1) is a member of the Forkhead family of genes with non-redundant roles in brain development, where alteration of this gene’s expression significantly affects the formation and function of the mammalian cerebral cortex. FOXG1 haploinsufficiency in humans is associated with prominent differences in brain size and impaired intellectual development noticeable in early childhood, while homozygous mutations are typically fatal. As such, FOXG1 has been implicated in a wide spectrum of congenital brain disorders, including the congenital variant of Rett syndrome, infantile spasms, microcephaly, autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and schizophrenia. Recent technological advances have yielded greater insight into phenotypic variations observed in FOXG1 syndrome, molecular mechanisms underlying pathogenesis of the disease, and multifaceted roles of FOXG1 expression. In this review, we explore the emerging mechanisms of FOXG1 in a range of transcriptional to posttranscriptional events in order to evolve our current view of how a single transcription factor governs the assembly of an elaborate cortical circuit responsible for higher cognitive functions and neurological disorders.</p>

<p>Exposure to toxic metals and metalloids is an important cause of preventable diseases worldwide. Inorganic arsenic (iAs) affects several organs and tissues, causing neurobehavioral alterations in the central nervous system (CNS) that might lead to neurodegeneration. In this work, we wanted to explore the time- and dose-related changes on glutathione (GSH) levels in several regions of the CNS, such as the cortex, striatum, hippocampus, and cerebellum, to identify the initial cellular changes associated to GSH depletion due to iAs exposure. Mice received a single intraperitoneal injection containing 5 or 14 mg/kg sodium arsenite. Animals were killed at 2, 6, and 24 h. Significant depletion of GSH levels was observed in the cortex at 2 and 6 h, while on the striatum, hippocampus, or cerebellum regions, no significant changes were observed. GSH depletion in the cortex was associated with the activation of the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and nuclear factor kappa B (NFκB) pathways, which led to the upregulation of xCT, excitatory amino acid carrier 1 (EAAC1), glutamate/aspartate transporter (GLAST), and glial glutamate transporter 1 (GLT-1), and the activation of the transsulfuration pathways, which led to the overproduction of H<sub>2</sub>S in the cortex and increased levels of GSH in the cortex and cerebellum at 24 h. In the cortex, the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor subunits NR2A and NR2B were also altered at 24 h. These early effects were not homogeneous among different brain regions and indicate early neurotoxic alterations in the cortex and cerebellum.</p>

<p>Among non-motor manifestations of Parkinson's Disease (PD), peripheral, sensory symptoms are particularly relevant. Smell dysfunction starts very early and frequently precedes the PD motor symptoms by years (being often a cue to the diagnosis). Moreover, olfactory system could be, together with gut, one of those peripheral sites where PD pathology first develops. Unlike smell loss, the relationship between PD and taste impairment is far less established. It can start early in the course of the disease but more frequently appears in advanced stages, in parallel with the advent of MCI, likely reflecting cortical involvement. Among PD patients has been demonstrated an increase in the frequency of the non-tasters for PROP (prototypical gustatory stimulus, 6- n-propylthiouracil), a genetically determined bitter taste which is mediated by TAS2RS38 receptor, and a significant increase of the recessive non-testing variant of this receptor. TAS2R38 receptors are expressed also in other tissues, such as in the epithelia of the gut and nasal cavities, where they can influence epithelial immunity ad its interaction with microbiota. Those pieces of evidence suggest that not only systematic assessment of taste and smell can be of a remarkable help for clinicians in the early diagnosis, but also that understanding the mechanisms of sensory involvement in PD could increase the knowledge of the pathophysiology of the disease.</p>

<p>Patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) demonstrate significant cognitive deficits, especially in the memory aspect. The memory deficiency might be attributed to the difficulties in the inhibitory function to suppress redundant stimuli. Sensory gating (SG) refers to the attenuation of neural responses to the second identical stimulus in a paired-click paradigm, in which auditory stimuli are delivered in pairs with inter-stimulus intervals (ISI) of 500 ms and inter-pair intervals of 6–8 s. It is considered as an electrophysiological signal to reflect the brain’s automatic response to gate out repetitive sensory inputs. However, there has been no study systematically investigating SG function in aMCI patients. Thus, the present study used magnetoencephalography (MEG) to record neuromagnetic responses to a paired-click paradigm in 23 healthy controls (HC) and 26 aMCI patients. The Stimulus 2/Stimulus 1 (S2/S1) amplitude ratio was used to represent the SG function. Compared to HC, aMCI patients showed M50 SG deficits in the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and right inferior parietal lobule (IPL). M100 SG defects were also observed in the right IPL. Based on the ROIs showing significant between-group SG differences, we found that a more deficient M50 SG function in the right IPL was associated with poorer performance in the immediate recall of Logic Memory (LM), Chinese Version Verbal Learning Test (CVVLT) and Digit Span Backward (DSB) Test. Furthermore, the M50 SG ratios of the right IPL together with the neuropsychological performance of LM and CVVLT demonstrated very good accuracy in the discrimination of aMCI from HC. In conclusion, compared to HC, aMCI patients showed a significant SG deficit in the right IPL, which was correlated with the auditory short-term memory function. We suggest the combination of SG in the right IPL, LM and CVVLT to be sensitive indicators to differentiate aMCI patients from HC.</p>

<p>Several sensorimotor modifications are known to occur with aging, possibly leading to adverse outcomes such as falls. Recently, some of those modifications have been proposed to emerge from motor planning deteriorations. Motor planning of vertical movements is thought to engage an internal model of gravity to anticipate its mechanical effects on the body-limbs and thus to genuinely produce movements that minimize muscle effort. This is supported, amongst other results, by direction-dependent kinematics where relative durations to peak accelerations and peak velocity are shorter for upward than for downward movements. The present study compares the motor planning of fast and slow vertical arm reaching movements between 18 young (24 ± 3 years old) and 17 older adults (70 ± 5 years old). We found that older participants still exhibit strong directional asymmetries (i.e., differences between upward and downward movements), indicating that optimization processes during motor planning persist with healthy aging. However, the size of these differences was increased in older participants, indicating that gravity-related motor planning changes with age. We discuss this increase as the possible result of an overestimation of gravity torque or increased weight of the effort cost in the optimization process. Overall, these results support the hypothesis that feedforward processes and, more precisely, optimal motor planning, remain active with healthy aging.</p>

Background<p>Multiple-modality exercise improves brain function. However, whether task-based brain functional connectivity (FC) following exercise suggests adaptations in preferential brain regions is unclear. The objective of this study was to explore memory function and task-related FC changes following multiple-modality exercise and mind–motor training in older adults with subjective cognitive complaints.</p>Methods<p>We performed secondary analysis of memory function data in older adults [n = 127, mean age 67.5 (7.3) years, 71% women] randomized to an exercise intervention comprised of 45 min of multiple-modality exercise with additional 15 min of mind-motor training (M4 group, n = 63) or an active control group (M2 group, n = 64). In total, both groups exercised for 60 min/day, 3 days/week, for 24 weeks. We then conducted exploratory analyses of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data collected from a sample of participants from the M4 group [n = 9, mean age 67.8 (8.8) years, 8 women] who completed baseline and follow-up task-based fMRI assessment. Four computer-based memory tasks from the Cambridge Brain Sciences cognitive battery (i.e. Monkey Ladder, Spatial Span, Digit Span, Paired Associates) were employed, and participants underwent 5 min of continuous fMRI data collection while completing the tasks. Behavioral data were analyzed using linear mixed models for repeated measures and paired-samples t-test. All fMRI data were analyzed using group-level independent component analysis and dual regression procedures, correcting for voxel-wise comparisons.</p>Results<p>Our findings indicated that the M4 group showed greater improvements in the Paired Associates tasks compared to the M2 group at 24 weeks [mean difference: 0.47, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.08 to 0.86, p = 0.019]. For our fMRI analysis, dual regression revealed significant decrease in FC co-activation in the right precentral/postcentral gyri after the exercise program during the Spatial Span task (corrected p = 0.008), although there was no change in the behavioral task performance. Only trends for changes in FC were found for the other tasks (all corrected p &lt; 0.09). In addition, for the Paired Associates task, there was a trend for increased co-activation in the right temporal lobe (Brodmann Area = 38, corrected p = 0.07), and left middle frontal temporal gyrus (corrected p = 0.06). Post hoc analysis exploring voxel FC within each group spatial map confirmed FC activation trends observed from dual regression.</p>Conclusion<p>Our findings suggest that multiple modality exercise with mind–motor training resulted in greater improvements in memory compared to an active control group. There were divergent FC adaptations including significant decreased co-activation in the precentral/postcentral gyri during the Spatial Span task. Borderline significant changes during the Paired Associates tasks in FC provided insight into the potential of our intervention to promote improvements in visuospatial memory and impart FC adaptations in brain regions relevant to Alzheimer’s disease risk.</p>Clinical Trial Registration<p>The trial was registered in ClinicalTrials.gov in April 2014, Identifier: NCT02136368.</p>

Increasing availability of comprehensive experimental datasets and of high-performance computing resources are driving rapid growth in scale, complexity, and biological realism of computational models in neuroscience. To support construction and simulation, as well as sharing of such large-scale models, a broadly applicable, flexible, and high-performance data format is necessary. To address this need, we have developed the Scalable Open Network Architecture TemplAte (SONATA) data format. It is designed for memory and computational efficiency and works across multiple platforms. The format represents neuronal circuits and simulation inputs and outputs via standardized files and provides much flexibility for adding new conventions or extensions. SONATA is used in multiple modeling and visualization tools, and we also provide reference Application Programming Interfaces and model examples to catalyze further adoption. SONATA format is free and open for the community to use and build upon with the goal of enabling efficient model building, sharing, and reproducibility.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/OfUKjuXg6SI" width="1" />

<p>by M. Ali Al-Radhawi, David Angeli, Eduardo D. Sontag</p>

Complex molecular biological processes such as transcription and translation, signal transduction, post-translational modification cascades, and metabolic pathways can be described in principle by biochemical reactions that explicitly take into account the sophisticated network of chemical interactions regulating cell life. The ability to deduce the possible qualitative behaviors of such networks from a set of reactions is a central objective and an ongoing challenge in the field of systems biology. Unfortunately, the construction of complete mathematical models is often hindered by a pervasive problem: despite the wealth of qualitative graphical knowledge about network interactions, the form of the governing nonlinearities and/or the values of kinetic constants are hard to uncover experimentally. The kinetics can also change with environmental variations. This work addresses the following question: given a set of reactions and without assuming a particular form for the kinetics, what can we say about the asymptotic behavior of the network? Specifically, it introduces a class of networks that are “structurally (mono) attractive” meaning that they are incapable of exhibiting multiple steady states, oscillation, or chaos by virtue of their reaction graphs. These networks are characterized by the existence of a universal energy-like function called a <i>Robust Lyapunov function</i> (RLF). To find such functions, a finite set of rank-one linear systems is introduced, which form the extremals of a linear convex cone. The problem is then reduced to that of finding a common Lyapunov function for this set of extremals. Based on this characterization, a computational package, Lyapunov-Enabled Analysis of Reaction Networks (LEARN), is provided that constructs such functions or rules out their existence. An extensive study of biochemical networks demonstrates that LEARN offers a new unified framework. Basic motifs, three-body binding, and genetic networks are studied first. The work then focuses on cellular signalling networks including various post-translational modification cascades, phosphotransfer and phosphorelay networks, T-cell kinetic proofreading, and ERK signalling. The Ribosome Flow Model is also studied.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/UfUKO5iF130" width="1" />

Abstract
<p>Human movements are flexible as they continuously adapt to changes in the environment. The recalibration of corrective responses to sustained perturbations (e.g., constant force) altering one’s movement contributes to this flexibility. We asked whether the recalibration of corrective actions involve cerebral structures using stroke as a disease model. We characterized changes in muscle activity in stroke survivors and control subjects before, during, and after walking on a split-belt treadmill moving the legs at different speeds. The recalibration of corrective muscle activity was comparable between stroke survivors and control subjects, which was unexpected given the known deficits in feedback responses poststroke. Also, the intact recalibration in stroke survivors contrasted their limited ability to adjust their muscle activity during steady-state split-belt walking. Our results suggest that the recalibration and execution of motor commands are partially dissociable: cerebral lesions interfere with the execution, but not the recalibration, of motor commands on novel movement demands.</p>

Abstract<p>To make full use of optogenetic and molecular techniques in the study of motor control, rich behavioral paradigms for rodentsmust rise to the same level of sophistication and applicability. We describe the layout, construction, use and analysis of data from joystick-based reaching in ahead-fixed mouse. The step-by-step guide is designed for both experienced rodent motor labs and new groups looking to enter into this research space. Using this platform,mice learn to consistently perform large, easily-quantified reaches, including during a two-armed bandit probabilistic learning task.The metrics of performance (reach trajectory, amplitude, speed, duration, and inter-reach interval) can be used to quantify behavior or administer stimulation in closed loop with behavior. We provide a highly customizable, low costand reproducible open-source behavior training platform for studying motor control, decision making, and reaching reaction time. The development of this software and hardware platform enables behavioral work to complement recent advances in rodents, while remaining accessible to smaller institutions and labs, thus providing a high-throughput method to study unexploredfeatures of action selection, motivation, and value-based decisions.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> We are realizing that the behavioral repertoire of mice is much richer than previously thought, including motor control and decision-making using reaches. Modern neuroscience is now capturing this richness, paired with new genetic tools, to understand fundamental neuroscience principles. Here, we provide an illustrated build guide, code, multiple use scenarios, and analytic tools to a low-cost, highly customizable mouse joystick. This tool will enable improved throughput, accessibility, and experimental design (e.g. spatiotemporal reach trajectories over lever presses) for labs wishing to study a range of reach-based experiments.</p>

<p>Quantitative MRI modalities, such as diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) or magnetization transfer imaging (MTI) are sensitive to the neuronal effects of aging of the cerebral white matter (WM), but lack the specificity for myelin content. Myelin water imaging (MWI) is highly specific for myelin and may be more sensitive for the detection of changes in myelin content inside the cerebral WM microstructure. In this multiparametric imaging study, we evaluated the performance of myelin water fraction (MWF) estimates as a marker for myelin alterations during normal-aging. Multiparametric MRI data derived from DTI, MTI and a novel, recently-proposed MWF-map processing and reconstruction algorithm were acquired from 54 healthy subjects (aged 18–79 years) and region-based multivariate regression analysis was performed. MWFs significantly decreased with age in most WM regions (except corticospinal tract) and changes of MWFs were associated with changes of radial diffusivity, indicating either substantial alterations or preservation of myelin content in these regions. Decreases of fractional anisotropy and magnetization transfer ratio were associated with lower MWFs in commissural fiber tracts only. Mean diffusivity had no regional effects on MWF. We conclude that MWF estimates are sensitive for the assessment of age-related myelin alterations in the cerebral WM of normal-aging brains.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Expanding use of immune‐checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) underscores the importance of accurate diagnosis and timely management of neurological immune‐related adverse events (irAE‐N). We evaluate the real‐world frequency, phenotypes, co‐occurring immune‐related adverse events (irAEs), and long‐term outcomes of severe, grade III‐V irAE‐N at a tertiary‐care center over 6 years. We analyze how our experience supports published literature and professional society guidelines. We also discuss these data with regard to common clinical scenarios, such as combination therapy, ICI re‐challenge and risk of relapse of irAE‐N, and corticosteroid taper, which are not specifically addressed by current guidelines and/or have limited data. Recommendations for management and future irAE‐N reporting are outlined.</p>

<p>by Natacha Comandante-Lou, Mehwish Khaliq, Divya Venkat, Mohan Manikkam, Mohammad Fallahi-Sichani</p>

Cell-to-cell variability generates subpopulations of drug-tolerant cells that diminish the efficacy of cancer drugs. Efficacious combination therapies are thus needed to block drug-tolerant cells via minimizing the impact of heterogeneity. Probabilistic models such as Bliss independence have been developed to evaluate drug interactions and their combination efficacy based on probabilities of specific actions mediated by drugs individually and in combination. In practice, however, these models are often applied to conventional dose-response curves in which a normalized parameter with a value between zero and one, generally referred to as fraction of cells affected (<i>f</i><sub>a</sub>), is used to evaluate the efficacy of drugs and their combined interactions. We use basic probability theory, computer simulations, time-lapse live cell microscopy, and single-cell analysis to show that <i>f</i><sub>a</sub> metrics may bias our assessment of drug efficacy and combination effectiveness. This bias may be corrected when dynamic probabilities of drug-induced phenotypic events, i.e. induction of cell death and inhibition of division, at a single-cell level are used as metrics to assess drug efficacy. Probabilistic phenotype metrics offer the following three benefits. First, in contrast to the commonly used <i>f</i><sub>a</sub> metrics, they directly represent probabilities of drug action in a cell population. Therefore, they deconvolve differential degrees of drug effect on tumor cell killing versus inhibition of cell division, which may not be correlated for many drugs. Second, they increase the sensitivity of short-term drug response assays to cell-to-cell heterogeneities and the presence of drug-tolerant subpopulations. Third, their probabilistic nature allows them to be used directly in unbiased evaluation of synergistic efficacy in drug combinations using probabilistic models such as Bliss independence. Altogether, we envision that probabilistic analysis of single-cell phenotypes complements currently available assays via improving our understanding of heterogeneity in drug response, thereby facilitating the discovery of more efficacious combination therapies to block drug-tolerant cells.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Ivq4hLChHLc" width="1" />

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>We aimed to determine the association between striatal dopaminergic depletion, cerebral β‐amyloid deposition, and cognitive dysfunction in Lewy body disease (LBD).</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This cross‐sectional study recruited 48 LBD patients (30 with dementia and 18 with mild cognitive impairment) and 15 control subjects from a university‐based hospital. We measured the striatal dopamine transporter (DAT) activity and regional β‐amyloid burden using<sup>18</sup>F‐FP‐CIT positron emission tomography (PET) and <sup>18</sup>F‐florbetaben (FBB) PET, respectively. The relationship between striatal FP‐CIT uptake, regional cortical FBB uptake, and cognitive function scores was evaluated using path analyses. We also investigated the effects of striatal FP‐CIT uptake and cortical FBB uptake on the interval between motor symptom and dementia onset.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Reduced striatal FP‐CIT uptake was associated with increased FBB uptake in the posterior cortical regions, most prominently in the occipital cortices. Reduced FP‐CIT uptake in the anterior putamen was associated with visuospatial dysfunction with mediation of increased occipital FBB uptake. Reduced FP‐CIT uptake in the posterior putamen and an increased parietal FBB uptake were independently associated with memory dysfunction. Reduced striatal FP‐CIT uptake was associated with attention, language, and frontal/executive dysfunction, independent of amyloid deposition. Increased FBB uptake, especially in the parietal cortex, was associated with earlier onset of dementia.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our results suggest that occipital β‐amyloid deposition may contribute to the association between striatal dopaminergic depletion and visuospatial dysfunction in LBD patients. Although the effects of reduced DAT activity are more prominent than those of β‐amyloid burden on cognitive dysfunction, the latter affects the onset of cognitive dysfunction.</p>

Abstract
<p>Visceral sensory neurons encode distinct sensations from healthy organs and initiate pain states that are resistant to common analgesics. Transcriptome analysis is transforming our understanding of sensory neuron subtypes but has generally focused on somatic sensory neurons or the total population of neurons in which visceral neurons form the minority. Our aim was to define transcripts specifically expressed by sacral visceral sensory neurons, as a step towards understanding the unique biology of these neurons and potentially leading to identification of new analgesic targets for pelvic visceral pain. Our strategy was to identify genes differentially expressed between sacral dorsal root ganglia (DRG) that include somatic neurons and sacral visceral neurons, and adjacent lumbar DRG that comprise exclusively of somatic sensory neurons. This was performed in adult and E18.5 male and female mice. By developing a method to restrict analyses to nociceptive Trpv1 neurons, a larger group of genes were detected as differentially expressed between spinal levels. We identified many novel genes that had not previously been associated with pelvic visceral sensation or nociception. Limited sex differences were detected across the transcriptome of sensory ganglia, but more were revealed in sacral levels and especially in Trpv1 nociceptive neurons. These data will facilitate development of new tools to modify mature and developing sensory neurons and nociceptive pathways.</p>

ABSTRACT<p>Spike conduction velocity characteristically differs between myelinated and unmyelinated axons. Here we test whether spikes of myelinated and unmyelinated paths differ in other respects by measuring rat retinal ganglion cell (RGC) spike duration in the intraretinal, unmyelinated nerve fiber layer and the extraretinal, myelinated optic nerve and optic chiasm. We find that rapid spike firing and illumination broaden spikes in intraretinal axons but not in extraretinal axons. RGC axons thus initiate spikes intraretinally and normalize spike duration extraretinally. Additionally, we analyze spikes that were recorded in a previous study of rhesus macaque retinogeniculate transmission and find that rapid spike firing does not broaden spikes in optic tract. The spike normalization we find reduces the number of spike properties that can change during RGC light responses. However, this is not because identical spikes fire in all axons. Instead, our recordings show that different subtypes of RGC generate axonal spikes of different durations and that the differences resemble spike duration increases that alter neurotransmitter release from other neurons. Moreover, previous studies have shown that RGC spikes of shorter duration can fire at higher maximum frequencies. These properties should facilitate signal transfer by different mechanisms at RGC synapses onto subcortical target neurons.</p><p><b>SIGNIFICANCE</b> Myelination increases spike conduction velocity in axons. To test whether unmyelinated and myelinated segments of axons differ only in propagation speed, we compared spikes in unmyelinated intraretinal and myelinated extraretinal portions of retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons. Short interspike intervals and illumination increased spike duration intraretinally but not extraretinally. Consequently, light can change only whether and how often extraretinal spikes fire. Notably, this does not eliminate axonal spike duration differences between subtypes of RGC. This would allow previously described properties of narrower and broader spikes to facilitate signal transfer by different mechanisms at RGC synapses onto subcortical target neurons.</p>

Background<p>To compare the efficacies of univariate and radiomics analyses of amide proton transfer weighted (APT<sub>W</sub>) imaging in predicting isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) mutation of grade II/III gliomas.</p>Methods<p>Fifty-nine grade II/III glioma patients with known IDH1 mutation status were prospectively included (IDH1 wild type, 16; IDH1 mutation, 43). A total of 1044 quantitative radiomics features were extracted from APT<sub>W</sub> images. The efficacies of univariate and radiomics analyses in predicting IDH1 mutation were compared. Feature values were compared between two groups with independent t-test and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was applied to evaluate the predicting efficacy of each feature. Cases were randomly assigned to either the training (n = 49) or test cohort (n = 10) for the radiomics analysis. Support vector machine with recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE) was adopted to select the optimal feature subset. The adverse impact of the imbalance dataset in the training cohort was solved by synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE). Subsequently, the performance of SVM model was assessed on both training and test cohort.</p>Results<p>As for univariate analysis, 18 features were significantly different between IDH1 wild-type and mutant groups (P &lt; 0.05). Among these parameters, High Gray Level Run Emphasis All Direction offset 8 SD achieved the biggest area under the curve (AUC) (0.769) with the accuracy of 0.799. As for radiomics analysis, SVM model was established using 19 features selected with SVM-RFE. The AUC and accuracy for IDH1 mutation on training set were 0.892 and 0.952, while on the testing set were 0.7 and 0.84, respectively.</p>Conclusion<p>Radiomics strategy based on APT image features is potentially useful for preoperative estimating IDH1 mutation status.</p>

<p>Olfaction is a sense involved in a complex set of tasks, influencing eating behavior, increasing awareness of environmental hazards and affecting social communication. Surprisingly, smell disorders are very frequent, especially in the elderly population. Several recent studies conducted mostly in older subjects have demonstrated a strong association between olfactory impairment and overall mortality risk, with anosmia being even more predictive of 5 years mortality risk than cardiovascular disease. Presently, the underlying pathophysiology linking olfactory impairment to mortality remains unknown and only putative mechanisms are suggested. This review aims to examine the link between olfactory impairment and mortality and to discuss existing ideas on underlying existing mechanisms including, (1) the effect of olfactory loss on nutrition, life-threatening situations and social interactions, (2) associated neurodegenerative diseases, (3) accelerated brain aging, and (4) reflection of general health status being reflected in olfactory function.</p>

Introduction<p>The Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia (HSP) is a heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative disorders characterized by progressive spasticity and lower limbs (LL) weakness. There is no treatment to cure or halt the disease, except for symptomatic therapy. The use of botulinum toxin type A (BoNT-A) is one of the primary treatment for focal spasticity. Physiotherapy (PT) can help in maintaining residual functioning. We performed a retrospective study to evaluate the effect of the combined BoNT-A and intensive PT in patients with HSP.</p>Methods<p>Eighteen adult patients (50% females) with clinical diagnosis of HSP were recruited. Eleven patients had a genetic diagnosis of SPG4, 5, 7, 8, 11, 72. Patients were all autonomously deambulant or needed support. BoNT-A was injected in 36 LL in different spastic muscles under electromyographic guidance and followed by intensive PT sessions. Outcome measures included disease severity, motor functional measures, perceived pain self-report and quality of life. Assessments occurred at baseline, 1 and 3 months after BoNT-A injection.</p>Results<p>Most inoculated muscles were hamstrings, rectus femoris and gastrocnemius. We observed an improvement in muscle tone, in the gait velocity and distance length. Spastic Paraplegia Rating Scale was significantly reduced after treatment, in addition to improving pain and quality of life. These results were riconfirmed in 3 months time.</p>Conclusion<p>Our study indicates that combined treatment of BoNT-A and PT can lead to improvement of spasticity and quality of life in patients with HSP.</p>

<p>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurodegenerative illness that is unremittingly fatal and for which no effective treatment exists. All forms of ALS are characterized by protein aggregation. In familial forms of ALS, specific and heritable aggregation-prone proteins have been identified, such as mutant superoxide dismutase (SOD1). It has been suggested that a factor capable of preventing mutant SOD1 protein aggregation and/or disassembling mutant SOD1 protein aggregates would ameliorate SOD1-associated forms of familial ALS. Here we identify Fas Apoptosis Inhibitory Molecule (FAIM), a highly evolutionarily conserved 20 kDa protein, as an agent with this activity. We show FAIM counteracts intracellular accumulation of mutant SOD1 protein aggregates, which is increased in the absence of FAIM, as determined by pulse-shape analysis and filter trap assays. In a cell-free system, FAIM inhibits aggregation of mutant SOD1, and further disassembles and solubilizes established mutant SOD1 protein aggregates, as determined by thioflavin T (ThT), filter trap, and sedimentation assays. In sum, we report here a previously unknown activity of FAIM that opposes ALS disease-related protein aggregation and promotes proteostasis of an aggregation-prone ALS protein.</p>

<p>Biomedical imaging Is an important source of information in cancer research. Characterizations of cancer morphology at onset, progression, and in response to treatment provide complementary information to that gleaned from genomics and clinical data. Accurate extraction and classification of both visual and latent image features Is an increasingly complex challenge due to the increased complexity and resolution of biomedical image data. In this paper, we present four deep learning-based image analysis methods from the Computational Precision Medicine (CPM) satellite event of the 21st International Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention (MICCAI 2018) conference. One method Is a segmentation method designed to segment nuclei in whole slide tissue images (WSIs) of adult diffuse glioma cases. It achieved a Dice similarity coefficient of 0.868 with the CPM challenge datasets. Three methods are classification methods developed to categorize adult diffuse glioma cases into oligodendroglioma and astrocytoma classes using radiographic and histologic image data. These methods achieved accuracy values of 0.75, 0.80, and 0.90, measured as the ratio of the number of correct classifications to the number of total cases, with the challenge datasets. The evaluations of the four methods indicate that (1) carefully constructed deep learning algorithms are able to produce high accuracy in the analysis of biomedical image data and (2) the combination of radiographic with histologic image information improves classification performance.</p>

<p>Advances in computation and neuronal modeling have enabled the study of entire neural tissue systems with an impressive degree of biological realism. These efforts have focused largely on modeling dendrites and somas while largely neglecting axons. The need for biologically realistic explicit axonal models is particularly clear for applications involving clinical and therapeutic electrical stimulation because axons are generally more excitable than other neuroanatomical subunits. While many modeling efforts can rely on existing repositories of reconstructed dendritic/somatic morphologies to study real cells or to estimate parameters for a generative model, such datasets for axons are scarce and incomplete. Those that do exist may still be insufficient to build accurate models because the increased geometric variability of axons demands a proportional increase in data. To address this need, a Ruled-Optimum Ordered Tree System (ROOTS) was developed that extends the capability of neuronal morphology generative methods to include highly branched cortical axon terminal arbors. Further, this study presents and explores a clear use-case for such models in the prediction of cortical tissue response to externally applied electric fields. The results presented herein comprise (i) a quantitative and qualitative analysis of the generative algorithm proposed, (ii) a comparison of generated fibers with those observed in histological studies, (iii) a study of the requisite spatial and morphological complexity of axonal arbors for accurate prediction of neuronal response to extracellular electrical stimulation, and (iv) an extracellular electrical stimulation strength–duration analysis to explore probable thresholds of excitation of the dentate perforant path under controlled conditions. ROOTS demonstrates a superior ability to capture biological realism in model fibers, allowing improved accuracy in predicting the impact that microscale structures and branching patterns have on spatiotemporal patterns of activity in the presence of extracellular electric fields.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00025">Antidepressant Paroxetine Exerts Developmental Neurotoxicity in an iPSC-Derived 3D Human Brain Model</a></h4>

<p>Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are frequently used to treat depression during pregnancy. Various concerns have been raised about the possible effects of these drugs on fetal development. Current developmental neurotoxicity (DNT) testing conducted in rodents is expensive, time-consuming, and does not necessarily represent human pathophysiology. A human, in vitro testing battery to cover key events of brain development, could potentially overcome these challenges. In this study, we assess the DNT of paroxetine—a widely used SSRI which has shown contradictory evidence regarding effects on human brain development using a versatile, organotypic human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived brain model (BrainSpheres). At therapeutic blood concentrations, which lie between 20 and 60 ng/ml, Paroxetine led to an 80% decrease in the expression of synaptic markers, a 60% decrease in neurite outgrowth and a 40–75% decrease in the overall oligodendrocyte cell population, compared to controls. These results were consistently shown in two different iPSC lines and indicate that relevant therapeutic concentrations of Paroxetine induce brain cell development abnormalities which could lead to adverse effects.</p>

Background<p>Memory deficits are linked to dysfunctional HPA axis activity and negative affect in older adults. This study evaluated the mediating effect of the diurnal cortisol pattern on the relationship between affect and memory in older people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI).</p>Methods<p>This longitudinal study recruited 189 Chinese older adults with MCI from elderly centers in Hong Kong. The participants completed assessments of affect, salivary cortisol, and digit spans at baseline; neurocognitive assessments on verbal fluency, memory retrieval, and digit spans at 6-month follow-up; and instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) at 1-year follow-up. Structural equation modeling examined the direct and indirect effects of negative affect on memory and IADL via diurnal cortisol pattern.</p>Results<p>Controlling for covariates, negative affect significantly predicted flattened diurnal cortisol slopes (β = 0.17, p &lt; 0.05) but not memory or IADL (p = 0.23 – 0.91) directly. Diurnal cortisol slopes negatively predicted memory retrieval (β = −0.20, p &lt; 0.05), which in turn positively predicted IADL (β = 0.22, p &lt; 0.01). The indirect effect from negative affect to IADL via cortisol slope and memory retrieval was significant and negative (αβγ = −0.05, 95% bootstrapped CI = −0.248 to −0.001).</p>Discussion<p>The present study established certain temporal linkages among affect and cortisol slopes at baseline, memory retrieval at 6 months, and functional decline 1 year later in older adults with MCI. Flattened diurnal cortisol slopes might mediate the detrimental effects of negative affect on memory retrieval and functioning across 1 year.</p>

Abstract
<p>In this study, we use an optogenetic inhibitor of c-Jun NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal kinase (JNK) in dendritic spine sub-compartments of rat hippocampal neurons. We show that JNK inhibition exerts rapid (within seconds) reorganization of actin in the spine-head. Using real-time Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) to measure JNK activity, we find that either excitotoxic insult (NMDA) or endocrine stress (corticosterone), activate spine-head JNK causing internalization of AMPARs and spine retraction. Both events are prevented upon optogenetic inhibition of JNK, and rescued by JNK inhibition even 2 h after insult. Moreover, we identify that the fast-acting anti-depressant ketamine reduces JNK activity in hippocampal neurons suggesting that JNK inhibition may be a downstream mediator of its anti-depressant effect. In conclusion, we show that JNK activation plays a role in triggering spine elimination by NMDA or corticosterone stress, whereas inhibition of JNK facilitates regrowth of spines even in the continued presence of glucocorticoid. This identifies that JNK acts locally in the spine-head to promote AMPAR internalization and spine shrinkage following stress, and reveals a protective function for JNK inhibition in preventing spine regression.</p>

<p>Hair cells are sensitive to many insults including environmental toxins such as heavy metals. We show here that cadmium can consistently kill hair cells of the zebrafish lateral line. Disrupting hair cell mechanotransduction genetically or pharmacologically significantly reduces the amount of hair cell death seen in response to cadmium, suggesting a role for mechanotransduction in this cell death process, possibly as a means for cadmium uptake into the cells. Likewise, when looking at multiple cilia-associated gene mutants that have previously been shown to be resistant to aminoglycoside-induced hair cell death, resistance to cadmium-induced hair cell death is only seen in those with mechanotransduction defects. In contrast to what was seen with mechanotransduction, significant protection was not consistently seen from other ions previously shown to compete for cadmium uptake into cells or tissue including zinc and copper. These results show that functional mechanotransduction activity is playing a significant role in cadmium-induced hair cell death.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00032">Filling the Gaps – A Call for Comprehensive Analysis of Extracellular Matrix of the Glial Scar in Region- and Injury-Specific Contexts</a></h4>

<p>Central nervous system (CNS) injury results in chronic scar formation that interferes with function and inhibits repair. Extracellular matrix (ECM) is prominent in the scar and potently regulates cell behavior. However, comprehensive information about the ECM proteome is largely lacking, and region- as well as injury-specific differences are often not taken into account. These aspects are the focus of our perspective on injury and scar formation. To highlight the importance of such comprehensive proteome analysis we include data obtained with novel analysis tools of the ECM composition in the scar and show the contribution of monocytes to the ECM composition after traumatic brain injury (TBI). Monocyte invasion was reduced using the CCR2-/- mouse line and step-wise de-cellularization and proteomics allowed determining monocyte-dependent ECM composition and architecture of the glial scar. We find significant reduction in the ECM proteins Tgm1, Itih (1,2, and 3), and Ftl in the absence of monocyte invasion. We also describe the scar ECM comprising zones with distinctive composition and show a subacute signature upon comparison to proteome obtained at earlier times after TBI. These results are discussed in light of injury-, region- and time-specific regulation of scar formation highlighting the urgent need to differentiate injury conditions and CNS-regions using comprehensive ECM analysis.</p>

<p>Morphine is a potent analgesic opiate commonly used in treating pain, and it is also a substance of abuse and highly addictive. Hence, it is vital to discover the action sites of morphine in the brain to increase its efficacy of treatment. In the present study, we aimed at identifying comprehensive neuroanatomical locations that are sensitive to morphine in the adult zebrafish (Danio rerio). We performed in situ hybridization to localize the mu opioid receptor (oprm1) gene and to map the morphine sensitive brain areas using neuronal PAS domain-containing protein 4a (npas4a), an early gene marker. Real-time PCR was used to detect changes in mRNA levels of oprm1 and npas4a in control and acute morphine treated fish (2 mg/L; 20 min). Intense positive oprm1 signals were seen in the telencephalon, preoptic area, habenula, hypothalamic area and periventricular gray zone of the optic tectum. Acute morphine exposure significantly increased oprm1 and npas4a mRNA levels in the medial zone of dorsal telencephalon (Dm), ventral region of the ventral telencephalon (Vv), preoptic area, and in the hypothalamus but a decrease in oprm1 and npas4a signals in the dorsal habenula. This study provides a detailed map of oprm1 localization in the brain, which includes previously unreported oprm1 in the habenula of teleost. Presence of oprm1 in multiple brain sites implies multiple action targets of morphine and potential brain functions which could include reward, cognitive and negative emotions.</p>

<p>The current longitudinal study examined factors (sex, physical function, response to novelty, ability to adapt to a shift in light/dark cycle, brain connectivity), which might predict the emergence of impaired memory during aging. Male and female Fisher 344 rats were tested at 6, 12, and 18 months of age. Impaired spatial memory developed in middle-age (12 months), particularly in males, and the propensity for impairment increased with advanced age. A reduced response to novelty was observed over the course of aging, which is inconsistent with cross-sectional studies. This divergence likely resulted from differences in the history of environmental enrichment/impoverishment for cross-sectional and longitudinal studies. Animals that exhibited lower level exploration of the inner region on the open field test exhibited better memory at 12 months. Furthermore, males that exhibited a longer latency to enter a novel environment at 6 months, exhibited better memory at 12 months. For females, memory at 12 months was correlated with the ability to behaviorally adapt to a shift in light/dark cycle. Functional magnetic resonance imaging of the brain, conducted at 12 months, indicated that the decline in memory was associated with altered functional connectivity within different memory systems, most notably between the hippocampus and multiple regions such as the retrosplenial cortex, thalamus, striatum, and amygdala. Overall, some factors, specifically response to novelty at an early age and the capacity to adapt to shifts in light cycle, predicted spatial memory in middle-age, and spatial memory is associated with corresponding changes in brain connectivity. We discuss similarities and differences related to previous longitudinal and cross-sectional studies, as well as the role of sex differences in providing a theoretical framework to guide future longitudinal research on the trajectory of cognitive decline. In addition to demonstrating the power of longitudinal studies, these data highlight the importance of middle-age for identifying potential predictive indicators of sexual dimorphism in the trajectory in brain and cognitive aging.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00033">Can Brief Cognitive or Medication Management Tasks Identify the Potential for Dependence in Instrumental Activities of Daily Living?</a></h4>

<p>Background and Objectives: The identification of functional performance deficits is critical to the community independence of older adults. We examined whether a combined cognitive and performance-based medication management measure would be able to better classify an individual’s functional cognitive status and potential for instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) impairment than either measure alone.</p><p>Research Design and Methods: Community-dwelling adults age 55 and older (n = 185) were administered the Mini-Cog, the Medication Transfer Screen-Revised (MTS-R), a combination measure the Medi-Cog-Revised (Medi-Cog-R), the Performance Assessment of Self-Care Skills (PASS) Checkbook Balancing and Shopping tasks (PCST), additional cognitive screening measures, and a self-report daily living scale. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses were computed for the Mini-Cog, MTS-R and the Medi-Cog-R using the PCST performance as the criterion measure. The area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity were computed for each measure.</p><p>Results: The Medi-Cog-R most accurately identified individuals as impaired on the PCST. An AUC statistic of 0.82 for the Medi-Cog-R was greater than either the Mini-Cog (0.75) or the MTS-R (0.73). The Medi-Cog-R demonstrated a sensitivity of 0.71 and a specificity of 0.78 in classifying individuals with impaired IADL as measured by the PCST.</p><p>Discussion and Implications: The Mini-Cog, the MTS-R, and the Medi-Cog-R all show discriminant validity, but the combined measure demonstrates greater sensitivity and specificity than either component measure alone in identifying IADL impairment. The Medi-Cog-R appears to be a useful screening measure for functional cognition and can be used to prompt further assessment and intervention to promote community independence.</p>

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Clinical trials in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) continue to rely on survival or functional scales as endpoints, despite the emergence of quantitative biomarkers. Neuroimaging‐based biomarkers in ALS have been shown to detect ALS‐associated pathology in vivo, although anatomical patterns of disease spread are poorly characterized. The objective of this study is to simulate disease propagation using network analyses of cerebral MRI data to predict disease progression.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Using brain networks of ALS patients (n=208) and matched controls across longitudinal time points, network‐based statistics unraveled progressive network degeneration originating from the motor cortex and expanding in a spatiotemporal manner. We applied a computational model to the MRI scan of patients to simulate this progressive network degeneration. Simulated aggregation levels at the group‐ and individual level were validated with empirical impairment observed at later time points of white matter and clinical decline using both internal and external datasets.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We observe that computer simulated aggregation levels mimic true disease patterns in ALS patients. Simulated patterns of involvement across cortical areas show significant overlap with the patterns of empirically impaired brain regions on later scans, both at the group and individual levels. These findings are validated using an external longitudinal dataset of 30 patients.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our results are in accordance with established pathological staging systems and may have implications for patient stratification in future clinical trials. Our results demonstrate the utility of computational models in ALS to predict disease progression and underscore the potential as a prognostic biomarker.</p>

<p>Increase in blood–brain barrier (BBB) permeability is a crucial step in neuroinflammatory processes. We previously showed that N Methyl D Aspartate Receptor (NMDARs), expressed on cerebral endothelial cells forming the BBB, regulate immune cell infiltration across this barrier in the mouse. Here, we describe the mechanism responsible for the action of NMDARs on BBB permeabilization. We report that mouse CNS endothelial NMDARs display the regulatory GluN3A subunit. This composition confers to NMDARs' unconventional properties: these receptors do not induce Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx but rather show nonionotropic properties. In inflammatory conditions, costimulation of human brain endothelial cells by NMDA agonists (NMDA or glycine) and the serine protease tissue plasminogen activator, previously shown to potentiate NMDAR activity, induces metabotropic signaling via the Rho/ROCK pathway. This pathway leads to an increase in permeability via phosphorylation of myosin light chain and subsequent shrinkage of human brain endothelial cells. Together, these data draw a link between NMDARs and the cytoskeleton in brain endothelial cells that regulates BBB permeability in inflammatory conditions.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The authors describe how NMDARs expressed on endothelial cells regulate blood–brain barrier function via myosin light chain phosphorylation and increase in permeability. They report that these non-neuronal NMDARs display distinct structural, functional, and pharmacological features than their neuronal counterparts.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2020.00006">Passive Coping Strategies During Repeated Social Defeat Are Associated With Long-Lasting Changes in Sleep in Rats</a></h4>

<p>Exposure to severe stress has immediate and prolonged neuropsychiatric consequences and increases the risk of developing Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Importantly, PTSD develops in only a subset of individuals after exposure to a traumatic event, with the understanding of this selective vulnerability being very limited. Individuals who go on to develop PTSD after a traumatic experience typically demonstrate sleep disturbances including persistent insomnia and recurrent trauma-related nightmares. We previously established a repeated social defeat paradigm in which rats segregate into either passively or actively coping subpopulations, and we found that this distinction correlates with measures of vulnerability or resilience to stress. In this study, we examined differences between these two behavioral phenotypes in sleep changes resulting from repeated social defeat stress. Our data indicate that, compared to control and actively coping rats, passively coping rats have less slow-wave sleep (SWS) for at least 2 weeks after the end of a series of exposures to social defeat. Furthermore, resilient rats show less exaggerated motor activation at awakenings from rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and less fragmentation of REM sleep compared to control and passively coping rats. Together, these data associate a passive coping strategy in response to repeated social defeat stress with persisting sleep disturbances. Conversely, an active coping strategy may be associated with resilience to sleep disturbances. These findings may have both prognostic and therapeutic applications to stress-associated neuropsychiatric disorders, including PTSD.</p>

<p>Cutaneous sensation is vital to controlling our hands and upper limbs. It helps close the motor control loop by informing adjustments of grasping forces during object manipulations and provides much of the information the brain requires to perceive our limbs as a part of our bodies. This sensory information is absent to upper-limb prosthesis users. Although robotic prostheses are becoming increasingly sophisticated, the absence of feedback imposes a reliance on open-loop control and limits the functional potential as an integrated part of the body. Experimental systems to restore physiologically relevant sensory information to prosthesis users are beginning to emerge. However, the impact of their long-term use on functional abilities, body image, and neural adaptation processes remains unclear. Understanding these effects is essential to transition sensate prostheses from sophisticated assistive tools to integrated replacement limbs. We recruited three participants with high-level upper-limb amputation who previously received targeted reinnervation surgery. Each participant was fit with a neural-machine-interface prosthesis that allowed participants to operate their device by thinking about moving their missing limb. Additionally, we fit a sensory feedback system that allowed participants to experience touch to the prosthesis as touch on their missing limb. All three participants performed a long-term take-home trial. Two participants used their neural-machine-interface systems with touch feedback and one control participant used his prescribed, insensate prosthesis. A series of functional outcome metrics and psychophysical evaluations were performed using sensate neural-machine-interface prostheses before and after the take-home period to capture changes in functional abilities, limb embodiment, and neural adaptation. Our results demonstrated that the relationship between users and sensate neural-machine-interface prostheses is dynamic and changes with long-term use. The presence of touch sensation had a near-immediate impact on how the users operated their prostheses. In the multiple independent measures of users’ functional abilities employed, we observed a spectrum of performance changes following long-term use. Furthermore, after the take-home period, participants more appropriately integrated their prostheses into their body images and psychophysical tests provided strong evidence that neural and cortical adaptation occurred.</p>

Through a proof-of-concept application, the characterization of the wireless network performances was assessed to check the adequacy of this solution with open-loop and closed-loop control requirements. We show the guaranteed time performances over the network through the control of quadriceps and hamstrings stimulation parameters based on the monitoring of the knee joint angle.

<p>Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases are the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorders in aging. Hyposmia has been described as an early symptom that can precede cognitive and motor deficits by decades. Certain regions within the olfactory system, such as the anterior olfactory nucleus, display the neuropathological markers tau and amyloid-β or α-synuclein from the earliest stages of disease progression in a preferential manner. Specific neuronal subpopulations, namely those expressing somatostatin (SST), are preferentially affected throughout the olfactory and limbic systems. SST is a neuropeptide present in a subpopulation of GABAergic interneurons throughout the brain and its main function is to inhibit principal neurons and/or other interneurons. It has been reported that SST expression is reduced by 50% in Alzheimer’s disease and that it is related to the formation of Aβ oligomers. The mechanisms underlying the preferential vulnerability of SST-expressing neurons in Alzheimer’s disease (and, to a minor extent, in Parkinson’s disease) are not known but analysis of the available data could shed light on their etiology. This short review aims to update the knowledge of functional features of somatostatin within the olfactory system and its role in olfactory deficits during neurodegeneration.</p>

<p>The consistency, efficacy, and safety of cannabis-based medicines have been demonstrated in humans, leading to the approval of the first cannabis-based therapy to alleviate spasticity and pain associated with multiple sclerosis (MS). Indeed, the evidence supporting the therapeutic potential of cannabinoids for the management of pathological events related to this disease is ever increasing. Different mechanisms of action have been proposed for cannabis-based treatments in mouse models of demyelination, such as Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis (EAE) and Theiler’s Murine Encephalomyelitis Virus-Induced Demyelinating Disease (TMEV-IDD). Cells in the immune and nervous system express the machinery to synthesize and degrade endocannabinoids, as well as their CB1 and CB2 receptors, each mediating different intracellular pathways upon activation. Hence, the effects of cannabinoids on cells of the immune system, on the blood-brain barrier (BBB), microglia, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes and neurons, potentially open the way for a plethora of therapeutic actions on different targets that could aid the management of MS. As such, cannabinoids could have an important impact on the outcome of MS in terms of the resolution of inflammation or the potentiation of endogenous repair in the central nervous system (CNS), as witnessed in the EAE, TMEV-IDD and toxic demyelination models, and through other in vitro approaches. In this mini review article, we summarize what is currently known about the peripheral and central effects of cannabinoids in relation to the neuroinflammation coupled to MS. We pay special attention to their effects on remyelination and axon preservation within the CNS, considering the major questions raised in the field and future research directions.</p>

<p>The cerebral cortical tissue of murine embryo and pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons can survive in the adult brain and extend axons to the spinal cord. These features suggest that cell transplantation can be a strategy to reconstruct the corticospinal tract (CST). It is unknown, however, which cell population makes for safe and effective donor cells. To address this issue, we grafted the cerebral cortex of E14.5 mouse to the brain of adult mice and found that the cells in the graft extending axons along the CST expressed CTIP2. By using CTIP2:GFP knock-in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs), we identified L1CAM as a cell surface marker to enrich CTIP2<sup>+</sup> cells. We sorted L1CAM<sup>+</sup> cells from E14.5 mouse brain and confirmed that they extended a larger number of axons along the CST compared to L1CAM<sup>−</sup> cells. Our results suggest that sorting L1CAM<sup>+</sup> cells from the embryonic cerebral cortex enriches subcortical projection neurons to reconstruct the CST.</p>

<p>Axonal development is essential to the establishment of neuronal morphology and circuitry, although the mechanisms underlying axonal outgrowth during the early developmental stages remain unclear. Here, we showed that the conserved disco-interacting protein B (DIP2B) which consists of a DMAP1 domain and a crotonobetaine/carnitine CoA ligase (Caic) domain, is highly expressed in the excitatory neurons of the hippocampus. DIP2B knockout led to excessive axonal outgrowth but not polarity at an early developmental stage. Furthermore, the loss of DIP2B inhibited synaptic transmission for both spontaneous and rapid release in cultured hippocampal neurons. Interestingly, DIP2B function during axonal outgrowth requires tubulin acetylation. These findings reveal a new conserved regulator of neuronal morphology and provide a novel intervention mechanism for neurocognitive disorders.</p>

<p>Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder and the main cause of dementia among the elderly worldwide. Unfortunately, the mechanism of AD remains unclear, and no effective therapies are available yet. An increasing amount of studies have demonstrated that long non-coding RNAs (LncRNAs) play a notable role in the pathogenesis of plenty of human diseases, and they have served as biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets. However, the function of LncRNAs in AD remains unclear. This study aimed to explore the potential role of LncRNA nuclear enriched abundant transcript 1 (NEAT1) in AD. We found that LncRNA NEAT1 was upregulated in the AD animal models. Furthermore, we demonstrated that NEAT1 could interact with NEDD4L and promote PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1)’s ubiquitination and degradation and then impaired PINK1-dependent autophagy. Collectively, the lncRNA NEAT1 promotes the pathogenesis of AD and serves as a promising novel target for pharmacological intervention.</p>

<p>Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is often considered a critical time window for predicting early conversion to Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Brain functional connectome data (i.e., functional connections, global and nodal graph metrics) based on resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) provides numerous information about brain networks and has been used to discriminate normal controls (NCs) from subjects with MCI. In this paper, Student’s t-tests and group-least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (group-LASSO) were used to extract functional connections with significant differences and the most discriminative network nodes, respectively. Based on group-LASSO, the middle temporal, inferior temporal, lingual, posterior cingulate, and middle frontal gyri were the most predominant brain regions for nodal observation in MCI patients. Nodal graph metrics (within-module degree, participation coefficient, and degree centrality) showed the maximum discriminative ability. To effectively combine the multipattern information, we employed the multiple kernel learning support vector machine (MKL-SVM). Combined with functional connectome information, the MKL-SVM achieved a good classification performance (area under the receiving operating characteristic curve = 0.9728). Additionally, the altered brain connectome pattern revealed that functional connectivity was generally decreased in the whole-brain network, whereas graph theory topological attributes of some special nodes in the brain network were increased in MCI patients. Our findings demonstrate that optimal feature selection and combination of all connectome features (i.e., functional connections, global and nodal graph metrics) can achieve good performance in discriminating NCs from MCI subjects. Thus, the combination of functional connections and global and nodal graph metrics of brain networks can predict the occurrence of MCI and contribute to the early clinical diagnosis of AD.</p>

The use of advanced technological solutions (“neurotechnologies”) can improve the clinical outcomes of neurorehabilitation after stroke. Here, Micera et al. propose a paradigm shift that is based on a deep understanding of the basic mechanisms of natural stroke recovery and technology-assisted neurorehabilitation to improve the clinical effectiveness of neurotechnology.

Confidence in perceptual decisions scales neural responses to violations in reward expectation. In this issue of Neuron, Lak et al. (2020) show that the medial prefrontal cortex in mice computes a confidence-dependent expectation signal that influences how dopamine neurons convey reward prediction errors to guide learning.

Balance between excitation and inhibition (E-I balance) in neural circuits is believed to be tightly regulated. To the contrary, in this issue of Neuron, Bridi et al. (2020) reveal that inverse oscillations of synaptic inhibition and excitation lead to peaks and valleys in E-I balance across the 24 h day.

You may have already noticed some of our growth and development, but this month we are moving into a new phase by rolling out the first elements of a new look for all of Cell Press. We have a new logo, a new color scheme that is unified across all that we do, and an underlying ethos that looks to the future of science and its role in society. We are a broader and more diverse organization than we used to be, with coverage across many scientific disciplines, and we have reached a point in our evolution where this type of external change is overdue.

<p>TAR DNA binding protein 43 kDa (TDP-43) is a ribonuclear protein regulating many aspects of RNA metabolism. Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration (FTLD) are fatal neurodegenerative diseases with the presence of TDP-43 aggregates in neuronal cells. Chaperone Mediated Autophagy (CMA) is a lysosomal degradation pathway participating in the proteostasis of several cytosolic proteins including neurodegenerative associated proteins. In addition, protein oligomers or aggregates can affect the status of CMA. In this work, we studied the relationship between CMA and the physiological and pathological forms of TDP-43. First, we found that recombinant TDP-43 was specifically degraded by rat liver’s CMA+ lysosomes and that endogenous TDP-43 is localized in rat brain’s CMA+ lysosomes, indicating that TDP-43 can be a CMA substrate in vivo. Next, by using a previously reported TDP-43 aggregation model, we have shown that wild-type and an aggregate-prone form of TDP-43 are detected in CMA+ lysosomes isolated from cell cultures. In addition, their protein levels increased in cells displaying CMA down-regulation, indicating that these two TDP-43 forms are CMA substrates in vitro. Finally, we observed that the aggregate-prone form of TDP-43 is able to interact with Hsc70, to co-localize with Lamp2A, and to up-regulate the levels of these molecular components of CMA. The latter was followed by an up-regulation of the CMA activity and lysosomal damage. Altogether our data shows that: (i) TDP-43 is a CMA substrate; (ii) CMA can contribute to control the turnover of physiological and pathological forms of TDP-43; and (iii) TDP-43 aggregation can affect CMA performance. Overall, this work contributes to understanding how a dysregulation between CMA and TDP-43 would participate in neuropathological mechanisms associated with TDP-43 aggregation.</p>

<p>The specific role of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) in emotional and behavioral regulation—particularly in relation to automatic processes—has gained increased attention in the sensory modulation literature. This mini-review article summarizes current knowledge about the role of the ANS in sensory modulation, with a focus on the integrated functions of the ANS and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and their measurement. Research from the past decade illustrates that sympathetic and parasympathetic interactions are more complex than previously assumed. Patterns of ANS activation vary across individuals, with distinct physiological response profiles influencing the reactivity underlying automatic behavioral responses. This review article advances a deeper understanding of stress and the complex stress patterns within the ANS and HPA axis that contribute to allostatic load (AL). We argue that using multiple physiological measurements to capture individual ANS response variation is critical for effectively treating children with sensory modulation disorder (SMD) and sensory differences. We consider the relative contributions of automatic vs. deliberately controlled processes across large-scale neural networks in the development of sensorimotor function and their associated links with arousal patterns and sensory over- and under-responsivity.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2020.00005">A Tactile Virtual Reality for the Study of Active Somatosensation</a></h4>

<p>Natural exploration of textures involves active sensing, i.e., voluntary movements of tactile sensors (e.g., human fingertips or rodent whiskers) across a target surface. Somatosensory input during moving tactile sensors varies according to both the movement and the surface texture. Combining motor and sensory information, the brain is capable of extracting textural features of the explored surface. Despite the ecological relevance of active sensing, psychophysical studies on active touch are largely missing. One reason for the lack of informative studies investigating active touch is the considerable challenge of assembling an appropriate experimental setup. A possible solution might be in the realm of virtual tactile reality that provides tactile finger stimulation depending on the position of the hand and the simulated texture of a target surface. In addition to rigorous behavioral studies, the investigation of the neuronal mechanisms of active tactile sensing in humans is highly warranted, requiring neurophysiological experiments using electroencephalography (EEG), magnetoencephalography (MEG) and/or functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). However, current neuroimaging techniques impose specific requirements on the tactile stimulus delivery equipment in terms of compatibility with the neurophysiological methods being used. Here, we present a user-friendly, MEG compatible, tactile virtual reality simulator. The simulator consists of a piezo-electric tactile stimulator capable of independently protruding 16 plastic pistons of 1 mm diameter arranged in a 4 × 4 matrix. The stimulator delivers a spatial pattern of tactile stimuli to the tip of a finger depending on the position of the finger moving across a 2-dimensional plane. In order to demonstrate the functionality of the tactile virtual reality, we determined participants’ detection thresholds in active and passive touch conditions. Thresholds in both conditions were higher than reported in the literature. It could well be that the processing of the piston-related stimulation was masked by the sensory input generated by placing the finger on the scanning probe. More so, the thresholds for both the active and passive tasks did not differ significantly. In further studies, the noise introduced by the stimulator in neuromagnetic recordings was quantified and somatosensory evoked fields for active and passive touch were recorded. Due to the compatibility of the stimulator with neuroimaging techniques such as MEG, and based on the feasibility to record somatosensory-related neuromagnetic brain activity the apparatus has immense potential for the exploration of the neural underpinnings of active tactile perception.</p>

<p>Captioning is the process of transcribing speech and acoustical information into text to help deaf and hard of hearing people accessing to the auditory track of audiovisual media. In addition to the verbal transcription, it includes information such as sound effects, speaker identification, or music tagging. However, it just takes into account a limited spectrum of the whole acoustic information available in the soundtrack, and hence, an important amount of emotional information is lost when attending just to the normative compliant captions. In this article, it is shown, by means of behavioral and EEG measurements, how emotional information related to sounds and music used by the creator in the audiovisual work is perceived differently by normal hearing group and hearing disabled group when applying standard captioning. Audio and captions activate similar processing areas, respectively, in each group, although not with the same intensity. Moreover, captions require higher activation of voluntary attentional circuits, as well as language-related areas. Captions transcribing musical information increase attentional activity, instead of emotional processing.</p>

Objective<p>Cigarette smoke (CS) exposure reportedly enhances allergic airway inflammation. However, some studies have shown an association between current cigarette smoke exposure and a low risk for allergic rhinitis. Thus, the impact of CS exposure on allergic rhinitis remains poorly understood. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of CS on the respiratory mucosa (RM) and the olfactory epithelium (OE) of mice with allergic rhinitis, as the effects may differ depending on the nasal histological compartments.</p>Methods<p>Eight-week-old male BALB/c mice were used for this study. We developed a mouse model of smoking by intranasally administering 10 doses of a CS solution (CSS), and a mouse model of allergic rhinitis by sensitization with intraperitoneal ovalbumin (OVA) injection and intranasal challenge with OVA. We examined the effects of CS on the nasal RM and OE in mice with or without allergic rhinitis using histological, serum, and genetic analyses. First, we examine whether CSS exposure induces allergic responses and then, examined allergic responses in the OVA-sensitized allergic rhinitis mice with or without CSS exposure.</p>Results<p>Short-term CSS administration intensified allergic responses including increased infiltration of eosinophils and inflammatory cells and upregulation of interleukin-5 expression in the nasal RM of OVA-immunized mice, although only CSS induced neither allergic responses nor impairment of the RM and OE. Notably, repetitive OVA-immunization partially impaired the OE in the upper-lateral area, but CSS administration did not reinforce this impairment in OVA-induced allergic mice.</p>Conclusion<p>Short-term CSS exposure strengthened allergic responses in the nasal RM and did not change the structure of the OE. These results suggest that patients with allergic rhinitis could experience exacerbation of allergic symptoms after CS exposure.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00105">Assessing Time-Resolved fNIRS for Brain-Computer Interface Applications of Mental Communication</a></h4>

<p>Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are becoming increasingly popular as a tool to improve the quality of life of patients with disabilities. Recently, time-resolved functional near-infrared spectroscopy (TR-fNIRS) based BCIs are gaining traction because of their enhanced depth sensitivity leading to lower signal contamination from the extracerebral layers. This study presents the first account of TR-fNIRS based BCI for “mental communication” on healthy participants. Twenty-one (21) participants were recruited and were repeatedly asked a series of questions where they were instructed to imagine playing tennis for “yes” and to stay relaxed for “no.” The change in the mean time-of-flight of photons was used to calculate the change in concentrations of oxy- and deoxyhemoglobin since it provides a good compromise between depth sensitivity and signal-to-noise ratio. Features were extracted from the average oxyhemoglobin signals to classify them as “yes” or “no” responses. Linear-discriminant analysis (LDA) and support vector machine (SVM) classifiers were used to classify the responses using the leave-one-out cross-validation method. The overall accuracies achieved for all participants were 75% and 76%, using LDA and SVM, respectively. The results also reveal that there is no significant difference in accuracy between questions. In addition, physiological parameters [heart rate (HR) and mean arterial pressure (MAP)] were recorded on seven of the 21 participants during motor imagery (MI) and rest to investigate changes in these parameters between conditions. No significant difference in these parameters was found between conditions. These findings suggest that TR-fNIRS could be suitable as a BCI for patients with brain injuries.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00051">Functional Integration and Segregation in Multiplex Brain Networks for Alzheimer's Disease</a></h4>

<p>Growing evidence links impairment of brain functions in Alzheimer's disease (AD) with disruptions of brain functional connectivity. However, whether the AD brain shows similar changes from a dynamic or cross-frequency view remains poorly explored. This paper provides an effective framework to investigate the properties of multiplex brain networks in AD considering inter-frequency and temporal dynamics. Using resting-state EEG signals, two types of multiplex networks were reconstructed separately considering the network interactions between different frequency bands or time points. We further applied multiplex network features to characterize functional integration and segregation of the cross-frequency or time-varying networks. Finally, machine learning methods were employed to evaluate the performance of multiplex-network-based indexes for detection of AD. Results revealed that the brain networks of AD patients are disrupted with reduced segregation particularly in the left occipital area for both cross-frequency and time-varying networks. However, the alteration of integration differs among brain regions and may show an increasing trend in the frontal area of AD brain. By combining the features of integration and segregation in time-varying networks, the best classification performance was achieved with an accuracy of 92.5%. These findings suggest that our multiplex framework can be applied to explore functional integration and segregation of brain networks and characterize the abnormalities of brain function. This may shed new light on the brain network analysis and extend our understanding of brain function in patients with neurological diseases.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00045">Src Inhibition Attenuates Neuroinflammation and Protects Dopaminergic Neurons in Parkinson’s Disease Models</a></h4>

<p>Chronic neuroinflammation is of great importance in the pathogenesis of Parkinson’s disease (PD). During the process of neuroinflammation, overactivated microglia release many proinflammatory factors, which eventually induce neurodegeneration. Inhibition of excessive microglial activation is regarded as a promising strategy for PD treatment. Src is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase that is closely related to tumors. Recently, some reports indicated that Src is a central mediator in multiple signaling pathways including neuroinflammation. The aim of our study was to demonstrate the role of Src in microglial regulation and neuroinflammation. The lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated BV2 microglia model and the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced PD model were applied in this study. The results showed that inhibition of Src could significantly relieve microgliosis and decrease levels of inflammatory factors. Besides, inhibition of Src function reduced the loss of dopaminergic neurons and improved the motor behavior of the MPTP-treated mice. Thus, this study not only verified the critical role of Src tyrosine kinase in neuroinflammation but also further proved that interfering neuroinflammation is beneficial for PD treatment. More importantly, this study shed a light on the hypothesis that Src tyrosine kinase might be a potential therapeutic target for PD and other neuroinflammation-related diseases.</p>

<p>Developments of new strategies to restore vision and improving on current strategies by harnessing new advancements in material and electrical sciences, and biological and genetic-based technologies are of upmost health priorities around the world. Federal and private entities are spending billions of dollars on visual prosthetics technologies. This review describes the most current and state-of-the-art bioengineering technologies to restore vision. This includes a thorough description of traditional electrode-based visual prosthetics that have improved substantially since early prototypes. Recent advances in molecular and synthetic biology have transformed vision-assisted technologies; For example, optogenetic technologies that introduce light-responsive proteins offer excellent resolution but cortical applications are restricted by fiber implantation and tissue damage. Other stimulation modalities, such as magnetic fields, have been explored to achieve non-invasive neuromodulation. Miniature magnetic coils are currently being developed to activate select groups of neurons. Magnetically-responsive nanoparticles or exogenous proteins can significantly enhance the coupling between external electromagnetic devices and any neurons affiliated with these modifications. The need to minimize cytotoxic effects for nanoparticle-based therapies will likely restrict the number of usable materials. Nevertheless, advances in identifying and utilizing proteins that respond to magnetic fields may lead to non-invasive, cell-specific stimulation and may overcome many of the limitations that currently exist with other methods. Finally, sensory substitution systems also serve as viable visual prostheses by converting visual input to auditory and somatosensory stimuli. This review also discusses major challenges in the field and offers bioengineering strategies to overcome those.</p>

<p>Natural brains perform miraculously well in learning new tasks from a small number of samples, whereas sample efficient learning is still a major open problem in the field of machine learning. Here, we raise the question, how the neural coding scheme affects sample efficiency, and make first progress on this question by proposing and analyzing a learning algorithm that uses a simple reinforce-type plasticity mechanism and does not require any gradients to learn low dimensional mappings. It harnesses three bio-plausible mechanisms, namely, population codes with bell shaped tuning curves, continous attractor mechanisms and probabilistic synapses, to achieve sample efficient learning. We show both theoretically and by simulations that population codes with broadly tuned neurons lead to high sample efficiency, whereas codes with sharply tuned neurons account for high final precision. Moreover, a dynamic adaptation of the tuning width during learning gives rise to both, high sample efficiency and high final precision. We prove a sample efficiency guarantee for our algorithm that lies within a logarithmic factor from the information theoretical optimum. Our simulations show that for low dimensional mappings, our learning algorithm achieves comparable sample efficiency to multi-layer perceptrons trained by gradient descent, although it does not use any gradients. Furthermore, it achieves competitive sample efficiency in low dimensional reinforcement learning tasks. From a machine learning perspective, these findings may inspire novel approaches to improve sample efficiency. From a neuroscience perspective, these findings suggest sample efficiency as a yet unstudied functional role of adaptive tuning curve width.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2020.00011">Resonance in the Mouse Ventral Tegmental Area Dopaminergic Network Induced by Regular and Poisson Distributed Optogenetic Stimulation in-vitro</a></h4>

<p>Neurons in many brain regions exhibit spontaneous, intrinsic rhythmic firing activity. This rhythmic firing activity may determine the way in which these neurons respond to extrinsic synaptic inputs. We hypothesized that neurons should be most responsive to inputs at the frequency of the intrinsic oscillation frequency. We addressed this question in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), a dopaminergic nucleus in the midbrain. VTA neurons have a unique propensity to exhibit spontaneous intrinsic rhythmic activity in the 1–5 Hz frequency range, which persists in the in-vitro brain slice, and form a network of weakly coupled oscillators. Here, we combine in-vitro simultaneous recording of action potentials from a 60 channel multi-electrode-array with cell-type-specific optogenetic stimulation of the VTA dopamine neurons. We investigated how VTA neurons respond to wide-band stochastic (Poisson input) as well as regular laser pulses. Strong synchrony was induced between the laser input and the spike timing of the neurons, both for regular pulse trains and Poisson pulse trains. For rhythmically pulsed input, the neurons demonstrated resonant behavior with the strongest phase locking at their intrinsic oscillation frequency, but also at half and double the intrinsic oscillation frequency. Stochastic Poisson pulse stimulation provided a more effective stimulation of the entire population, yet we observed resonance at lower frequencies (approximately half the oscillation frequency) than the neurons' intrinsic oscillation frequency. The non-linear filter characteristics of dopamine neurons could allow the VTA to predict precisely timed future rewards based on past sensory inputs, a crucial component of reward prediction error signaling. In addition, these filter characteristics could contribute to a pacemaker role for the VTA in synchronizing activity with other regions like the prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2020.00010">A Novel Approach for Fully Automatic Intra-Tumor Segmentation With 3D U-Net Architecture for Gliomas</a></h4>

<p>Purpose: Gliomas are the most common primary brain malignancies, with varying degrees of aggressiveness and prognosis. Understanding of tumor biology and intra-tumor heterogeneity is necessary for planning personalized therapy and predicting response to therapy. Accurate tumoral and intra-tumoral segmentation on MRI is the first step toward understanding the tumor biology through computational methods. The purpose of this study was to design a segmentation algorithm and evaluate its performance on pre-treatment brain MRIs obtained from patients with gliomas.</p><p>Materials and Methods: In this study, we have designed a novel 3D U-Net architecture that segments various radiologically identifiable sub-regions like edema, enhancing tumor, and necrosis. Weighted patch extraction scheme from the tumor border regions is proposed to address the problem of class imbalance between tumor and non-tumorous patches. The architecture consists of a contracting path to capture context and the symmetric expanding path that enables precise localization. The Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) based architecture is trained on 285 patients, validated on 66 patients and tested on 191 patients with Glioma from Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) 2018 challenge dataset. Three dimensional patches are extracted from multi-channel BraTS training dataset to train 3D U-Net architecture. The efficacy of the proposed approach is also tested on an independent dataset of 40 patients with High Grade Glioma from our tertiary cancer center. Segmentation results are assessed in terms of Dice Score, Sensitivity, Specificity, and Hausdorff 95 distance (ITCN intra-tumoral classification network).</p><p>Result: Our proposed architecture achieved Dice scores of 0.88, 0.83, and 0.75 for the whole tumor, tumor core and enhancing tumor, respectively, on BraTS validation dataset and 0.85, 0.77, 0.67 on test dataset. The results were similar on the independent patients' dataset from our hospital, achieving Dice scores of 0.92, 0.90, and 0.81 for the whole tumor, tumor core and enhancing tumor, respectively.</p><p>Conclusion: The results of this study show the potential of patch-based 3D U-Net for the accurate intra-tumor segmentation. From experiments, it is observed that the weighted patch-based segmentation approach gives comparable performance with the pixel-based approach when there is a thin boundary between tumor subparts.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00029">Intentional Switching Between Bimanual Coordination Patterns in Older Adults: Is It Mediated by Inhibition Processes?</a></h4>

<p>The study investigated the consequences of age-related decline in inhibition processes on intentional switching between bimanual coordination patterns. Fifteen young (24±2.8 years) and 20 older adults (69±5.3 years) performed Stroop tasks and bimanual coordination tasks. Stroop tasks included neutral, congruent, and incongruent conditions. Response time and error rate were measured. Bimanual coordination tasks consisted of performing in-phase (IP) and anti-phase (AP) patterns. Participants were requested to switch as quickly as possible from one pattern to the other, resulting in two different switching directions (AP to IP; IP to AP). Mean and standard deviation (SD) of the continuous relative phase (CRP) were calculated pre- and post-switching for each participant. Total switching time (TST) was measured. The switching phase was also decomposed into reaction time (RT) and reversal time (REvT). Pearson correlation analyses were performed to test for correlations between: (i) SD of CRP and response time in Stroop tasks, and (ii) switching times (TST, RT, RevT) and response time in Stroop task, respectively. In addition, parallel mediation analyses were conducted. Results showed that: (i) the AP pattern was less stable than the IP pattern in both young and older adults, (ii) coordination patterns were less stable in older adults, (iii) response times in Stroop task were longer in the incongruent condition, and (iv) RespTs were longer in older than in young participants, whatever the condition. In the bimanual coordination task, RT, RevT, and TST increased with age. The stability of the IP pattern was correlated with the response times observed in neutral and congruent conditions, while the stability of the AP pattern was correlated with response time observed in the incongruent condition. Correlation and mediation analyses showed that, in the AP to IP switching direction, RT and RevT were both significantly correlated with response times observed in the incongruent condition of Stroop task. These findings suggest that inhibition processes are involved in switching between bimanual coordination patterns, at least to trigger the early phase of switching. They also support the hypothesis that inhibition processes are more involved in maintaining the AP pattern and switching to the IP pattern. Finally, age-related changes in switching times seem to be prominently mediated by alterations of inhibition processes.</p>

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The bicaudal D cargo adaptor 2 (BICD2) gene encodes a conserved cargo adapter protein required for dynein‐mediated transport. Inherited and <i>de novo</i> variants in <i>BICD2</i> cause spinal muscular atrophy, lower extremity dominant 2 (SMALED2), and a subset have recently been reported to cause severe, often lethal disease. However, a true genotype‐phenotype correlation for <i>BICD2</i> has not been performed, and cases described to date are scattered among at least 14 publications. In this review, we identify the characteristics of disease‐causing variants in <i>BICD2</i> that distinguish them from benign variation, and perform genotype‐phenotype correlations for 99 <i>BICD2</i> variant carriers from 35 families.</p>

<p>Tau hyperphosphorylation is an early step in tau‐mediated neurodegeneration and is associated with intracellular aggregation of tau as neurofibrillary tangles, neuronal and synaptic loss, and eventual cognitive dysfunction in Alzheimer disease. Sleep loss increases the cerebrospinal fluid concentration of amyloid‐β and tau. Using mass spectrometry, we measured tau and phosphorylated tau concentrations in serial samples of cerebrospinal fluid collected from participants who were sleep‐deprived, treated with sodium oxybate, or allowed to sleep normally. We found that sleep loss affected phosphorylated tau differently depending on the modified site. These findings suggest a mechanism for sleep loss to increase risk of Alzheimer disease.

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Novel, highly effective disease‐modifying therapies have revolutionized multiple sclerosis (MS) care. However, evidence from large comparative studies on important safety outcomes, such as cancer, is still lacking.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In this nationwide register‐based cohort study, we linked data from the Swedish MS register to the Swedish Cancer Register and other national healthcare and census registers. We included 4187 first‐ever initiations of rituximab, 1620 of fingolimod, and 1670 of natalizumab, in 6136 MS patients, age‐sex‐and‐location matched to 37801 non‐MS general population subjects. Primary outcome was time to first invasive cancer.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We identified 78 invasive cancers among treated patients: rituximab 33 (incidence rate, IR, per 10,000 person years 34.4 [95% confidence interval 23.7–48.3]), fingolimod 28 (44.0 [29.2–63.5]), and natalizumab 17 (26.0 [15.1–41.6]). The general population IR was 31.0 [27.8–34.4]. Adjusting for baseline characteristics, we found no difference in risk of invasive cancer between rituximab, natalizumab, and the general population, but a possibly higher risk with fingolimod compared to the general population (1.53 [0.98–2.38]) and rituximab (hazard ratio 1.68 [1.00–2.84]).</p>
<p><b>Interpretation</b></p>
<p>In this first, large, comparative study of three highly effective MS disease‐modifying therapies, no increased risk of invasive cancer was seen with rituximab and natalizumab, compared to the general population. However, there was a borderline‐significant increased risk with fingolimod, compared to both the general population and rituximab. It was not possible to attribute this increased risk to any specific type of cancer and further studies are warranted to validate these findings.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>MRI is essential for multiple sclerosis diagnostics but is not specific to demyelination. Myelin imaging is often hampered by long scanning times, complex post‐processing or lack of clinical approval. This study aimed to assess the specificity, robustness and clinical value of Rapid Estimation of Myelin for Diagnostic Imaging, a new myelin imaging technique based on time‐efficient simultaneous T<sub>1</sub>/T<sub>2</sub>‐relaxometry and proton density mapping, in multiple sclerosis.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Rapid myelin imaging was applied using 3 Tesla MRI; <i>ex vivo</i> in three multiple sclerosis brain samples and <i>in vivo</i> in a prospective cohort of 71 multiple sclerosis patients and 21 age/sex‐matched healthy controls, with scan‐rescan repeatability in a subcohort. Disability in patients was assessed by the Expanded Disability Status Scale and the Symbol Digit Modalities Test at baseline and 2‐year follow‐up.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Rapid myelin imaging correlated with myelin‐related stains (proteolipid protein‐immunostaining and Luxol fast blue) and demonstrated good precision. Multiple sclerosis patients had, relative to controls, lower normalized whole‐brain and normal‐appearing white matter myelin fractions, which correlated with baseline cognitive and physical disability. Longitudinally, these myelin fractions correlated with follow‐up physical disability, even with correction for baseline disability.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Rapid Estimation of Myelin for Diagnostic Imaging provides robust myelin quantification that detects diffuse demyelination in normal‐appearing tissue in multiple sclerosis, which is associated with both cognitive and clinical disability. Since the technique is fast with automatic post‐processing and FDA/CE clinical approval, it can be a clinically feasible biomarker that may be suitable to monitor myelin dynamics and evaluate treatments aiming at remyelination.</p>

<p>Monosynaptically-restricted transsynaptic tracing using deletion-mutant rabies virus (RV) has become a widely used technique in neuroscience, allowing identification, imaging, and manipulation of neurons directly presynaptic to a starting neuronal population. Its most common implementation is to use Cre mouse lines in combination with Cre-dependent “helper” adeno-associated viral vectors (AAVs) to supply the required genes to the targeted population before subsequent injection of a first-generation (ΔG) rabies viral vector. Here we show that the efficiency of transsynaptic spread and the degree of nonspecific labeling in wild-type control animals depend strongly on the concentrations of these helper AAVs. Our results suggest practical guidelines for achieving good results.</p>

<p>Neuropathic pain is a challenging condition for which current therapies often remain unsatisfactory. Chronic administration of β2 adrenergic agonists, including formoterol currently used to treat asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, alleviates mechanical allodynia in the sciatic nerve cuff model of neuropathic pain. The limited clinical data currently available also suggest that formoterol would be a suitable candidate for drug repurposing. The antiallodynic action of β2 adrenergic agonists is known to require activation of the delta-opioid (DOP) receptor but better knowledge of the molecular mechanisms involved is necessary. Using a mouse line in which DOP receptors were selectively ablated in neurons expressing Nav1.8 sodium channels (DOP cKO), we showed that these DOP peripheral receptors were necessary for the antiallodynic action of the β2 adrenergic agonist formoterol in the cuff model. Using a knock-in mouse line expressing a fluorescent version of the DOP receptor fused with the enhanced green fluorescent protein (DOPeGFP), we established in a previous study, that mechanical allodynia is associated with a smaller percentage of DOPeGFP positive small peptidergic sensory neurons in dorsal root ganglia (DRG), with a reduced density of DOPeGFP positive free nerve endings in the skin and with increased DOPeGFP expression at the cell surface. Here, we showed that the density of DOPeGFP positive free nerve endings in the skin is partially restored and no increase in DOPeGFP translocation to the plasma membrane is observed in mice in which mechanical pain is alleviated upon chronic oral administration of formoterol. This study, therefore, extends our previous results by confirming that changes in the mechanical threshold are associated with changes in peripheral DOP profile. It also highlights the common impact on DOP receptors between serotonin noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors such as duloxetine and the β2 mimetic formoterol.</p>

<p>Recent task fMRI studies suggest that individual differences in trait empathy and empathic concern are mediated by patterns of connectivity between self-other resonance and top-down control networks that are stable across task demands. An untested implication of this hypothesis is that these stable patterns of connectivity should be visible even in the absence of empathy tasks. Using machine learning, we demonstrate that patterns of resting state fMRI connectivity (i.e. the degree of synchronous BOLD activity across multiple cortical areas in the absence of explicit task demands) of resonance and control networks predict trait empathic concern (n = 58). Empathic concern was also predicted by connectivity patterns within the somatomotor network. These findings further support the role of resonance-control network interactions and of somatomotor function in our vicariously driven concern for others. Furthermore, a practical implication of these results is that it is possible to assess empathic predispositions in individuals without needing to perform conventional empathy assessments.</p>

<p>The Edinburgh Handedness Inventory (EHI) and the Waterloo Footedness Questionnaire (WFQ) are two of the most widely used questionnaires to assess lateralized everyday behavior in human participants. However, it is unclear to what extent the specific behavior assessed in these questionnaires elicit lateralized neural activity when performed in real-life situations. To illuminate this unresolved issue, we assessed EEG alpha and beta asymmetries during real-life performance of the behaviors assessed in the EHI and WFQ using a mobile EEG system. This methodology provides high ecological validity for studying neural correlates of motor behavior under more naturalistic conditions. Our results indicate that behavioral performance of items of both the EHI and WFQ differentiate between left- and right-handers and left- and right-footers on the neural level, especially in the alpha frequency band. These results were unaffected by movement parameters. Furthermore, we could demonstrate that neural activity elicited specifically during left-sided task performance provides predictive power for the EHI or WFQ score of the participants. Overall, our results show that these prominent questionnaires not only distinguish between different motor preferences on the behavioral level, but also on the neurophysiological level. Furthermore, we could show that mobile EEG systems are a powerful tool to investigate motor asymmetries in ecologically valid situations outside of the laboratory setting. Future research should focus on other lateralized behavioral phenotypes in real-life settings to provide more insights into lateralized motor functions.</p>

<p>The main hypothesis of this work is that the time of delay in reaction to an unexpected event can be predicted on the basis of the brain activity recorded prior to that event. Such mental activity can be represented by electroencephalographic data. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a novel experiment involving 19 participants that took part in a 2-h long session of simulated aircraft flights. An EEG signal processing pipeline is proposed that consists of signal preprocessing, extracting bandpass features, and using regression to predict the reaction times. The prediction algorithms that are used in this study are the Least Absolute Shrinkage Operator and its Least Angle Regression modification, as well as Kernel Ridge and Radial Basis Support Vector Machine regression. The average Mean Absolute Error obtained across the 19 subjects was 114 ms. The present study demonstrates, for the first time, that it is possible to predict reaction times on the basis of EEG data. The presented solution can serve as a foundation for a system that can, in the future, increase the safety of air traffic.</p>

<p>In this work, we propose a novel cascaded V-Nets method to segment brain tumor substructures in multimodal brain magnetic resonance imaging. Although V-Net has been successfully used in many segmentation tasks, we demonstrate that its performance could be further enhanced by using a cascaded structure and ensemble strategy. Briefly, our baseline V-Net consists of four levels with encoding and decoding paths and intra- and inter-path skip connections. Focal loss is chosen to improve performance on hard samples as well as balance the positive and negative samples. We further propose three preprocessing pipelines for multimodal magnetic resonance images to train different models. By ensembling the segmentation probability maps obtained from these models, segmentation result is further improved. In other hand, we propose to segment the whole tumor first, and then divide it into tumor necrosis, edema, and enhancing tumor. Experimental results on BraTS 2018 online validation set achieve average Dice scores of 0.9048, 0.8364, and 0.7748 for whole tumor, tumor core and enhancing tumor, respectively. The corresponding values for BraTS 2018 online testing set are 0.8761, 0.7953, and 0.7364, respectively. We also evaluate the proposed method in two additional data sets from local hospitals comprising of 28 and 28 subjects, and the best results are 0.8635, 0.8036, and 0.7217, respectively. We further make a prediction of patient overall survival by ensembling multiple classifiers for long, mid and short groups, and achieve accuracy of 0.519, mean square error of 367240 and Spearman correlation coefficient of 0.168 for BraTS 2018 online testing set.</p>

<p>Pericytes are perivascular mural cells that enwrap brain capillaries and maintain blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity. Most studies suggest that pericytes regulate cerebral blood flow (CBF) and oxygen delivery to activated brain structures, known as neurovascular coupling. While we have previously shown that congenital loss of pericytes leads over time to aberrant hemodynamic responses, the effects of acute global pericyte loss on neurovascular coupling have not been studied. To address this, we used our recently reported inducible pericyte-specific Cre mouse line crossed to iDTR mice carrying Cre-dependent human diphtheria toxin (DT) receptor, which upon DT treatment leads to acute pericyte ablation. As expected, DT led to rapid progressive loss of pericyte coverage of cortical capillaries up to 50% at 3 days post-DT, which correlated with approximately 50% reductions in stimulus-induced CBF responses measured with laser doppler flowmetry (LDF) and/or intrinsic optical signal (IOS) imaging. Endothelial response to acetylcholine, microvascular density, and neuronal evoked membrane potential responses remained, however, unchanged, as well as arteriolar smooth muscle cell (SMC) coverage and functional responses to adenosine, as we previously reported. Together, these data suggest that neurovascular uncoupling in this model is driven by pericyte loss, but not other vascular deficits or neuronal dysfunction. These results further support the role of pericytes in CBF regulation and may have implications for neurological conditions associated with rapid pericyte loss such as hypoperfusion and stroke, as well as conditions where the exact time course of global regional pericyte loss is less clear, such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and other neurogenerative disorders.</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>It is not known whether patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) with ischemic stroke despite oral anticoagulant therapy are at increased risk for further recurrent strokes or how ongoing secondary prevention should be managed.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We conducted an individual patient data pooled analysis of 7 prospective cohort studies that recruited patients with AF and recent cerebral ischemia. We compared patients taking oral anticoagulants (vitamin K antagonists [VKA] or direct oral anticoagulants [DOAC]) prior to index event (OAC<sub>prior</sub>) with those without prior oral anticoagulation (OAC<sub>naive</sub>). We further compared those who changed the type (ie, from VKA or DOAC, vice versa, or DOAC to DOAC) of anticoagulation (OAC<sub>changed</sub>) with those who continued the same anticoagulation as secondary prevention (OAC<sub>unchanged</sub>). Time to recurrent acute ischemic stroke (AIS) was analyzed using multivariate competing risk Fine–Gray models to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We included 5,413 patients (median age = 78 years [interquartile range (IQR) = 71–84 years]; 5,136 [96.7%] had ischemic stroke as the index event, median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale on admission = 6 [IQR = 2–12]). The median CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>‐Vasc score (congestive heart failure, hypertension, age≥ 75 years, diabetes mellitus, stroke/transient ischemic attack, vascular disease, age 65–74 years, sex category) was 5 (IQR = 4–6) and was similar for OAC<sub>prior</sub> (n = 1,195) and OAC<sub>naive</sub> (n = 4,119, <i>p</i> = 0.103). During 6,128 patient‐years of follow‐up, 289 patients had AIS (4.7% per year, 95% CI = 4.2–5.3%). OAC<sub>prior</sub> was associated with an increased risk of AIS (HR = 1.6, 95% CI = 1.2–2.3, <i>p</i> = 0.005). OAC<sub>changed</sub> (n = 307) was not associated with decreased risk of AIS (HR = 1.2, 95% CI = 0.7–2.1, <i>p</i> = 0.415) compared with OAC<sub>unchanged</sub> (n = 585).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Patients with AF who have an ischemic stroke despite previous oral anticoagulation are at a higher risk for recurrent ischemic stroke despite a CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>‐Vasc score similar to those without prior oral anticoagulation. Better prevention strategies are needed for this high‐risk patient group. ANN NEUROL 2020</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Antibodies against neuronal N‐methyl‐D‐aspartate receptors (NMDARs) in patients with anti‐NMDAR encephalitis alter neuronal synaptic function and plasticity, but the effects on other cells of the nervous system are unknown.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with anti‐NMDAR encephalitis (preabsorbed or not with GluN1) and a human NMDAR‐specific monoclonal antibody (SSM5) derived from plasma cells of a patient, along the corresponding controls, were used in the studies. To evaluate the activity of oligodendrocyte NMDARs and α‐amino‐3‐hydroxy‐5‐methyl‐4‐isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors in vitro after exposure to patients' CSF antibodies or SSM5, we used a functional assay based on cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging. Expression of the glucose transporter (GLUT1) in oligodendrocytes was assessed by immunocytochemistry.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>NMDAR agonist responses were robustly reduced after preincubation of oligodendrocytes with patients' CSF or SSM5 but remained largely unaltered with the corresponding controls. These effects were NMDAR specific, as patients' CSF did not alter responses to AMPA receptor agonists and was abrogated by preabsorption of CSF with HEK cells expressing GluN1 subunit. Patients' CSF also reduced oligodendrocyte expression of glucose transporter GLUT1 induced by NMDAR activity.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Antibodies from patients with anti‐NMDAR encephalitis specifically alter the function of NMDARs in oligodendrocytes, causing a decrease of expression of GLUT1. Considering that normal GLUT1 expression in oligodendrocytes and myelin is needed to metabolically support axonal function, the findings suggest a link between antibody‐mediated dysfunction of NMDARs in oligodendrocytes and the white matter alterations reported in patients with this disorder.

<p>Purkinje cell microcircuits perform diverse functions using widespread inputs from the brain and spinal cord. The formation of these functional circuits depends on developmental programs and molecular pathways that organize mossy fiber afferents from different sources into a complex and precisely patterned map within the granular layer of the cerebellum. During development, Purkinje cell zonal patterns are thought to guide mossy fiber terminals into zones. However, the molecular mechanisms that mediate this process remain unclear. Here, we used knockout mice to test whether Eph/ephrin signaling controls Purkinje cell-mossy fiber interactions during cerebellar circuit formation. Loss of ephrin-A2 and ephrin-A5 disrupted the patterning of spinocerebellar terminals into discrete zones. Zone territories in the granular layer that normally have limited spinocerebellar input contained ectopic terminals in ephrin-A2<sup>−/−</sup>;ephrin-A5<sup>−/−</sup> double knockout mice. However, the overall morphology of the cerebellum, lobule position, and Purkinje cell zonal patterns developed normally in the ephrin-A2<sup>−/−</sup>;ephrin-A5<sup>−/−</sup> mutant mice. This work suggests that communication between Purkinje cell zones and mossy fibers during postnatal development allows contact-dependent molecular cues to sharpen the innervation of sensory afferents into functional zones.</p>

<p>Polymorphisms in the human circadian clock gene PERIOD3 (PER3) are associated with a wide variety of phenotypes such as diurnal preference, delayed sleep phase disorder, sleep homeostasis, cognitive performance, bipolar disorder, type 2 diabetes, cardiac regulation, cancer, light sensitivity, hormone and cytokine secretion, and addiction. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these phenotypic associations remain unknown. Per3 knockout mice (Per3<sup>–/–</sup>) have phenotypes related to activity, sleep homeostasis, anhedonia, metabolism, and behavioral responses to light. Using a protocol that induces behavioral differences in response to light in wild type and Per3<sup>–/–</sup> mice, we compared genome-wide expression in the eye and hypothalamus in the two genotypes. Differentially expressed transcripts were related to inflammation, taste, olfactory and melatonin receptors, lipid metabolism, cell cycle, ubiquitination, and hormones, as well as receptors and channels related to sleep regulation. Differentially expressed transcripts in both tissues co-localized with Per3 on an ∼8Mbp region of distal chromosome 4. The most down-regulated transcript is Prdm16, which is involved in adipocyte differentiation and may mediate altered body mass accumulation in Per3<sup>–/–</sup> mice. eQTL analysis with BXD mouse strains showed that the expression of some of these transcripts and also others co-localized at distal chromosome 4, is correlated with brain tissue expression levels of Per3 with a highly significant linkage to genetic variation in that region. These data identify a cluster of transcripts on mouse distal chromosome 4 that are co-regulated with Per3 and whose expression levels correlate with those of Per3. This locus lies within a topologically associating domain island that contains many genes with functional links to several of the diverse non-circadian phenotypes associated with polymorphisms in human PER3.</p>

<p>γ-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) transporter (GAT)-1, the major GABA transporter in the brain, plays a key role in modulating GABA signaling and is involved in the pathophysiology of several neuropsychiatric diseases, including epilepsy. The original description of GAT-1 as a neuronal transporter has guided the interpretation of the findings of all physiological, pharmacological, genetic, or clinical studies. However, evidence published in the past few years, some of which is briefly reviewed herein, does not seem to be consistent with a neurocentric view of GAT-1 function and calls for more detailed analysis of its localization. We therefore performed a thorough systematic assessment of GAT-1 localization in neocortex and subcortical white matter. In line with earlier work, we found that GAT-1 was robustly expressed in axon terminals forming symmetric synapses and in astrocytic processes, whereas its astrocytic expression was more diffuse than expected and, even more surprisingly, immature and mature oligodendrocytes and microglial cells also expressed the transporter. These data indicate that the era of “neuronal” and “glial” GABA transporters has finally come to a close and provide a wider perspective from which to view GABA-mediated physiological phenomena. In addition, given the well-known involvement of astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and microglial cells in physiological as well as pathological conditions, the demonstration of functional GAT-1 in these cells is expected to provide greater insight into the phenomena occurring in the diseased brain as well as to prompt a reassessment of earlier findings.</p>

<p>The search for new disease-modifying drugs for Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a slow and highly expensive process, and the repurposing of drugs already approved for different medical indications is becoming a compelling alternative option for researchers. Genetic variables represent a predisposing factor to the disease and mutations in leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) locus have been correlated to late-onset autosomal-dominant PD. The common fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster carrying the mutation LRRK2 loss-of-function in the WD40 domain (LRRK2<sup>WD40</sup>), is a simple in vivo model of PD and is a valid tool to first evaluate novel therapeutic approaches to the disease. Recent studies have suggested a neuroprotective activity of immunomodulatory agents in PD models. Here the immunomodulatory drug Pomalidomide (POM), a Thalidomide derivative, was examined in the Drosophila LRRK2<sup>WD40</sup> genetic model of PD. Mutant and wild type flies received increasing POM doses (1, 0.5, 0.25 mM) through their diet from day 1 post eclosion, until postnatal day (PN) 7 or 14, when POM’s actions were evaluated by quantifying changes in climbing behavior as a measure of motor performance, the number of brain dopaminergic neurons and T-bars, mitochondria integrity. LRRK2<sup>WD40</sup> flies displayed a spontaneous age-related impairment of climbing activity, and POM significantly and dose-dependently improved climbing performance both at PN 7 and PN 14. LRRK2<sup>WD40</sup> fly motor disability was underpinned by a progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in posterior clusters of the protocerebrum, which are involved in the control of locomotion, by a low number of T-bars density in the presynaptic bouton active zones. POM treatment fully rescued the cell loss in all posterior clusters at PN 7 and PN 14 and significantly increased the T-bars density. Moreover, several damaged mitochondria with dilated cristae were observed in LRRK2<sup>WD40</sup> flies treated with vehicle but not following POM. This study demonstrates the neuroprotective activity of the immunomodulatory agent POM in a genetic model of PD. POM is an FDA-approved clinically available and well-tolerated drug used for the treatment of multiple myeloma. If further validated in mammalian models of PD, POM could rapidly be clinically tested in humans.</p>

<p>The global incidence of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is on the rise with the increase in obesity and metabolic disease epidemic. Obesity is co-morbid with the increase in mass of adipose tissue, which secretes numerous molecules that are biologically important. Obesity and its associated conditions are perhaps involved in the causative pathway of AD. Immunologically important cytokines such as IL-1β, IL-10, and IL-18, which are released by adipose tissue, are also found to be associated with AD. Besides, the expression of IL-6, IFNγ, and TNF alpha are also associated with AD. Ang-I and Ang-II are found to mediate the progression of AD. Complement factors B, C4b, and H are differentially expressed in AD. Overall, several adipocyte-derived cytokines are found to be dysregulated in AD, and their role in AD remains to be studied. The induction of autophagy is a very promising strategy in the treatment of AD. A variety of adipose-derived molecules have been shown to modulate autophagy. However, very little literature is available on the role of adipose-derived molecules in inducing autophagy in microglial cells of AD. Understanding the role of adipose-derived molecules in the development of AD, especially in the induction of autophagy, would open up new avenues in devising strategies for the treatment of AD.</p>

Synaptic transmission and plasticity are shaped by the dynamic reorganization of signaling molecules within pre- and postsynaptic compartments. The nanoscale organization of key effector molecules has been revealed by single-particle trajectory (SPT) methods. Interestingly, this nanoscale organization is highly heterogeneous. For example, presynaptic voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) and postsynaptic ligand-gated ion channels such as AMPA receptors (AMPARs) are organized into so-called nanodomains where individual molecules are only transiently trapped.

<p>Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that leads to impaired memory and cognitive deficits. Spine loss as well as changes in spine morphology correlates with cognitive impairment in this neurological disorder. Many studies in animal models and ex vivo cultures indicate that amyloid β-peptide (Aβ) oligomers induce synaptic damage early during the progression of the disease. Here, in order to determine the events that initiate synaptic alterations, we acutely applied oligomeric Aβ to primary hippocampal neurons and an ex vivo model of organotypic hippocampal cultures from a mouse after targeted expression of EGFP to allow high-resolution imaging and algorithm-based evaluation of spine changes. Dendritic spines were classified as thin, stubby or mushroom, based on morphology. In vivo, time-lapse imaging showed that the three spine types were relatively stable, although their stability significantly decreased after treatment with Aβ oligomers. Unexpectedly, we observed that the density of total dendritic spines increased in organotypic hippocampal slices treated with Aβ compared to control cultures. Specifically, the fraction of stubby spines significantly increased, while mushroom and thin spines remained unaltered. Pharmacological tools revealed that acute Aβ oligomers induced spine changes through mechanisms involving CaMKII and integrin β1 activities. Additionally, analysis of dendritic complexity based on a 3D reconstruction of the whole neuron morphology showed an increase in the apical dendrite length and branching points in CA1 organotypic hippocampal slices treated with Aβ. In contrast to spines, the morphological changes were affected by integrin β1 but not by CaMKII inhibition. Altogether, these data indicate that the Aβ oligomers exhibit early dual effects by acutely enhancing dendritic complexity and spine density.</p>

<p>Emerging studies have demonstrated that interleukin (IL)-33 and its receptor ST2 act as key factors in inflammatory diseases. Moreover, accumulating evidence has suggested that cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and IL-1β, trigger an inflammatory cascade. SIRT1 has been shown to suppress the expression of inflammatory cytokines. However, the effects of SIRT1 on IL-33/ST2 signaling and initiation of the inflammatory cascade via modulation of TNF-α and IL-1β by IL-33 remain unclear. In the present study, we found that the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) IL-33 and ST2 were upregulated in a rat model of spared nerve injury (SNI) and intrathecal injection of either IL-33 or ST2 antibodies alleviated mechanical allodynia and downregulated TNF-α and IL-1β induced by SNI. In addition, activation of SIRT1 decreased enhanced DRG IL-33/ST2 signaling in SNI rats. Artificial inactivation of SIRT1 via intrathecal injection of an SIRT1 antagonist could induce mechanical allodynia and upregulate IL-33 and ST2. These results demonstrated that reduction in SIRT1 could induce upregulation of DRG IL-33 and ST2 and contribute to mechanical allodynia induced by SNI in rats.</p>

<p>Social attention deficits are a hallmark characteristic within autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and have been hypothesized to have cascading effects on emotion recognition. Eye-tracking methodology has emerged as a potentially reliable, feasible, and sensitive biomarker for examining core phenotypic features of ASD; however, these findings are mixed with regards to measuring treatment change in clinical trials. The present study aimed to assess the utility of an eye-tracking paradigm to discriminate between clinical groups in social attention and emotion recognition through face scanning and pupillometry. The present study also assessed the reliability of this paradigm within the ASD sample to further our understanding of the utility of eye-tracking for future clinical trials. Participants included 42 individuals with ASD, 29 developmental disability (DD) controls, and 62 typically developing (TD) controls between 3 and 25 years of age. An emotional faces eye-tracking paradigm was administered to all participants, with the ASD group completing the paradigm a second time approximately 2 months later. Participants’ average proportion of looking and number of fixations to specific areas of interest (AOI) were examined along with changes in pupil reactivity while viewing different emotional faces. Results suggest atypical face-scanning through a reduced proportion of looking and the number of fixations toward the eyes in the ASD group regardless of the emotion that was presented. Further, pupillometry measures were able to detect increases in pupil dilation to happy faces in the ASD group. Lastly, test-retest reliability coefficients varied between the poor and excellent range based on the mechanism assessed, with the proportion of looking demonstrating the highest reliability coefficients. These findings build on the promise of eye-tracking as a feasible and reliable biomarker for identifying social attention and emotion recognition deficits in ASD. Detecting differences in emotion recognition explicitly through facial scanning was not as clear. Specific mechanisms within the eye-tracking paradigm may be viable options for assessing treatment-specific outcomes.</p>

<p>Abnormal structural connectivity of cerebral small-vessel disease (CSVD) is associated with cognitive impairment. But the different characteristics of structural connectivity have not been elucidated in early CSVD patients. The current study aimed to investigate the potential differences of structural connectivity in CSVD patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and CSVD patients with normal cognition. Twenty-two CSVD patients with MCI, 34 CSVD patients with normal cognition, and 35 controls, who were age, sex, and education matched underwent diffusion tensor imaging and high resolution T1-weighted imaging. Clinical characteristics, lacunar infarct volume, white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volume, and global atrophy were quantitatively evaluated. Maps of fiber connectivity density (FiCD) were constructed and compared across groups in vertex levels. Pearson correlation was used to estimate the imaging–clinical relationships with control of general characteristics. CSVD patients with MCI had higher lesion load of WMH and lacunar infarcts, and correspondingly lower global FiCD value than CSVD patients with normal cognition (P &lt; 0.01). Lacunar infarct (r = −0.318, P &lt; 0.01) and WMH (r = −0.400, P &lt; 0.01), but not global atrophy, age, or sex, were significantly correlated with the global FiCD value. CSVD patients with normal cognition showed decreased FiCD value mainly in the prefrontal areas (P &lt; 0.01 with Monte Carlo correction). Compared with CSVD patients with normal cognition, CSVD patients with MCI showed significantly decreased FiCD value in enlarged frontal and parietal areas (P &lt; 0.01 with Monte Carlo correction). Inter-group comparisons showed regional enhanced impairment of connectivity density in CSVD patients with MCI in the left superior frontal gyrus, the left precuneus, and the orbital part of the right inferior frontal gyrus (P &lt; 0.01 with Monte Carlo correction). Regional FiCD value of frontal and parietal areas was associated with the cognitive function (P &lt; 0.01). In conclusion, cognitively normal CSVD patients already have disruptions of structural connectivity. The extent and intensity of connectivity disruptions in frontal and parietal areas may underlie the mechanism of cognitive impairment in CSVD. Fiber connectivity density measurements may be helpful for quantitative description of structural cortical connectivity.</p>

<p>Recent works have shown that the resting-state brain functional connectivity hypernetwork, where multiple nodes can be connected, are an effective technique for brain disease diagnosis and classification research. The lasso method was used to construct hypernetworks by solving sparse linear regression models in previous research. But, constructing a hypernetwork based on the lasso method simply selects a single variable, in that it lacks the ability to interpret the grouping effect. Considering the group structure problem, the previous study proposed to create a hypernetwork based on the elastic net and the group lasso methods, and the results showed that the former method had the best classification performance. However, the highly correlated variables selected by the elastic net method were not necessarily in the active set in the group. Therefore, we extended our research to address this issue. Herein, we propose a new method that introduces the sparse group lasso method to improve the construction of the hypernetwork by solving the group structure problem of the brain regions. We used the traditional lasso, group lasso method, and sparse group lasso method to construct a hypernetwork in patients with depression and normal subjects. Meanwhile, other clustering coefficients (clustering coefficients based on pairs of nodes) were also introduced to extract features with traditional clustering coefficients. Two types of features with significant differences obtained after feature selection were subjected to multi-kernel learning for feature fusion and classification using each method, respectively. The network topology results revealed differences among the three networks, where hypernetwork using the lasso method was the strictest; the group lasso, most lenient; and the sgLasso method, moderate. The network topology of the sparse group lasso method was similar to that of the group lasso method but different from the lasso method. The classification results show that the sparse group lasso method achieves the best classification accuracy by using multi-kernel learning, which indicates that better classification performance can be achieved when the group structure exists and is properly extended.</p>

<p>Sleep and wakefulness are promoted not by a single neural pathway but via wake or sleep-promoting nodes distributed across layers of the brain. We equate each layer with a brain region in proposing a layered subsumption model for arousal based on a computational architecture. Beyond the brainstem the layers include the diencephalon (hypothalamus, thalamus), basal ganglia, and cortex. In light of existing empirical evidence, we propose that each layer have sleep and wake computations driven by similar high-level architecture and processing units. Specifically, an interconnected wake-promoting system is suggested as driving arousal in each brain layer with the processing converging to produce the features of wakefulness. In contrast, sleep-promoting GABAergic neurons largely project to and inhibit wake-promoting neurons. We propose a general pattern of caudal wake-promoting and sleep-promoting neurons having a strong effect on overall behavior. However, while rostral brain layers have less influence on sleep and wake, through descending projections, they can subsume the activity of caudal brain layers to promote arousal. The two models presented in this work will suggest computations for the layering and hierarchy. Through dynamic system theory several hypotheses are introduced for the interaction of controllers and systems that correspond to the different populations of neurons at each layer. The models will be drawn-upon to discuss future experiments to elucidate the structure of the hierarchy that exists among the sleep-arousal architecture.</p>

<p>In contrast to lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced preconditioning, which has repeatedly been examined in the past, the effects of post-ischemic LPS-induced sepsis, although clinically considerably more important, have not systemically been studied. We exposed mice to transient intraluminal middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and examined the effects of intraperitoneal LPS (0.1 or 1 mg/kg) which was administered 24 h post-ischemia. Post-ischemic glial reactivity, neuronal survival and neurological outcome were differently modulated by the higher and the lower LPS dose. Although both doses promoted neuronal survival after 72 h, the underlying mechanisms were not similar. Mice receiving 1 mg/kg LPS exhibited transient hypothermia at 1 and 3 hours post sepsis (hps), followed by reduced focal neurological deficits at 24, 48 and 72 hps. The lower dose (0.1 mg/kg) did not induce hypothermia, but reduced microglia/macrophage activation with the appearance of an anti-inflammatory CD206 positive cell phenotype in the brain parenchyma. Together, our results indicate a novel, dose-dependent modulation of microglial cells that is intricately involved in brain protection.</p>

It is now widely recognized that children exposed to adverse life events in the first years of life are at increased risk for a variety of neural, behavioral, and psychological sequelae. As we discuss in this paper, adverse events represent a violation of the expectable environment. If such violations occur during a critical period of brain development, the detrimental effects of early adversity are likely to be long lasting. Here we discuss the various ways adversity becomes neurobiologically embedded, and how the timing of such adversity plays an important role in determining outcomes.

<p>Consciousness while under general anesthesia is a dreadful condition. Various electroencephalogram (EEG)-based technologies have been developed, on the basis of empirical evidence, in order to identify this condition. However, certain electrophysiological phenomena, which seem strongly related with depth of anesthesia in some drugs, appear less consistent with those of other anesthetic drugs. There is a gap between the complexity of the phenomenon of consciousness and its behavioral manifestations, on the one hand, and the empirical nature of the reported electrophysiological markers, which are associated with it, on the other hand. In fact, such a gap might prevent us from progressing toward unified electrophysiological markers of consciousness while under anesthesia, which are applicable to all anesthetic drugs. We believe that there is a need to bridge this conceptual gap. Therefore, in this work, we will try to present a theoretical framework for such bridging. First, we suggest focusing on neuropsychological processes, which seem to have a clear role in the behavioral manifestations of consciousness while under anesthesia but seem, nevertheless, better defined than consciousness itself—such as perception and attention. Then, we suggest analyzing the effects of anesthesia upon these neuropsychological processes, as they are manifested in the EEG signal. Specifically, we will focus on the effects of anesthesia on event-related potentials (ERPs), which seem more easily associable with neuropsychological modeling.</p>

<p>Synaptic transmission between neurons is the basic mechanism for information processing in cortical microcircuits. To date, paired recording from synaptically coupled neurons is the most widely used method which allows a detailed functional characterization of unitary synaptic transmission at the cellular and synaptic level in combination with a structural characterization of both pre- and postsynaptic neurons at the light and electron microscopic level. In this review, we will summarize the many applications of paired recordings to investigate synaptic function and structure. Paired recordings have been used to study the detailed electrophysiological and anatomical properties of synaptically coupled cell pairs within a synaptic microcircuit; this is critical in order to understand the connectivity rules and dynamic properties of synaptic transmission. Paired recordings can also be adopted for quantal analysis of an identified synaptic connection and to study the regulation of synaptic transmission by neuromodulators such as acetylcholine, the monoamines, neuropeptides, and adenosine etc. Taken together, paired recordings from synaptically coupled neurons will remain a very useful approach for a detailed characterization of synaptic transmission not only in the rodent brain but also that of other species including humans.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.00012">Expanding Clinical Presentations Due to Variations in THOC2 mRNA Nuclear Export Factor</a></h4>

<p>Multiple TREX mRNA export complex subunits (e.g., THOC1, THOC2, THOC5, THOC6, THOC7) have now been implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), neurodegeneration and cancer. We previously implicated missense and splicing-defective THOC2 variants in NDDs and a broad range of other clinical features. Here we report 10 individuals from nine families with rare missense THOC2 variants including the first case of a recurrent variant (p.Arg77Cys), and an additional individual with an intragenic THOC2 microdeletion (Del-Ex37-38). Ex vivo missense variant testing and patient-derived cell line data from current and published studies show 9 of the 14 missense THOC2 variants result in reduced protein stability. The splicing-defective and deletion variants result in a loss of small regions of the C-terminal THOC2 RNA binding domain (RBD). Interestingly, reduced stability of THOC2 variant proteins has a flow-on effect on the stability of the multi-protein TREX complex; specifically on the other NDD-associated THOC subunits. Our current, expanded cohort refines the core phenotype of THOC2 NDDs to language disorder and/or ID, with a variable severity, and disorders of growth. A subset of affected individuals’ has severe-profound ID, persistent hypotonia and respiratory abnormalities. Further investigations to elucidate the pathophysiological basis for this severe phenotype are warranted.</p>

<p>Laminin-α2-related congenital muscular dystrophy (LAMA2-CMD) is a devastating neuromuscular disease caused by mutations in the LAMA2 gene. These mutations result in the complete absence or truncated expression of the laminin-α2 chain. The α2-chain is a major component of the laminin-211 and laminin-221 isoforms, the predominant laminin isoforms in healthy adult skeletal muscle. Mutations in this chain result in progressive skeletal muscle degeneration as early as neonatally. Laminin-211/221 is a ligand for muscle cell receptors integrin-α7β1 and α-dystroglycan. LAMA2 mutations are correlated with integrin-α7β1 disruption in skeletal muscle. In this review, we will summarize laminin-211/221 interactions with integrin-α7β1 in LAMA2-CMD muscle. Additionally, we will summarize recent developments using upregulation of laminin-111 in the sarcolemma of laminin-α2-deficient muscle. We will discuss potential mechanisms of action by which laminin-111 is able to prevent myopathy. These published studies demonstrate that laminin-111 is a disease modifier of LAMA2-CMD through different methods of delivery. Together, these studies show the potential for laminin-111 therapy as a novel paradigm for the treatment of LAMA2-CMD.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2020.00004">Multisensory Audiovisual Processing in Children With a Sensory Processing Disorder (I): Behavioral and Electrophysiological Indices Under Speeded Response Conditions</a></h4>

Background<p>Maladaptive reactivity to sensory inputs is commonly observed in neurodevelopmental disorders (e.g., autism, ADHD). Little is known, however, about the underlying neural mechanisms. For some children, atypical sensory reactivity is the primary complaint, despite absence of another identifiable neurodevelopmental diagnosis. Studying Sensory Processing Disorder (SPD) may well provide a window into the neuropathology of these symptoms. It has been proposed that a deficit in sensory integration underlies the SPD phenotype, but objective quantification of sensory integration is lacking. Here we used neural and behavioral measures of multisensory integration (MSI), which would be affected by impaired sensory integration and for which there are well accepted objective measures, to test whether failure to integrate across the senses is associated with atypical sensory reactivity in SPD. An autism group served to determine if observed differences were unique to SPD.</p>Methods<p>We tested whether children aged 6–16 years with SPD (N = 14) integrate multisensory inputs differently from age-matched typically developing controls (TD: N = 54), or from children with an autism spectrum disorder (ASD: N = 44). Participants performed a simple reaction-time task to the occurrence of auditory, visual, and audiovisual stimuli presented in random order, while high-density recordings of electrical brain activity were made.</p>Results<p>Children with SPD showed large reductions in the extent to which they benefited from multisensory inputs compared to TDs. The ASD group showed similarly reduced response speeding to multisensory relative to unisensory inputs. Neural evidence for MSI was seen across all three groups, with the multisensory response differing from the sum of the unisensory responses. Post hoc tests suggested the possibility of enhanced MSI in SPD in timeframes consistent with cortical sensory registration (∼60 ms), followed by reduced MSI during a timeframe consistent with object formation (∼130 ms). The ASD group also showed reduced MSI in the later timeframe.</p>Conclusion<p>Children with SPD showed reduction in their ability to benefit from redundant audio-visual inputs, similar to children with ASD. Neurophysiological recordings, on the other hand, showed that major indices of MSI were largely intact, although post hoc testing pointed to periods of potential differential processing. While these exploratory electrophysiological observations point to potential sensory-perceptual differences in multisensory processing in SPD, it remains equally plausible at this stage that later attentional processing differences may yet prove responsible for the multisensory behavioral deficits uncovered here.</p>

<p>Objectives: To explore structural variations of the circle of Willis using three-dimensional time-of-flight magnetic resonance angiography (3D-TOF-MRA), and to compare this modality with digital subtraction angiography (DSA).</p><p>Methods: A total of 819 consecutive patients suspected of having cerebral vascular diseases underwent 3D-TOF-MRA, followed by DSA within 2 weeks.

The sensitivity and NPV of 3D-TOF-MRA images for A-, C-, D-, and H-types of circle of Willis anomalies were 100%. The specificity, accuracy and sensitivity were all 100% for detecting absence of the anterior communicating artery (ACOA). Sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV were all 100% for detecting F-type. The sensitivity and PPV of volume rendered (VR) images for the B-, E-, and G-types were relatively low (85.0, 86.2, and 73.8%, respectively). Maximum intensity projection (MIP) was somewhat better (88.3, 89.2, and 81.8%, respectively). Combined analyses were better still (95.8, 96.1, and 99.0%, respectively). Specificity and NPVs were high (99.3–100%).</p><p>Conclusions: 3D-TOF-MRA compares well to DSA for evaluation of the structure of the circle of Willis. As 3D-TOF-MRA is a non-invasive modality, it may be preferred as a means to evaluate structural variations of the circle of Willis.</p>

<p>Tauopathies are neurodegenerative diseases characterized by the presence of aggregates of abnormally phosphorylated Tau. Deciphering the pathophysiological mechanisms that lead from the alteration of Tau biology to neuronal death depends on the identification of Tau cellular partners. Combining genetic and transcriptomic analyses in Drosophila, we identified 77 new modulators of human Tau-induced toxicity, bringing to 301 the number of Tau genetic interactors identified so far in flies. Network analysis showed that 229 of these genetic modulators constitute a connected network. The addition of 77 new genes strengthened the network structure, increased the intergenic connectivity and brought up key hubs with high connectivities, namely Src64B/FYN, Src42A/FRK, kuz/ADAM10, heph/PTBP1, scrib/SCRIB, and Cam/CALM3. Interestingly, we established for the first time a genetic link between Tau-induced toxicity and ADAM10, a recognized Alzheimer Disease protective factor. In addition, our data support the importance of the presynaptic compartment in mediating Tau toxicity.</p>

<p>This paper examines the problem of diffeomorphic image registration in the presence of differing image intensity profiles and sparsely sampled, missing, or damaged tissue. Our motivation comes from the problem of aligning 3D brain MRI with 100-micron isotropic resolution to histology sections at 1 × 1 × 1,000-micron resolution with multiple varying stains. We pose registration as a penalized Bayesian estimation, exploiting statistical models of image formation where the target images are modeled as sparse and noisy observations of the atlas. In this injective setting, there is no assumption of symmetry between atlas and target. Cross-modality image matching is achieved by jointly estimating polynomial transformations of the atlas intensity. Missing data is accommodated via a multiple atlas selection procedure where several atlas images may be of homogeneous intensity and correspond to “background” or “artifact.” The two concepts are combined within an Expectation-Maximization algorithm, where atlas selection posteriors and deformation parameters are updated iteratively and polynomial coefficients are computed in closed form. We validate our method with simulated images, examples from neuropathology, and a standard benchmarking dataset. Finally, we apply it to reconstructing digital pathology and MRI in standard atlas coordinates. By using a standard convolutional neural network to detect tau tangles in histology slices, this registration method enabled us to quantify the 3D density distribution of tauopathy throughout the medial temporal lobe of an Alzheimer's disease postmortem specimen.</p>

<p>Large-scale research integration is contingent on seamless access to data in standardized formats. Standards enable researchers to understand external experiment structures, pool results, and apply homogeneous preprocessing and analysis workflows. Particularly, they facilitate these features without the need for numerous potentially confounding compatibility add-ons. In small animal magnetic resonance imaging, an overwhelming proportion of data is acquired via the ParaVision software of the Bruker Corporation. The original data structure is predominantly transparent, but fundamentally incompatible with modern pipelines. Additionally, it sources metadata from free-field operator input, which diverges strongly between laboratories and researchers. In this article we present an open-source workflow which automatically converts and reposits data from the ParaVision structure into the widely supported and openly documented Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS). Complementing this workflow we also present operator guidelines for appropriate ParaVision data input, and a programmatic walk-through detailing how preexisting scans with uninterpretable metadata records can easily be made compliant after the acquisition.</p>

<p>IRSp53 (also known as BAIAP2) is an abundant excitatory postsynaptic scaffolding protein implicated in autism spectrum disorders (ASD), schizophrenia, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). IRSp53 is expressed in different cell types across different brain regions, although it remains unclear how IRSp53 deletion in different cell types affects brain functions and behaviors in mice. Here, we deleted IRSp53 in excitatory and inhibitory neurons in mice and compared resulting phenotypes in males and females. IRSp53 deletion in excitatory neurons driven by Emx1 leads to strong social deficits and hyperactivity without affecting anxiety-like behavior, whereas IRSp53 deletion in inhibitory neurons driven by Viaat has minimal impacts on these behaviors in male mice. In female mice, excitatory neuronal IRSp53 deletion induces hyperactivity but moderate social deficits. Excitatory neuronal IRSp53 deletion in male mice induces an increased ratio of evoked excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission (E/I ratio) in layer V pyramidal neurons in the prelimbic region of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), whereas the same mutation does not alter the E/I ratio in female neurons. These results suggest that IRSp53 deletion in excitatory and inhibitory neurons and in male and female mice has distinct impacts on behaviors and synaptic transmission.</p>

In some brain areas, this teleost has radial glia that appears to perform astrocyte-like functions, but these cells have not been described in the zebrafish olfactory bulb. Mammalian astrocytes facilitate neuroplasticity and undergo astrogliosis after insult. The role of these cells in the zebrafish olfactory system after the damage has been poorly explored. This is important to examine because zebrafish have a high degree of neuroplasticity and the olfactory bulb is a brain area renowned for plasticity. The goal of this study was to explore the potential role of zebrafish astrocytes in the olfactory bulb damage response, with a goal to exploit the high level of regeneration in this system. We found that anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) labels numerous processes in the zebrafish olfactory bulb that are concentrated in the nerve and glomerular layers (GL) and do not show radial glial-like morphology. We propose to term this astroglia, since their location and response to damage suggests that they are similar in function to the mammalian astrocyte. To induce repetitive peripheral damage to the olfactory organ, a wax plug was inserted into the nasal cavity of adult zebrafish every 12 h for up to 7 days; this crushes the olfactory organ and leads to degradation of olfactory sensory neuron axons that project to the olfactory bulb. After 1 day, we found a significant increase in astroglial labeling in the affected bulb when compared to the internal control bulb and astroglial branches appeared to increase in number and size. By the third day of plug insertions there was no significant difference in astroglial labeling between the affected bulb and the internal control bulb. These data lead us to believe that astrogliosis does occur in the presence of peripheral damage, but this process attenuates within 1 week and no glial scar is evident upon recovery from the damage. Further exploration of astrocytes in zebrafish, in particular this apparent attenuation of astrogliosis, has the potential to elucidate key differences in glial function between teleosts and mammals.</p>

<p>The cat brain is a useful model for neuroscientific research and with the increasing use of advanced neuroimaging techniques there is a need for an open-source stereotaxic white matter brain atlas to accompany the cortical gray matter atlas, currently available. A stereotaxic white matter atlas would facilitate anatomic registration and segmentation of the white matter to aid in lesion localization or standardized regional analysis of specific regions of the white matter. In this article, we document the creation of a stereotaxic feline white matter atlas from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data obtained from a population of eight mesaticephalic felines. Deterministic tractography reconstructions were performed to create tract priors for the major white matter projections of Corpus callosum (CC), fornix, cingulum, uncinate, Corona Radiata (CR), Corticospinal tract (CST), inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF), Superior Longitudinal Fasciculus (SLF), and the cerebellar tracts. T1-weighted, fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), radial diffusivity (RD) and axial diffusivity (AD) population maps were generated. The volume, mean tract length and mean FA, MD, AD and RD values for each tract prior were documented. A structural connectome was then created using previously published cortical priors and the connectivity metrics for all cortical regions documented. The provided white matter atlas, diffusivity maps, tract priors and connectome will be a valuable resource for anatomical, pathological and translational neuroimaging research in the feline model. Multi-atlas population maps and segmentation priors are available at Cornell’s digital repository: https://ecommons.cornell.edu/handle/1813/58775.2.</p>

<p>Age-related hearing loss, one of the most frequently diagnosed disabilities in industrialized countries, may result from declining levels of GABA in the aging inferior colliculus (IC). However, the mechanisms of aging and subsequent disruptions of temporal processing in elderly hearing abilities are still being investigated. Perineuronal nets (PNs) are a specialized form of the extracellular matrix and have been linked to GABAergic neurotransmission and to the regulation of structural and synaptic plasticity. We sought to determine whether the density of PNs in the IC changes with age. We combined Wisteria floribunda agglutinin (WFA) staining with immunohistochemistry to glutamic acid decarboxylase in three age groups of Fischer Brown Norway (FBN) rats. The density of PNs on GABAergic and non-GABAergic cells in the three major subdivisions of the IC was quantified. Results first demonstrate that the density of PNs in the FBN IC increase with age. The greatest increases of PN density from young to old age occurred in the central IC (67% increase) and dorsal IC (117% increase). Second, in the young IC, PNs surround non-GABAergic and GABAergic cells with the majority of PNs surrounding the former. The increase of PNs with age in the IC occurred on both non-GABAergic and GABAergic populations. The average density of PN-surrounded non-GABAergic cells increased from 84.9 PNs/mm<sup>2</sup> in the young to 134.2 PNs/mm<sup>2</sup> in the old. While the density of PN-surrounded GABAergic cells increased from 26 PNs/mm<sup>2</sup> in the young to 40.6 PNs/mm<sup>2</sup> in the old. The causality is unclear, but increases in PN density in old age may play a role in altered auditory processing in the elderly, or may lead to further changes in IC plasticity.</p>

Dysfunctional dopamine (DA) signaling has been associated with a broad spectrum of neuropsychiatric disorders, prompting investigations into how midbrain DA neuron heterogeneity may underpin this variety of behavioral symptoms. Emerging literature indeed points to functional heterogeneity even within anatomically defined DA clusters. Recognizing the need for a systematic classification scheme, several groups have used single-cell profiling to catalog DA neurons based on their gene expression profiles.

<p>Summary of interactions between Toll‐like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling and brain injury on network excitability and epileptogenesis. Graphic illustration of the effect of injury and early TLR4 antagonist treatment on early network excitability and the long‐term network state. The schematic neurons include TLR4 and α‐amino‐3‐hydroxy‐5‐methyl‐4‐isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAR) subunit expression profiles in the acute phase of sham or brain injury. The corresponding early effects on network excitability are depicted by schematic population response traces (inset on upper left). Note the increase in excitability of the uninjured neuron after TLR4 antagonism without changes in AMPAR expression. Note also the increase in TLR4, calcium permeable AMPARs, and population excitability after injury and its reduction by TLR4 antagonist treatment. Ampakine enhancement of excitability during TLR4 antagonism is illustrated. The early phase responses and manipulations (including injury, treatments, and molecular responses) are superimposed on a 2‐tone color‐coded network state topology, where green indicates low‐normal network excitability, ensuring network stability and low risk for epilepsy (inset on upper right). Note the correspondence between early excitability state (population response profile) and long‐term seizure susceptibility and the effects of pharmacological manipulations.

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Traumatic brain injury is a major risk factor for acquired epilepsies, and understanding the mechanisms underlying the early pathophysiology could yield viable therapeutic targets. Growing evidence indicates a role for inflammatory signaling in modifying neuronal excitability and promoting epileptogenesis. Here we examined the effect of innate immune receptor Toll‐like receptor 4 (TLR4) on excitability of the hippocampal dentate gyrus and epileptogenesis after brain injury.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Slice and in vivo electrophysiology and Western blots were conducted in rats subject to fluid percussion brain injury or sham injury.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The studies identify that TLR4 signaling in neurons augments dentate granule cell calcium‐permeable α‐amino‐3‐hydroxy‐5‐methyl‐4‐isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor (CP‐AMPAR) currents after brain injury. Blocking TLR4 signaling in vivo shortly after brain injury reduced dentate network excitability and seizure susceptibility. When blocking of TLR4 signaling after injury was delayed, however, this treatment failed to reduce postinjury seizure susceptibility. Furthermore, TLR4 signal blocking was less efficacious in limiting seizure susceptibility when AMPAR currents, downstream targets of TLR4 signaling, were transiently enhanced. Paradoxically, blocking TLR4 signaling augmented both network excitability and seizure susceptibility in uninjured controls. Despite the differential effect on seizure susceptibility, TLR4 antagonism suppressed cellular inflammatory responses after injury without impacting sham controls.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>These findings demonstrate that independently of glia, the immune receptor TLR4 directly regulates post‐traumatic neuronal excitability. Moreover, the TLR4‐dependent early increase in dentate excitability is causally associated with epileptogenesis. Identification and selective targeting of the mechanisms underlying the aberrant TLR4‐mediated increase in CP‐AMPAR signaling after injury may prevent epileptogenesis after brain trauma.</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Although migraine is defined by the headache and headache‐associated symptoms, the true beginning of a migraine attack lies in the premonitory phase. To understand the generation of attacks, one needs to investigate the phase before headache starts. The premonitory phase of migraine is characterized by a well‐described complex of symptoms. Its duration, however, is not clearly defined, and there are no biomarkers to help define when this phase starts.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Here, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to elucidate the duration of the premonitory phase in spontaneous human migraine attacks. Because migraine attacks are hardly predictable and thereby the premonitory phase is difficult to catch, we scanned 9 patients daily over a minimum period of 30 days using a well‐established paradigm for functional MRI of trigeminal nociception.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Seven patients were included in the analysis, thus providing cumulative data of 27 spontaneous human migraine attacks including scans before, during, and after migraine pain as well as interictal scans. As a response to painful trigeminal stimulation, activation of the hypothalamus was present within the last 48 hours before headache onset but not earlier.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Using hypothalamic activation as a potential marker for the premonitory phase of migraine in this unique dataset, our data corroborated a duration of 48 hours for the premonitory phase of migraine. We suggest applying this time criterion in future studies when focusing on this phase of the migraine cycle. ANN NEUROL 2020</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Observational epidemiological studies have reported a relationship between coffee intake and risk of stroke. However, evidence for this association is inconsistent, and it remains uncertain whether the association is causal or due to confounding or reverse causality. To clarify this relationship, we adopted a Mendelian randomization (MR) approach to evaluate the effects of coffee consumption on the risk of stroke and its subtypes.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>A meta‐analysis of genome‐wide association studies (GWASs) including 91,462 coffee consumers was used to identify instruments for coffee consumption. Summary‐level data for stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, ischemic stroke (IS), and IS subtypes were obtained from GWAS meta‐analyses conducted by the MEGASTROKE consortium. MR analyses were performed using the inverse‐variance‐weighted, weighted‐median, MR‐PRESSO (Pleiotropy RESidual Sum and Outlier) test and MR‐Egger regression. Sensitivity analyses were further performed using alternative instruments to test the robustness of our findings.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Genetically predicted coffee consumption (high vs infrequent/no) was not associated with risk of stroke. Similarly, among coffee consumers, MR analysis did not indicate causal associations between coffee consumption (cups/day) and risk of stroke. However, in the subgroup analysis, we found weak suggestive evidence for a potential protective effect of coffee consumption on risk of small vessel (SV)‐IS, although the association did not reach statistical significance after correction for multiple comparisons.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This study suggests that coffee consumption is not causally associated with risk of stroke or its subtypes. Further studies are warranted to elucidate the possible association between coffee intake and risk of SV‐IS, as well as its potential underlying mechanisms. ANN NEUROL 2020</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The dual hit hypothesis about the pathogenesis of Parkinson disease (PD) suggests that the brainstem is a convergent area for the propagation of pathological α‐synuclein from the periphery to the brain. Although brainstem structures are likely to be affected early in the course of the disease, detailed information regarding specific brainstem regions is lacking. The aim of our study was to investigate the function of the superior colliculus, a sensorimotor brainstem structure, in de novo PD patients compared to controls using brain functional magnetic imaging and visual stimulation paradigms.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>De novo PD patients and controls were recruited. PD subjects were imaged before and after starting PD medications. A recently developed functional magnetic resonance imaging protocol was used to stimulate and visualize the superior colliculus and 2 other visual structures: the lateral geniculate nucleus and the primary visual cortex.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In the 22 PD patients, there was no modulation of the superior colliculus responses to the luminance contrasts compared to controls. This implies a hypersensitivity to low luminance contrast and abnormal rapid blood oxygenation level–dependent signal saturation to high luminance contrasts. The lateral geniculate nucleus was only modulated by 3 to 9% luminance contrasts compared to controls. No major differences were found in the primary visual cortex between both groups.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our findings suggest that pathological superior colliculus visual responses in de novo PD patients are present early in the course of the disease. Changes in imaging the superior colliculus could play an important role as a preclinical biomarker of the disease. ANN NEUROL 2020</p>

<p>Calcium-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMKII) is a molecule involved in several cell processes including plasticity related to learning and memory. Activation of NMDA-type glutamate receptors results in translocation of CaMKII to synapses. However, there are at least two distinct mechanisms by which glutamate-dependent CaMKII translocation occurs: one well-studied process resulting from whole-cell glutamate stimulation and one resulting from brief, local glutamate application. Unlike the relatively fast CaMKII translocation seen following whole-cell glutamate delivery (seconds), local application results in CaMKII translocation that occurs gradually within 6–10 min. This locally-induced translocation of CaMKII requires L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel co-activation but does not rely on GluN2B receptor subunit expression, unlike translocation following whole-cell application of glutamate. The current study examined if nucleotide binding is necessary for locally-induced CaMKII translocation, similar to CaMKII translocation resulting from whole-cell glutamate application. Three different mechanisms of inhibition were employed: staurosporine (ATP inhibitor), CaMKII(281–302) peptide inhibitor and expression of the K42M mutation. Locally-induced CaMKII translocation was moderately suppressed in the presence of either the broad-spectrum kinase inhibitor staurosporine (100 nm) or the CaMKII(281–302) peptide inhibitor. However, expression of the catalytically dead K42M mutation that prevents ATP-binding to CaMKII, significantly inhibited locally-induced translocation. Thus, CaMKII translocation following brief, local glutamate application requires nucleotide binding, providing support for future research into the molecular mechanisms of this distinct form of CaMKII translocation.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsyn.2020.00003">Plasticity in the Brainstem: Prenatal and Postnatal Experience Can Alter Laterodorsal Tegmental (LDT) Structure and Function</a></h4>

<p>The brainstem has traditionally been considered an area of the brain with autonomous control of mostly homeostatic functions such as heart rate, respiration, and the sleep and wakefulness state, which would preclude the necessity to exhibit the high degree of synaptic or cellular mechanisms of plasticity typical of regions of the brain responsible for flexible, executive control, such as the medial prefrontal cortex or the hippocampus. The perception that the brainstem does not share the same degree of flexibility to alter synaptic strength and/or wiring within local circuits makes intuitive sense, as it is not easy to understand how “soft wiring” would be an advantage when considering the importance of faithful and consistent performance of the homeostatic, autonomic functions that are controlled by the brainstem. However, many of the molecular and cellular requirements which underlie strengthening of synapses seen in brain regions involved in higher-level processing are present in brainstem nuclei, and recent research suggest that the view of the brainstem as “hard wired,” with rigid and static connectivity and with unchanging synaptic strength, is outdated. In fact, information from studies within the last decades, including work conducted in our group, leads us to propose that the brainstem can dynamically alter synaptic proteins, and change synaptic connections in response to prenatal or postnatal stimuli, and this would likely alter functionality and output. This article reviews recent research that has provided information resulting in our revision of the view of the brainstem as static and non-changing by using as example recent information gleaned from a brainstem pontine nucleus, the laterodorsal tegmentum (LDT). The LDT has demonstrated mechanisms underlying synaptic plasticity, and plasticity has been exhibited in the postnatal LDT following exposure to drugs of abuse. Further, exposure of the brain during gestation to drugs of abuse results in alterations in development of signaling pathways in the LDT. As the LDT provides a high degree of innervation of mesoaccumbal and mesocortical circuits involved in salience, as well as thalamocortical circuits involved in control of arousal and orientation, changes in synaptic strength would be expected to alter output, which would significantly impact behavioral state, motivated behavior and directed attention. Further, alterations in developmental trajectory within the LDT following prenatal exposure to drugs of abuse would be expected to impact on later life expression of motivation and arousal.</p>

<p>The P/Q-type Ca<sub>V</sub>2.1 channel regulates neurotransmitter release at neuromuscular junctions (NMJ) and many central synapses. CACNA1A encodes the pore-containing α<sub>1A</sub> subunit of Ca<sub>V</sub>2.1 channels. In humans, de novo CACNA1A mutations result in a wide spectrum of neurological, neuromuscular, and movement disorders, such as familial hemiplegic migraine type 1 (FHM1), episodic ataxia type 2 (EA2), as well as a more recently discovered class of more severe disorders, which are characterized by ataxia, hypotonia, cerebellar atrophy, and cognitive/developmental delay. Heterologous expression of Ca<sub>V</sub>2.1 channels has allowed for an understanding of the consequences of CACNA1A missense mutations on channel function. In contrast, a mechanistic understanding of how specific CACNA1A mutations lead in vivo to the resultant phenotypes is lacking. In this review, we present the zebrafish as a model to both study in vivo mechanisms of CACNA1A mutations that result in synaptic and behavioral defects and to screen for effective drug therapies to combat these and other Ca<sub>V</sub>2.1 channelopathies.</p>

<p>The objective of the Autism Biomarkers Consortium for Clinical Trials (ABC-CT) is to evaluate a set of lab-based behavioral video tracking (VT), electroencephalography (EEG), and eye tracking (ET) measures for use in clinical trials with children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Within the larger organizational structure of the ABC-CT, the Data Acquisition and Analytic Core (DAAC) oversees the standardization of VT, EEG, and ET data acquisition, data processing, and data analysis. This includes designing and documenting data acquisition and analytic protocols and manuals; facilitating site training in acquisition; data acquisition quality control (QC); derivation and validation of dependent variables (DVs); and analytic deliverables including preparation of data for submission to the National Database for Autism Research (NDAR). To oversee consistent application of scientific standards and methodological rigor for data acquisition, processing, and analytics, we developed standard operating procedures that reflect the logistical needs of multi-site research, and the need for well-articulated, transparent processes that can be implemented in future clinical trials. This report details the methodology of the ABC-CT related to acquisition and QC in our Feasibility and Main Study phases. Based on our acquisition metrics from a preplanned interim analysis, we report high levels of acquisition success utilizing VT, EEG, and ET experiments in a relatively large sample of children with ASD and typical development (TD), with data acquired across multiple sites and use of a manualized training and acquisition protocol.</p>

However, MRI is limited by its spatial resolution and signal specificity. In order to mitigate these shortcomings, it is crucial to validate MRI with an array of ancillary ex vivo imaging techniques. These techniques include histological methods, such as light and electron microscopy (EM), which can provide specific information on the tissue structure in healthy and diseased brain and spinal cord, at cellular and subcellular level. However, these conventional histological techniques are intrinsically two-dimensional (2D) and, as a result of sectioning, lack volumetric information of the tissue. This limitation can be overcome with genuine three-dimensional (3D) imaging approaches of the tissue. 3D highly resolved information of the CNS achievable by means of other imaging techniques can complement and improve the interpretation of MRI measurements. In this article, we provide an overview of different 3D imaging techniques that can be used to validate MRI. As an example, we introduce an approach of how to combine diffusion MRI and synchrotron X-ray phase contrast tomography (SXRPCT) data. Our approach paves the way for a new multiscale assessment of the CNS allowing to validate and to improve our understanding of in vivo imaging (such as MRI).</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00065">Systematic Evaluation of Image Tiling Adverse Effects on Deep Learning Semantic Segmentation</a></h4>

<p>Convolutional neural network (CNN) models obtain state of the art performance on image classification, localization, and segmentation tasks. Limitations in computer hardware, most notably memory size in deep learning accelerator cards, prevent relatively large images, such as those from medical and satellite imaging, from being processed as a whole in their original resolution. A fully convolutional topology, such as U-Net, is typically trained on down-sampled images and inferred on images of their original size and resolution, by simply dividing the larger image into smaller (typically overlapping) tiles, making predictions on these tiles, and stitching them back together as the prediction for the whole image. In this study, we show that this tiling technique combined with translationally-invariant nature of CNNs causes small, but relevant differences during inference that can be detrimental in the performance of the model. Here we quantify these variations in both medical (i.e., BraTS) and non-medical (i.e., satellite) images and show that training a 2D U-Net model on the whole image substantially improves the overall model performance. Finally, we compare 2D and 3D semantic segmentation models to show that providing CNN models with a wider context of the image in all three dimensions leads to more accurate and consistent predictions. Our results suggest that tiling the input to CNN models—while perhaps necessary to overcome the memory limitations in computer hardware—may lead to undesirable and unpredictable errors in the model's output that can only be adequately mitigated by increasing the input of the model to the largest possible tile size.</p>

<p>Available evidence suggests that diabetes mellitus (DM) is a non-genetic risk factor for Parkinson’s disease (PD). PD and DM have shared similarities in pathogenetic mechanisms, including age, environmental factors, inflammatory reaction, and protein aggregation, etc. α-Synuclein is the primary protein component in the protein inclusions in PD, while islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) aggregates to form amyloid structures in β cells in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Pancreatic and cerebral functions, pancreas and brain α-synuclein deposition as well as striatal alterations, were assessed in spontaneously developed T2DM monkeys and age-matched normal monkeys. We demonstrated increased accumulation, aggregation, and phosphorylation of α-synuclein, and IAPP in the pancreatic islets of spontaneously developed T2DM monkeys, compared to the age-matched normal subjects. Double immunofluorescence analyses showed complete overlap between α-synuclein and IAPP in the pancreatic islets. In addition, in T2DM monkeys’ brain, we observed concomitantly increased accumulation and phosphorylation of α-synuclein in the cortex, pre-commissural putamen and dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, which interestingly showed high correlation with levels of fasting plasma glucose (FPG), triglyceride (TG), and high density lipoprotein (HDL). Our data indicates the close association between IAPP and α-synuclein and the potential link between T2DM and PD, which implies that T2DM may facilitate PD disease onset and progress by interfering with the pathological protein aggregation both in the pancreatic islets and the brain.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00026">Monitoring Depth of Anesthesia Based on Hybrid Features and Recurrent Neural Network</a></h4>

<p>Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals contain valuable information about the different physiological states of the brain, with a variety of linear and nonlinear features that can be used to investigate brain activity. Monitoring the depth of anesthesia (DoA) with EEG is an ongoing challenge in anesthesia research. In this paper, we propose a novel method based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and a sparse denoising autoencoder (SDAE) to combine the hybrid features of EEG to monitor the DoA. The EEG signals were preprocessed using filtering, etc., and then more than ten features including sample entropy, permutation entropy, spectra, and alpha-ratio were extracted from the EEG signal. We then integrated the optional features such as permutation entropy and alpha-ratio to extract the essential structure and learn the most efficient temporal model for monitoring the DoA. Compared with using a single feature, the proposed model could accurately estimate the depth of anesthesia with higher prediction probability (P<sub>k</sub>). Experimental results evaluated on the datasets demonstrated that our proposed method provided better performance than the methods using permutation entropy, alpha-ratio, LSTM, and other traditional indices.</p>

<p>Background: Classic motion abnormalities in Parkinson's disease (PD), such as tremor, bradykinesia, or rigidity, are well-covered by standard clinical assessments such as the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). However, PD includes motor abnormalities beyond the symptoms and signs as measured by UPDRS, such as the lack of anticipatory adjustments or compromised movement smoothness, which are difficult to assess clinically. Moreover, PD may entail motor abnormalities not yet known. All these abnormalities are quantifiable via motion capture and may serve as biomarkers to diagnose and monitor PD.</p><p>Objective: In this pilot study, we attempted to identify motion features revealing maximum contrast between healthy subjects and PD patients with deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the nucleus subthalamicus (STN) switched off and on as the first step to develop biomarkers for detecting and monitoring PD patients' motor symptoms.</p><p>Methods: We performed 3D gait analysis in 7 out of 26 PD patients with DBS switched off and on, and in 25 healthy control subjects. We computed feature values for each stride, related to 22 body segments, four time derivatives, left–right mean vs. difference, and mean vs. variance across stride time. We then ranked the feature values according to their distinguishing power between PD patients and healthy subjects.</p><p>Results: The foot and lower leg segments proved better in classifying motor anomalies than any other segment. Higher degrees of time derivatives were superior to lower degrees (jerk &gt; acceleration &gt; velocity &gt; displacement). The averaged movements across left and right demonstrated greater distinguishing power than left–right asymmetries. The variability of motion was superior to motion's absolute values.</p><p>Conclusions: This small pilot study identified the variability of a smoothness measure, i.e., jerk of the foot, as the optimal signal to separate healthy subjects' from PD patients' gait. This biomarker is invisible to clinicians' naked eye and is therefore not included in current motor assessments such as the UPDRS. We therefore recommend that more extensive investigations be conducted to identify the most powerful biomarkers to characterize motor abnormalities in PD. Future studies may challenge the composition of traditional assessments such as the UPDRS.</p>

<p>The detailed mechanisms underlying oxidative stress that leads to neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration in retinal vascular conditions, including diabetic retinopathy, retinopathy of prematurity etc., remain largely unexplored mainly due to a lack of suitable disease models that can simulate the inherent neuron–glia interactions in human retina. Specifically, establishment of a mixed retinal culture (MRC) containing both neuron and glial cell types remains a challenge due to different conditions required for their optimal growth and differentiation. Here, we establish a novel primary MRC model system containing neurons, astrocytes, Müller glia, and microglia from human donor retina that can be used to study the neuromodulatory effects of glial cells under the stress. The cell characterization based on immunostaining with individual cell type–specific markers and their presence in close vicinity to each other further underscores their utility for studying their cross talk. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first instance of an in vitro model obtained from human donor retina containing four major cell types. Next, we induce hypoxic stress to MRC to investigate if hypoxia activated neuroglia modulates altered gene expression for inflammatory, apoptotic, and angiogenic markers and Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients by live cell imaging. Further, we performed k-means clustering of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses to identify the modification of clustering pattern in stressed condition. Finally, we provide the evidence that the altered Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient correlates to differential expression of genes shown to be involved in neuroinflammation, angiogenesis, and neurodegeneration under the hypoxic conditions as seen earlier in human cell lines and animal models of diabetic retinopathy. The major features of the hypoxic conditions in the proposed human MRC model included: increase in microglia activity, chemokine and cytokine expression, and percentage of cells having higher amplitude and frequency of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients. Thus, the proposed experimental system can potentially serve as an ideal in vitro model for studying the neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative changes in the retina and identifying newer drug targets.</p>

<p>A non-invasive, brain-to-brain interface (BBI) requires precision neuromodulation and high temporal resolution as well as portability to increase accessibility. A BBI is a combination of the brain–computer interface (BCI) and the computer–brain interface (CBI). The optimization of BCI parameters has been extensively researched, but CBI has not. Parameters taken from the BCI and CBI literature were used to simulate a two-class medical monitoring BBI system under a wide range of conditions. BBI function was assessed using the information transfer rate (ITR), measured in bits per trial and bits per minute. The BBI ITR was a function of classifier accuracy, window update rate, system latency, stimulation failure rate (SFR), and timeout threshold. The BCI parameters, including window length, update rate, and classifier accuracy, were kept constant to investigate the effects of varying the CBI parameters, including system latency, SFR, and timeout threshold. Based on passively monitoring BCI parameters, a base ITR of 1 bit/trial was used. The optimal latency was found to be 100 ms or less, with a threshold no more than twice its value. With the optimal latency and timeout parameters, the system was able to maintain near-maximum efficiency, even with a 25% SFR. When the CBI and BCI parameters are compared, the CBI’s system latency and timeout threshold should be reflected in the BCI’s update rate. This would maximize the number of trials, even at a high SFR. These findings suggested that a higher number of trials per minute optimizes the ITR of a non-invasive BBI. The delays innate to each BCI protocol and CBI stimulation method must also be accounted for. The high latencies in each are the primary constraints of non-invasive BBI for the foreseeable future.</p>

<p>At present, the diagnosis of brain disease is mainly based on the self-reported symptoms and clinical signs of the patient, which can easily lead to psychiatrists' bias. The purpose of this study is to develop a brain network clustering model to accurately identify brain diseases based on resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in the absence of clinical information. We use cosine similarity and sub-network kernels to measure attribute similarity and structure similarity, respectively. By integrating the structure similarity and attribute similarity into one matrix, spectral clustering is used to achieve brain network clustering. Finally, we evaluate this method on three diseases: Alzheimer's disease, Bipolar disorder patients, and Schizophrenia. The performance of methods is evaluated by measuring clustering consistency. Clustering consistency is similar to clustering accuracy, which is used to evaluate the consistency between the clustering labels and clinical diagnostic labels of the subjects. The experimental results show that our proposed method can significantly improve clustering performance, with a consistency of 60.6% for Alzheimer's disease, with a consistency of 100% for Schizophrenia, with a consistency of 100% for Bipolar disorder patients.</p>

<p>Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have shown favorable performance recently. Nonetheless, the time-consuming computation on neuron level and complex optimization limit their real-time application. Curiosity has shown great performance in brain learning, which helps biological brains grasp new knowledge efficiently and actively. Inspired by this leaning mechanism, we propose a curiosity-based SNN (CBSNN) model, which contains four main learning processes. Firstly, the network is trained with biologically plausible plasticity principles to get the novelty estimations of all samples in only one epoch; secondly, the CBSNN begins to repeatedly learn the samples whose novelty estimations exceed the novelty threshold and dynamically update the novelty estimations of samples according to the learning results in five epochs; thirdly, in order to avoid the overfitting of the novel samples and forgetting of the learned samples, CBSNN retrains all samples in one epoch; finally, step two and step three are periodically taken until network convergence. Compared with the state-of-the-art Voltage-driven Plasticity-centric SNN (VPSNN) under standard architecture, our model achieves a higher accuracy of 98.55% with only 54.95% of its computation cost on the MNIST hand-written digit recognition dataset. Similar conclusion can also be found out in other datasets, i.e., Iris, NETtalk, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10, respectively. More experiments and analysis further prove that such curiosity-based learning theory is helpful in improving the efficiency of SNNs. As far as we know, this is the first practical combination of the curiosity mechanism and SNN, and these improvements will make the realistic application of SNNs possible on more specific tasks within the von Neumann framework.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2020.00006">Demystifying Brain Tumor Segmentation Networks: Interpretability and Uncertainty Analysis</a></h4>

<p>The accurate automatic segmentation of gliomas and its intra-tumoral structures is important not only for treatment planning but also for follow-up evaluations. Several methods based on 2D and 3D Deep Neural Networks (DNN) have been developed to segment brain tumors and to classify different categories of tumors from different MRI modalities. However, these networks are often black-box models and do not provide any evidence regarding the process they take to perform this task. Increasing transparency and interpretability of such deep learning techniques is necessary for the complete integration of such methods into medical practice. In this paper, we explore various techniques to explain the functional organization of brain tumor segmentation models and to extract visualizations of internal concepts to understand how these networks achieve highly accurate tumor segmentations. We use the BraTS 2018 dataset to train three different networks with standard architectures and outline similarities and differences in the process that these networks take to segment brain tumors. We show that brain tumor segmentation networks learn certain human-understandable disentangled concepts on a filter level. We also show that they take a top-down or hierarchical approach to localizing the different parts of the tumor. We then extract visualizations of some internal feature maps and also provide a measure of uncertainty with regards to the outputs of the models to give additional qualitative evidence about the predictions of these networks. We believe that the emergence of such human-understandable organization and concepts might aid in the acceptance and integration of such methods in medical diagnosis.</p>

<p>The piriform cortex (PC) is a key brain area involved in both processing and coding of olfactory information. It is implicated in various brain disorders, such as epilepsy, Alzheimer’s disease, and autism. The PC consists of the anterior (APC) and posterior (PPC) parts, which are different anatomically and functionally. However, the direct input networks to specific neuronal populations within the APC and PPC remain poorly understood. Here, we mapped the whole-brain direct inputs to the two major neuronal populations, the excitatory glutamatergic principal neurons and inhibitory γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic interneurons within the APC and PPC using the rabies virus (RV)-mediated retrograde trans-synaptic tracing system. We found that for both types of neurons, APC and PPC share some similarities in input networks, with dominant inputs originating from the olfactory region (OLF), followed by the cortical subplate (CTXsp), isocortex, cerebral nuclei (CNU), hippocampal formation (HPF) and interbrain (IB), whereas the midbrain (MB) and hindbrain (HB) were rarely labeled. However, APC and PPC also show distinct features in their input distribution patterns. For both types of neurons, the input proportion from the OLF to the APC was higher than that to the PPC; while the PPC received higher proportions of inputs from the HPF and CNU than the APC did. Overall, our results revealed the direct input networks of both excitatory and inhibitory neuronal populations of different PC subareas, providing a structural basis to analyze the diverse PC functions.</p>

Healthy central nervous system (CNS) development and function require an intricate and balanced bidirectional communication between neurons and glia cells. In this review, we discuss the complementary roles of astrocytes and microglia in building the brain, including in the formation and refinement of synapses. We discuss recent evidence demonstrating how these interactions are coordinated in the transition from healthy physiology towards disease and discuss known and potential molecular mechanisms that mediate this cellular crosstalk.

<p>Human babies respond preferentially to faces or face-like images. It has been proposed that an innate and rapid face detection system is present at birth before the cortical visual pathway is developed in many species, including primates. However, in primates, the visual area responsible for this process is yet to be unraveled. We hypothesized that the superior colliculus (SC) that receives direct and indirect retinal visual inputs may serve as an innate rapid face-detection system in primates. To test this hypothesis, we examined the responsiveness of monkey SC neurons to first-order information of faces required for face detection (basic spatial layout of facial features including eyes, nose, and mouth), by analyzing neuronal responses to line drawing images of: (1) face-like patterns with contours and properly placed facial features; (2) non-face patterns including face contours only; and (3) nonface random patterns with contours and randomly placed face features. Here, we show that SC neurons respond stronger and faster to upright and inverted face-like patterns compared to the responses to nonface patterns, regardless of contrast polarity and contour shapes. Furthermore, SC neurons with central receptive fields (RFs) were more selective to face-like patterns. In addition, the population activity of SC neurons with central RFs can discriminate face-like patterns from nonface patterns as early as 50 ms after the stimulus onset. Our results provide strong neurophysiological evidence for the involvement of the primate SC in face detection and suggest the existence of a broadly tuned template for face detection in the subcortical visual pathway.</p>

<p>Neuromodulation is a therapeutic technique that is well-established in the treatment of idiopathic Lower urinary tract (LUT) dysfunction such as overactive bladder (OAB). We have recently developed a novel neuromodulation approach, Transcutaneous Electrical Spinal Cord Neuromodulation (TESCoN) and demonstrated its acute effects on LUT dysfunction after spinal cord injury (SCI) during urodynamic studies. We found that TESCoN can promote urinary storage and induce urinary voiding when delivered during urodynamic studies. The objective of this study was to determine whether TESCoN can retrain the spinal neural networks to induce chronic improvement in the LUT, such that positive changes can persist even in the absence of stimulation. In addition, we wished to examine the effect of TESCoN on LUT dysfunction due to multiple pathologies. To achieve this objective, 14 patients [SCI = 5, stroke = 5, multiple sclerosis (MS) = 3, and idiopathic OAB (iOAB) = 1] completed 24 sessions of TESCoN over the course of 8 weeks. Patients completed urodynamic studies before and after undergoing TESCoN therapy. Additionally, each subject completed a voiding diary and the Neurogenic Bladder Symptom Score questionnaire before and after receiving TESCoN therapy. We found that TESCoN led to decreased detrusor overactivity, improved continence, and enhanced LUT sensation across the different pathologies underlying LUT dysfunction. This study serves as a pilot in preparation for a rigorous randomized placebo-controlled trial designed to demonstrate the effect of TESCoN on LUT function in neurogenic and non-neurogenic conditions.</p>New And Noteworthy<p>Non-Surgical modality to reduce incidence of urinary incontinence and improve neurogenic bladder symptom scores (NBSS) in individuals with neurogenic bladder due to spinal cord injury or stroke.</p>

<p>Lysophosphatidic acid is a small extracellular signaling molecule, which is elevated in pathological conditions such as ischemic stroke and traumatic brain injury (TBI). LPA regulates the survival of neurons in various diseases. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying LPA-induced neuronal death remain unclear. Here we report that LPA activates LPA1 and LPA2 receptors, and the downstream MAPK pathway to induce the apoptosis of PC12 cells through mitochondrial dysfunction. LPA elicits the activation of ERK1/2, p38, and JNK pathways, decreases the expression of Bcl2, promotes the translocation of Bax, and enhances the activation of caspase-3, resulting in mitochondrial dysfunction and cell apoptosis. This process can be blocked by LPA1 receptor antagonist and LPA2 receptor antagonist and MAPK pathway inhibitors. Our results indicate that LPA1 receptor, LPA2 receptor and MAPK pathway play a critical role in LPA-induced neuronal injury. LPA receptors and MAPK pathways may be novel therapeutic targets for ischemic stroke and TBI, where excessive LPA signaling exist.</p>

<p>Fiber photometry has enabled neuroscientists to easily measure targeted brain activity patterns in awake, freely behaving animal. A focus of this technique is to identify functionally-relevant changes in activity around particular environmental and/or behavioral events, i.e., event-related activity transients (ERT). A simple and popular approach to identifying ERT is to summarize peri-event signal [e.g., area under the curve (AUC), peak activity, etc.,] and perform standard analyses on this summary statistic. We highlight the various issues with this approach and overview straightforward alternatives: waveform confidence intervals (CIs) and permutation tests. We introduce the rationale behind these approaches, describe the results of Monte Carlo simulations evaluating their effectiveness at controlling Type I and Type II error rates, and offer some recommendations for selecting appropriate analysis strategies for fiber photometry experiments.</p>

<p>Agglomerative hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA) is a commonly used unsupervised machine learning approach for identifying informative natural clusters of observations. HCA is performed by calculating a pairwise dissimilarity matrix and then clustering similar observations until all observations are grouped within a cluster. Verifying the empirical clusters produced by HCA is complex and not well studied in biomedical applications. Here, we demonstrate the comparability of a novel HCA technique with one that was used in previous biomedical applications while applying both techniques to plasma angiogenic (FGF, FLT, PIGF, Tie-2, VEGF, VEGF-D) and inflammatory (MMP1, MMP3, MMP9, IL8, TNFα) protein data to identify informative subsets of individuals. Study subjects were diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment due to cerebrovascular disease (MCI-CVD). Through comparison of the two HCA techniques, we were able to identify subsets of individuals, based on differences in VEGF (p &lt; 0.001), MMP1 (p &lt; 0.001), and IL8 (p &lt; 0.001) levels. These profiles provide novel insights into angiogenic and inflammatory pathologies that may contribute to VCID.</p>
