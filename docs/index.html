                <p>The tuning properties of neurons in the visual system can be contextually modulated by the statistics of the area surrounding their receptive field (RF), particularly when the surround contains natural features. However, stimuli presented in specific egocentric locations may have greater behavioral relevance, raising the possibility that the extent of contextual modulation may vary with position in visual space. To explore this possibility, we utilized the small size and optical transparency of the larval zebrafish to describe the form and spatial arrangement of contextually modulated cells throughout an entire tectal hemisphere. We found that the spatial tuning of tectal neurons to a prey-like stimulus sharpens when the stimulus is presented against a background with the statistics of complex natural scenes, relative to a featureless background. These neurons are confined to a spatially restricted region of the tectum and have receptive fields centered within a region of visual space in which the presence of prey preferentially triggers hunting behavior. Our results suggest that contextual modulation of tectal neurons by complex backgrounds may facilitate prey-localization in cluttered visual environments.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Sleep facilitates memory storage and even brief periods of sleep loss lead to impairments in memory, particularly memories that are hippocampus dependent. In previous studies, we have shown that the deficit in memory seen after sleep loss is accompanied by deficits in synaptic plasticity. Our previous work has also found that sleep deprivation (SD) is associated with reduced levels of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) in the hippocampus and that the reduction of cAMP mediates the diminished memory observed in sleep-deprived animals. Based on these findings, we hypothesized that cAMP acts as a mediator for not only the cognitive deficits caused by sleep deprivation, but also the observed deficits in synaptic plasticity. In this study, we expressed the heterologous <I>Drosophila melanogaster</I> G&alpha;s-protein-coupled octopamine receptor (DmOct&beta;1R) in mouse hippocampal neurons. This receptor is selectively activated by the systemically injected ligand (octopamine), thus allowing us to increase cAMP levels in hippocampal neurons during a 5-h sleep deprivation period. Our results show that chemogenetic enhancement of cAMP during the period of sleep deprivation prevents deficits in a persistent form of long-term potentiation (LTP) that is induced at the Schaffer collateral synapses in the hippocampal CA1 region. We also found that elevating cAMP levels in either the first or second half of sleep deprivation successfully prevented LTP deficits. These findings reveal that cAMP-dependent signaling pathways are key mediators of sleep deprivation at the synaptic level. Targeting these pathways could be useful in designing strategies to prevent the impact of sleep loss.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>The noradrenergic locus coeruleus (LC) is among the earliest sites of tau and &alpha;-synuclein pathology in Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease (AD) and Parkinson&rsquo;s disease (PD), respectively. The onset of these pathologies coincides with loss of noradrenergic fibers in LC target regions and the emergence of prodromal symptoms including sleep disturbances and anxiety. Paradoxically, these prodromal symptoms are indicative of a noradrenergic hyperactivity phenotype, rather than the predicted loss of norepinephrine (NE) transmission following LC damage, suggesting the engagement of complex compensatory mechanisms. Because current therapeutic efforts are targeting early disease, interest in the LC has grown, and it is critical to identify the links between pathology and dysfunction. We employed the LC-specific neurotoxin N-(2-chloroethyl)-N-ethyl-2-bromobenzylamine (DSP-4), which preferentially damages LC axons, to model early changes in the LC-NE system pertinent to AD and PD in male and female mice. DSP-4 (two doses of 50 mg/kg, one week apart) induced LC axon degeneration, triggered neuroinflammation and oxidative stress, and reduced tissue NE levels. There was no LC cell death or changes to LC firing, but transcriptomics revealed reduced expression of genes that define noradrenergic identity and other changes relevant to neurodegenerative disease. Despite the dramatic loss of LC fibers, NE turnover and signaling were elevated in terminal regions and were associated with anxiogenic phenotypes in multiple behavioral tests. These results represent a comprehensive analysis of how the LC-NE system responds to axon/terminal damage reminiscent of early AD and PD at the molecular, cellular, systems, and behavioral levels, and provides potential mechanisms underlying prodromal neuropsychiatric symptoms.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/12-19/v1?src=rss">Protocol for a systematic review and meta-analysis on preoperative risk factors for failure after fixed sling implantation for post-prostatectomy stress urinary incontinence [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Post-prostatectomy urinary incontinence (PPI) is a bothersome complication affecting patients undergoing prostate surgery that in up 10% of cases will require an invasive treatment with fixed slings or artificial urinary sphincters (AUS). Although fixed slings have several advantages over AUS, failure rates after slings range between 15% and 45% while current knowledge of predictors of sling efficacy remains limited. By systematically combining and summarizing all relevant literature, the present review and meta-analysis aim to address this research need assessing the association between preoperative risk factors and sling failure. Methods: Studies pertaining to fixed synthetic male perineal slings as treatment for adult male suffering from PPI, will be included. A systematic search will be conducted in PubMED, Scopus, Web of Science and Cochrane databases, and in the reference lists of retrieved articles. Independent reviewers will conduct study selection and data extraction. Outcomes will include failure to achieve the continence cure and overall success (cure plus improvement), measured as per included studies. Exposures will include any preoperative variables evaluated for association with sling failure. The QUIPS tool will be used for study quality assessment and a random-effects DerSimonian-Laird model, with Hartung-Knapp adjustment, will be used to pool adjusted and unadjusted odds ratios separately. Sensitivity analysis will be performed using the leave-one-out methodology and subgroup meta-analyses based on pre-specified studies’ characteristics will be conducted to explain the heterogeneity. Certainty of evidence will be assessed according to GRADE methodology and review reporting will comply with the PRISMA-P statement. Discussion: By summarising all relevant literature in the field, our results will help to incorporate available evidence into clinical practice assisting healthcare professionals managing PPI patients in treatment decision-making. The present review will also provide researchers with the necessary, evidence-based groundwork to perform future high-quality prognostic studies in the field. Registration: CRD42022307160.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/12-18/v1?src=rss">Pharmacy students' empathy and its determinants: a systematic review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Empathy in the context of healthcare is an immersion experience to comprehend patients' viewpoints, feelings, and emotions, without passing judgment, to ensure they receive the necessary treatment to feel comfortable. Empathy for others must be possessed by healthcare professionals and healthcare students as healthcare professionals’ candidates, including the pharmacy student. This study aimed to identify and assess the determinants related to pharmacy students' empathy. Methods: Three electronic databases were used for the first searches. We used peer-reviewed original papers, full text, must assess determinants that are associated with pharmacy students' empathy, and only be focused on pharmacy students (first to the fourth year) as healthcare professionals candidates. We utilized Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Checklists to observe the quality of published publications and reduce bias. Results: This review examined 14 papers that reported on determinants connected to pharmacy students' empathy. Nine studies evaluated the association between sex and the level of empathy, seven studies reported educational intervention, four studies discussed the year of study, two studies explained the type of school, four studies evaluated experience, and others determinants that discussed in the included studies were career preference, intercultural sensitivity, stigma, altruism, grit, self-awareness, marital status, and family income Conclusions: Educational intervention, experience, gender or sex, type of school, year of study, intercultural sensitivity, career preference, altruism, grit, self-awareness, marital status, and family income, can all have a positive impact on increased empathy among pharmacy students. We acknowledge that the included studies are heterogeneous, indicating that additional studies are necessary before reaching any firm conclusions. More research is needed to properly understand how empathy can be improved with the most effective pharmacy educational strategies. Higher levels of evidence are also required in studies to address the potential bias caused using self-report questionnaires, as well as other potential biases and inaccuracies.

                Background: The University of Rwanda is the only African residency to have implemented the pediatric International In-Training Examination (I-ITE) as a tool to monitor resident knowledge acquisition. The objective of this study was to better understand the acceptance and relevance of this exam to residents from this setting and their perceptions regarding this assessment tool. Methods: A retrospective, survey-study was undertaken to describe candidate feedback. Immediately on completing the I-ITE residents provided feedback by filling in an electronic questionnaire comprised of four closed Likert questions and an open text box for free-text feedback. Participants were pediatric residents from the University of Rwanda, the only university in Rwanda with a pediatric residency program. Quantitative analysis of the Likert questions was undertaken descriptively using SPSS. Free-text feedback was coded and analysed employing a phenomenological approach, with coding and analysis undertaken by two researchers. Results: Eighty-four residents completed a total of 213 I-ITE sittings during the five exam cycles undertaken during the study period. The survey was completed after 206 of the 213 exam sittings, giving a response rate of 97%.  Five themes emerged from the qualitative analysis; 1) undertaking the I-ITE was a positive experience; 2) exam content; 3) formative nature of the assessment; 4) challenges to completing the exam; 5) practicalities to undertaking the exam. Conclusion: Qualitative feedback demonstrates that the I-ITE, a standardized, and independent exam, produced by the American Board of Pediatrics, was valued and well accepted by Rwanda pediatric residents. Its formative nature and the breadth and quality of the questions were reported to positively contribute to the residents' formative development.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/11-1105/v2?src=rss">Case Report: Primary graft failure due to a reversed lenticule in Descemet Stripping Automated Endothelial Keratoplasty [version 2; peer review: 3 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction and importance: This report details the clinical features and management in a case of Descemet stripping automated endothelial keratoplasty (DSAEK) which had primary graft failure (PGF) due to an inverted yet attached lenticule. Presentation of case: A 66-year-old gentleman had poor visual recovery in the right eye after undergoing cataract surgery 12 years prior to presentation. The visual acuity was counting fingers and examination revealed endothelial decompensation. The patient underwent a DSAEK and postoperatively had a well attached lenticule. However, the cornea was edematous three weeks after the surgery and optical coherence tomography (OCT) revealed a reversed lenticule. The patient underwent a repeat DSAEK and had an uneventful postoperative course. The visual acuity was 20/40 after 7 months with a clear cornea and a well attached graft. Discussion: PGF is a rare complication following DSAEK which occurs due to poor endothelial function of the donor graft. Insertion of a reversed lenticule may get overlooked as a cause of PGF unless the graft edge profile is examined on an OCT scan. The graft in the current case was well attached despite its inverted position suggesting that graft adherence is perhaps not a function of the corneal endothelial pumps in isolation and may be driven by factors such as the intraocular pressure. Conclusion: A reversed DSAEK lenticule may have normal adherence to the host stroma and must be considered in cases with PGF. OCT of the graft edge is required for diagnosis before performing a repeat keratoplasty.

Summary <p>The survival path mapping approach has been proposed for dynamic prognostication of cancer patients using time-series survival data. The SurvivalPath R package was developed to facilitate building personalized survival path models. The package contains functions to convert time-series data into time-slices data by fixed interval based on time information of input medical records. After the pre-processing of data, under a user-defined parameters on covariates, significance level, minimum bifurcation sample size and number of time slices for analysis, survival paths can be computed using the main function, which can be visualized as a tree diagram, with important parameters annotated. The package also includes function for analyzing the connections between exposure/treatment and node transitions, and function for screening patient subgroup with specific features, which can be used for further exploration analysis. In this study, we demonstrate the application of this package in a large dataset of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, which is embedded in the package. The SurvivalPath R package is freely available from CRAN, with source code and documentation hosted at https://github.com/zhangt369/SurvivalPath.</p>

                <p>by Gian Luca Lancia, Mattia Eluchans, Marco D’Alessandro, Hugo J. Spiers, Giovanni Pezzulo</p>

When faced with navigating back somewhere we have been before we might either retrace our steps or seek a shorter path. Both choices have costs. Here, we ask whether it is possible to characterize formally the choice of navigational plans as a <i>bounded rational</i> process that trades off the quality of the plan (e.g., its length) and the cognitive cost required to find and implement it. We analyze the navigation strategies of two groups of people that are firstly trained to follow a "default policy" taking a route in a virtual maze and then asked to navigate to various known goal destinations, either in the way they want ("Go To Goal") or by taking novel shortcuts ("Take Shortcut"). We address these wayfinding problems using InfoRL: an information-theoretic approach that formalizes the cognitive cost of devising a navigational plan, as the informational cost to deviate from a well-learned route (the "default policy"). In InfoRL, optimality refers to finding the best trade-off between route length and the amount of control information required to find it. We report five main findings. First, the navigational strategies automatically identified by InfoRL correspond closely to different routes (optimal or suboptimal) in the virtual reality map, which were annotated by hand in previous research. Second, people deliberate more in places where the value of investing cognitive resources (i.e., relevant goal information) is greater. Third, compared to the group of people who receive the "Go To Goal" instruction, those who receive the "Take Shortcut" instruction find shorter but less optimal solutions, reflecting the intrinsic difficulty of finding optimal shortcuts. Fourth, those who receive the "Go To Goal" instruction modulate flexibly their cognitive resources, depending on the benefits of finding the shortcut. Finally, we found a surprising amount of variability in the choice of navigational strategies and resource investment across participants. Taken together, these results illustrate the benefits of using InfoRL to address navigational planning problems from a bounded rational perspective.

                <p>by Hongxuan Zhai, Julia Fukuyama</p>

<i>k</i>-mer-based distances are often used to describe the differences between communities in metagenome sequencing studies because of their computational convenience and history of effectiveness. Although <i>k</i>-mer-based distances do not use information about taxon abundances, we show that one class of <i>k</i>-mer distances between metagenomes (the Euclidean distance between <i>k</i>-mer spectra, or EKS distances) are very closely related to a class of phylogenetically-informed <i>β</i>-diversity measures that do explicitly use both the taxon abundances and information about the phylogenetic relationships among the taxa. Furthermore, we show that both of these distances can be interpreted as using certain features of the taxon abundances that are related to the phylogenetic tree. Our results allow practitioners to perform phylogenetically-informed analyses when they only have <i>k</i>-mer data available and provide a theoretical basis for using <i>k</i>-mer spectra with relatively small values of <i>k</i> (on the order of 4-5). They are also useful for analysts who wish to know more of the properties of any method based on <i>k</i>-mer spectra and provide insight into one class of phylogenetically-informed <i>β</i>-diversity measures.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1010820">Over-optimism in unsupervised microbiome analysis: Insights from network learning and clustering</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Theresa Ullmann, Stefanie Peschel, Philipp Finger, Christian L. Müller, Anne-Laure Boulesteix</p>

In recent years, unsupervised analysis of microbiome data, such as microbial network analysis and clustering, has increased in popularity. Many new statistical and computational methods have been proposed for these tasks. This multiplicity of analysis strategies poses a challenge for researchers, who are often unsure which method(s) to use and might be tempted to try different methods on their dataset to look for the “best” ones. However, if only the best results are selectively reported, this may cause over-optimism: the “best” method is overly fitted to the specific dataset, and the results might be non-replicable on validation data. Such effects will ultimately hinder research progress. Yet so far, these topics have been given little attention in the context of unsupervised microbiome analysis. In our illustrative study, we aim to quantify over-optimism effects in this context. We model the approach of a hypothetical microbiome researcher who undertakes four unsupervised research tasks: clustering of bacterial genera, hub detection in microbial networks, differential microbial network analysis, and clustering of samples. While these tasks are unsupervised, the researcher might still have certain expectations as to what constitutes interesting results. We translate these expectations into concrete evaluation criteria that the hypothetical researcher might want to optimize. We then randomly split an exemplary dataset from the American Gut Project into discovery and validation sets multiple times. For each research task, multiple method combinations (e.g., methods for data normalization, network generation, and/or clustering) are tried on the discovery data, and the combination that yields the best result according to the evaluation criterion is chosen. While the hypothetical researcher might only report this result, we also apply the “best” method combination to the validation dataset. The results are then compared between discovery and validation data. In all four research tasks, there are notable over-optimism effects; the results on the validation data set are worse compared to the discovery data, averaged over multiple random splits into discovery/validation data. Our study thus highlights the importance of validation and replication in microbiome analysis to obtain reliable results and demonstrates that the issue of over-optimism goes beyond the context of statistical testing and fishing for significance.

                <p>by Sebastian Sten, Henrik Podéus, Nicolas Sundqvist, Fredrik Elinder, Maria Engström, Gunnar Cedersund</p>

Neurons regulate the activity of blood vessels through the neurovascular coupling (NVC). A detailed understanding of the NVC is critical for understanding data from functional imaging techniques of the brain. Many aspects of the NVC have been studied both experimentally and using mathematical models; various combinations of blood volume and flow, local field potential (LFP), hemoglobin level, blood oxygenation level-dependent response (BOLD), and optogenetics have been measured and modeled in rodents, primates, or humans. However, these data have not been brought together into a unified quantitative model. We now present a mathematical model that describes all such data types and that preserves mechanistic behaviors between experiments. For instance, from modeling of optogenetics and microscopy data in mice, we learn cell-specific contributions; the first rapid dilation in the vascular response is caused by NO-interneurons, the main part of the dilation during longer stimuli is caused by pyramidal neurons, and the post-peak undershoot is caused by NPY-interneurons. These insights are translated and preserved in all subsequent analyses, together with other insights regarding hemoglobin dynamics and the LFP/BOLD-interplay, obtained from other experiments on rodents and primates. The model can predict independent validation-data not used for training. By bringing together data with complementary information from different species, we both understand each dataset better, and have a basis for a new type of integrative analysis of human data.

                <p>by Nicola Catenacci Volpi, Martin Greaves, Dari Trendafilov, Christoph Salge, Giovanni Pezzulo, Daniel Polani</p>

The mastery of skills, such as balancing an inverted pendulum, implies a very accurate control of movements to achieve the task goals. Traditional accounts of skilled action control that focus on either routinization or perceptual control make opposite predictions about the ways we achieve mastery. The notion of routinization emphasizes the decrease of the variance of our actions, whereas the notion of perceptual control emphasizes the decrease of the variance of the states we visit, but not of the actions we execute. Here, we studied how participants managed control tasks of varying levels of difficulty, which consisted of controlling inverted pendulums of different lengths. We used information-theoretic measures to compare the predictions of alternative accounts that focus on routinization and perceptual control, respectively. Our results indicate that the successful performance of the control task strongly correlates with the decrease of state variability and the increase of action variability. As postulated by perceptual control theory, the mastery of skilled pendulum control consists in achieving stable control of goals by flexible means.

                <p>by Jason Asher, Annabelle Lemenuel-Diot, Matthew Clay, David P. Durham, Luis Mier-y-Teran-Romero, Carlos J. Arguello, Sebastien Jolivet, Diana Y. Wong, Klaus Kuhlbusch, Barry Clinch, Jean-Eric Charoin</p>

To aid understanding of the effect of antiviral treatment on population-level influenza transmission, we used a novel pharmacokinetic–viral kinetic transmission model to test the correlation between nasal viral load and infectiousness, and to evaluate the impact that timing of treatment with the antivirals oseltamivir or baloxavir has on influenza transmission. The model was run under three candidate profiles whereby infectiousness was assumed to be proportional to viral titer on a natural-scale, log-scale, or dose–response model. Viral kinetic profiles in the presence and absence of antiviral treatment were compared for each individual (N = 1000 simulated individuals); subsequently, viral transmission mitigation was calculated. The predicted transmission mitigation was greater with earlier administration of antiviral treatment, and with baloxavir versus oseltamivir. When treatment was initiated 12–24 hours post symptom onset, the predicted transmission mitigation was 39.9–56.4% for baloxavir and 26.6–38.3% for oseltamivir depending on the infectiousness profile. When treatment was initiated 36–48 hours post symptom onset, the predicted transmission mitigation decreased to 0.8–28.3% for baloxavir and 0.8–19.9% for oseltamivir. Model estimates were compared with clinical data from the BLOCKSTONE post-exposure prophylaxis study, which indicated the log-scale model for infectiousness best fit the observed data and that baloxavir affords greater reductions in secondary case rates compared with neuraminidase inhibitors. These findings suggest a role for baloxavir and oseltamivir in reducing influenza transmission when treatment is initiated within 48 hours of symptom onset in the index patient.

The relationship between neuronal activity and computations embodied by it remains an open question. We develop a novel methodology that condenses observed neuronal activity into a quantitatively accurate, simple, and interpretable model and validate it on diverse systems and scales from single neurons in <i>C. elegans</i> to fMRI in humans. The model treats neuronal activity as collections of interlocking 1-dimensional trajectories. Despite their simplicity, these models accurately predict future neuronal activity and future decisions made by human participants. Moreover, the structure formed by interconnected trajectories—a scaffold—is closely related to the computational strategy of the system. We use these scaffolds to compare the computational strategy of primates and artificial systems trained on the same task to identify specific conditions under which the artificial agent learns the same strategy as the primate. The computational strategy extracted using our methodology predicts specific errors on novel stimuli. These results show that our methodology is a powerful tool for studying the relationship between computation and neuronal activity across diverse systems.

                <p>by Junping Li, Lin Gao, Yusen Ye</p>

Structural variations (SVs) play an essential role in the evolution of human genomes and are associated with cancer genetics and rare disease. High-throughput chromosome capture (Hi-C) technology probed all genome-wide crosslinked chromatin to study the spatial architecture of chromosomes. Hi-C read pairs can span megabases, making the technology useful for detecting large-scale SVs. So far, the identification of SVs from Hi-C data is still in the early stages with only a few methods available. Especially, no algorithm has been developed that can detect SVs without control samples. Therefore, we developed HiSV (Hi-C for Structural Variation), a control-free method for identifying large-scale SVs from a Hi-C sample. Inspired by the single image saliency detection model, HiSV constructed a saliency map of interaction frequencies and extracted saliency segments as large-scale SVs. By evaluating both simulated and real data, HiSV not only detected all variant types, but also achieved a higher level of accuracy and sensitivity than existing methods. Moreover, our results on cancer cell lines showed that HiSV effectively detected eight complex SV events and identified two novel SVs of key factors associated with cancer development. Finally, we found that integrating the result of HiSV helped the WGS method to identify a total number of 94 novel SVs in two cancer cell lines.

                <p>by Souvik Seal, Qunhua Li, Elle Butler Basner, Laura M. Saba, Katerina Kechris</p>

Inferring gene co-expression networks is a useful process for understanding gene regulation and pathway activity. The networks are usually undirected graphs where genes are represented as nodes and an edge represents a significant co-expression relationship. When expression data of multiple (<i>p</i>) genes in multiple (<i>K</i>) conditions (e.g., treatments, tissues, strains) are available, joint estimation of networks harnessing shared information across them can significantly increase the power of analysis. In addition, examining condition-specific patterns of co-expression can provide insights into the underlying cellular processes activated in a particular condition. Condition adaptive fused graphical lasso (CFGL) is an existing method that incorporates condition specificity in a fused graphical lasso (FGL) model for estimating multiple co-expression networks. However, with computational complexity of <i>O</i>(<i>p</i><sup>2</sup><i>K</i> log <i>K</i>), the current implementation of CFGL is prohibitively slow even for a moderate number of genes and can only be used for a maximum of three conditions. In this paper, we propose a faster alternative of CFGL named rapid condition adaptive fused graphical lasso (RCFGL). In RCFGL, we incorporate the condition specificity into another popular model for joint network estimation, known as fused multiple graphical lasso (FMGL). We use a more efficient algorithm in the iterative steps compared to CFGL, enabling faster computation with complexity of <i>O</i>(<i>p</i><sup>2</sup><i>K</i>) and making it easily generalizable for more than three conditions. We also present a novel screening rule to determine if the full network estimation problem can be broken down into estimation of smaller disjoint sub-networks, thereby reducing the complexity further. We demonstrate the computational advantage and superior performance of our method compared to two non-condition adaptive methods, FGL and FMGL, and one condition adaptive method, CFGL in both simulation study and real data analysis. We used RCFGL to jointly estimate the gene co-expression networks in different brain regions (conditions) using a cohort of heterogeneous stock rats. We also provide an accommodating <i>C</i> and <i>Python</i> based package that implements RCFGL.

                Background: The number of Tuberculosis (TB) cases or deaths is declining, however, the rate of decline is not adequate to meet the World Health Organization's (WHO's) mitigation. TB remains a public health problem in Ghana with a significant economic and health burden on its citizens and health care system.  Consequently, there is a need for further studies about the disease aimed at accelerating the rate of decline in cases. Methods:  The spatio-temporal characteristics of TB in Ghana using Bayesian spatial and spatio-temporal regression models was analysed in this study. Data were obtained from Ghana National Tuberculosis Programme (NTP) for the 10 regions of Ghana, collected over a six-year period. The study also examines some baseline predictors of TB infections to ascertain their effects on the TB risk across the ten regions in Ghana. Results: Hot-spots of TB cases are observed in the Upper East, Upper West, Volta, Western, and Central regions and low risk in the Northern, Ashanti, Greater Accra, Brong Ahafo, Eastern and Western regions. The results indicated a clustering of risk between neighboring regions. TB cure rate, TB success rate, knowledge about TB, awareness that TB is airborne, HIV prevalence, percentage of literacy, and high income are important predictors of  detection for this disease across the ten regions of Ghana. Conclusion: Most regions in Ghana have similar TB risks. A substantial reduction in TB cases  requires measures that will increase  detection, success and cure rates, awareness, knowledge about how this disease spreads as well adequate health facilities with easy access.

                Background: 3D-printing has shown potential in several medical advances because of its ability to create patient-specific surgical models and instruments. In fact, this technology makes it possible to acquire and study physical models that accurately reproduce patient-specific anatomy. The challenge is to apply 3D-printing to reproduce the porous structure of a bone tissue, consisting of compact bone, spongy bone and bone marrow. Methods: An interesting approach is presented here for reproducing the structure of a bone tissue of a femur by 3D-printing porous structure. Through the process of CT segmentation, the distribution of bone density was analysed. In 3D-printing, the bone density was compared with the density of infill. Results: The zone of compact bone, the zone of spongy bone and the zone of bone marrow can be recognized in the 3D printed model by a porous density additive manufacturing method. Conclusions: The application of 3D-printing to reproduce a porous structure, such as that of a bone, makes it possible to obtain physical anatomical models that likely represent the internal structure of a bone tissue. This process is low cost and easily reproduced.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/12-16/v1?src=rss">Study protocol for a systematic review of the social determinants of mental health and well-being of older migrants aged 50 years and above [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Migration is a milestone event in a person’s life, bringing with it the challenges of settling down in an unfamiliar environment. The age at which migration takes place and the way migrants negotiate their old and new world significantly impacts their mental health. Thus, this systematic review seeks to analyse and summarize existing research detailing the contexts in which people migrate later in life and the associations between these contexts and social determinants of their mental health and well-being. Methods: Seven databases including PsycINFO, Web of Science, PubMed, Applied Social Sciences Index, Abstracts: ASSIA, Ageline, CINAHL, and Informit will be searched systematically for original journal articles published in English. In the first screening stage, the first reviewer (PB) will screen all titles and abstracts and mark all potentially eligible texts for full-text screening. The second reviewer (HM) will review the decisions made. Any potential conflicts will be resolved with discussion. Afterward, full texts of potentially eligible studies will be assessed for eligibility by two reviewers (PB and HM). The methodological quality (or risk of bias) of individual studies will be appraised using the Mixed Method Appraisal Tool. The thematic synthesis of the data will be performed using a hybrid approach incorporating deductive (framed against the social determinants of health using intersectionality as a lens) and inductive data-driven processes. The review protocol was registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) (Reg: CRD42022359881).

                Hearing in mammals is characterised by a greatly expanded hearing frequency range and enhanced frequency tuning. Comparative studies, both within mammals and alongside other vertebrate clades have greatly enhanced our knowledge about its evolutionary and developmental origins, morphological and functional features. The auditory system shares its evolutionary and developmental histories with the vestibular and lateral line systems, all of which rely on sensory hair cells for the detection of mechanical stimuli [1].

                Using cross-species screens, Kim et al. identified 11 genes that when knocked down decrease tau in the mouse brain. Furthermore, they showed that adult knockdown of USP7, RNF130, and RNF149 in a tauopathy mouse model rescued the disease phenotypes. Mechanistic studies revealed that these three genes regulate tau by counteracting the C terminus of Hsc70-interacting protein (CHIP)-mediated tau ubiquitination.

                Afferents of peripheral mechanoreceptors innervate the skin of vertebrates, where they detect physical touch via mechanically gated ion channels (mechanotransducers). While the afferent terminal is generally understood to be the primary site of mechanotransduction, the functional properties of mechanically activated (MA) ionic current generated by mechanotransducers at this location remain obscure. Until now, direct evidence of MA current and mechanically induced action potentials in the mechanoreceptor terminal has not been obtained. Here, we report patch-clamp recordings from the afferent terminal innervating Grandry (Meissner) corpuscles in the bill skin of a tactile specialist duck. We show that mechanical stimulation evokes MA current in the afferent with fast kinetics of activation and inactivation during the dynamic phases of the mechanical stimulus. These responses trigger rapidly adapting firing in the afferent detected at the terminal and in the afferent fiber outside of the corpuscle. Our findings elucidate the initial electrogenic events of touch detection in the mechanoreceptor nerve terminal.

                Spatial frequency (SF) is an important attribute in the visual scene and is a defining feature of visual processing channels. However, there remain many unsolved questions about how extrastriate areas in primate visual cortex codes this fundamental information. Here, using intrinsic signal optical imaging in visual areas of V2 and V4 of macaque monkeys, we quantify the relationship between SF maps and (1) visual topography and (2) color and orientation maps. We find that in orientation regions, low to high SF is mapped orthogonally to orientation; in color regions, which are reported to contain orthogonal axes of color and lightness, low spatial frequencies (SFs) tend to be represented more frequently than high SFs. This supports a population-based SF fluctuation related to the 'color/orientation' organizations. We propose a generalized hypercolumn model across cortical areas, comprised of two orthogonal parameters with additional parameters.

">The Cortical Representation of Language Timescales is Shared between Reading and Listening</a></h4>

              
                Natural language comprehension is thought to involve the integration of low-level sensory representations into a hierarchy of increasingly high-level representations. To investigate whether in the human brain the same pathways are used to integrate both written and spoken language, we tested whether brain representations of this hierarchy are shared between written and spoken language comprehension. Different levels of the language hierarchy were operationally defined as timescales, where each timescale refers to the spectral components of a language stimulus that vary over a certain number of words. Voxelwise encoding models were used to determine how different language timescales are represented across the cerebral cortex, for each modality separately. The encoding models were estimated with fMRI BOLD data that were recorded while participants read and listened to the same set of natural language narratives in each modality (Huth et al. 2016, Deniz et al. 2019). These models reveal that the topographic organization of language timescale representations across the cortical surface is highly similar between the two modalities. Our results suggest that brain representations of language timescales are largely independent of stimulus modality.

">D-type K+ current controls the function of electrically coupled neurons in a species-specific fashion</a></h4>

              
                Electrical synapses supported by gap junctions, are known to form networks of electrically coupled neurons in many regions of the mammalian brain, where they play relevant functional roles. Yet, how electrical coupling support sophisticated network operations, and the contribution of the intrinsic electrophysiological properties of neurons to these operations, remains incompletely understood. Here, comparative analysis of electrically coupled mesencephalic trigeminal (MesV) neurons, uncovered remarkable difference in the operation of these networks in highly related species. While spiking of MesV neurons might support the recruitment of coupled cells in rats, this rarely occurs in mice. Using whole-cell recordings, we determined that the higher efficacy in postsynaptic recruitment in rat's MesV neurons does not result from coupling strength of larger magnitude, but instead from the higher excitability of coupled neurons. Consistently, MesV neurons from rats present a lower threshold current for activation, more hyperpolarized firing level as well as a higher ability to generate repetitive discharges, in comparison to their counterparts from mice. This difference in neuronal excitability results from a significantly higher magnitude of the D-type K+ current (ID) in MesV neurons from mice, indicating that the expression level of this current gates the recruitment of postsynaptic coupled neurons. Since MesV neurons are primary afferents critically involved in the organization of orofacial behaviors, such mechanism might support lateral excitation, by which activation of single neurons at the periphery can spread to coupled partners. Thus, by amplifying sensory inputs, lateral excitation may significantly contribute to information processing and organization of motor outputs.

">Somatostatin-expressing neurons in the ventral tegmental area innervate specific forebrain regions and are involved in the stress response</a></h4>

              
                Expanding knowledge about the cellular composition of subcortical brain regions demonstrates large heterogeneity and differences from the cortical architecture. Recently, we described three subtypes of somatostatin-expressing (Sst) neurons in the mouse ventral tegmental area (VTA) and showed their local inhibitory action on the neighbouring dopaminergic neurons (Nagaeva et al., 2020). Here, we report that VTA Sst neurons also project far outside the VTA and innervate several forebrain regions that are mainly involved in the regulation of emotional behaviour. When we deleted these VTA Sst neurons several behaviours and drug effects were affected, such as home cage activity, sensitization of locomotor activity to morphine, fear conditioning responses, and reactions to inescapable stress of forced swimming, often in a sex-dependent manner. Interestingly, the majority of these Sst projecting neurons was found to express Vglut2 and Th, but not Dat. Together, these data demonstrate that VTA Sst neurons have their selective projection targets, which are distinct from the main targets of VTA dopamine neurons and involved in the regulation of a variety of behaviours mostly associated with the stress response. This, in turn, makes these VTA neurons a meaningful addition to the somatostatinergic system of the brain.

">Neural characterization of the "totonou" state associated with sauna use</a></h4>

              
                Saunas are becoming increasingly popular worldwide, being an activity that promotes relaxation and health. Intense feelings of happiness have been reported shortly after enjoying a hot sauna and cold water, what is known in Japan as the "totonou" state. However, no research has investigated what occurs in the brain during the "totonou" state. In the present study, participants underwent a sauna phase, consisting of three sets of alternating hot sauna, cold water, and rest. We elucidated changes in brain activity and mood in the "totonou" state by measuring and comparing brain activity and emotional scales before and after the sauna phase and during the rest phase in each set. We found significant increases in theta and alpha power during rest and after the sauna phase compared to before the sauna phase. Moreover, in an auditory oddball task, the p300 amplitude decreased significantly and MMN amplitude increased significantly after the sauna phase. The increase in MMN indicates higher activation of the pre-attentional auditory process, leading to a decrease in attention-related brain activity P300. Hence, the brain reaches in a more efficient state. Further, the response time in behavioral tasks decreased significantly. In addition, the participants' subjective responses to the questionnaire showed significant changes in physical relaxation and other indicators after being in the sauna. Finally, we developed an artificial intelligence classifier, obtaining an average accuracy of brain state classification of 88.34%. The results have potential for future application.

">Thermodynamic limitations on brain oxygen metabolism: physiological implications</a></h4>

              
                A recent hypothesis is that maintaining the brain tissue ratio of O2 to CO2 is critical for preserving the entropy increase available from oxidative metabolism of glucose, with a fall of that available entropy leading to a reduction of the phosphorylation potential and impairment of brain energy metabolism. The hypothesis suggests that physiological responses under different conditions can be understood as preserving tissue O2/CO2. To test this idea, a mathematical model of O2 and CO2 transport was used to calculate how well different physiological responses maintain tissue O2/CO2, showing good agreement with reported experimental measurements for increased neural activity, hypercapnia and hypoxia. The results highlight the importance of thinking about brain blood flow as a way to modulate tissue O2/CO2, rather than simply in terms of O2 delivery to the capillary bed. The hypoxia modeling focused on humans at high altitude, including acclimatized lowlanders and adapted populations, with a primary finding that decreasing CO2 by increasing ventilation rate is much more effective for preserving tissue O2/CO2 than increasing blood hemoglobin content. The modeling provides a new framework and perspective for understanding how blood flow and other physiological factors support energy metabolism in the brain under a wide range of conditions.

">Cortical projection to the pedunculopontine nucleus subpopulation for the Go/STOP signal modulation of muscle tone and locomotion</a></h4>

              
                The pedunculopontine nucleus is a central actor of motor control with functions at the level of the Basal Ganglia and the Spinal cord and can modulate ongoing behavior as well as movement execution. Physiologically, the PPN is a heterogeneous nucleus, and these disparities can explain the functional outcome of deep brain stimulation in Parkinson's patients. Here, we revealed two individually distributed populations of glutamatergic neurons acting as the only known subcortical bidirectional interface between the Basal Ganglia and the Spinal cord. These subpopulations are under the control of direct cortical inputs from the primary motor cortex, that participate in the PPN microcircuitry to modulate muscle tones, locomotion, and balance. Thus, our data, for the first time revealed a subdivision within the PPN anatomy that is anatomically, physiologically, and functionally separated and could provide the first evidence for a symptoms-based approach in deep brain stimulations.

">An entorhinal-like region in food-caching birds</a></h4>

              
                The mammalian entorhinal cortex routes inputs from diverse sources into the hippocampus. This information is mixed and expressed in the activity of many specialized entorhinal cell types, which are considered indispensable for hippocampal function. However, functionally similar hippocampi exist even in non-mammals that lack an obvious entorhinal cortex, or generally any layered cortex. To address this dilemma, we mapped extrinsic hippocampal connections in chickadees, whose hippocampi are used for remembering numerous food caches. We found a well-delineated structure in these birds that is topologically similar to the entorhinal cortex and interfaces between the hippocampus and other pallial regions. Recordings of this structure revealed entorhinal-like activity, including border and multi-field grid-like cells. These cells were localized to the subregion predicted by anatomical mapping to match the dorsomedial entorhinal cortex. Our findings uncover an anatomical and physiological equivalence of vastly different brains, suggesting a fundamental nature of entorhinal-like computations for hippocampal function.

	<p>Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a serious global risk factor leading to the onset of cognitive impairment and neurodegenerative diseases. Cognitive and memory impairment following a TBI is associated with the dysregulation of cholinergic neurotransmission in the brains of subjects. The extent of memory impairment following a TBI is linked with the sex of the subject. This study aimed to identify the sex-dimorphic role of muscarinic cholinergic modulation in neurological functioning and episodic memory retrieval in a mouse model of TBI. Balb/c mice were divided into four groups of males and four groups of females (i.e., Sham, TBI, TBI + Scopolamine 1 mg/kg, and TBI + Donepezil 1 mg/kg). After training with the Morris water maze test and fear conditioning, all groups were subjected to brain injury (7.84 &amp;amp;times; 10&amp;amp;minus;5 J impact force) except for the Sham mice. Following brain injury, scopolamine or donepezil was administered to the respective groups for 5 days. Acute scopolamine immediately after brain trauma showed a neuroprotective effect in the males only, while subchronic donepezil significantly impaired neurological functioning in both sexes. Subchronic scopolamine and donepezil treatment reversed the TBI-induced retrograde amnesia for spatial memory in male mice. Contextual fear memory retrieval was not affected by the TBI and treatments in both sexes. Thus, we concluded that the sex-dimorphic response of the muscarinic receptors in TBI-induced memory impairment depends on the type of memory. This study highlights the potential for therapeutic modalities in TBI subjects.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Understanding the neuronal composition of the brains of dinosaurs and other fossil amniotes would offer fundamental insight into their behavioral and cognitive capabilities, but brain tissue is only rarely fossilized. However, when the bony brain case is preserved, the volume and therefore mass of the brain can be estimated with computer tomography; and if the scaling relationship between brain mass and numbers of neurons for the clade is known, that relationship can be applied to estimate the neuronal composition of the brain. Using a recently published database of numbers of neurons in the telencephalon of extant sauropsids (birds, squamates, and testudines), here I show that the neuronal scaling rules that apply to these animals can be used to infer the numbers of neurons that composed the telencephalon of dinosaur, pterosaur, and other fossil sauropsid species. The key to inferring numbers of telencephalic neurons in these species is first using the relationship between their estimated brain and body mass to determine whether bird-like (endothermic) or squamate-like (ectothermic) rules apply to each fossil sauropsid species. This procedure shows that the notion of “mesothermy” in dinosaurs is an artifact due to the mixing of animals with bird-like and squamate-like scaling, and indicates that theropods such as <i>Tyrannosaurus</i> and <i>Allosaurus</i> were endotherms with baboon- and monkey-like numbers of telencephalic neurons, respectively, which would make these animals not only giant but also long-lived and endowed with flexible cognition, and thus even more magnificent predators than previously thought.</p>

                Background: We live in a time where traditional education has rapidly incorporated online modalities due to the recent SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) safety measures such as social distancing. Regardless of these challenges, health education constantly strives to implement the best technologies available for an effective student deep learning outcome. Virtual (VR) and augmented reality (AR) in the dental pre-clinical stage may help stimulate students to better understand the foundation material prescribed in the curriculum. Most visual material available for students is still mainly based on 2D graphics. Thus, this study will attempt to evaluate the students' perceptions about implementing VR/AR technologies in the learning setting. Methods: A single-group pretest-posttest design will be implemented where students will be exposed to VR/AR and fill out two questionnaires, one before and one after the exposure. Conclusions: This project is intended to start once the institutional ethical approval is obtained. It is expected that the analysis from the current project will provide recommendations to improve the students' academic curriculum pre-clinical experience. The recommendations will be provided in the form of at least three scientific publications, with one publication for each subject area intended to be evaluated (i.e., head and neck anatomy, dental anatomy, and removable prosthodontics).

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Injuries to peripheral nerves are frequent, yet no drug therapies are available for effective nerve repair. The slow growth rate of axons and inadequate access to growth factors challenge natural repair of nerves. A better understanding of the molecules that can promote the rate of axon growth may reveal therapeutic opportunities. Molecular profiling of injured neurons at early intervals of injury, when regeneration is at the maximum, has been the gold standard for exploring growth promoters. A complementary <I>in vitro</I> regenerative priming model was recently shown to induce enhanced outgrowth in adult sensory neurons. In this work, we exploited the <I>in vitro</I> priming model to reveal novel candidates for adult nerve regeneration. We performed a whole-tissue proteomics analysis of the <I>in vitro</I> primed dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) from adult SD rats and compared their molecular profile with that of the <I>in vivo</I> primed, and control DRGs. The proteomics data generated are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD031927. From the follow-up analysis, Bioinformatics interventions, and literature curation, we identified several molecules that were differentially expressed in the primed DRGs with a potential to modulate adult nerve regrowth. We then validated the growth promoting roles of mesencephalic astrocyte-derived neurotrophic factor (MANF), one of the hits we identified, in adult rat sensory neurons. Overall, in this study, we explored two growth priming paradigm and shortlisted several candidates, and validated MANF, as potential targets for adult nerve regeneration. We also demonstrate that the <I>in vitro</I> priming model is a valid tool for adult nerve regeneration studies.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Long-term memory formation requires anterograde transport of proteins from the soma of a neuron to its distal synaptic terminals. This allows new synaptic connections to be grown and existing ones remodeled. However, we do not yet know which proteins are transported to synapses in response to activity and temporal regulation. Here, using quantitative mass spectrometry, we have profiled anterograde protein cargos of a learning-regulated molecular motor protein kinesin [<I>Aplysia</I> kinesin heavy chain 1 (ApKHC1)] following short-term sensitization (STS) and long-term sensitization (LTS) in <I>Aplysia californica</I>. Our results reveal enrichment of specific proteins associated with ApKHC1 following both STS and LTS, as well as temporal changes within 1 and 3 h of LTS training. A significant number of proteins enriched in the ApKHC1 complex participate in synaptic function, and, while some are ubiquitously enriched across training conditions, a few are enriched in response to specific training. For instance, factors aiding new synapse formation, such as synaptotagmin-1, dynamin-1, and calmodulin, are differentially enriched in anterograde complexes 1 h after LTS but are depleted 3 h after LTS. Proteins including gelsolin-like protein 2 and sec23A/sec24A, which function in actin filament stabilization and vesicle transport, respectively, are enriched in cargos 3 h after LTS. These results establish that the composition of anterograde transport complexes undergo experience-dependent specific changes and illuminate dynamic changes in the communication between soma and synapse during learning.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>The ability to interrogate specific representations in the brain, determining how, and where, difference sources of information are instantiated can provide invaluable insight into neural functioning. Pattern component modeling (PCM) is a recent analytic technique for human neuroimaging that allows the decomposition of representational patterns in brain into contributing subcomponents. In the current study, we present a novel PCM variant that tracks the contribution of prespecified representational patterns to brain representation across areas, thus allowing hypothesis-guided employment of the technique. We apply this technique to investigate the contributions of hedonic and nonhedonic information to the neural representation of tactile experience. We applied aversive pressure (AP) and appetitive brush (AB) to stimulate distinct peripheral nerve pathways for tactile information (C-/CT-fibers, respectively) while patients underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanning. We performed representational similarity analyses (RSAs) with pattern component modeling to dissociate how discriminatory versus hedonic tactile information contributes to population code representations in the human brain. Results demonstrated that information about appetitive and aversive tactile sensation is represented separately from nonhedonic tactile information across cortical structures. This also demonstrates the potential of new hypothesis-guided PCM variants to help delineate how information is instantiated in the brain.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/10-1145/v2?src=rss">Nutrient dynamics in water and soil under conventional rice cultivation in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background The evaluation of nutrient variability plays a crucial role in accessing soil potentials and practical intervention responses in rice production systems. Synthetic fertilizer applications and cultivation practices are considered key factors affecting nutrient dynamics and availability. Here, we assessed the nutrient dynamics in surface, subsurface water and soil under local water management and conventional rice cultivation practices in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta. Methods We implemented a field experiment (200 m  2) in the 2018 wet season and the 2019 dry season in a triple rice-cropping field. Surface water, subsurface water (30–45 cm), and topsoil (0–20 cm) were collected eight samples during the rice-growing seasons to clarify its nutrient dynamic. Results The results showed that N-NH  4 +, P-PO  4 3- and total P peaks were achieved after fertilizing. Irrespective of seasons, the nutrient content in surface water was always greater than that of subsurface water ( P<0.001), with the exception of N-NO  3 -, no significant difference was disclosed ( P>0.05). When comparing the wet and dry seasons, nutrient concentrations exhibited minor differences ( P>0.05). Under conventional rice cultivation, the effects of synthetic fertilizer topdressing on the total N, soil organic matter (SOM), and total P were negligible in the soil. Higher rates of N fertilizer application did not significantly increase soil N-NH  4 +, total N, yet larger P fertilizer amounts substantially enhanced soil total P ( P<0.001). Conclusions Under conventional rice cultivation, the low concentration of N-NH  4 +, P-PO  4 3- and total P in the subsurface water indicated that nutrient losses mainly occur through runoff rather than leaching. Notably, nutrient content in soil was fairly high, whilst SOM was varied from low to medium between seasons. Future work should consider the nutrient balance and nutrient dynamic simulation on surface and subsurface.

                Aims and objectives: Purpose of this study is to detect the presence of SAR-CoV-2 viral RNA in conjunctival secretions of COVID-19 patients and to compare the RT-PCR positivity rate for SARS-CoV-2 in conjunctival and nasopharyngeal swab. Materials and method: Eighty hospitalised COVID-19 patients whose nasopharyngeal swab tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR were included in the study. Conjunctival swab was collected from eyes of these patients and sent for detection of SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR method. Results: Among the eighty patients, 51 (63.7%) were males and 29 (36.3%) were females. The mean age of the patients was 55.93 ± 16.59. Six patients had ocular manifestations. Eleven (13.75%) patients tested positive on conjunctival swab for SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA and only one of them had ocular manifestations out of the eleven. Conclusion: In our study the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in conjunctival secretions of COVID-19 patients was detected and this was not dependent on presence of ocular manifestations or duration of disease. Though the conjunctival positivity is lower compared to the nasopharyngeal swab sampling, ocular surface and secretions can be a potential route of viral transmission.

                Background:  The annual incidence and mortality rates of pancreatic cancer has been rising. We analyzed pancreatic cancer trends by demographics and geographic location. Methods:  Data was obtained from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registry 17 were available to assess trends of pancreatic cancer incidence and mortality from 2000 to 2019. Results:  The pancreatic cancer incidence and mortality rates consistently increased over time from 2000 to 2019. Incidence of pancreatic cancer was highest in males (14; 95% Cl, 13.9,14.1) and blacks (15.4 95% Cl,15.2, 15.6). The incidence was highest in Alaska (16.2; 95% Cl, 14.1, 18.5), and lowest in Utah (10.7; 95% Cl, 10.4, 11.0). Incidence increased at 0.85% per year (95% Cl, 0.76, 0.92; P < .001). Overall incidence increased significantly for all sex, race, stage sub-groups except for Blacks (APC of 0.04%; 95% Cl, -0.14, 0.22; P = 0.649), and American Indian/Alaska natives (APC of -0.22 %; 95% Cl, -1.33, 0.89; P= 0.679). There was an overall significant increase in incidence across all states except for Alaska. Incidence-based mortality of pancreatic cancer was highest in males (12.6; 95% Cl, 12.5,12.7) and blacks (14.1; 95% Cl, 13.9, 14.3). Mortality was highest in Alaska (15.1; 95% Cl, 13.1,17.3), and lowest in Utah (9.6; 95% Cl, 9.3,9.9). Mortality increased at 0.91% per year (95% Cl, 0.32, 1.50; P = .005). The overall incidence-based mortality increased significantly only in the males APC, 0.95% (95% Cl, 0.36, 1.54; P = 0.003), females APC 1.18 (95% Cl, 0.47, 1.89; P = 0.002) and whites APC 1.05% (95% Cl, 0.45, 1.66; P = 0.002). Furthermore, there was an overall significant increase in incidence-based mortality across all states except for Alaska, Hawaii and Washington. Conclusion: Pancreatic cancer incidence and mortality rates increased overall but differed by demographics and geographic location.

                Background: Glaucoma and diabetic retinopathy are the leading causes of blindness due to an irreversible damage to the retina which results in vision loss. Early detection of these diseases through regular screening is especially important to prevent progression. The image of retinal fundus is the main evaluating strategy for the glaucoma and diabetic retinopathy detection. Then, automated eye disease detection is an important application of retinal image analysis. Compared with classical diagnostic techniques, image classification by convolutional neural networks (CNN) have the potential for better cost-effective performance. Methods: In this paper, we propose the use of MATLAB – retrained AlexNet CNN for computerized eye diseases identification, particularly glaucoma and diabetic retinopathy, by employing retinal fundus images. The acquisition of the database was carried out through free access databases and access upon request. A transfer learning technique is used for retraining the AlexNet CNN. Specifically, the model divides the fundus image dataset into training and testing data. Results: As datasets were added by network training, different values were reported for validation accuracy, false positives and false negatives, precision, and recall. Thus, having NetTransfer I with a validation accuracy value of 94.3% for two classes. NetTransfer II with a validation accuracy value of 91.8% for two classes. NetTransfer III with a validation accuracy value of 89.7% for three classes. Net transfer IV with a validation accuracy value of 93.1% for three classes. Finally, NetTransfer V with a validation accuracy value of 92.1% for three classes. Conclusions: Re-training of the AlexNet network proved to be a powerful tool to create disease detection systems having high accuracy values and being able to discern between more than two diseases.

                Background: Genetic mutations cause 50-75% of congenital deafness. Congenital deafness is a disease divided into syndromic and non-syndromic types. Type B special schools facilitate children with deafness in Surabaya. This study aimed to identify a mutation gene that causes non-syndromic hearing impairment in school students. Methods: This research was an analytic observational study using a cross-sectional method applying simple random sampling of non-syndromic deaf children. The applied tests were pure tone audiometry, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and hybridization tests. Subjects were evaluated on the pedigree route and then analyzed. Results: A total of 138 participants with non-syndromic hearing loss were enrolled in this study and 49 patients met the inclusion criteria. The subject’s average age was 16.16 years, with more male subjects than female.  The hybridization results obtained six genetic mutations, one subject with mtDNA 1555, one subject with GJB2-299, two subjects with SLC26A4-IVS(7)2, and 3 subjects with unknown mutations. In pedigree analysis, the same genetic mutation was found in two generations of subjects with mtDNA 1555 and GJB2-299 mutations, and mutations of more than one genetic type were found in two generations of subjects with the SLC26A4-IVS(7)2 mutation. Conclusions: This study obtained six genetic mutations in non-syndromic congenital deaf children. Non-syndromic congenital deafness in Indonesia was found to have genetic mutations as a health risk. The risk was heredity with diverse inheritance patterns.

                Background: As the most abundant coffee by-product, cascara pulp has been considered a good source of antioxidants which could be used to prevent photoaging. The aim of this study was to determine the phytometabolite profiles, antioxidant and photoaging properties of the ethanolic extract of Coffea arabica cascara pulp. Methods: Ethanolic maceration was performed on the fine powder of C. arabica cascara pulp collected from Gayo Highland, Aceh Province, Indonesia. The filtrate obtained was evaluated for its 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) scavenging activity, total phenolic content (TPC), and total flavonoid content (TFC). The phytometabolite profiling was conducted qualitatively using reagents and quantitatively using gas chromatography—mass spectroscopy (GC-MS). The potential of the cascara pulp phytometabolites in inhibiting activator protein-1 (AP-1) was evaluated through molecular docking. Results: The extract had TPC and TFC of 2.04 mg gallic acid equivalent/g extract and 91.81 mg quercetin equivalent/g extract, respectively. The half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) for the DPPH inhibition reached as low as 9.59 mg/L. Qualitative phytocompound screening revealed the presence of alkaloids, saponins, tannins, flavonoids, steroids, quinones, polyphenols, and triterpenoids. GC-MS revealed the extract containing 5-hydroxy-methylfurfural (22.31%); 2,5 dimethyl 4 hidroxy 3(2H) furanone (0.74%); and caffeine (21.07%), which could form interaction with AP-1 with binding energies of -172.8, -150.8, and -63.188 kJ/mol, respectively. Conclusion: Ethanolic extract from C. arabica cascara pulp potentially have anti-photoaging properties which is worthy for further investigations in the future.

                <p>by Davide Chicco, Rakesh Shiradkar</p>

Medical imaging is a great asset for modern medicine, since it allows physicians to spatially interrogate a disease site, resulting in precise intervention for diagnosis and treatment, and to observe particular aspect of patients’ conditions that otherwise would not be noticeable. Computational analysis of medical images, moreover, can allow the discovery of disease patterns and correlations among cohorts of patients with the same disease, thus suggesting common causes or providing useful information for better therapies and cures. Machine learning and deep learning applied to medical images, in particular, have produced new, unprecedented results that can pave the way to advanced frontiers of medical discoveries. While computational analysis of medical images has become easier, however, the possibility to make mistakes or generate inflated or misleading results has become easier, too, hindering reproducibility and deployment. In this article, we provide ten quick tips to perform computational analysis of medical images avoiding common mistakes and pitfalls that we noticed in multiple studies in the past. We believe our ten guidelines, if taken into practice, can help the computational–medical imaging community to perform better scientific research that eventually can have a positive impact on the lives of patients worldwide.

Open, reproducible, and replicable research practices are a fundamental part of science. Training is often organized on a grassroots level, offered by early career researchers, for early career researchers. Buffet style courses that cover many topics can inspire participants to try new things; however, they can also be overwhelming. Participants who want to implement new practices may not know where to start once they return to their research team. We describe ten simple rules to guide participants of relevant training courses in implementing robust research practices in their own projects, once they return to their research group. This includes (1) prioritizing and planning which practices to implement, which involves obtaining support and convincing others involved in the research project of the added value of implementing new practices; (2) managing problems that arise during implementation; and (3) making reproducible research and open science practices an integral part of a future research career. We also outline strategies that course organizers can use to prepare participants for implementation and support them during this process.

Knowledge of the cell-type-specific composition of the brain is useful in order to understand the role of each cell type as part of the network. Here, we estimated the composition of the whole cortex in terms of well characterized morphological and electrophysiological inhibitory neuron types (me-types). We derived probabilistic me-type densities from an existing atlas of molecularly defined cell-type densities in the mouse cortex. We used a well-established me-type classification from rat somatosensory cortex to populate the cortex. These me-types were well characterized morphologically and electrophysiologically but they lacked molecular marker identity labels. To extrapolate this missing information, we employed an additional dataset from the Allen Institute for Brain Science containing molecular identity as well as morphological and electrophysiological data for mouse cortical neurons. We first built a latent space based on a number of comparable morphological and electrical features common to both data sources. We then identified 19 morpho-electrical clusters that merged neurons from both datasets while being molecularly homogeneous. The resulting clusters best mirror the molecular identity classification solely using available morpho-electrical features. Finally, we stochastically assigned a molecular identity to a me-type neuron based on the latent space cluster it was assigned to. The resulting mapping was used to derive inhibitory me-types densities in the cortex.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3001961">Nutritional compensation of the circadian clock is a conserved process influenced by gene expression regulation and mRNA stability</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Christina M. Kelliher, Elizabeth-Lauren Stevenson, Jennifer J. Loros, Jay C. Dunlap</p>

Compensation is a defining principle of a true circadian clock, where its approximately 24-hour period length is relatively unchanged across environmental conditions. Known compensation effectors directly regulate core clock factors to buffer the oscillator’s period length from variables in the environment. Temperature Compensation mechanisms have been experimentally addressed across circadian model systems, but much less is known about the related process of Nutritional Compensation, where circadian period length is maintained across physiologically relevant nutrient levels. Using the filamentous fungus <i>Neurospora crassa</i>, we performed a genetic screen under glucose and amino acid starvation conditions to identify new regulators of Nutritional Compensation. Our screen uncovered 16 novel mutants, and together with 4 mutants characterized in prior work, a model emerges where Nutritional Compensation of the fungal clock is achieved at the levels of transcription, chromatin regulation, and mRNA stability. However, eukaryotic circadian Nutritional Compensation is completely unstudied outside of <i>Neurospora</i>. To test for conservation in cultured human cells, we selected top hits from our fungal genetic screen, performed siRNA knockdown experiments of the mammalian orthologs, and characterized the cell lines with respect to compensation. We find that the wild-type mammalian clock is also compensated across a large range of external glucose concentrations, as observed in <i>Neurospora</i>, and that knocking down the mammalian orthologs of the <i>Neurospora</i> compensation-associated genes <i>CPSF6</i> or <i>SETD2</i> in human cells also results in nutrient-dependent period length changes. We conclude that, like Temperature Compensation, Nutritional Compensation is a conserved circadian process in fungal and mammalian clocks and that it may share common molecular determinants.

                <p>by Han Hao, Rosmaliza Ramli, Caixue Wang, Chao Liu, Shihab Shah, Pierce Mullen, Varinder Lall, Frederick Jones, Jicheng Shao, Hailin Zhang, David B. Jaffe, Nikita Gamper, Xiaona Du</p>

Accumulating observations suggest that peripheral somatosensory ganglia may regulate nociceptive transmission, yet direct evidence is sparse. Here, in experiments on rats and mice, we show that the peripheral afferent nociceptive information in mice undergoes dynamic filtering within the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) and suggest that this filtering occurs at the axonal bifurcations (t-junctions). Using synchronous in vivo electrophysiological recordings from the peripheral and central processes of sensory neurons (in the spinal nerve and dorsal root), ganglionic transplantation of GABAergic progenitor cells, and optogenetics, we demonstrate existence of tonic and dynamic filtering of action potentials traveling through the DRG. Filtering induced by focal application of GABA or optogenetic GABA release from the DRG-transplanted GABAergic progenitor cells was specific to nociceptive fibers. Light-sheet imaging and computer modeling demonstrated that, compared to other somatosensory fiber types, nociceptors have shorter stem axons, making somatic control over t-junctional filtering more efficient. Optogenetically induced GABA release within DRG from the transplanted GABAergic cells enhanced filtering and alleviated hypersensitivity to noxious stimulation produced by chronic inflammation and neuropathic injury in vivo. These findings support “gating” of pain information by DRGs and suggest new therapeutic approaches for pain relief.

                <p>by Lydia Hadjeras, Marie Bouvier, Isabelle Canal, Leonora Poljak, Quentin Morin-Ogier, Carine Froment, Odile Burlet-Schlitz, Lina Hamouche, Laurence Girbal, Muriel Cocaign-Bousquet, Agamemnon J. Carpousis</p>

RNA processing and degradation shape the transcriptome by generating stable molecules that are necessary for translation (rRNA and tRNA) and by facilitating the turnover of mRNA, which is necessary for the posttranscriptional control of gene expression. In bacteria and the plant chloroplast, RNA degradosomes are multienzyme complexes that process and degrade RNA. In many bacterial species, the endoribonuclease RNase E is the central component of the RNA degradosome. RNase E-based RNA degradosomes are inner membrane proteins in a large family of gram-negative bacteria (β- and γ-Proteobacteria). Until now, the reason for membrane localization was not understood. Here, we show that a mutant strain of <i>Escherichia coli</i>, in which the RNA degradosome is localized to the interior of the cell, has high levels of 20S and 40S particles that are defective intermediates in ribosome assembly. These particles have aberrant protein composition and contain rRNA precursors that have been cleaved by RNase E. After RNase E cleavage, rRNA fragments are degraded to nucleotides by exoribonucleases. In vitro, rRNA in intact ribosomes is resistant to RNase E cleavage, whereas protein-free rRNA is readily degraded. We conclude that RNA degradosomes in the nucleoid of the mutant strain interfere with cotranscriptional ribosome assembly. We propose that membrane-attached RNA degradosomes in wild-type cells control the quality of ribosome assembly after intermediates are released from the nucleoid. That is, the compact structure of mature ribosomes protects rRNA against cleavage by RNase E. Turnover of a proportion of intermediates in ribosome assembly explains slow growth of the mutant strain. Competition between mRNA and rRNA degradation could be the cause of slower mRNA degradation in the mutant strain. We conclude that attachment of the RNA degradosome to the bacterial inner cytoplasmic membrane prevents wasteful degradation of rRNA precursors, thus explaining the reason for conservation of membrane-attached RNA degradosomes throughout the β- and γ-Proteobacteria.

                <p>by Mirko Singer, Kathrin Simon, Ignasi Forné, Markus Meissner</p>

Apicomplexa are obligate intracellular parasites. While most species are restricted to specific hosts and cell types, <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i> can invade every nucleated cell derived from warm-blooded animals. This broad host range suggests that this parasite can recognize multiple host cell ligands or structures, leading to the activation of a central protein complex, which should be conserved in all apicomplexans. During invasion, the unique secretory organelles (micronemes and rhoptries) are sequentially released and several micronemal proteins have been suggested to be required for host cell recognition and invasion. However, to date, only few micronemal proteins have been demonstrated to be essential for invasion, suggesting functional redundancy that might allow such a broad host range. Cysteine Repeat Modular Proteins (CRMPs) are a family of apicomplexan-specific proteins. In <i>T</i>. <i>gondii</i>, two CRMPs are present in the genome, CRMPA (TGGT1_261080) and CRMPB (TGGT1_292020). Here, we demonstrate that both proteins form a complex that contains the additional proteins MIC15 and the thrombospondin type 1 domain-containing protein (TSP1). Disruption of this complex results in a block of rhoptry secretion and parasites being unable to invade the host cell. In conclusion, this complex is a central invasion complex conserved in all apicomplexans.

                <p>by Tomoya Nakai, Cléa Girard, Léa Longo, Hanna Chesnokova, Jérôme Prado</p>

Number symbols, such as Arabic numerals, are cultural inventions that have transformed human mathematical skills. Although their acquisition is at the core of early elementary education in children, it remains unknown how the neural representations of numerals emerge during that period. It is also unclear whether these relate to an ontogenetically earlier sense of approximate quantity. Here, we used multivariate fMRI adaptation coupled with within- and between-format machine learning to probe the cortical representations of Arabic numerals and approximate nonsymbolic quantity in 89 children either at the beginning (age 5) or four years into formal education (age 8). Although the cortical representations of both numerals and nonsymbolic quantities expanded from age 5 to age 8, these representations also segregated with learning and development. Specifically, a format-independent neural representation of quantity was found in the right parietal cortex, but only for 5-year-olds. These results are consistent with the so-called symbolic estrangement hypothesis, which argues that the relation between symbolic and nonsymbolic quantity weakens with exposure to formal mathematics in children.

Use of rigorous study design methods and transparent reporting in publications are 2 key strategies proposed to improve the reproducibility of preclinical research. Despite promotion of these practices by funders and journals, assessments suggest uptake is low in preclinical research. Thirty preclinical scientists were interviewed to better understand barriers and enablers to rigorous design and reporting. The interview guide was informed by the Theoretical Domains Framework, which is a framework used to understand determinants of current and desired behavior. Four global themes were identified; 2 reflecting enablers and 2 reflecting barriers. We found that basic scientists are highly motivated to apply the methods of rigorous design and reporting and perceive a number of benefits to their adoption (e.g., improved quality and reliability). However, there was varied awareness of the guidelines and in implementation of these practices. Researchers also noted that these guidelines can result in disadvantages, such as increased sample sizes, expenses, time, and can require several personnel to operationalize. Most researchers expressed additional resources such as personnel and education/training would better enable the application of some methods. Using existing guidance (Behaviour Change Wheel (BCW); Expert Recommendations for Implementing Change (ERIC) project implementation strategies), we mapped and coded our interview findings to identify potential interventions, policies, and implementation strategies to improve routine use of the guidelines by preclinical scientists. These findings will help inform specific strategies that may guide the development of programs and resources to improve experimental design and transparent reporting in preclinical research.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>This study aimed to assess the possible association between cognitive impairment and two important biochemical biomarkers of oxidative stress, thiol-disulfide homeostasis (TDH), and ischemia-modified albumin (IMA) in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). This study included 85 patients with MS (38 treatment-naïve relapsing–remitting MS (RRMS), 31 RRMS on fingolimod therapy, and 16 secondary progressive MS (SPMS)) and 33 healthy controls. Cognitive evaluation was carried out by applying the Brief International Cognitive Assessment for Multiple Sclerosis (BICAMS) test battery and the scores were adjusted for age and years of education. Plasma TDH was assessed using an automated method and plasma IMA levels were determined using the cobalt-albumin binding assay. Plasma native thiol and total thiol levels were significantly decreased in patients with SPMS when compared with the naïve patients and healthy controls. Cognitive impairment was detected in 47.4% of naïve patients, 64.5% of patients on fingolimod therapy, and 80% of patients with SPMS. Naïve patients or patients on fingolimod therapy who were cognitively impaired had significantly decreased levels of native thiol and total thiol compared to the cognitively normal patients. Logistic regression analysis revealed total thiol and native thiol to be significantly associated with cognitive impairment in naïve patients and patients on fingolimod therapy. Significant correlations were determined between BICAMS scores, TDH, IMA, clinical indices of disease severity (EDSS and MSSS), and magnetic resonance imaging parameters. This study has shown for the first time that plasma TDH parameters are associated with cognitive impairment in MS.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jnr.25160?af=R">Visual discrimination and inhibitory control deficits in mouse models of Down syndrome: A pilot study using rodent touchscreen technology</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Several non-verbal cognitive and behavioral tests have been developed to assess learning deficits in humans with Down syndrome (DS). Here we used rodent touchscreen paradigms in adult male mice to investigate visual discrimination (VD) learning and inhibitory control in the Dp(16)1/Yey (C57BL/6J genetic background), Ts65Dn (mixed B6 X C3H genetic background) and Ts1Cje (C57BL/6J genetic background) mouse models of DS. Dp(16)1/Yey and Ts1Cje models did not exhibit motivation or learning deficits during early pre-training, however, Ts1Cje mice showed a significant learning delay after the introduction of the incorrect stimulus (late pre-training), suggesting prefrontal cortex defects in this model. Dp(16)1/Yey and Ts1Cje mice display learning deficits in VD but these deficits were more pronounced in the Dp(16)1/Yey model. Both models also exhibited compulsive behavior and abnormal cortical inhibitory control during Extinction compared to WT littermates. Finally, Ts65Dn mice outperformed WT littermates in pre-training stages by initiating a significantly higher number of trials due to their hyperactive behavior. Both Ts65Dn and WT littermates showed poor performance during late pre-training and were not tested in VD. These studies demonstrate significant learning deficits and compulsive behavior in the Ts1Cje and Dp(16)1/Yey mouse models of DS. They also demonstrate that the mouse genetic background (C57BL/6J vs. mixed B6 X C3H) and the absence of hyperactive behavior are key determinants of successful learning in touchscreen behavioral testing. These data will be used to select the mouse model that best mimics cognitive deficits in humans with DS and evaluate the effects of future therapeutic interventions.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26597?af=R">Monkeypox‐associated central nervous system disease: a case series and review</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Monkeypox virus (MPXV) disease has been declared a public health emergency by the World Health Organization, creating an urgent need for neurologists to be able to recognize, diagnosis, and treat MPXV-associated neurologic disease.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Three cases of MPXV-associated central nervous system (CNS) disease occurring during the 2022 outbreak and their associated imaging findings are presented, with two cases previously published in a limited capacity in a public health bulletin.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Three previously healthy immunocompetent gay men in their 30s developed a febrile illness followed by progressive neurologic symptoms with presence of a vesiculopustular rash. MPXV nucleic acid was detected by PCR from skin lesions of two patients with the third patient having indeterminate testing but an epidemiologic link to a confirmed MPXV disease case. Cerebrospinal fluid demonstrated a lymphocytic pleocytosis, elevated protein, and negative MPXV specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR). In two patients, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and spine demonstrated partially enhancing, longitudinally extensive central spinal cord lesions with multifocal subcortical, basal ganglia, thalamic, cerebellar, and/or brainstem lesions. The third patient had thalamic and basal ganglia lesions. All patients received 14 days of tecovirimat, and two patients also received multiple forms of immunotherapy, including intravenous immunoglobulin, pulsed high dose steroids, plasmapheresis, and/or rituximab. Good neurologic recovery was observed in all cases.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>MPXV can be associated with CNS disease. It is unclear whether this is from a parainfectious immune-mediated injury or direct CNS viral invasion.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26585?af=R">Ultrastructural Axon–Myelin Unit Alterations in Multiple Sclerosis Correlate with Inflammation</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Changes in the normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) in multiple sclerosis (MS) may contribute to disease progression. Here, we systematically quantified ultrastructural and subcellular characteristics of the axon–myelin unit in MS NAWM and determined how this correlates with low-grade inflammation.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Human brain tissue obtained with short postmortem delay and fixation at autopsy enables systematic quantification of ultrastructural characteristics. In this study, we performed high-resolution immunohis tochemistry and quantitative transmission electron microscopy to study inflammation and ultrastructural characteristics of the axon–myelin unit in MS NAWM (n = 8) and control white matter (WM) in the optic nerve.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In the MS NAWM, there were more activated and phagocytic microglia cells (HLA<sup>+</sup>P2RY12<sup>−</sup> and Iba1<sup>+</sup>CD68<sup>+</sup>) and more T cells (CD3<sup>+</sup>) compared to control WM, mainly located in the perivascular space. In MS NAWM compared to control WM, there were, as expected, longer paranodes and juxtaparanodes and larger overlap between paranodes and juxtaparanodes. There was less compact myelin wrapping, a lower g-ratio, and a higher frequency of axonal mitochondria. Changes in myelin and axonal mitochondrial frequency correlated positively with the number of active and phagocytic microglia and lymphocytes in the optic nerve.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>These data suggest that in MS NAWM myelin detachment and uncompact myelin wrapping occurs, potassium channels are unmasked at the nodes of Ranvier, and axonal energy demand is increased, or mitochondrial transport is stagnated, accompanied by increased presence of activated and phagocytic microglia and T cells. These subclinical alterations to the axon–myelin unit in MS NAWM may contribute to disease progression. ANN NEUROL 2023</p>

                In evolutionary medicine, it is recognized that some disease symptoms commonly assumed to be maladaptive, such as diarrhea and fever, are in fact evolutionary adaptations promoting survival and reproductive success – notwithstanding the distress they cause [1]. One malady almost universally considered maladaptive is chronic neuropathic pain (see Glossary) [2,3], which contrasts with acute pain that has clear protective functions. In humans and rodents, many examples of neuropathic pain have been linked to persistent electrical hyperactivity in primary nociceptors (Figure 1 and Box 1) (reviewed in [2,4,5]).

                Sun et al. show that Rett syndrome-causing mutations in MeCP2 impair the gene expression landscape of human astrocytes, including genes associated with astrocyte development, and negatively affect their structural maturation and energy metabolism, mediated by dysfunctional mitochondria. These together negatively impact the astrocyte’s key role in supporting neurons.

                Kravtiz et al. develop a method to identify genes that randomly differentially express their parental alleles in human tissues and find that random allelic expression disproportionately impacts genes linked to age-related disease, GWAS hits, and rapidly evolving genomic regions. They also find putative subtypes from different gene regulatory features and domains.

                While re-defining the spectrum of germ cell precursors in vitro, Alves-Lopes et al. demonstrate that germ cell-like cells specified from precursors transitioning between primed and naïve pluripotency harbor an enhanced progression capability compared with counterparts derived from peri-gastrulation precursors. Both counterpart precursors may co-exist in the early post-implantation epiblast.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/85246">Dalpiciclib partially abrogates ER signaling activation induced by pyrotinib in HER2+HR+ breast cancer</a></h4>

              
                Recent evidences from clinical trials (NCT04486911) revealed that the combination of pyrotinib, letrozole, and dalpiciclib exerted optimistic therapeutic effect in treating HER2<sup>+</sup>HR<sup>+</sup> breast cancer; however, the underlying molecular mechanism remained elusive. Through the drug sensitivity test, the drug combination efficacy of pyrotinib, tamoxifen, and dalpiciclib to BT474 cells was tested. The underlying molecular mechanisms were investigated using immunofluorescence, Western blot analysis, immunohistochemical staining, and cell cycle analysis. Potential risk factor that may indicate the responsiveness to drug treatment in HER2<sup>+</sup>/HR<sup>+</sup> breast cancer was identified using RNA-sequence and evaluated using immunohistochemical staining and in vivo drug susceptibility test. We found that pyrotinib combined with dalpiciclib exerted better cytotoxic efficacy than pyrotinib combined with tamoxifen in BT474 cells. Degradation of HER2 could enhance ER nuclear transportation, activating ER signaling pathway in BT474 cells, whereas dalpiciclib could partially abrogate this process. This may be the underlying mechanism by which combination of pyrotinib, tamoxifen, and dalpiciclib exerted best cytotoxic effect. Furthermore, CALML5 was revealed to be a risk factor in the treatment of HER2<sup>+</sup>/HR<sup>+</sup> breast cancer and the usage of dalpiciclib might overcome the drug resistance to pyrotinib + tamoxifen due to CALML5 expression. Our study provided evidence that the usage of dalpiciclib in the treatment of HER2<sup>+</sup>/HR<sup>+</sup> breast cancer could partially abrogate the estrogen signaling pathway activation caused by anti-HER2 therapy and revealed that CALML5 could serve as a risk factor in the treatment of HER2<sup>+</sup>/HR<sup>+</sup> breast cancer.

                Non-coding RNAs exert diverse functions in many cell types. In addition to transcription factors from coding genes, non-coding RNAs may also play essential roles in shaping and directing the fate of germ cells. The presence of many long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) which are specifically expressed in the germ cells during human gonadal development were reportedand one divergent lncRNA, <i>LNC1845</i>, was functionally characterized. Comprehensive bioinformatic analysis of these lncRNAs indicates that divergent lncRNAs occupied the majority of female and male germ cells. Integrating lncRNA expression into the bioinformatic analysis also enhances the cell-type classification of female germ cells. Functional dissection using <i>in vitro</i> differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells to germ cells revealed the regulatory role of <i>LNC1845</i> on a transcription factor essential for ovarian follicle development, <i>LHX8</i>, by modulating the levels of histone modifications, H3K4me3 and H3K27Ac. Hence, bioinformatical analysis and experimental verification provide a comprehensive analysis of lncRNAs in developing germ cells and elucidate how a lncRNA function as a <i>cis</i> regulator during human germ cell development.

">The neuron mixer and its impact on human brain dynamics</a></h4>

              
                A signal mixer made of a transistor facilitates rich computation that has been the building block of modern telecommunication. Here we report that a neural cell is also a signal mixer. We found through ex vivo and in vivo measurements that individual neurons mix exogenous (controlled) and endogenous (spontaneous) subthreshold membrane potential oscillations, thereby producing new oscillations. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the neural mixing dynamic is evident in human brain activity and is associated with our cognitive functions. Neural network oscillations have been observed in nearly every cognitive domain and species. Signal mixing enables single neurons to actively sculpt their network oscillations and utilize them for computational operations, which have only been seen in modern telecommunication until now.

">A novel, lightweight drive implant for chronic tetrode recordings in juvenile mice</a></h4>

              
                In vivo electrophysiology provides unparalleled insight into sub-second-level circuit dynamics of the intact brain and represents a method of particular importance for studying mouse models of human neuro-psychiatric disorders. However, such methods often require large cranial implants which cannot be used in mice at early developmental timepoints. As such, virtually no studies of in vivo physiology have been performed in freely behaving infant or juvenile mice, despite the fact that a better understanding of neurological development in this critical window is likely to provide unique insights into age-dependent developmental disorders such as autism or schizophrenia. Here, we describe a novel micro-drive design, surgical implantation procedure, and post-surgery recovery strategy that allows for chronic field and single-unit recordings from up to sixteen brain regions simultaneously in mice as they age from postnatal day 20 (p20) to postnatal day 60 (p60) and beyond, a time window roughly corresponding to human ages 2-years-old through adult. The number of recording electrodes and final recording sites can be easily modified and expanded, allowing flexible experimental control of in vivo monitoring of behavior- or disease-relevant brain regions across development.

">Different methods to estimate the phase of neural rhythms agree, but only during times of low uncertainty</a></h4>

              
                Rhythms are a common feature of brain activity. Across different types of rhythms, the phase has been proposed to have functional consequences, thus requiring its accurate specification from noisy data. Phase is conventionally specified using techniques that presume a frequency band-limited rhythm. However, in practice, observed brain rhythms are typically non-sinusoidal and amplitude modulated. How these features impact methods to estimate phase remains unclear. To address this, we consider three phase estimation methods, each with different underlying assumptions about the rhythm. We apply these methods to rhythms simulated with different generative mechanisms and demonstrate inconsistency in phase estimates across the different methods. We propose two improvements to the practice of phase estimation: (1) estimating confidence in the phase estimate, and (2) examining the consistency of phase estimates between two (or more) methods.

">Functional connectivity favors hyperactivity leading to synapse loss in amyloidosis</a></h4>

              
                Hyperactivity is observed in early Alzheimers disease (AD) in multiple brain regions, including the visual cortex. We recently found that the postsynaptic structures favor visual cortex hyperactivity, which disrupts functional connectivity and leads to visual recognition memory deficits in a mouse AD model. It is unclear whether presynaptic structures also favor hyperactivity and whether hyperactivity depends on the target or source of presynaptic terminals. In addition, it is not well understood whether the functional connectivity of brain regions under nonpathological conditions predicts their hyperactivity in amyloid pathology. We used c-Fos immunolabeling under resting state conditions to map brain-wide neural activity and performed network analysis. We also quantified excitatory and inhibitory presynaptic terminals in hyperactive and non-hyperactive brain regions.We found that hyperactivity in the visual network originates in the cortex, and brain regions highly connected to the primary visual cortex in nonpathological conditions tend to be hyperactive in amyloid pathology. Immunolabeling presynaptic terminals from subcortical and cortical neurons show that the source rather than the target brain regions determine the vulnerability of synapses. Furthermore, we observed a reduction in presynaptic structures selectively in the hyperactive region, indicating presynaptic changes are unfavorable to hyperactivity. Brain regions with higher functional connectivity under nonpathological conditions are vulnerable to hyperactivity in amyloid pathology. Furthermore, presynapse loss may serve as an adaptation to maintain neuronal activity homeostasis.

                In selecting a behavior, animals should weigh sensory evidence both for and against their beliefs about the world. For instance, animals use optic flow to estimate and control their own rotation. However, existing models of flow detection can confuse the movement of external objects with genuine self motion. Here, we show that stationary patterns on the retina, which constitute negative evidence against self rotation, are used by the fruit fly Drosophila to suppress inappropriate stabilizing rotational behavior. In parallel in silico experiments, we show that artificial neural networks trained to distinguish self and world motion incorporate similar negative evidence. We used neural measurements and genetic manipulations to identify components of the circuitry for stationary pattern detection, which is parallel to the fly's motion- and optic flow-detectors. Our results exemplify how the compact brain of the fly incorporates negative evidence to improve heading stability, exploiting geometrical constraints of the visual world.

">Distinct prefrontal projections conversely orchestrate social competition and hierarchy</a></h4>

              
                Social animals compete for limited resources, resulting in a social hierarchy. Although different neuronal subpopulations in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), a hub brain region of social hierarchy, encode distinct social competition behaviors, their identities and associated molecular underpinnings have not yet been identified. In this study, we found that mPFC neurons projecting to the nucleus accumbens (mPFC-NAc) encode social winning behavior, whereas mPFC neurons projecting to the ventral tegmental area (mPFC-VTA) encode social losing behavior by monitoring and manipulating neural circuit activity. High-throughput single-cell transcriptomic analysis and projection-specific genetic manipulation revealed that the expression level of POU domain, class 3, transcription factor 1 (Pou3f1) in mPFC-VTA neurons controls social hierarchy. Optogenetic activation of mPFC-VTA neurons increases Pou3f1 expression and lowers social rank. Together, these data demonstrate that discrete activity and gene expression in separate mPFC projections oppositely orchestrate social competition and hierarchy.

                Aging-related retinal degeneration and vision loss have been severely affecting the elder worldwide. Previously we showed that the m6A reader YTHDF2 is a negative regulator for dendrite development and maintenance of retinal ganglion cells (RGC) in mice (Niu et al. 2022). Here, we show that conditional ablation of Ythdf2 protects retina from RGC dendrite shrinking and vision loss in the aged mice. Further, we identify Hspa12a and Islr2 as the YTHDF2 target mRNAs mediating these effects. Together our results indicate that m6A modification regulates retinal degeneration caused by aging, which might provide therapeutical potentials for developing new treatment approaches against aging-related vision loss.

">Neurovascular reactivity increases across development in the visual and frontal pole networks as revealed by a breath-holding task: a longitudinal fMRI study</a></h4>

              
                Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has been widely used to understand the neurodevelopmental changes that occur in cognition and behavior across childhood. The blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal obtained from fMRI is understood to be comprised of both neuronal and vascular information. However, it is unclear whether the vascular response is altered across age in studies investigating development in children. Since breath-hold activation is an important aspect to understand the neurovascular response in fMRI studies, it can be used to account for developmental differences in vascular response. This study examines how the vascular response changes over age in a longitudinal children breath-hold dataset from the Nathan Kline Institute (NKI) Rockland Sample (ages 6 to 18 years old at enrollment). A principal component analysis (PCA) approach was applied to derive brain activation from breath-hold data. To model both the longitudinal and cross-sectional effects of age on breath-hold activation, we used mixed effects modeling with the following terms: linear, quadratic, logarithmic, and quadratic-logarithmic, to find the best-fitting model. We observed increased breath-hold activation in the frontal pole, medial visual, and lateral visual networks across age, in which linear and logarithmic mixed effects models provided the best fit with the lowest Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) scores. This shows that the vascular response increases across development in a brain network-specific manner and may also be nonlinear depending on the brain network. Therefore, fMRI studies investigating the developmental period should account for vascular changes which occur with age.

">Neurophysiological Changes Associated with Vibroacoustically-augmented Breath-focused Mindfulness for Dissociation: Targeting Interoception and Attention</a></h4>

              
                Background: Dissociative symptoms can emerge after trauma and interfere with attentional control and interoception, both of which are barriers to mind-body interventions such as breath-focused mindfulness (BFM). To overcome these barriers, we tested the use of an exteroceptive augmentation to BFM, using vibrations equivalent to the amplitude of the auditory waveform of the actual breath, delivered via a wearable subwoofer in real time (VBFM). We tested whether this device enhanced interoceptive processes, attentional control and autonomic regulation in trauma-exposed women with dissociative symptoms. Method: 65 women, majority (82%) Black American, aged 18-65 completed self-report measures of interoception and 6 BFM sessions, during which electrocardiographic recordings were taken to derive high-frequency heart rate variability (HRV) estimates. A subset (n=31) of participants completed functional MRI at pre- and post-intervention, during which they were administered an affective attentional control task. Results: Compared to those who received BFM only, women who received VBFM demonstrated greater increases in interoception, particularly their ability to trust body signals, increased sustained attention, and as well as increased connectivity between nodes of emotion processing and interoceptive networks. Intervention condition moderated the relationship between interoception change and dissociation change, as well as the relationship between dissociation and HRV change. Conclusions: Vibration feedback during breath focus yielded greater improvements in interoception, sustained attention and increased connectivity of emotion processing and interoceptive networks. Augmenting BFM with vibration appears to have considerable effects on interoception, attention and autonomic regulation; it could be used as a monotherapy or to address trauma treatment barriers.

">Chronic Changes In Oligodendrocyte Sub-Populations After Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion in Neonatal Mice.</a></h4>

              
                Background: Neonatal stroke is common and causes life-long motor and cognitive sequelae. Because neonates with stroke are not diagnosed until days-months after the injury, chronic targets for repair are needed. We evaluated oligodendrocyte maturity and myelination and assessed oligodendrocyte gene expression changes using single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA seq) at chronic timepoints in a mouse model of neonatal arterial ischemic stroke. Methods: Mice underwent sixty minutes of transient right middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) on postnatal day 10 (p10) and received 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) on post-MCAO days 3-7 to label dividing cells. Animals were sacrificed 14 and 28-30 days post-MCAO for immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy. Oligodendrocytes were isolated from striatum 14 days post-MCAO for scRNA seq and differential gene expression analysis. Results: The density of Olig2+EdU+ cells was significantly increased in ipsilateral striatum 14 days post-MCAO and the majority of oligodendrocytes were immature. Density of Olig2+EdU+ cells declined significantly between 14 and 28 days post-MCAO without a concurrent increase in mature Olig2+EdU+ cells. By 28 days post-MCAO there were significantly fewer myelinated axons in ipsilateral striatum. scRNA seq identified a cluster of disease associated oligodendrocytes (DOLs) specific to the ischemic striatum, with increased expression of MHC class I genes. Gene ontology analysis suggested decreased enrichment of pathways involved in myelin production in the reactive cluster. Conclusions: Oligodendrocytes proliferate 3-7 days post-MCAO and persist at 14 days, but fail to mature by 28 days. MCAO induces a subset of oligodendrocytes with reactive phenotype, which may be a therapeutic target to promote white matter repair.

">Prenatal benzene exposure alters offspring hypothalamic development predisposing to metabolic disease in later life</a></h4>

              
                The hypothalamus is essential in the regulation of metabolism, notably during critical windows of development. An abnormal hormonal and inflammatory milieu during development can trigger persistent changes in the function of hypothalamic circuits, leading to long-lasting effects on the body's energy homeostasis and metabolism. We recently demonstrated that gestational exposure to benzene at smoking levels induces severe metabolic dysregulation in the offspring. Given the central role of the hypothalamus in metabolic control, we hypothesized that prenatal exposure to benzene impacts hypothalamic development, contributing to the adverse metabolic effects in the offspring. C57BL/6JB dams were exposed to benzene in the inhalation chambers exclusively during pregnancy (from E0.5 to E19). The transcriptome analysis of the offspring hypothalamus at postnatal day 21 (P21) revealed changes in genes related to metabolic regulation, inflammation, and neurodevelopment exclusively in benzene-exposed male offspring. Moreover, the hypothalamus of prenatally benzene-exposed male offspring displayed alterations in orexigenic and anorexigenic projections, impairments in leptin signaling, and increased microgliosis. Additional exposure to benzene during lactation did not promote further microgliosis or astrogliosis in the offspring, while the high-fat diet (HFD) challenge in adulthood exacerbated glucose metabolism and hypothalamic inflammation in benzene-exposed offspring of both sexes. These findings reveal the persistent impact of prenatal benzene exposure on hypothalamic circuits and neuroinflammation, predisposing the offspring to long-lasting metabolic health conditions.

">Dihydroxy-Metabolites of Dihomo-gamma-linolenic Acid Drive Ferroptosis- Mediated Neurodegeneration</a></h4>

              
                Even after decades of research, the mechanism of neurodegeneration remains understudied, hindering the discovery of effective treatments for neurodegenerative diseases. Recent reports suggest that ferroptosis could be a novel therapeutic target for neurodegenerative diseases. While polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) plays an important role in neurodegeneration and ferroptosis, how PUFAs may trigger these processes remains largely unknown. PUFA metabolites from cytochrome P450 and epoxide hydrolase metabolic pathways may modulate neurodegeneration. Here, we test the hypothesis that specific PUFAs regulate neurodegeneration through the action of their downstream metabolites by affecting ferroptosis. We find that the PUFA, dihomo gamma linolenic acid (DGLA), specifically induces ferroptosis-mediated neurodegeneration in dopaminergic neurons. Using synthetic chemical probes, targeted metabolomics, and genetic mutants, we show that DGLA triggers neurodegeneration upon conversion to dihydroxyeicosadienoic acid through the action of CYP-EH, representing a new class of lipid metabolite that induces neurodegeneration via ferroptosis.

">BundleWarp, streamline-based nonlinear registration of white matter tracts</a></h4>

              
                Nonlinear registration plays a central role in most neuroimage analysis methods and pipelines, such as in tractography-based individual and group-level analysis methods. However, nonlinear registration is a non-trivial task, especially when dealing with tractography data that digitally represent the underlying anatomy of the brain's white matter. Furthermore, such process often changes the structure of the data, causing artifacts that can suppress the underlying anatomical and structural details. In this paper, we introduce BundleWarp, a novel and robust streamline-based nonlinear registration method for the registration of white matter tracts. BundleWarp intelligently warps two bundles while preserving the bundles' crucial topological features. BundleWarp has two main steps. The first step involves the solution of an assignment problem that matches corresponding streamlines from the two bundles (iterLAP step). The second step introduces streamline-specific point-based deformations while keeping the topology of the bundle intact (mlCPD step). We provide comparisons against streamline-based linear registration and image-based nonlinear registration methods. BundleWarp quantitatively and qualitatively outperforms both, and we show that BundleWarp can deform and, at the same time, preserve important characteristics of the original anatomical shape of the bundles. Results are shown on 1,728 pairs of bundle registrations across 27 different bundle types. In addition, we present an application of BundleWarp for quantifying bundle shape differences using the generated deformation fields.

">Impaired migration and premature differentiation underlie the neurological phenotype associated with PCDH12 loss of function</a></h4>

              
                Protocadherins (PCDHs) are cell adhesion molecules that regulate many essential neurodevelopmental processes related to neuronal maturation, dendritic arbor formation, axon pathfinding, and synaptic plasticity. Bi-allelic loss-of-function variants in PCDH12 are associated with several neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) such as diencephalic-mesencephalic dysplasia syndrome, cerebral palsy, cerebellar ataxia, and microcephaly. Despite the highly deleterious outcome resulting from loss of PCDH12, little is known about its role during brain development and disease. Here, we show that PCDH12 loss severely impairs cerebral organoid development with reduced proliferative areas and disrupted laminar organization. 2D models further show that neural progenitor cells lacking PCDH12 prematurely exit cell cycle and differentiate earlier when compared to wildtype. Furthermore, we show that PCDH12 regulates neuronal migration through a mechanism requiring ADAM10-mediated ectodomain shedding and membrane recruitment of cytoskeleton regulators. Our data demonstrate a critical and broad involvement of PCDH12 in cortical development, revealing the pathogenic mechanisms underlying PCDH12-related NDDs.

">Emergence of brain-like mirror-symmetric viewpoint tuning in convolutional neural networks</a></h4>

              
                Primates can recognize objects despite 3D geometric variations such as in-depth rotations. The computational mechanisms that give rise to such invariances are yet to be fully understood. A curious case of partial invariance occurs in the macaque face-patch AL and in fully connected layers of deep convolutional networks in which neurons respond similarly to mirror-symmetric views (e.g., left and right profiles). Why does this tuning develop? Here, we propose a simple learning-driven explanation for mirror-symmetric viewpoint tuning. We show that mirror-symmetric viewpoint tuning for faces emerges in the fully connected layers of convolutional deep neural networks trained on object recognition tasks, even when the training dataset does not include faces. First, using 3D objects rendered from multiple views as test stimuli, we demonstrate that mirror-symmetric viewpoint tuning in convolutional neural network models is not unique to faces: it emerges for multiple object categories with bilateral symmetry. Second, we show why this invariance emerges in the models. Learning to discriminate among bilaterally symmetric object categories induces reflection-equivariant intermediate representations. AL-like mirror-symmetric tuning is achieved when such equivariant responses are spatially pooled by downstream units with sufficiently large receptive fields. These results explain how mirror-symmetric viewpoint tuning can emerge in neural networks, providing a theory of how they might emerge in the primate brain. Our theory predicts that mirror-symmetric viewpoint tuning can emerge as a consequence of exposure to bilaterally symmetric objects beyond the category of faces, and that it can generalize beyond previously experienced object categories.

">Loss of secondary motor cortex neurons in chronic neuropathic pain</a></h4>

              
                Chronic neuropathic pain is associated with structural plasticity of the brain on different spatial scales, yet, on the mesoscopic scale of tissue composition, little is known. Here, we determined the cellular composition of cortical areas and structural variability of entire neurons during chronic neuropathic pain using longitudinal in vivo two-photon microscopy and behavioral assessment. When monitoring cell type composition in response to spared-nerve injury in 84 cortical volumes containing ~25000 cells each, we found neuronal loss in the secondary motor cortex region M2 immediately adjacent to the cingulate cortex already one week after surgery. Loss of mostly interneurons was also evident when monitoring individual M2 neurons over time. This neuronal loss was preceded by decreased spine density and loss of distal dendritic branches. In conclusion, our work delineates M2 as a novel site and neuronal loss as a so far underappreciated mechanism underlying chronic neuropathic pain states.

">Placing approach-avoidance conflict within the framework of multi-objective reinforcement learning</a></h4>

              
                Many psychiatric disorders are marked by impaired decision-making during an approach-avoidance conflict. Current experiments elicit approach-avoidance conflicts in bandit tasks by pairing an individual's actions with consequences that are simultaneously desirable (reward) and undesirable (harm). We frame approach-avoidance conflict tasks as a multi-objective multi-armed bandit. By defining a general decision-maker as a limiting sequence of actions, we disentangle the decision process from learning. Each decision maker can then be identified as a multi-dimensional point representing its long-term average expected outcomes, while different decision making models can be associated by the geometry of their 'feasible region', the set of all possible long term performances on a fixed task. We introduce three example decision-makers based on popular reinforcement learning models and characterize their feasible regions, including whether they can be Pareto optimal. From this perspective, we find that existing tasks are unable to distinguish between the three examples of decision-makers. We show how to design new tasks whose geometric structure can be used to better distinguish between decision-makers. These findings are expected to guide the design of approach-avoidance conflict tasks and the modeling of resulting decision-making behavior.

">A glia cell dependent mechanism at a peripheral nerve plexus critical for target-selective axon regeneration</a></h4>

              
                A critical step for functional recovery from peripheral nerve injury is for regenerating axons to connect with their pre-injury targets. Reestablishing pre-injury target specificity is particularly challenging for limb-innervating axons as they encounter a plexus, a network where peripheral nerves converge, axons from different nerves intermingle, and then re-sort into target-specific bundles. Here, we examine this process at a plexus located at the base of the zebrafish pectoral fin, equivalent to tetrapod forelimbs. Using live cell imaging and sparse axon labeling, we find that regenerating motor axons from three nerves coalesce into the plexus. There, they intermingle and sort into distinct branches, and then navigate to their original muscle domains with high fidelity that restores functionality. We demonstrate that this regeneration process includes selective retraction of mistargeted axons, suggesting active correction mechanisms. Moreover, we find that Schwann cells are enriched and associate with axons at the plexus, and that Schwann cell ablation during regeneration causes profound axonal mistargeting. Our data provide the first real time account of regenerating vertebrate motor axons navigating a nerve plexus and reveal a previously unappreciated role for Schwann cells to promote axon sorting at a plexus during regeneration.

">Chronic seizure-induced serotonin pathway dysregulation coincides with mortality in Alzheimer s disease mouse models</a></h4>

              
                Objective: People with early-onset Alzheimer disease (AD) with amyloid precursor protein (APP) duplications or presenilin (PSEN) variants are at elevated seizure risk within 5 years of diagnosis. Further, seizures in AD may increase neuropsychiatric comorbidity burden. We thus hypothesized that disruptions in serotonin pathway-related protein expression was impacted by 60 Hz corneal kindled seizures in an AD-genotype-related manner. Methods: Male and female 2-3-month-old APP/PS1, PSEN2-N141I, and respective transgenic (Tg) control mice underwent corneal or sham kindling for 2 weeks until reaching kindling criterion defined as five consecutive Racine stage 5 seizures. Chronic seizure-induced changes in serotonin pathway protein expression in hippocampus were then quantified by western blot. Results: Young female APP/PS1 mice kindled significantly faster than Tg- controls, whereas PSEN2-N141I mice kindled no differently versus their Tg controls. APP/PS1 mice subjected to corneal kindling were at extremely elevated mortality risk relative to kindled Tg- controls, as well as sham-kindled APP/PS1 and Tg- control mice, whereas PSEN2-N141I mice were not adversely affected by kindling. Kindled APP/PS1 mice demonstrated a marked downregulation of hippocampal tryptophan hydroxylase 2 and monoamine oxidase A protein expression versus kindled Tg- and sham-kindled APP/PS1 groups. Serotonin pathway protein expression in PSEN2-N141I mice was unchanged from Tg. Importantly, all changes in serotonin pathway protein expression in kindled APP/PS1 mice occurred in the absence of amyloid {beta} (A{beta}) deposition. Significance: The co-occurrence of seizures in the APP/PS1 mouse is sufficient to evoke unexpected mortality well ahead of pathological A{beta} deposition synonymous with a symptomatic AD model. The presence of another AD-associated variant (PSEN2-N141) does not lead to seizure-induced mortality, suggesting that AD-associated risk genes differentially influence vulnerability to chronic seizure-associated mortality. Further, disruptions in serotonin pathway synthesis coincide with heightened mortality risk exclusively in adult APP/PS1 mice, suggesting a possible non-canonical sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP)-related phenotype.

">A Convolutional Autoencoder-based Explainable Clustering Approach for Resting-State EEG Analysis</a></h4>

              
                Machine learning methods have frequently been applied to electroencephalography (EEG) data. However, while supervised EEG classification is well-developed, relatively few studies have clustered EEG, which is problematic given the potential for clustering EEG to identify novel subtypes or patterns of dynamics that could improve our understanding of neuropsychiatric disorders. There are established methods for clustering EEG using manually extracted features that reduce the richness of the feature space for clustering, but only a couple studies have sought to use deep learning-based approaches with automated feature learning to cluster EEG. Those studies involve separately training an autoencoder and then performing clustering on the extracted features, and the separation of those steps can lead to poor quality clustering. In this study, we propose an explainable convolutional autoencoder-based approach that combines model training with clustering to yield high quality clusters. We apply the approach within the context of schizophrenia (SZ), identifying 8 EEG states characterized by varying levels of {delta} activity. We also find that individuals who spend more time outside of the dominant state tend to have increased negative symptom severity. Our approach represents a significant step forward for clustering resting-state EEG data and has the potential to lead to novel findings across a variety of neurological and neuropsychological disorders in future years.

">Maternal diesel exposure and maternal choline supplementation interactions in fetal and placental immune factors</a></h4>

              
                Air pollution causes widespread inflammatory changes in the body and brain. When exposure to air pollution occurs early in development, children exhibit impaired working memory ability (Sunyer et al., 2015). In addition, prenatal exposure to diesel particulate matter (DEP) increases inflammatory cytokine expression in the whole brain of embryonic day 18 (E18) males and leads to adverse long-term negative outcomes (Bolton et al., 2012). In contrast, dietary choline supplementation is negatively correlated with inflammatory cytokine production in adult rats and cultured human cells (Zhang et al., 2018; Jiang et al., 2014). When administered as a supplement to pregnant rats, choline also improves working memory in adulthood (Meck et al., 2008; Meck & Williams, 1999; 1997). The current study sought to determine if prenatal dietary choline supplementation protects against the effects of air pollution in the developing brain and in the placenta and fetal liver. These data revealed region-specific microglial morphology alterations in fetal brain and in inflammatory gene expression in the placenta and fetal liver (specifically, Tnf, Tlr2, Tlr4, and Itgam) due to maternal choline supplementation and/or maternal air pollution exposure. We found that DEP led to changes in microglial morphology in the fetal dentate gyrus of E18 male, but not female, fetuses. In the placenta and fetal liver of males, inflammatory gene expression was affected by both DEP and maternal choline supplementation. However, maternal choline supplementation alone upregulated inflammatory gene expression in females, which may indicate an alteration in maturation rate. These data further contribute to the growing literature indicating region- and tissue-specificity in the developmental immune system in the context of maternal exposures.

">Low dimensional criticality embedded in high dimensional awake brain dynamics</a></h4>

              
                Cerebral cortex has been hypothesized to operate close to a critical phase transition. This hypothesis offers an explanation of the observed complexity of brain dynamics and is important because of potential computational advantages near criticality. However, in the awake state, when cortex most needs computation, experimental evidence for criticality has been inconsistent, especially when considering high precision measurements, i.e. spikes of many single neurons measured with millisecond resolution. The inconsistency of previous reports casts doubt on the possibility that awake cortex operates near criticality. Here we show that discrepant previous reports of critical phenomena in the brain may be reconciled by considering dimensionality and dimensionality reduction of brain dynamics. Indeed, fundamental physics of critical phenomena emphasizes the importance of coarse-graining of observables, which is a type of dimensionality reduction. Many detailed microscopic degrees of freedom must be excluded to reveal universal macroscopic features of criticality. We show that coarse graining over neurons and time is a type of dimensionality reduction which reveals low-dimensional critical dynamics in a prominent subspace (first few principal components) of awake cortical dynamics.

	<p>Flavonoids, a group of natural compounds with phenolic structure, are becoming popular as alternative medicines obtained from plants. These compounds are reported to have various pharmacological properties, including attenuation of inflammatory responses in multiple health issues. Epilepsy is a disorder of the central nervous system implicated with the activation of the inflammatory cascade in the brain. The aim of the present study was to summarize the role of various neuroinflammatory mediators in the onset and progression of epilepsy, and, thereafter, to discuss the flavonoids and their classes, including their biological properties. Further, we highlighted the modulation of anti-inflammatory responses achieved by these substances in different forms of epilepsy, as evident from preclinical studies executed on multiple epilepsy models. Overall, the review summarizes the available evidence of the anti-inflammatory potential of various flavonoids in epilepsy.</p>

	<p>Cytoglobin (Cygb), a hemoprotein of the globin family, is expressed in the supportive tissue cells of the fibroblast lineage and in distinct neuronal cell populations. The expression pattern and regulatory parameters of fibroblasts and related cells were studied in organs such as the kidney and liver in a variety of animal models. In contrast, knowledge about cytoglobin-expressing neurons is sparse. Only a few papers described the distribution in the brain as ubiquitous with a restricted number of neurons in focal regions. Although there is evidence for cytoglobin involvement in neuronal hypoxia tolerance, its presence in the auditory system was not studied despite high metabolism rates and oxygen demands of the cochlea and related brainstem centers. In a continuation of a previous study demonstrating Cygb-neurons in, inter alia, auditory regions of the mouse brain, we concentrated on the superior olivary complex (SOC) in the present study. We sought to investigate the distribution, projection pattern and neurochemistry of Cygb-neurons in the SOC. We conducted immunohistochemistry using a Cygb antibody and found that this brainstem region, functionally competent for bilateral hearing and providing cochlear hair cell innervation, contains a considerable number of Cygb-expressing neurons (averaging 2067 &amp;amp;plusmn; 211 making up 10 &amp;amp;plusmn;1% percent of total neuron number) in rats, and 514 &amp;amp;plusmn; 138 (6 &amp;amp;plusmn; 1%) in mice. They were observed in all regions of the SOC. Retrograde neuronal tract tracing with Fluorogold injected into the cochlea demonstrated that 1243 &amp;amp;plusmn; 100 (6 &amp;amp;plusmn; 1% of total neuron number in rat SOC)) were olivocochlear neurons. Approximately 56% of total Cygb neurons were retrogradely labelled, while the majority of olivocochlear neurons of both lateral and medial systems were Cygb-immunoreactive. We also conducted double immunofluorescence staining for Cygb and neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), the enzyme responsible for nitric oxide production, and observed that cytoglobin in the SOC frequently co-localized with nNOS. Our findings suggest that cytoglobin plays an important physiologic role in the oxygen homeostasis of the peripheral and central auditory nervous system. Further studies, also including transgenic animal models, are required to shed more light on the function(s) of Cygb in neurons, in particular of the auditory system.</p>

	<p>Both short- and long-term memories decline with healthy ageing. The aims of the current study were twofold: firstly, to build on previous studies and investigate the presence of a relationship between short- and long-term memories and, secondly, to examine cross-sectionally whether there are changes in this relationship with age. In two experiments, participants across the age range were tested on contextual-spatial memories after short and long memory durations. Experimental control in stimulus materials and task demands enabled the analogous encoding and probing for both memory durations, allowing us to examine the relationship between the two memory systems. Across two experiments, in line with previous studies, we found both short-term memory and long-term memory declined from early to late adulthood. Additionally, there was a significant relationship between short- and long-term memory performance, which, interestingly, persisted throughout the age range. Our findings suggest a significant degree of common vulnerability to healthy ageing for short- and long-term memories sharing the same spatial-contextual associations. Furthermore, our tasks provide a sensitive and promising framework for assessing and comparing memory function at different timescales in disorders with memory deficits at their core.</p>

	<p>Background: Education is believed to contribute positively to brain structure and function, as well as to cognitive reserve. One of the brain regions most impacted by education is the medial temporal lobe (MTL), a region that houses the hippocampus, which has an important role in learning processes and in consolidation of memories, and is also known to undergo neurogenesis in adulthood. We aimed to investigate the influence of education on the absolute cell numbers of the MTL (comprised by the hippocampal formation, amygdala, and parahippocampal gyrus) of men without cognitive impairment. Methods: The Isotropic Fractionator technique was used to allow the anisotropic brain tissue to be transformed into an isotropic suspension of nuclei, and therefore assess the absolute cell composition of the MTL. We dissected twenty-six brains from men aged 47 to 64 years, with either low or high education. Results: A significant difference between groups was observed in brain mass, but not in MTL mass. No significant difference was found between groups in the number of total cells, number of neurons, and number of non-neuronal cells. Regression analysis showed that the total number of cells, number of neurons, and number of non-neuronal cells in MTL were not affected by education. Conclusions: The results indicate a resilience of the absolute cellular composition of the MTL of typical men to low schooling, suggesting that the cellularity of brain regions is not affected by formal education.</p>

	<p>Clinically oriented studies of mood as a function of the menstrual cycle mainly address the negative moods in the premenstrual phase of the cycle. However, a periovulatory increase in positive emotions and motivations related to reproduction has also been noted. Thus, it has been suggested that the drop in mood during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle might be a byproduct of elevated positive moods occurring mid-cycle. The aim of this prospective study was to compare both the positive and negative dimensions of mood across the menstrual cycle. A group of 60 healthy, normally cycling women assessed their mood throughout three phases of their menstrual cycles: the early follicular (low estradiol and progesterone), the late follicular (fertile phase; high estradiol, low progesterone) and the mid-luteal phase (high levels of both estradiol and progesterone). Repeated MANOVA evaluations showed a significant increase in positive (friendly, cheerful, focused, active) and a significant decrease in negative (anxious, depressed, fatigued, hostile) dimensions of mood mid-cycle, i.e., during the late follicular phase (&amp;amp;eta;2 = 0.072&amp;amp;ndash;0.174, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). Contrary to the widespread belief that negative moods are characteristic of the luteal phase (preceding the onset of the next cycle), the post hoc Bonferroni tests showed that none of the mood dimensions differed between the mid-luteal and early follicular phases of the cycle. The results held when controlling for relationship status and order of testing. This pattern of fluctuations is in accordance with the ovulatory-shift hypothesis, i.e., the notion that the emotions of attraction rise during a short window during which the conception is likely.</p>

	<p>Background: Subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS) is widely used for the treatment of primary motor symptoms in patients with Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD). Further, recent evidence suggests that STN-DBS may relieve a few ophthalmic symptoms in PD, such as eye-blink rate and the flexibility of eye saccades. However, its exact effect on visual function remains unknown. Herein, we report the case of a patient with PD who underwent STN-DBS and experienced visual symptoms following levodopa reduction. Case presentation: A 63-year-old male patient with PD developed severe visual impairment after six months of high-frequency STN-DBS. His symptoms resolved after adjusting the levodopa dose prescribed to the patient. Conclusions: This case report suggests that DBS is beneficial in patients with PD in terms of eye-blink rate. However, the rapid reduction of medication after STN-DBS may lead to retinal atrophy and the shrinkage of vessel density in the ocular fundus. Thus, neurosurgeons should pay close attention to patients with visual symptoms when adjusting levodopa dosages.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/43/1/2?rss=1">Trapping of Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptor Ligands Assayed by In Vitro Cellular Studies and In Vivo PET Imaging</a></h4>

              
                <p>A question relevant to nicotine addiction is how nicotine and other nicotinic receptor membrane-permeant ligands, such as the anti-smoking drug varenicline (Chantix), distribute in brain. Ligands, like varenicline, with high pK<SUB>a</SUB> and high affinity for &alpha;4&beta;2-type nicotinic receptors (&alpha;4&beta;2Rs) are trapped in intracellular acidic vesicles containing &alpha;4&beta;2Rs <I>in vitro</I>. Nicotine, with lower pK<SUB>a</SUB> and &alpha;4&beta;2R affinity, is not trapped. Here, we extend our results by imaging nicotinic PET ligands <I>in vivo</I> in male and female mouse brain and identifying the trapping brain organelle <I>in vitro</I> as Golgi satellites (GSats). Two PET <sup>18</sup>F-labeled imaging ligands were chosen: [<sup>18</sup>F]2-FA85380 (2-FA) with varenicline-like pK<SUB>a</SUB> and affinity and [<sup>18</sup>F]Nifene with nicotine-like pK<SUB>a</SUB> and affinity. [<sup>18</sup>F]2-FA PET-imaging kinetics were very slow consistent with 2-FA trapping in &alpha;4&beta;2R-containing GSats. In contrast, [<sup>18</sup>F]Nifene kinetics were rapid, consistent with its binding to &alpha;4&beta;2Rs but no trapping. Specific [<sup>18</sup>F]2-FA and [<sup>18</sup>F]Nifene signals were eliminated in &beta;2 subunit knock-out (KO) mice or by acute nicotine (AN) injections demonstrating binding to sites on &beta;2-containing receptors. Chloroquine (CQ), which dissipates GSat pH gradients, reduced [<sup>18</sup>F]2-FA distributions while having little effect on [<sup>18</sup>F]Nifene distributions <I>in vivo</I> consistent with only [<sup>18</sup>F]2-FA trapping in GSats. These results are further supported by <I>in vitro</I> findings where dissipation of GSat pH gradients blocks 2-FA trapping in GSats without affecting Nifene. By combining <I>in vitro</I> and <I>in vivo</I> imaging, we mapped both the brain-wide and subcellular distributions of weak-base nicotinic receptor ligands. We conclude that ligands, such as varenicline, are trapped in neurons in &alpha;4&beta;2R-containing GSats, which results in very slow release long after nicotine is gone after smoking.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Mechanisms of nicotine addiction remain poorly understood. An earlier study using <I>in vitro</I> methods found that the anti-smoking nicotinic ligand, varenicline (Chantix) was trapped in &alpha;4&beta;2R-containing acidic vesicles. Using a fluorescent-labeled high-affinity nicotinic ligand, this study provided evidence that these intracellular acidic vesicles were &alpha;4&beta;2R-containing Golgi satellites (GSats). <I>In vivo</I> PET imaging with F-18-labeled nicotinic ligands provided additional evidence that differences in PET ligand trapping in acidic vesicles were the cause of differences in PET ligand kinetics and subcellular distributions. These findings combining <I>in vitro</I> and <I>in vivo</I> imaging revealed new mechanistic insights into the kinetics of weak base PET imaging ligands and the subcellular mechanisms underlying nicotine addiction.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/43/1/14?rss=1">Pharmacological Signature and Target Specificity of Inhibitory Circuits Formed by Martinotti Cells in the Mouse Barrel Cortex</a></h4>

              
                <p>In the neocortex, fast synaptic inhibition orchestrates both spontaneous and sensory-evoked activity. GABAergic interneurons (INs) inhibit pyramidal neurons (PNs) directly, modulating their output activity and thus contributing to balance cortical networks. Moreover, several IN subtypes also inhibit other INs, forming specific disinhibitory circuits, which play crucial roles in several cognitive functions. Here, we studied a subpopulation of somatostatin-positive INs, the Martinotti cells (MCs) in layer 2/3 of the mouse barrel cortex (both sexes). MCs inhibit the distal portion of PN apical dendrites, thus controlling dendrite electrogenesis and synaptic integration. Yet, it is poorly understood whether MCs inhibit other elements of the cortical circuits, and the connectivity properties with non-PN targets are unknown. We found that MCs have a strong preference for PN dendrites, but they also considerably connect with parvalbumin-positive, vasoactive intestinal peptide-expressing, and layer 1 (L1) INs. Remarkably, GABAergic synapses from MCs exhibited clear cell type-specific short-term plasticity. Moreover, whereas the biophysical properties of MC-PN synapses were consistent with distal dendritic inhibition, MC-IN synapses exhibited characteristics of fast perisomatic inhibition. Finally, MC-PN connections used &alpha;5-containing GABA<SUB>A</SUB> receptors (GABA<SUB>A</SUB>Rs), but this subunit was not expressed by the other INs targeted by MCs. We reveal a specialized connectivity blueprint of MCs within different elements of superficial cortical layers. In addition, our results identify &alpha;5-GABA<SUB>A</SUB>Rs as the molecular fingerprint of MC-PN dendritic inhibition. This is of critical importance, given the role of &alpha;5-GABA<SUB>A</SUB>Rs in cognitive performance and their involvement in several brain diseases.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Martinotti cells (MCs) are a prominent, broad subclass of somatostatin-expressing GABAergic interneurons, specialized in controlling distal dendrites of pyramidal neurons (PNs) and taking part in several cognitive functions. Here we characterize the connectivity pattern of MCs with other interneurons in the superficial layers (L1 and L2/3) of the mouse barrel cortex. We found that the connectivity pattern of MCs with PNs as well as parvalbumin, vasoactive intestinal peptide, and L1 interneurons exhibit target-specific plasticity and biophysical properties. The specificity of &alpha;5-GABA<SUB>A</SUB>Rs at MC-PN synapses and the lack or functional expression of this subunit by other cell types define the molecular identity of MC-PN connections and the exclusive involvement of this inhibitory circuits in &alpha;5-dependent cognitive tasks.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/43/1/28?rss=1">Synaptic Development in Diverse Olfactory Neuron Classes Uses Distinct Temporal and Activity-Related Programs</a></h4>

              
                <p>Developing neurons must meet core molecular, cellular, and temporal requirements to ensure the correct formation of synapses, resulting in functional circuits. However, because of the vast diversity in neuronal class and function, it is unclear whether or not all neurons use the same organizational mechanisms to form synaptic connections and achieve functional and morphologic maturation. Moreover, it remains unknown whether neurons united in a common goal and comprising the same sensory circuit develop on similar timescales and use identical molecular approaches to ensure the formation of the correct number of synapses. To begin to answer these questions, we took advantage of the <I>Drosophila</I> antennal lobe (AL), a model olfactory circuit with remarkable genetic access and synapse-level resolution. Using tissue-specific genetic labeling of active zones, we performed a quantitative analysis of synapse formation in multiple classes of neurons of both sexes throughout development and adulthood. We found that olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs), projection neurons (PNs), and local interneurons (LNs) each have unique time courses of synaptic development, addition, and refinement, demonstrating that each class follows a distinct developmental program. This raised the possibility that these classes may also have distinct molecular requirements for synapse formation. We genetically altered neuronal activity in each neuronal subtype and observed differing effects on synapse number based on the neuronal class examined. Silencing neuronal activity in ORNs, PNs, and LNs impaired synaptic development but only in ORNs did enhancing neuronal activity influence synapse formation. ORNs and LNs demonstrated similar impairment of synaptic development with enhanced activity of a master kinase, GSK-3&beta;, suggesting that neuronal activity and GSK-3&beta; kinase activity function in a common pathway. ORNs also, however, demonstrated impaired synaptic development with GSK-3&beta; loss-of-function, suggesting additional activity-independent roles in development. Ultimately, our results suggest that the requirements for synaptic development are not uniform across all neuronal classes with considerable diversity existing in both their developmental time frames and molecular requirements. These findings provide novel insights into the mechanisms of synaptic development and lay the foundation for future work determining their underlying etiologies.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Distinct olfactory neuron classes in <I>Drosophila</I> develop a mature synaptic complement over unique timelines and using distinct activity-dependent and molecular programs, despite having the same generalized goal of olfactory sensation.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/43/1/56?rss=1">Preferential Modulatory Action of 5-HT2A Receptors on the Dynamic Regulation of Basal Ganglia Circuits</a></h4>

              
                <p>In rodents, cortical information is transferred to the <I>substantia nigra pars reticulata</I> (SNr) through motor and medial prefrontal (mPF) basal ganglia (BG) circuits implicated in motor and cognitive/motivational behaviors, respectively. The serotonergic 5-HT<SUB>2A</SUB> receptors are located in both of these neuronal networks, displaying topographical differences with a high expression in the associative/limbic territories, and a very low expression in the subthalamic nucleus. This study investigated whether the stimulation of 5-HT<SUB>2A</SUB> receptors could have a specific signature on the dynamic regulation of BG circuits, preferentially modulating the mPF information processing through trans-striatal pathways. We performed <I>in vivo</I> single-unit extracellular recordings to assess the effect of the 5-HT<SUB>2A</SUB> agonist TCB-2 on the spontaneous and cortically evoked activity of lateral and medial SNr neurons in male rats (involved in motor and mPF circuits, respectively). TCB-2 (50&ndash;200 &micro;g/kg, i.v.) increased the basal firing rate and enhanced the cortically evoked inhibitory response of medial SNr neurons (transmission through the direct striato-nigral pathway). A prior administration of the preferential 5-HT<SUB>2A</SUB> receptor antagonist MDL11939 (200 &micro;g/kg, i.v.) did not modify any electrophysiological parameter, but occluded TCB-2-induced effects. In animals treated with the 5-HT synthesis inhibitor pCPA (4-chloro-<scp>dl</scp>-phenylalanine methyl ester hydrochloride), TCB-2 failed to induce the above-mentioned effects, thus suggesting the contribution of endogenous 5-HT. However, the mobilization of 5-HT induced by the acute administration of fluoxetine (10 mg/kg, i.p.) did not mimic the effects triggered by TCB-2. Overall, these data suggest that 5-HT<SUB>2A</SUB> receptors have a preferential modulatory action on the dynamic regulation of BG circuitry.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Motor and medial prefrontal (mPF) basal ganglia (BG) circuits play an important role in integrative brain functions like movement control or cognitive/motivational behavior, respectively. Although these neuronal networks express 5-HT<SUB>2A</SUB> receptors, the expression is higher in associative/limbic structures than in the motor ones. We show a topographical-dependent dissociation in the effects triggered by the 5HT<SUB>2A</SUB> agonist TCB-2, which specifically increases the medial <I>substantia nigra pars reticulata</I> neuron activity and has a preferential action on mPF information processing through the striato-nigral direct pathway. These are very likely to be 5-HT<SUB>2A</SUB> receptor-mediated effects that require mobilization of the endogenous 5-HT system. These findings provide evidence about the specific signature of 5-HT<SUB>2A</SUB> receptors on the dynamic regulation of BG circuits.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/43/1/68?rss=1">Parallel Pathways Provide Hippocampal Spatial Information to Prefrontal Cortex</a></h4>

              
                <p>Long-range synaptic connections define how information flows through neuronal networks. Here, we combined retrograde and anterograde trans-synaptic viruses to delineate areas that exert direct and indirect influence over the dorsal and ventral prefrontal cortex (PFC) of the rat (both sexes). Notably, retrograde tracing using pseudorabies virus (PRV) revealed that both dorsal and ventral areas of the PFC receive prominent disynaptic input from the dorsal CA3 (dCA3) region of the hippocampus. The PRV experiments also identified candidate anatomical relays for this disynaptic pathway, namely, the ventral hippocampus, lateral septum, thalamus, amygdala, and basal forebrain. To determine the viability of each of these relays, we performed three additional experiments. In the first, we injected the retrograde monosynaptic tracer Fluoro-Gold into the PFC and the anterograde monosynaptic tracer Fluoro-Ruby into the dCA3 to confirm the first-order connecting areas and revealed several potential relay regions between the PFC and dCA3. In the second, we combined PRV injection in the PFC with polysynaptic anterograde viral tracer (HSV-1) in the dCA3 to reveal colabeled connecting neurons, which were evident only in the ventral hippocampus. In the third, we combined retrograde adeno-associated virus (AAV) injections in the PFC with an anterograde AAV in the dCA3 to reveal anatomical relay neurons in the ventral hippocampus and dorsal lateral septum. Together, these findings reveal parallel disynaptic pathways from the dCA3 to the PFC, illuminating a new anatomical framework for understanding hippocampal&ndash;prefrontal interactions. We suggest that the representation of context and space may be a universal feature of prefrontal function.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The known functions of the prefrontal cortex are shaped by input from multiple brain areas. We used transneuronal viral tracing to discover multiple prominent disynaptic pathways through which the dorsal hippocampus (specifically, the dorsal CA3) has the potential to shape the actions of the prefrontal cortex. The demonstration of neuronal relays in the ventral hippocampus and lateral septum presents a new foundation for understanding long-range influences over prefrontal interactions, including the specific contribution of the dorsal CA3 to prefrontal function.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/43/1/82?rss=1">Creation of Neuronal Ensembles and Cell-Specific Homeostatic Plasticity through Chronic Sparse Optogenetic Stimulation</a></h4>

              
                <p>Cortical computations emerge from the dynamics of neurons embedded in complex cortical circuits. Within these circuits, neuronal ensembles, which represent subnetworks with shared functional connectivity, emerge in an experience-dependent manner. Here we induced ensembles in <I>ex vivo</I> cortical circuits from mice of either sex by differentially activating subpopulations through chronic optogenetic stimulation. We observed a decrease in voltage correlation, and importantly a synaptic decoupling between the stimulated and nonstimulated populations. We also observed a decrease in firing rate during Up-states in the stimulated population. These ensemble-specific changes were accompanied by decreases in intrinsic excitability in the stimulated population, and a decrease in connectivity between stimulated and nonstimulated pyramidal neurons. By incorporating the empirically observed changes in intrinsic excitability and connectivity into a spiking neural network model, we were able to demonstrate that changes in both intrinsic excitability and connectivity accounted for the decreased firing rate, but only changes in connectivity accounted for the observed decorrelation. Our findings help ascertain the mechanisms underlying the ability of chronic patterned stimulation to create ensembles within cortical circuits and, importantly, show that while Up-states are a global network-wide phenomenon, functionally distinct ensembles can preserve their identity during Up-states through differential firing rates and correlations.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The connectivity and activity patterns of local cortical circuits are shaped by experience. This experience-dependent reorganization of cortical circuits is driven by complex interactions between different local learning rules, external input, and reciprocal feedback between many distinct brain areas. Here we used an <I>ex vivo</I> approach to demonstrate how simple forms of chronic external stimulation can shape local cortical circuits in terms of their correlated activity and functional connectivity. The absence of feedback between different brain areas and full control of external input allowed for a tractable system to study the underlying mechanisms and development of a computational model. Results show that differential stimulation of subpopulations of neurons significantly reshapes cortical circuits and forms subnetworks referred to as neuronal ensembles.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/43/1/93?rss=1">A Redundant Cortical Code for Speech Envelope</a></h4>

              
                <p>Animal communication sounds exhibit complex temporal structure because of the amplitude fluctuations that comprise the sound envelope. In human speech, envelope modulations drive synchronized activity in auditory cortex (AC), which correlates strongly with comprehension (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B17">Giraud and Poeppel, 2012</cross-ref>; <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B47">Peelle and Davis, 2012</cross-ref>; <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B20">Haegens and Zion Golumbic, 2018</cross-ref>). Studies of envelope coding in single neurons, performed in nonhuman animals, have focused on periodic amplitude modulation (AM) stimuli and use response metrics that are not easy to juxtapose with data from humans. In this study, we sought to bridge these fields. Specifically, we looked directly at the temporal relationship between stimulus envelope and spiking, and we assessed whether the apparent diversity across neurons' AM responses contributes to the population representation of speech-like sound envelopes. We gathered responses from single neurons to vocoded speech stimuli and compared them to sinusoidal AM responses in auditory cortex (AC) of alert, freely moving Mongolian gerbils of both sexes. While AC neurons displayed heterogeneous tuning to AM rate, their temporal dynamics were stereotyped. Preferred response phases accumulated near the onsets of sinusoidal AM periods for slower rates (&lt;8 Hz), and an over-representation of amplitude edges was apparent in population responses to both sinusoidal AM and vocoded speech envelopes. Crucially, this encoding bias imparted a decoding benefit: a classifier could discriminate vocoded speech stimuli using summed population activity, while higher frequency modulations required a more sophisticated decoder that tracked spiking responses from individual cells. Together, our results imply that the envelope structure relevant to parsing an acoustic stream could be read-out from a distributed, redundant population code.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Animal communication sounds have rich temporal structure and are often produced in extended sequences, including the syllabic structure of human speech. Although the auditory cortex (AC) is known to play a crucial role in representing speech syllables, the contribution of individual neurons remains uncertain. Here, we characterized the representations of both simple, amplitude-modulated sounds and complex, speech-like stimuli within a broad population of cortical neurons, and we found an overrepresentation of amplitude edges. Thus, a phasic, redundant code in auditory cortex can provide a mechanistic explanation for segmenting acoustic streams like human speech.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/43/1/113?rss=1">Activity Patterns of Individual Neurons and Ensembles Correlated with Retrieval of a Contextual Memory in the Dorsal CA1 of Mouse Hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                <p>The hippocampus is crucial for retrieval of contextual memories. The activation of a subpopulation of neurons in the dorsal CA1 (dCA1) of the hippocampus is required for memory retrieval. Given that hippocampal neurons exhibit distinct patterns of response during memory retrieval, the activity patterns of individual neurons or ensembles may be critically involved in memory retrieval. However, this relation has been unclear. To investigate this question, we used an <I>in vivo</I> microendoscope calcium imaging technique to optically record neuronal activity in the dCA1 of male and female mice. We observed that a portion of dCA1 neurons increased their responses to the learned context after contextual fear conditioning (FC), resulting in overall increase in response of neuronal population compared with simple context exposure. Such increased response was specific to the conditioned context as it disappeared in neutral context. The magnitude of increase in neuronal responses by FC was proportional to memory strength during retrieval. The increases in activity preferentially occurred during the putative sharp wave ripple events and were not simply because of animal's movement and immobility. At the ensemble level, synchronous cell activity patterns were associated with memory retrieval. Accordingly, when such patterns were more similar between conditioned and neutral context, animals displayed proportionally more similar level of freezing. Together, these results indicate that increase in responses of individual neurons and synchronous cell activity patterns in the dCA1 neuronal network are critically involved in representing a contextual memory recall.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Neurons in the dorsal CA1 of the hippocampus are crucial for memory retrieval. By using <I>in vivo</I> calcium imaging methods for recording neuronal activity, we demonstrate that dCA1 neurons increased their responses to the learned context specifically by FC and such changes correlated with memory strength during retrieval. Moreover, distinct synchronous cell activity patterns were formed by FC and involved in representing contextual memory retrieval. These findings reveal dynamic activity features of dCA1 neurons that are involved in contextual memory retrieval.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/43/1/125?rss=1">Action Observation Network Activity Related to Object-Directed and Socially-Directed Actions in Adolescents</a></h4>

              
                <p>The human action observation network (AON) encompasses brain areas consistently engaged when we observe other's actions. Although the core nodes of the AON are present from childhood, it is not known to what extent they are sensitive to different action features during development. Because social cognitive abilities continue to mature during adolescence, the AON response to socially-oriented actions, but not to object-related actions, may differ in adolescents and adults. To test this hypothesis, we scanned with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) male and female typically-developing teenagers (<I>n</I> = 28; 13 females) and adults (<I>n</I> = 25; 14 females) while they passively watched videos of manual actions varying along two dimensions: sociality (i.e., directed toward another person or not) and transitivity (i.e., involving an object or not). We found that action observation recruited the same fronto-parietal and occipito-temporal regions in adults and adolescents. The modulation of voxel-wise activity according to the social or transitive nature of the action was similar in both groups of participants. Multivariate pattern analysis, however, revealed that decoding accuracies in intraparietal sulcus (IPS)/superior parietal lobe (SPL) for both sociality and transitivity were lower for adolescents compared with adults. In addition, in the lateral occipital temporal cortex (LOTC), generalization of decoding across the orthogonal dimension was lower for sociality only in adolescents. These findings indicate that the representation of the content of others' actions, and in particular their social dimension, in the adolescent AON is still not as robust as in adults.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The activity of the action observation network (AON) in the human brain is modulated according to the purpose of the observed action, in particular the extent to which it involves interaction with an object or with another person. How this conceptual representation of actions is implemented during development is largely unknown. Here, using multivoxel pattern analysis (MVPA) of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data, we discovered that, while the action observation network is in place in adolescence, the fine-grain organization of its posterior regions is less robust than in adults to decode the abstract social dimensions of an action. This finding highlights the late maturation of social processing in the human brain.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/43/1/142?rss=1">Rapid Interactions of Widespread Brain Networks Characterize Semantic Cognition</a></h4>

              
                <p>Language comprehension requires the rapid retrieval and integration of contextually appropriate concepts ("semantic cognition"). Current neurobiological models of semantic cognition are limited by the spatial and temporal restrictions of single-modality neuroimaging and lesion approaches. This is a major impediment given the rapid sequence of processing steps that have to be coordinated to accurately comprehend language. Through the use of fused functional magnetic resonance imaging and electroencephalography analysis in humans (<I>n</I> = 26 adults; 15 females), we elucidate a temporally and spatially specific neurobiological model for real-time semantic cognition. We find that semantic cognition in the context of language comprehension is supported by trade-offs between widespread neural networks over the course of milliseconds. Incorporation of spatial and temporal characteristics, as well as behavioral measures, provide convergent evidence for the following progression: a hippocampal/anterior temporal phonological semantic retrieval network (peaking at ~300 ms after the sentence final word); a frontotemporal thematic semantic network (~400 ms); a hippocampal memory update network (~500 ms); an inferior frontal semantic syntactic reappraisal network (~600 ms); and nodes of the default mode network associated with conceptual coherence (~750 ms). Additionally, in typical adults, mediatory relationships among these networks are significantly predictive of language comprehension ability. These findings provide a conceptual and methodological framework for the examination of speech and language disorders, with additional implications for the characterization of cognitive processes and clinical populations in other cognitive domains.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The present study identifies a real-time neurobiological model of the meaning processes required during language comprehension (i.e., "semantic cognition"). Using a novel application of fused magnetic resonance imaging and electroencephalography in humans, we found that semantic cognition during language comprehension is supported by a rapid progression of widespread neural networks related to meaning, meaning integration, memory, reappraisal, and conceptual cohesion. Relationships among these systems were predictive of individuals' language comprehension efficiency. Our findings are the first to use fused neuroimaging analysis to elucidate language processes. In so doing, this study provides a new conceptual and methodological framework in which to characterize language processes and guide the treatment of speech and language deficits/disorders.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/43/1/155?rss=1">Selective TLR4 Antagonism Prevents and Reverses Morphine-Induced Persistent Postoperative Cognitive Dysfunction, Dysregulation of Synaptic Elements, and Impaired BDNF Signaling in Aged Male Rats</a></h4>

              
                <p>Perioperative neurocognitive disorders (PNDs) are characterized by confusion, difficulty with executive function, and episodic memory impairment in the hours to months following a surgical procedure. Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) represents such impairments that last beyond 30 d postsurgery and is associated with increased risk of comorbidities, progression to dementia, and higher mortality. While it is clear that neuroinflammation plays a key role in PND development, what factors underlie shorter self-resolving versus persistent PNDs remains unclear. We have previously shown that postoperative morphine treatment extends POCD from 4 d (without morphine) to at least 8 weeks (with morphine) in aged male rats, and that this effect is likely dependent on the proinflammatory capabilities of morphine via activation of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). Here, we extend these findings to show that TLR4 blockade, using the selective TLR4 antagonist lipopolysaccharide from the bacterium <I>Rhodobacter sphaeroides</I> (LPS-RS Ultrapure), ameliorates morphine-induced POCD in aged male rats. Using either a single central preoperative treatment or a 1 week postoperative central treatment regimen, we demonstrate that TLR4 antagonism (1) prevents and reverses the long-term memory impairment associated with surgery and morphine treatment, (2) ameliorates morphine-induced dysregulation of the postsynaptic proteins postsynaptic density 95 and synaptopodin, (3) mitigates reductions in mature BDNF, and (4) prevents decreased activation of the BDNF receptor TrkB (tropomyosin-related kinase B), all at 4 weeks postsurgery. We also reveal that LPS-RS Ultrapure likely exerts its beneficial effects by preventing endogenous danger signal HMGB1 (high-mobility group box 1) from activating TLR4, rather than by blocking continuous activation by morphine or its metabolites. These findings suggest TLR4 as a promising therapeutic target to prevent or treat PNDs.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> With humans living longer than ever, it is crucial that we identify mechanisms that contribute to aging-related vulnerability to cognitive impairment. Here, we show that the innate immune receptor toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) is a key mediator of cognitive dysfunction in aged rodents following surgery and postoperative morphine treatment. Inhibition of TLR4 both prevented and reversed surgery plus morphine-associated memory impairment, dysregulation of synaptic elements, and reduced BDNF signaling. Together, these findings implicate TLR4 in the development of postoperative cognitive dysfunction, providing mechanistic insight and novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of cognitive impairments following immune challenges such as surgery in older individuals.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/43/1/173?rss=1">The Neural Signature of Impaired Inhibitory Control in Individuals with Heroin Use Disorder</a></h4>

              
                <p>Heroin addiction imposes a devastating toll on society, with little known about its neurobiology. Excessive salience attribution to drug over nondrug cues/reinforcers, with concomitant inhibitory control decreases, are common mechanisms underlying drug addiction. Although inhibitory control alterations generally culminate in prefrontal cortex (PFC) hypoactivations across drugs of abuse, patterns in individuals with heroin addiction (iHUDs) remain unknown. We used a stop-signal fMRI task designed to meet recent consensus guidelines in mapping inhibitory control in 41 iHUDs and 24 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HCs). Despite group similarities in the stop-signal response time (SSRT; the classic inhibitory control measure), compared with HCs, iHUDs exhibited impaired target detection sensitivity (proportion of hits in go vs false alarms in stop trials; <I>p</I> = 0.003). Additionally, iHUDs exhibited lower right anterior PFC (aPFC) and dorsolateral PFC (dlPFC) activity during successful versus failed stops (the hallmark inhibitory control contrast). Lower left dlPFC/supplementary motor area (SMA) activity was associated with slower SSRT specifically in iHUDs and lower left aPFC activity with worse target sensitivity across all participants (<I>p</I> &lt; 0.05 corrected). Importantly, in iHUDs, lower left SMA and aPFC activity during inhibitory control was associated with shorter time since last use and higher severity of dependence, respectively (<I>p</I> &lt; 0.05 corrected). Together, results revealed lower perceptual sensitivity and hypoactivations during inhibitory control in cognitive control regions (e.g., aPFC, dlPFC, SMA) as associated with task performance and heroin use severity measures in iHUDs. Such neurobehavioral inhibitory control deficits may contribute to self-control lapses in heroin addiction, constituting targets for prevention and intervention efforts to enhance recovery.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Heroin addiction continues its deadly impact, with little known about the neurobiology of this disorder. Although behavioral and prefrontal cortical impairments in inhibitory control characterize addiction across drugs of abuse, these patterns remain underexplored in heroin addiction. Here, we illustrate a significant behavioral impairment in target discrimination in individuals with heroin addiction compared with matched healthy controls. We further show lower engagement during inhibitory control in the anterior and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (key regions that regulate cognitive control) as associated with slower stopping, worse discrimination, and heroin use measures. Mapping the neurobiology of inhibitory control in heroin addiction for the first time, we identify potential treatment targets inclusive of prefrontal cortex-mediated cognitive control amenable for neuromodulation en route to recovery.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Postsynaptic scaffolding proteins function as central organization hubs, ensuring the synaptic localization of neurotransmitter receptors, trans-synaptic adhesion proteins, and signaling molecules. Gephyrin is the major postsynaptic scaffolding protein at glycinergic and a subset of GABAergic inhibitory synapses. In contrast to cells outside the CNS, where one gephyrin isoform is predominantly expressed, neurons express different splice variants. In this study, we characterized the expression and scaffolding of neuronal gephyrin isoforms differing in the inclusion of the C4 cassettes located in the central C-domain. In hippocampal and cortical neuronal populations, gephyrin P1, lacking additional cassettes, is the most abundantly expressed isoform. In addition, alternative splicing generated isoforms carrying predominantly C4a, and minor amounts of C4c or C4d cassettes. We detected no striking difference in C4 isoform expression between different neuron types and a single neuron can likely express all C4 isoforms. To avoid the cytosolic aggregates that are commonly observed upon exogenous gephyrin expression, we used adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated expression to analyze the scaffolding behavior of individual C4 isoforms in murine dissociated hippocampal glutamatergic neurons. While all isoforms showed similar clustering at GABAergic synapses, a thorough quantitative analysis revealed localization differences for the C4c isoform (also known as P2). Specifically, synaptic C4c isoform clusters showed a more distal dendritic localization and reduced occurrence at P1-predominating synapses. Additionally, inhibitory currents displayed faster decay kinetics in the presence of gephyrin C4c compared with P1. Therefore, inhibitory synapse heterogeneity may be influenced, at least in part, by mechanisms relating to C4 cassette splicing.</p>

                <p>The study used machine learning to predict The American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale (AIS) scores for newly injured spinal cord injury patients at hospital discharge time from hospital admission data. Additionally, machine learning was used to analyze the best model for feature importance to validate the criticality of the AIS score and highlight relevant demographic details. The data used for training machine learning models was from the National Spinal Cord Injury Statistical Center (NSCISC) database of U.S. spinal cord injury patient details. Eighteen real features were used from 417 provided features, which mapped to 53 machine learning features after processing. Eight models were tuned on the dataset to predict AIS scores, and Shapely analysis was performed to extract the most important of the 53 features. Patients within the NSCISC database who sustained injuries were between 1972 and 2016 after data cleaning (<I>n</I> = 20,790). Outcomes were test set multiclass accuracy and aggregated Shapely score magnitudes. Ridge Classifier was the best performer with 73.6% test set accuracy. AIS scores and neurologic category at the time of admission were the best predictors of recovery. Demographically, features were less important, but age, sex, marital status, and race stood out. AIS scores on admission are highly predictive of patient outcomes when combined with patient demographic data. Promising results in terms of predicting recovery were seen, and Shapely analysis allowed for the machine learning model to be probed as a whole, giving insight into overall feature trends.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Environmental enrichment (EE) is beneficial for brain development and function, but our understanding of its capacity to drive circuit repair, the underlying mechanisms, and how this might vary with age remains limited. Ten-m3 knock-out (KO) mice exhibit a dramatic and stereotyped mistargeting of ipsilateral retinal inputs to the thalamus, resulting in visual deficits. We have recently shown a previously unexpected capacity for EE during early postnatal life (from birth for six weeks) to drive the partial elimination of miswired axonal projections, along with a recovery of visually mediated behavior, but the timeline of this repair was unclear. Here, we reveal that with just 3.5 weeks of EE from birth, Ten-m3 KOs exhibit a partial behavioral rescue, accompanied by pruning of the most profoundly miswired retinogeniculate terminals. Analysis suggests that the pruning is underway at this time point, providing an ideal opportunity to probe potential mechanisms. With the shorter EE-period, we found a localized increase in microglial density and activation profile within the identified geniculate region where corrective pruning was observed. No comparable response to EE was found in age-matched wild-type (WT) mice. These findings identify microglia as a potential mechanistic link through which EE drives the elimination of miswired neural circuits during early postnatal development.

                Previous research has indicated that some aspects of Chinese culture became more individualistic. However, prior studies have suggested a decrease in individualism in other aspects of China. Thus, it was unclear whether China became more individualistic. Therefore, the current research investigated whether Chinese culture became more individualistic by examining historical changes in family structure. Specifically, I analyzed temporal shifts in the divorce rate and household size, which have been confirmed as valid representative indicators of individualism. Results showed that the divorce rate increased between 1978 and 2017 and household size decreased between 1953 and 2017, indicating a rise in individualism. Moreover, analyses suggested that the one-child policy was unlikely the sole and major factor in the decrease in household size. Additionally, the aggregated score of divorce rate and household size demonstrated a clear increase in individualism. Therefore, the present research provided further evidence of the rise in individualism in China.

                The objective of this article is to establish whether the judges depend on relevant facts, judicial rules, and the law when making their judgments or they use extraneous factors such as what a judge eats, personal ideology, beliefs, or the cultural and political environment. The discourse between the two sides is incomplete without exploring the grand theories: formalism and realism. The antimony between the two theories resulted in theoretical analysis and empirical research. The realism challenged the existing logical reasoning and legal rules that judges use in making their judgment as they contend that judges applying rules and law in their decision-making process are irrational and mechanical. Formalism insists on using the judicial rules and the law in making decisions as opposed to extraneous factors, which realists contend should be the basis for decision making with laws and rules only to support the findings. The continental legal theory holds that legal realism is a hard-nosed, down-to-earth, and practical school of thought that is opposed to mechanical and scientific theories. The scholarly analysis of the judicial decision-making process brings into focus the conduct of judicial officers and whether they base their reasoning on extrajudicial issues. However, the discussion should avoid denigrating into an attack on the personality of judges as it undermines the rule of law.

                Background: Patients with Crohn’s disease (CD) have an altered intestinal microbiome, which may facilitate novel diagnostic testing. However, accuracy of microbiome classification models across geographic regions may be limited. Therefore, we sought to examine geographic variation in the microbiome of patients with CD from North America and test the performance of a machine learning classification model across geographic regions. Methods: The RISK cohort included 447 pediatric patients with CD and 221 non-inflammatory bowel disease controls from across North America. Terminal ileum, rectal and fecal samples were obtained prior to treatment for microbiome analysis. We divided study sites into 3 geographic regions to examine regional microbiome differences. We trained and tested the performance of a machine learning classification model across these regions. Results: No differences were seen in the mucosal microbiome of patients with CD across regions or in either the fecal or mucosal microbiomes of controls. Machine learning classification algorithms for patients with CD performed well across regions (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUROC] range of 0.85-0.91) with the best results from terminal ileum. Conclusions: This study demonstrated the feasibility of microbiome based diagnostic testing in pediatric patients with CD within North America, independently from regional influences.

                Background: The 44-question Thai Home Fall Hazard Assessment Tool (Thai-HFHAT) was developed to assist healthcare professionals in identifying the risk of falls among community-dwelling elderly from their home environment. However, the reliability of this tool has not been studied. This study aimed to examine reliability of the 44-question Thai-HFHAT and determine the person characteristics associated with home hazards. Methods: A descriptive cross-sectional study design was used for this research. The participants in this study were 51 elderly people from various types of Thai houses: a one-story elevated house, a one-story non-elevated house, and a house with two or more floors, 51 caregivers of elderly patients and 5 village health volunteers (VHV). All participants answered 44 Thai-HFHAT questions to determine inter-rater and test-retest reliabilities. The reliabilities were analyzed using an intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC). Personal characteristics including sex, occupation, and education were used to identify the factors affecting home hazard and linear regression was used to analyze. Results: The ICC of inter-rater reliability of the 44-question Thai-HFHAT was 0.74 (95% CI: 0.57-0.84) and the test-retest reliability was 0.80 (95% CI: 0.64-0.88) for the elderly, 0.80 (95% CI: 0.65-0.89) for the caregivers and 0.70 (95% CI: 0.477-0.83) for the VHV. Personal business career and education level grade 1-3 are less than 0.05, which showed these factors had a significant relationship with the 44-question Thai-HFHAT score as dependent variable. Conclusions: The 44-question Thai-HFHAT is suitable for the home hazards assessment among the elderly in Thailand. Further studies are needed to investigate changes in the house environment after using the 44-question Thai-HFHAT to determine which changes can reduce the risk of fall.

                Foreign bodies (FB) in the aerodigestive tract are common, especially in children. The type of foreign body in the esophagus can vary and include magnets. A magnet that lodges in the esophagus should be extracted within 24 hours to prevent complications due to associated chemical reactions. In rural areas, there are several limitations to extracting FBs from the esophagus. We report a case of a magnetic FB that lodged in the esophagus of a three-year-old boy. The extraction was successfully done by esophagoscopy with the modification of a hook that was attached to the endoscope. This innovation may help otolaryngologists all over the world, especially in rural areas. In the future, this innovation could be produced on an industrial scale.

                Background: A growing body of research indicates that psychological coercive control poses a threat in academic environments. Little is known, however, about the process, the dynamics, and the phases used to impose silently a variety of non-violent assaults on students and academics. A lack of awareness of coercive intimidation and psychological coercive control obstructs a student’s path to academic achievement, which can have an impact on his or her emotional and mental well-being and diminishes the prosperity of society.   Methods: A methodological selection and review of the scientific literature, theories, and practice on psychological intimidation, coercive control, and systems thinking has been employed in this study. A comprehensive reflective analysis and critical synthesis of the relevant scientific literature were conducted to gain insight into the design of a model of psychological coercive control applicable to educational environments.   Results: This article identifies gaps in research theory and practice and examines critical issues of intimidation and psychological coercive control that is relevant to educational contexts. The article proposes a conceptual model of psychological coercive control as a direction for further research.   Conclusions: Adequate awareness, models, and training programmes in relation to coercive infiltration are missing at higher education institutions. There is an urgent need for a curriculum change that may serve to promote support systems thinking and security awareness in educational environments.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Polygenic variation accounts for a substantial portion of the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD), but its effect on the rate of fibrillar-tau accumulation as a key driver of dementia symptoms is unclear.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We combined the to-date largest number of genetic risk variants of AD (n = 85 lead single-nucleotide polymorphisms [SNPs]) from recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to generate a polygenic score (PGS). We assessed longitudinal tau-positron emission tomography (PET), amyloid-PET, and cognition in 231 participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Using the PGS, together with global amyloid-PET, we predicted the rate of tau-PET increases in Braak-stage regions-of-interest and cognitive decline. We also assessed PGS-risk enrichment effects on the required sample size in clinical trials targeting tau pathology.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We found that a higher PGS was associated with higher rates of tau-PET accumulation, in particular at elevated amyloid-PET levels. The tau-PET increases mediated the association between PGS and faster cognitive decline. Risk enrichment through high PGS afforded sample size savings by 34%.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our results demonstrate that the PGS predicts faster tau progression and thus cognitive decline, showing utility to enhance statistical power in clinical trials. ANN NEUROL 2023</p>

     alt="Biomarkers of Migraine and Cluster Headache: Differences and Similarities"/>
<p>We aimed to identify interictal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) biomarkers that differentiate migraine from cluster headache patients, using a machine learning approach, and clinical and multimodal MRI data. The accuracy for classifying headache patients from controls was 80%. The MRI and MRI–clinical combined classifiers distinguishing cluster headache from migraine yielded an accuracy of 78% and 99%. Hypothalamic and periaqueductal gray functional networks were the most important MRI features in classifying headache patients from controls. The thalamic network was the most discriminative MRI feature in classifying migraine from cluster headache.
</p>
<br/>
<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>This study was undertaken to identify magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) biomarkers that differentiate migraine from cluster headache patients and imaging features that are shared.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Clinical, functional, and structural MRI data were obtained from 20 migraineurs, 20 cluster headache patients, and 15 healthy controls. Support vector machine algorithms and a stepwise removal process were used to discriminate headache patients from controls, and subgroups of patients. Regional between-group differences and association between imaging features and patients' clinical characteristics were also investigated.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The accuracy for classifying headache patients from controls was 80%. The classification accuracy for discrimination between migraine and controls was 89%, and for cluster headache and controls it was 98%. For distinguishing cluster headache from migraine patients, the MRI classifier yielded an accuracy of 78%, whereas MRI–clinical combined classification model achieved an accuracy of 99%. Bilateral hypothalamic and periaqueductal gray (PAG) functional networks were the most important MRI features in classifying migraine and cluster headache patients from controls. The left thalamic network was the most discriminative MRI feature in classifying migraine from cluster headache patients. Compared to migraine, cluster headache patients showed decreased functional interaction between the left thalamus and cortical areas mediating interoception and sensory integration. The presence of restlessness was the most important clinical feature in discriminating the two groups of patients.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Functional biomarkers, including the hypothalamic and PAG networks, are shared by migraine and cluster headache patients. The thalamocortical pathway may be the neural substrate that differentiates migraine from cluster headache attacks with their distinct clinical features. ANN NEUROL 2023</p>

                <h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>Structural imaging of the cholinergic basal forebrain may provide a biomarker for cholinergic system integrity that can be used in motor and non-motor outcome studies in Parkinson's disease. However, no prior studies have validated these structural metrics with cholinergic nerve terminal in vivo imaging in Parkinson's disease. Here, we correlate cholinergic basal forebrain morphometry with the topography of vesicular acetylcholine transporter in a large Parkinson's sample.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>[<sup>18</sup>F]-Fluoroethoxybenzovesamicol vesicular acetylcholine transporter positron emission tomography was carried out in 101 non-demented people with Parkinson's (76.24% male, mean age 67.6 ± 7.72 years, disease duration 5.7 ± 4.4 years). Subregional cholinergic basal forebrain volumes were measured using magnetic resonance imaging morphometry. Relationships were assessed via volume-of-interest based correlation analysis.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Subregional volumes of the cholinergic basal forebrain predicted cholinergic nerve terminal loss, with most robust correlations occurring between the posterior cholinergic basal forebrain and temporofrontal, insula, cingulum and hippocampal regions, and with modest correlations in parieto-occipital regions. Hippocampal correlations were not limited to the cholinergic basal forebrain subregion Ch1-2. Correlations were also observed in the striatum, thalamus and brainstem.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Cholinergic basal forebrain morphometry is a robust predictor of regional cerebral vesicular acetylcholine transporter bindings, especially in the anterior brain. The relative lack of correlation between parieto-occipital binding and basal forebrain volumes may reflect the presence of more diffuse synaptopathy in the posterior cortex due to etiologies that extend well beyond the cholinergic system.</p>
