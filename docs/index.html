Here, authors show that maternal high-fat diets trigger immune-metabolic dysregulation, elevating neurotoxic kynurenine metabolites in fetal brains, and blocking these pathways rescues social deficits in male mice, highlighting preventive strategies for neurodevelopmental disorders.

                Berry et al. report a RAS-independent role of the NF1 tumor suppressor in regulating the immune checkpoint protein PD-L1. Their results may explain, in part, the higher response rates of patients with NF1 mutant melanoma to anti-PD-1 immunotherapies. Their work supports the examination of anti-PD-1 therapies in other NF1 mutant cancers.

                Using a model for breast cancer, Pereira et al. report that the induction of metastatic dormancy in the lungs requires CD8+ T cells aided by CD4+ T cells, with IFNγ as a key mediator. Awakening depends on inflammatory signals, notably IL-17A, while maintenance of dormancy occurs independently of lymphocyte surveillance.

">Reading fluency development is predicted by cortical latency</a></h4>

              
                The development of fluent literacy skills from childhood to adolescence is strongly constrained by the temporal dynamics of word recognition. Capturing the neural basis of these subtle timing changes in word recognition has remained challenging with EEG measures that lack reliability at the individual subject level. Here, we leverage phase information from Steady-State Visual Evoked Potentials (SSVEPs) to derive precise and reliable temporal dynamics of neural signatures underlying visual word form recognition at the individual level and examine their relationship to reading fluency and comprehension. Typically developing readers (N = 68), aged 8-15 years, viewed a stream of four-character stimulus strings presented at 3 Hz. Significant SSVEP signals emerged for nearly all participants. Signals at 3, 6, and 9 Hz harmonics exhibited a phase pattern consistent with a delay model, indicating a mean latency of approximately 170 milliseconds. Individual variations in latencies demonstrated (a) high internal consistency (R = .94); (b) stability across variations in letter string forms (familiar words, nonwords with familiar letters, nonwords with unfamiliar pseudo-characters); (c) a linear relationship with age; and most remarkably, (d) a predictive relationship with individual variation in reading fluency and reading comprehension. These results establish SSVEP visual word form latency as a promising approach for investigating the neural basis of reading development, paving the way for future translational applications in education and offering potential solutions to broader societal challenges in promoting population-level reading fluency.

">Dissecting the sublexical route for reading: Frontal and parietal networks support learned orthography-to-phonology mappings</a></h4>

              
                Oral reading relies on lexical and sublexical processes with distinct neural mechanisms. Damage within the sublexical system causes phonological alexia, a blanket diagnosis describing acquired deficits in reading unfamiliar words. Improving the precision of alexia diagnosis requires understanding the neurocognitive basis of specific reading subprocesses. This study investigated the neural correlates of sublexical reading in 64 adults with chronic left-hemisphere stroke (LHS), focusing on lesions that impair the use of learned orthography-to-phonology (OP) mappings to read new words. Participants read aloud real words and three types of pseudowords varying in the number of plausible OP mappings at the level of the orthographic body: zero mappings (0M), one mapping (1M), and multiple mappings (MM). LHS participants exhibited phonological reading deficits with an exaggerated lexicality effect compared to 71 neurotypical controls. Across both groups, pseudowords with learned OP mappings were read more accurately than those without. Voxelwise and connectome-based lesion-symptom mapping revealed that relative lexical reading deficits were associated with lateral temporal lesions, while sublexical reading deficits were associated with lesions or disconnections of the left inferior frontal (IFG), supramarginal, and pre/postcentral gyri. Applying learned OP mappings relied on anterior IFG and frontoparietal connections, while resolving multiple plausible OP mappings relied on intraparietal connections. These results underscore the role of learned mutigraphemic OP mappings in sublexical reading, and demonstrate that disruptions of different sublexical reading subprocesses result in subtly different deficit patterns. Dissecting the neurocognitive basis of reading subprocesses may improve the precision of alexia diagnosis and point to new treatments.

">The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly: Segmentation-Based Quality Control of Structural Magnetic Resonance Images</a></h4>

              
                The processing and analysis of magnetic resonance images is highly dependent on the quality of the input data, and systematic differences in quality can consequently lead to loss of sensitivity or biased results. However, varying image properties due to different scanners and acquisition protocols, as well as subject-specific image interferences, such as motion artifacts, can be incorporated in the analysis. A reliable assessment of image quality is therefore essential to identify critical outliers that may bias results. Here we present a quality assessment for structural (T1-weighted) images using tissue classification. We introduce multiple useful image quality measures, standardize them into quality scales and combine them into an integrated structural image quality rating to facilitate the interpretation and fast identification of outliers with (motion) artifacts. The reliability and robustness of the measures are evaluated using synthetic and real datasets. Our study results demonstrate that the proposed measures are robust to simulated segmentation problems and variables of interest such as cortical atrophy, age, sex, brain size and severe disease-related changes, and might facilitate the separation of motion artifacts based on within-protocol deviations. The quality control framework presents a simple but powerful tool for the use in research and clinical settings.

">Influence of contextual exposure on memory strength and precision for inhibitory avoidance in male and female rats</a></h4>

              
                Aversive associative learning paradigms such as inhibitory avoidance (IA) are frequently used to examine episodic-like memories in rodents. In IA, rodents learn to associate a context with a footshock, followed by testing for memory strength in the original training context and for memory precision in a similar yet distinct neutral context. The present work assessed the effects of different contextual exposure procedures on memory strength and precision in IA at both recent and remote time points using male and female Long-Evans rats. An initial experiment found that rats kept in the lit (non-shock) compartment of the IA apparatus for 60 s during training, as opposed to 10 s, displayed enhanced memory strength, with discrimination between both chambers at the recent retention test and generalization at the remote retention test. Subsequent experiments investigated the effects of contextual pre-exposure the day before training. The results indicate that pre-exposure to the neutral context promoted generalization without altering memory strength compared to the first experiment. In contrast, pre-exposure to the aversive chamber promoted discrimination and enhanced memory strength. Notably, the different procedures yielded similar effects in both sexes. However, the results also indicate an overall pattern of greater contextual discrimination in females compared to males. These findings provide evidence for how different contextual exposures influence the degree of encoding at the time of training and a behavioral foundation for future studies examining the neurobiological mechanisms underlying memory strength and precision in IA, while highlighting the importance of using both sexes in initial behavioral work.

">Broadband synergy versus oscillatory redundancy in the visual cortex</a></h4>

              
                The cortex generates diverse neural dynamics, ranging from broadband fluctuations to narrowband oscillations in specific frequency bands. Here, we investigated whether broadband and oscillatory dynamics play different roles in the encoding and transmission of synergistic and redundant information. We used information-theoretical measures to dissociate neural signals sharing common information (i.e., redundancy) from signals encoding complementary information (i.e., synergy). We analyzed electrocorticography (ECoG) and local field potentials (LFP) in the visual cortex of human and non-human primates (macaque) to investigate to what extent broadband signals (BB) and narrowband gamma (NBG) oscillations conveyed synergistic or redundant information about images. In both species, the information conveyed by BB signals was highly synergistic within and between visual areas. By contrast, the information carried by NBG was primarily redundant within and between the same visual areas. Finally, the information conveyed by BB signals emerged early after stimulus onset, while NBG sustained information at later time points. These results suggest that broadband activity encodes information synergistically while gamma-band oscillatory activity encodes information redundantly in the visual cortex.

">Persistent representation of a prior schema in the orbitofrontal cortex facilitates learning of a conflicting schema</a></h4>

              
                Schemas allow efficient behavior in new situations, but reliance on them can impair flexibility when new demands conflict, culminating in psychopathology. Evidence implicates the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) in deploying schemas in new situations congruent with previously acquired knowledge. But how does this role affect learning of a conflicting behavioral schema? Here we addressed this question by recording single-unit activity in the OFC of rats learning odor problems with identical external information but orthogonal rules governing reward. Consistent with schema formation, OFC representations adapted to track the underlying rules, and both performance and encoding was faster on subsequent than initial problems. Surprisingly however, when the rule governing reward changed, persistent representation of the prior schema was correlated with acquisition of the new. Thus, OFC was not a source of interference and instead supported new learning by accurately and independently representing the old schema as the new was acquired.

">Dendritic Architecture Enables de Novo Computation of Salient Motion in the Superior Colliculus</a></h4>

              
                Dendritic architecture plays a crucial role in shaping how neurons extract behaviorally relevant information from sensory inputs. Wide-field neurons in the superior colliculus integrate visual information from the retina to encode cues critical for visually guided orienting behaviors. However, the principles governing how these neurons filter their inputs to generate appropriate responses remain unclear. Using viral tracing, two-photon calcium imaging, and computational modeling, we show that wide-field neurons receive functionally diverse inputs from twelve retinal ganglion cell types, forming a layered, type-specific organization along their dendrites. This structured arrangement allows wide-field neurons to multiplex salient motion cues, selectively amplifying movement and suppressing static features. Computational models reveal that the spatial organization of dendrites and inputs enables the selective extraction of behaviorally relevant stimuli, including de novo computations. Our findings underscore the critical role of dendritic architecture in shaping sensory processing and neural circuit function.

">Rapid and efficient generation of human oligodendrocytes myelinating adult human cortical neurons</a></h4>

              
                Intracerebral transplantation of stem cell-derived oligodendrocytes (OLs) holds promise as a new strategy for repairing demyelinated brain tissue. However, two challenges hinder clinical translation: the slow and inefficient generation of human OLs for transplantation using the protocols described to date, and the limited insight into their remyelination potential, which has only been evaluated in vitro or in xenotransplantation studies, failing to capture critical human-specific cellular interactions involved in myelination. Here, we present a highly reproducible method for the rapid generation of myelinating human OLs from human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived long-term neuroepithelial-like stem (lt-NES) cells. Induced expression of SOX10 and OLIG2 in human lt-NES cells is sufficient to produce O4-expressing OLs with an efficiency of 80% within 7 days, as confirmed by flow cytometry and immunocytochemistry. Importantly, these OLs survive, differentiate and become functional when grafted into adult human brain slices ex vivo, demonstrating their ability to maintain their phenotype after allotransplantation in a system mimicking the clinical setting. Our new protocol has potential to further advance personalized medicine in the field of myelin disorders.

">Longitudinal tracking of neuronal activity from the same cells in the developing brain using Track2p</a></h4>

              
                Understanding cortical circuit development requires tracking neuronal activity across days in the growing brain. While in vivo calcium imaging now enables such longitudinal studies, automated tools for reliably tracking large populations of neurons across sessions remain limited. Here, we present a novel cell-tracking method based on sequential image registration, validated on calcium imaging data from the barrel cortex of mouse pups over one postnatal week. Our approach enables robust long-term analysis of several hundreds of individual neurons, allowing quantification of neuronal dynamics and representational stability over time. Using this method, we identified a key developmental transition in neuronal activity statistics, marking the emergence of arousal state modulation. Beyond this key finding, our method provides an essential tool for tracking developmental trajectories of individual neurons, which could help identify potential deviations associated with neurodevelopmental disorders.

">Simultaneous analysis of single-cell gene expression and morphology provides new insight into how microglia change with age</a></h4>

              
                Cellular morphology is intimately connected with function. While the link between morphology and functional states has been studied extensively, the role of subcellular transcript localization in cellular function remains unclear. Here we use microglia, the brain's resident macrophages, as a model to dissect the interaction of morphology, transcript localization, and function. Using multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridization combined with fluorescent immunohistochemistry, we analyzed transcript distribution and morphology simultaneously in young and aged mouse brains. Our approach revealed how mRNA spatial organization varies across microglial states. We identified distinct transcript localization patterns within microglial processes and uncovered morphological heterogeneity within transcriptomically defined populations. Notably, we found a subpopulation of disease-associated microglia with a ramified morphology (displaying numerous processes), challenging the conventional assumption between morphology and microglial states. Finally, we found that aging not only alters the distribution of compartmentalized mRNAs but also reshapes their colocalization networks, shifting microglial functions from synaptic maintenance and phagocytic processes in younger brains to migration and catabolic pathways in older brains. Our findings highlight the role of subcellular transcript organization in shaping microglial morphology and function, offering new avenues for studying and modulating microglial states in health, disease, and aging.

">Predicting the Regenerative Potential of Retinal Ganglion Cells Based on Developmental Growth Trajectories</a></h4>

              
                Retinal ganglion cells in the mammalian central nervous system fail to regenerate following injury, with the capacity to survive and regrow varying by cell type. This variability may be linked to differences in developmental programs that overlap with the genetic pathways that mediate regeneration. To explore this correlation, we compared the structural changes in mouse retinal ganglion cells during development with those occurring after axonal injury. The dendritic trees of over 1,000 ganglion cells were reconstructed at different developmental stages, revealing that each cell type follows a distinct timeline. ON-sustained (sONa) cells reach maturity by P14, whereas ON-transient (tONa) cells achieve their maximum dendritic size by P10. Modeling of the dendritic changes indicate that while sONa and tONa follow similar growth programs the onset of growth was later in sONa. After optic nerve crush, the remodeling of dendritic architecture differed between the two cell-types. sONa cells exhibited rapid dendritic shrinkage, while tONa cells shrank more gradually with changes in branching features. Following injury, sONa cells reverted to an earlier developmental state than tONa cells. In addition, after co-deletion of PTEN and SOC3, neurons appeared to regress further back in developmental time. Our results provide evidence that a ganglion cell's resilience to injury and regenerative potential is predicted by its maturation timeline. Understanding these intrinsic differences could inform targeted neuroprotective interventions.

">Multi-omic analysis of the ciliogenic transcription factor RFX3 reveals a role in promoting activity-dependent responses via enhancing CREB binding in human neurons</a></h4>

              
                Heterozygous loss-of-function (LoF) variants in RFX3, a transcription factor known to play key roles in ciliogenesis, result in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and neurodevelopmental delay. RFX binding motifs are also enriched upstream of genes found to be commonly dysregulated in transcriptomic analyses of brain tissue from individuals with idiopathic ASD. Still, the precise functions of RFX3 in the human brain is unknown. Here, we studied the impact of RFX3 deficiency using human iPSC-derived neurons and forebrain organoids. Biallelic loss of RFX3 disrupted ciliary gene expression and delayed neuronal differentiation, while monoallelic loss of RFX3 did not. Instead, transcriptomic and DNA binding analyses demonstrated that monoallelic RFX3 loss disrupted synaptic target gene expression and diminished neuronal activity-dependent gene expression. RFX3 binding sites co-localized with CREB binding sites near activity-dependent genes, and RFX3 deficiency led to decreased CREB binding and impaired induction of CREB targets in response to neuronal depolarization. This study demonstrates a novel role of the ASD-associated gene RFX3 in shaping neuronal synaptic development and plasticity.

	<p>Background/Objectives: The aim of this pilot study is to qualitatively describe the use of life history questionnaires in an acute neurorehabilitation setting to define individualised goals of care for patients with clinical cognitive motor dissociation and to determine to what extent the information they contain influences the care and management provided by the team. Methods: Using the patient records of our sample, all individualised goals of care were summarised, which were subsequently used to assess whether life history questionnaires had supplied sufficient information to define various individualised goals of care. We then conducted semi-structured interviews with the involved healthcare professionals to gain insights on how these questionnaires were used. Results: Approximately one-third of all individualised goals of care belonging to the &amp;amp;ldquo;Activities and Participation&amp;amp;rdquo; ICF category were defined through life history questionnaires. The semi-structured interviews highlighted the impact of these questionnaires in three main aspects: creating a therapeutic alliance with the patient, facilitating multidisciplinary cohesion, and nurturing a sense of empathy amongst the healthcare professionals. Conclusions: Life history questionnaires are an important contribution to individualised goals of care and may improve the relationship with the patient and the therapeutic setting for all healthcare professionals involved.</p>

	<p>Objectives: Accurate survival prediction for brain metastasis patients undergoing stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) is crucial for personalized treatment planning and improving patient outcomes. This study aimed to develop a machine learning model to estimate survival times, providing clinicians with a reliable tool for making informed decisions based on individual patient characteristics. The goal was to compare the performance of multiple algorithms and identify the most effective model for clinical use. Methods: We applied a hybrid machine learning approach to predict survival in brain metastasis patients treated with SRT, utilizing real-world data. Four algorithms&amp;amp;mdash;XGBoost, CatBoost, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting&amp;amp;mdash;were compared within a meta-model framework to identify the most accurate for survival prediction. Model performance was evaluated using metrics such as MSE, MAE, MAPE, and C index. Results: XGBoost outperformed all other algorithms, achieving an MSE of 0.14%, MAE of 0.10%, and MAPE of 0.093%, with a high C-index of 100%. CatBoost showed reasonable performance, while Gradient Boosting had higher error rates (MSE of 6.99%, MAE of 21.04%, MAPE of 19.29%). Random Forest performed the weakest, with the highest MSE (14.39%), MAE (30.23%), and MAPE (33.58%). Conclusion: Inputting relevant clinical variables into the model enables clinicians to obtain highly accurate survival predictions for patients with brain metastasis. This enhances clinical decision making by providing a more precise understanding of expected outcomes.

	<p>Background/Objectives: Sleep plays a pivotal role in memory consolidation, especially for declarative memory. While extensive research has examined sleep&amp;amp;rsquo;s impact on simple declarative materials, such as word lists, its effect on more complex narrative passages remains less studied. This study aimed to investigate the effect of sleep on prose memory consolidation. Methods: In a within-subjects design, 10 healthy university students (6 F, 4 M; age range = 19&amp;amp;ndash;29; generation ratio = 0.8) learned prose passages and were tested both immediately and after a retention interval spent either asleep or awake. Results: The analyses revealed a positive effect of sleep, with the participants recalling more textual details in the Sleep condition (R2 conditional = 0.269). Correlational analyses further supported this outcome, showing a positive association between specific sleep features (i.e., sleep cycles) and prose memory performance (r2 = 0.56). Conclusions: Our finding suggests that sleep facilitates the consolidation of complex declarative memory traces, counteracting the decay that occurs during wakefulness; correlational analyses further support this outcome. Overall, these findings underscore the importance of sleep for everyday learning and comprehension, particularly when processing complex textual information.</p>

                Abstract Mycotic thoracic aortic aneurysms are rare but life-threatening, and are associated with high morbidity and mortality after operative repair. They frequently present at a late stage with sepsis and rupture; therefore, emergency management is paramount. Repair options, particularly in the thoracic aorta, are complex and include open, endovascular, and hybrid surgical approaches. We present the case of a 72-year-old woman with a ruptured mycotic thoracic aortic aneurysm who underwent successful endovascular repair with thoracic stent graft placement and left subclavian artery embolization. This case highlights the successful use of endovascular repair for the management of a ruptured mycotic thoracic aortic aneurysm in zone 2, emphasizing the importance of early diagnosis, timely intervention, and potential benefits of minimally invasive repair in these rare complex cases.

                In 2024 the Cross-Strait Conflict between Taipei and Beijing turned 75 years old. Using an eclectic conflict analysis framework, this paper lays out the evolution of the conflict, its main actors, and traces the fundamental shift of its core-issue from “who is China” to “what is Taiwan.” Realist concepts of international relations are used to argue that it is important to imagine political scenarios not ending in warfare to escape the escalatory spiral and a self-fulfilling prophecy. The rhetoric of warfare, distorted views on history, and Great Power competition are destabilizing factors that push toward an escalation that will result in warfare if they are not counterbalanced by refocusing the relationship on common ground. A peaceful way forward, the paper argues, does not need to solve the underlying conflict between the PRC and the ROC, it only needs to mitigate their red lines long enough for new reconciliation strategies to emerge that re-channel the core-issue into a constructive conflict, which, over time, can lead to permanent reconciliation.

                Background Predicting the number and distribution of Olympic medals in the future has become a hot topic, but predicting the number of Olympic medals is not easy and requires comprehensive consideration of multiple factors such as historical data, athlete performance, and host country effects. Method This article uses the GA-BP algorithm model, combined with genetic algorithm (GA) and backpropagation neural network (BPNN), to optimize the weights and bias parameters of the BP neural network using the global search capability of genetic algorithm, thereby improving training efficiency and prediction performance. By estimating the number of Olympic gold medals and total medals, verifying the accuracy of the model, and predicting the medal table for the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics. Meanwhile, based on the synthetic control model, Estonia and China were selected as research subjects to construct a virtual control group and two experimental groups for analysis. Result The experimental results showed that Estonia and China won more medals with a head coach than without one. In 1992, Estonia won 1 gold medal and 2 bronze medals under the guidance of excellent coaches, indicating the significant role of head coaches in improving athletes’ performance. Conclusion This study provides valuable insights for the decision-making of the Olympic Committee, revealing key factors in medal distribution, optimizing the allocation of national strategic resources, and predicting the performance of countries at future Olympic Games.

With the explosive increase in genome sequence data, perhaps the major challenge in natural-product-based drug discovery is the identification of gene clusters most likely to specify new chemistry and bioactivities. We discuss the challenges and state-of-the-art of antibiotic discovery based on ecological principles, genome mining and artificial intelligence.

                <p>by Jung M. Park, Li-Huei Tsai</p>

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder affecting millions worldwide. There is no known cure for AD, highlighting an urgent need for new, innovative treatments. Recent studies have shed light on a promising, noninvasive approach using sensory stimulation as a potential therapy for AD. Exposing patients to light and sound pulses at a frequency of 40 hertz induces brain rhythms in the gamma frequency range that are important for healthy brain activity. Using this treatment in animal models, we are now beginning to understand the molecular, cellular, and circuit-level changes that underlie improvements in disease pathology, cognition, and behavior. A mechanistic understanding of the basic biology that underlies the 40-hertz treatment will inform ongoing clinical trials that offer a promising avenue of treatment without the side effects and high costs typically associated with pharmacological interventions. Concurrent advancements in neurotechnology that can also noninvasively stimulate healthy brain rhythms are illuminating new possibilities for alternative therapies. Altogether, these noninvasive approaches could herald a new era in treating AD, making them a beacon of hope for patients, families, and caregivers facing the challenges of this debilitating condition.

                <p>by Rishi De-Kayne, Ian J. Gordon, Reinier F. Terblanche, Steve Collins, Kennedy Saitoti Omufwoko, Dino J. Martins, Simon H. Martin</p>

Supergenes can evolve when recombination-suppressing mechanisms like inversions promote co-inheritance of alleles at two or more polymorphic loci that affect a complex trait. Theory shows that such genetic architectures can be favoured under balancing selection or local adaptation in the face of gene flow, but they can also bring costs associated with reduced opportunities for recombination. These costs may in turn be offset by rare ‘gene flux’ between inverted and ancestral haplotypes, with a range of possible outcomes. We aimed to shed light on these processes by investigating the BC supergene, a large genomic region comprising multiple rearrangements associated with three distinct wing colour morphs in <i>Danaus chrysippus</i>, a butterfly known as the African monarch, African queen and plain tiger. Using whole-genome resequencing data from 174 individuals, we first confirm the effects of BC on wing colour pattern: background melanism is associated with SNPs in the promoter region of <i>yellow</i>, within an inverted subregion of the supergene, while forewing tip pattern is most likely associated with copy-number variation in a separate subregion of the supergene. We then show that haplotype diversity within the supergene is surprisingly extensive: there are at least six divergent haplotype groups that experience suppressed recombination with respect to each other. Despite high divergence between these haplotype groups, we identify an unexpectedly large number of natural recombinant haplotypes. Several of the inferred crossovers occurred between adjacent inversion ‘modules’, while others occurred within inversions. Furthermore, we show that new haplotype groups have arisen through recombination between two pre-existing ones. Specifically, an allele for dark colouration in the promoter of <i>yellow</i> has recombined into distinct haplotype backgrounds on at least two separate occasions. Overall, our findings paint a picture of dynamic evolution of supergene haplotypes, fuelled by incomplete recombination suppression.

                Background The watershed management approach has been well-acknowledged as an effective strategy for improving food security. However, the significance of community engagement, which is vital for the success of this strategy, has not been adequately acknowledged. The study examined the level of community involvement and the factors influencing their participation in watershed management. Methods A household survey of 337 household heads, focus group discussions, and key informant interviews were used to collect the data. Descriptive statistics, a people participation index, and a binary regression model were used for data analysis. Result The results of the people participation index indicated a moderate level of farmers’ participation in the planning, implementation, monitoring, and evaluation phases, with no significant differences observed between the three micro watersheds. However, there were variations in the indicator metrics within and across the micro watersheds, with participants from the Sustainable Land Management Program II (SLMPII), micro watershed showing significant differences compared to those from the Productive Safety Net Public work (PSNP_PW) and free mass mobilization at levels of 0.01 and 0.05, respectively. The results of binary logistic regression indicated that the overall level of farmer participation was significantly affected by the frequency of extension contact, livestock ownership, education level, family size, and group membership. Conclusions The study highlights the need to consider variability in indicator measurements for effective watershed management to improve food security. It stresses the importance of building farmers’ capacity and fostering ownership, rather than simply providing them with explícitas instructions to follow.

                Background The nursing workforce is crucial in healthcare systems worldwide and contributes to community well-being. also, Nurses experience numerous psychological, social, emotional, and behavioral shocks and challenges in their work. In Jordan, 43% of doctors and nurses suffer from high levels of burnout, around 55% experience high levels of emotional exhaustion, and 33% of doctors and nurses suffer from high levels of psychological pressure and job stress. Others found that 70% of nurses experience stress. these issues can be reduced by practicing self-care and psychological flow which impact in work-related tasks which are important in effectively addressing occupational stress healthily and soundly. This study aims to determine assessing the predictive power of self-care and psychological flow in occupational stress among nurses Methods This study follows the quantitative technique. sample consisting of 476 nurses in Amman Jordan was chosen. Three scales were adapted to meet the study objectives: Occupational stress scale, Self-care scale, and psychological flow scale. There validity and reliability were checked. Results The study results indicate that self-care and psychological flow levels were low with means of 2.32 and 2.13, while the occupational stress level was high with a mean of 3.91. Also, there are a predictive power of self-care and psychological flow in occupational stress among nurses. Conclusions This study shows that of self-care and psychological flow predict occupational stress among nurses, which helps us to manage the occupational stress among them by giving them self-care and psychological flow practices and healing time during work by group counseling and lectures.

The ubiquitin-binding kinase RIOK3 is a new iRQC factor that facilitates 40S degradation. The iRQC pathway utilizes a feedforward mechanism of autoregulation where iRQC-stimulating conditions increase RNF10 and RIOK3 expression.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94917">Bridging the 3D geometrical organisation of white matter pathways across anatomical length scales and species</a></h4>

              
                We used diffusion MRI and x-ray synchrotron imaging on monkey and mice brains to examine the organisation of fibre pathways in white matter across anatomical scales. We compared the structure in the corpus callosum and crossing fibre regions and investigated the differences in cuprizone-induced demyelination in mouse brains versus healthy controls. Our findings revealed common principles of fibre organisation that apply despite the varying patterns observed across species; small axonal fasciculi and major bundles formed laminar structures with varying angles, according to the characteristics of major pathways. Fasciculi exhibited non-straight paths around obstacles like blood vessels, comparable across the samples of varying fibre complexity and demyelination. Quantifications of fibre orientation distributions were consistent across anatomical length scales and modalities, whereas tissue anisotropy had a more complex relationship, both dependent on the field-of-view. Our study emphasises the need to balance field-of-view and voxel size when characterising white matter features across length scales.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98102">Secondary structure of the SARS-CoV-2 genome is predictive of nucleotide substitution frequency</a></h4>

              
                Accurate estimation of the effects of mutations on SARS-CoV-2 viral fitness can inform public-health responses such as vaccine development and predicting the impact of a new variant; it can also illuminate biological mechanisms including those underlying the emergence of variants of concern. Recently, Lan et al. reported a model of SARS-CoV-2 secondary structure and its underlying dimethyl sulfate reactivity data (Lan et al., 2022). I investigated whether base reactivities and secondary structure models derived from them can explain some variability in the frequency of observing different nucleotide substitutions across millions of patient sequences in the SARS-CoV-2 phylogenetic tree. Nucleotide basepairing was compared to the estimated ‘mutational fitness’ of substitutions, a measurement of the difference between a substitution’s observed and expected frequency that is correlated with other estimates of viral fitness (Bloom and Neher, 2023). This comparison revealed that secondary structure is often predictive of substitution frequency, with significant decreases in substitution frequencies at basepaired positions. Focusing on the mutational fitness of C→U, the most common type of substitution, I describe C→U substitutions at basepaired positions that characterize major SARS-CoV-2 variants; such mutations may have a greater impact on fitness than appreciated when considering substitution frequency alone.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98351">An image-computable model of speeded decision-making</a></h4>

              
                Evidence accumulation models (EAMs) are the dominant framework for modeling response time (RT) data from speeded decision-making tasks. While providing a good quantitative description of RT data in terms of abstract perceptual representations, EAMs do not explain how the visual system extracts these representations in the first place. To address this limitation, we introduce the visual accumulator model (VAM), in which convolutional neural network models of visual processing and traditional EAMs are jointly fitted to trial-level RTs and raw (pixel-space) visual stimuli from individual subjects in a unified Bayesian framework. Models fitted to large-scale cognitive training data from a stylized flanker task captured individual differences in congruency effects, RTs, and accuracy. We find evidence that the selection of task-relevant information occurs through the orthogonalization of relevant and irrelevant representations, demonstrating how our framework can be used to relate visual representations to behavioral outputs. Together, our work provides a probabilistic framework for both constraining neural network models of vision with behavioral data and studying how the visual system extracts representations that guide decisions.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97894">Adaptive chunking improves effective working memory capacity in a prefrontal cortex and basal ganglia circuit</a></h4>

              
                How and why is working memory (WM) capacity limited? Traditional cognitive accounts focus either on limitations on the number or items that can be stored (slots models), or loss of precision with increasing load (resource models). Here, we show that a neural network model of prefrontal cortex and basal ganglia can learn to reuse the same prefrontal populations to store multiple items, leading to resource-like constraints within a slot-like system, and inducing a trade-off between quantity and precision of information. Such ‘chunking’ strategies are adapted as a function of reinforcement learning and WM task demands, mimicking human performance and normative models. Moreover, adaptive performance requires a dynamic range of dopaminergic signals to adjust striatal gating policies, providing a new interpretation of WM difficulties in patient populations such as Parkinson’s disease, ADHD, and schizophrenia. These simulations also suggest a computational rather than anatomical limit to WM capacity.

">Maternal low protein diet alters the development of reward circuits from childhood to adulthood by reshaping its function</a></h4>

              
                Inadequate nutrition during pregnancy can lead to intrauterine growth retardation and low birth weight, which in turn increases the risk of developing metabolic disorders in adulthood, according to various epidemiological and clinical studies. The inclina-tion of individuals born with low birth weight towards palatable foods indicates a possible modification in the hedonic aspect of their eating behavior. However, our understanding of the ontogenesis of structural organization and function within the brain's reward circuits remains limited. Therefore, the objective of this research is to investigate the preferences for palatable food, molec-ular signatures of reward circuits, and functional properties of the nucleus accumbens (NAc) in a rat model of perinatal protein restriction (LP). Starting from weaning, continuing into adolescence and adulthood, a longitudinal analysis was conducted on rats born to mothers with protein-restricted diets during gestation and lactation (LP pups), comparing them to pups born from control dams (CD pups). The LP group exhibited an increased preference for palatable food at day 25 after birth (P25), followed by a decreased preference during adolescence (P50), and no significant difference in palatable food preference at P95 (young adult) compared to CD rats. Molecular and electrophysiological assessments of medium spiny neurons (MSN) in the NAc revealed a reorganization of reward circuits during crucial developmental periods, potentially influencing the attractiveness of palatable food for the LP group. This study represents the first exploration of how preferences for palatable food evolve throughout an indi-vidual's lifespan and how these observations correlate with the remodeling of reward circuits. By shedding light on the molecular and functional aspects of reward circuits, we contribute to a better understanding of the link between perinatal nutrition, behav-ioral preferences, and the underlying neural mechanisms.

">In vivo tractography of human neonatal white-matter pathways underlying hypothalamic and reward functions to study predispositions to neurodevelopmental conditions and obesity</a></h4>

              
                White matter (WM) tracts of the reward, limbic, and autonomic systems implicate the hypothalamus, nucleus accumbens, ventral tegmental area and the amygdala and are associated with autism, ADHD, addiction and obesity. However, since most of these structures remain uncharacterised in vivo in human neonates, re- search on the early-life predispositions to these long-term "mind and body" conditions and the impact of common fetal exposures such as maternal obesity remains limited. Through the developing human connectome project, we acquired 3T brain diffusion and structural magnetic resonance imaging from healthy neonates born at-term to 137 normal-weight women (controls) and to 28 obese women and scanned at mean 40 weeks+6 days (+/-9 days) postmenstrual age (PMA). We first developed novel tractography protocols to reconstruct anatomical WM pathways for the neonatal medial forebrain bundle, ventral amygdalofugal pathway, amygdalo-accumbens fasciculus, stria terminalis and autonomic dorsal longitudinal fasciculus (DLF). We then quantified WM structure from the mean tract fibre bundle density (FD) and fibre cross-section (FC) and using regression path models evaluated WM change across PMA and the effects of antenatal obesity exposure and neonatal covariates. Lastly, we explored if neonatal WM FD and obesity exposure predicted child psycho-cognitive outcomes and anthropometry at 18 months. We show successful in vivo tractography of tracts with high topographical correspondence to adult histology, including in subcompartments of the hypothalamus and amygdala. The obesity exposure*PMA interaction was significant for mean FD in the bilateral amygdalo-accumbens fasciculus and right uncinate fasciculus. Males had larger FC in these same tracts bilaterally. Antenatal obesity exposure predicted lower cognitive scores and higher WHO weight and height z-scores at 18 months. Toddler reward-seeking temperament was correlated with higher weight z-score and was predicted by higher neonatal FD of the amygdalo-accumbens and uncinate fasciculi. Denser neonatal DLF predicted higher language and cognitive scores and fewer autistic traits at 18 months. In conclusion, we inform on neuroanatomical growth in vivo of discrete multisystemic regulatory networks and present evidence for early-life predispositions to psychological outcomes and obesity.

">M&uumlller glial Kir4.1 channel Dysfunction in APOE4-KI model of Alzheimer's disease</a></h4>

              
                Alzheimer's disease (AD), particularly late-onset AD (LOAD), affects millions worldwide, with the apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4) allele being a significant genetic risk factor. Retinal abnormalities are a hallmark of LOAD, and our recent study demonstrated significant age-related retinal impairments in APOE4-knock-in (KI) mice, highlighting that retinal impairments occur before the onset of cognitive decline in these mice. Muller cells (MCs), key retinal glia, are vital for retinal health, and their dysfunction may contribute to retinal impairments seen in AD. MCs maintain potassium balance via specialized inwardly rectifying K+ channels 4.1 (Kir4.1). This study posits that Kir4.1 channels will be impaired in APOE4-KI, resulting in MC dysfunction. Additionally, we demonstrate that MC dysfunction in APOE4-KI stems from alterations in mitochondrial dynamics and oxidative stress. Kir4.1 expression and function were studied using immunofluorescence and through the whole-cell voltage clamp, respectively. In parallel, rat Muller cells (rMC-1) were used to create an in vitro model for further mechanistic studies. Mitoquinol (MitoQ) was used to evaluate its potential to mitigate APOE4-induced deficits. APOE4 retinas and APOE4-transfected rMC-1 significantly reduced Kir4.1 expression, K+ buffering capacity, and increased mitochondrial damage. APOE4-transfected rMC-1 showed reduced mitochondrial membrane potential ({Delta}{Psi}m) and increased mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS). MitoQ treatment significantly reduced mitochondrial ROS and restored Kir4.1 expression in APOE4-expressing cells. Our results demonstrate that APOE4 causes mitochondrial dysfunction and MC impairment, which may contribute to retinal pathology in AD. MitoQ restored mitochondrial health and Kir4.1 expression in APOE4-expressing rMC-1, suggesting targeting mitochondria may offer a promising therapeutic strategy for AD.

	<p>Background/Objectives: Voice analysis has shown promise in anxiety assessment, yet traditional approaches examining isolated acoustic features yield inconsistent results. This study aimed to explore the relationship between anxiety states and vocal parameters from a network perspective in ecologically valid settings. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted with 316 undergraduate students (191 males, 125 females; mean age 20.3 &amp;amp;plusmn; 0.85 years) who completed a standardized picture description task while their speech was recorded. Participants were categorized into low-anxiety (n = 119) and high-anxiety (n=197) groups based on self-reported anxiety ratings. Five acoustic parameters&amp;amp;mdash;jitter, fundamental frequency (F0), formant frequencies (F1/F2), intensity, and speech rate&amp;amp;mdash;were analyzed using network analysis. Results: Network analysis revealed a robust negative relationship between jitter and state anxiety, with jitter as the sole speech parameter consistently linked to state anxiety in the total group. Additionally, higher anxiety levels were associated with a coupling between intensity and F1/F2, whereas the low-anxiety network displayed a sparser organization without intensity and F1/F2 connection. Conclusions: Anxiety could be recognized by speech parameter networks in ecological settings. The distinct pattern with the negative jitter-anxiety relationship in the total network and the connection between intensity and F1/2 in high-anxiety states suggest potential speech markers for anxiety assessment. These findings suggest that state anxiety may directly influence jitter and fundamentally restructure the relationships among speech features, highlighting the importance of examining jitter and speech parameter interactions rather than isolated values in speech detection of anxiety.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Research on pleasant tactile perception has primarily focused on C-tactile fibers found in hairy skin, with the forearm and face as common study sites. Recent findings of these fibers in hairless skin, such as the palms, have sparked interest in tactile stimulation on the hands. While studies have examined comfort and brain activity in passive touch, active touch remains underexplored. This study aimed to investigate differences in pleasant sensation and brain activity during active touch with stress balls of varying hardness. Methods: Forty healthy women participated. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), brain activity was measured as participants alternated between gripping stress balls of soft, medium, and hard hardness and resting without a ball. Participants rated hardness and comfort on a 9-point scale. Results: Soft stress balls were perceived as soft and comfortable, activating the thalamus and left insular cortex while reducing activity in the right insular cortex. Medium stress balls elicited similar perceptions and thalamic activation but with reduced right insular cortex activity. Hard stress balls caused discomfort, activating the insular cortex, thalamus, and amygdala while reducing anterior cingulate cortex activity. Conclusions: Soft stress balls may reduce aversive stimuli through perceived comfort, while hard stress balls may induce discomfort and are unlikely to alleviate stress.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Cocaine use disorder (CUD) poses a worldwide health challenge, with severe consequences for brain function. However, the phase dynamics underlying CUD and the transitions between CUD and health remain poorly understood. Methods: Here, we used resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from 43 CUD patients and 45 healthy controls (HCT). We performed empirical analysis to identify phase-coherence states and compared their probabilities of occurrence between conditions. To further explore the underlying mechanism, we employed computational modeling to replicate the observed state probabilities for each condition. These generated whole-brain models enabled us to simulate external perturbations and identify optimal brain regions mediating transitions between HCT and CUD. Results: We found that CUD was associated with a reduced occurrence probability of the state dominated by the default mode network (DMN). Perturbing the nucleus accumbens, thalamus, and specific regions within the default mode, limbic and frontoparietal networks drives transitions from HCT to CUD, while perturbing the hippocampus and specific regions within the visual, dorsal attention, and DMN facilitates a return from CUD to HCT. Conclusions: This study revealed altered DMN-related dynamics in CUD from the phase perspective and provides potential regions critical for state transitions. The results contribute to understanding the pathogenesis of CUD and the development of therapeutic stimulation strategies.</p>

	<p>Background: Both transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and acupuncture are promising methods for managing chronic low back pain (cLBP), however, their underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Methods: To explore the neural mechanisms of tDCS and acupuncture on cLBP, we examined how real and sham tDCS applied to the bilateral motor cortex (M1), combined with real or sham acupuncture, influenced cerebral blood flow (CBF) using pulsed continuous arterial spin labeling (pCASL) imaging. tDCS was administered over six sessions, combined with real or sham acupuncture, over one month. Results: Following real tDCS, we observed increased CBF in the bilateral occipital cortex, precuneus, left hippocampus, and parahippocampal gyrus/posterior cingulate cortex. After sham tDCS, CBF decreased in regions including the bilateral superior parietal lobule, precuneus, bilateral precentral and postcentral gyri, and left angular gyrus. Real acupuncture led to reduced CBF in the bilateral occipital cortex and hippocampus, and left posterior cingulate gyrus, and increased CBF in the right postcentral gyrus, superior parietal lobule, and frontal areas. Sham acupuncture was associated with decreased CBF in the bilateral hippocampus and anterior cingulate gyrus. Conclusions: These results suggest both shared and distinct patterns of CBF changes between real and sham tDCS, as well as between real and sham acupuncture, reflecting mode-dependent effects on brain networks involved in pain processing and modulation. Our findings highlight the different neural circuits implicated in the therapeutic mechanisms of tDCS and acupuncture in the management of cLBP.</p>

	<p>Background: Cytotoxic lesions of the corpus callosum (CLOCCs) are a rare disorder of various etiologies referred to as transient lesions of the splenium of the corpus callosum, with a usually mild clinical course. Epstein&amp;amp;ndash;Barr virus (EBV) is one of the factors potentially responsible for triggering this abnormality. Results: The authors present the case of a 15-year-old girl, so far without any health burden, who suffered from severe CLOCCs with the etiology of EBV. The patient was admitted to hospital because of hepatosplenomegaly and hypertransaminasemia. Her condition rapidly deteriorated&amp;amp;mdash;she had seizures with respiratory failure, requiring treatment in the PICU. The first MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scan showed changes in the hippocampus, and, in the early control, changes like those of CLOCCs; in follow-up studies (one and three months after the onset of respiratory failure), a gradual incomplete regression of the changes in the corpus callosum was seen. Her clinical condition improved quickly, with no seizures during the follow-up and no signs of focal CNS deficits. Cases of CLOCCs are reported as a secondary syndrome connected with many disease entities (e.g., toxic, infectious, and metabolic). The clinical presentation ranges from asymptomatic to severe cases demanding intensive treatment. The diagnosis is determined via an MRI examination. Conclusions: The general prognosis for CLOCCs is good, though the normalization of a brain MRI can take several months. As the only method of showing CLOCCs, MRI is the imaging gold standard. Still, clinical abnormalities often precede radiological changes, as was the case with the reported patient.</p>

                <p>Transgenic mice provide unprecedented access to manipulate and visualize neural circuits; however, those on a C57BL/6 background develop progressive hearing loss, significantly confounding systems-level and behavioral analysis. While outbreeding can limit hearing loss, it introduces strain variability and complicates the generation of complex genotypes. Here, we propose an approach to preserve hearing by crossing transgenic mice with congenic B6.CAST-<I>Cdh23<sup>Ahl</sup></I><sup>+</sup> mice, which maintain low-threshold hearing into adulthood. Widefield and two-photon imaging of the auditory cortex revealed that 2.5-month-old C57BL/6 mice exhibit elevated thresholds to high-frequency tones and widespread cortical reorganization, with most neurons responding best to lower frequencies. In contrast, <I>Ahl+</I> C57BL/6 mice exhibited robust neural responses across tested frequencies and sound levels (4&ndash;64&nbsp;kHz, 30&ndash;90&nbsp;dB SPL) and retained low thresholds into adulthood. Our approach offers a cost-effective solution for generating complex genotypes and facilitates more interpretable systems neuroscience research by eliminating confounding effects from hearing loss.</p>

                Background Cayratia trifolia has been extensively studied for its bioactive components and medicinal properties. This study was carried out to evaluate the fermentation ability of Saccharomyces cerevisiae 2.1 yeast to determine suitable fermentation conditions. Methods The suitable initial sugar content, temperature, and incubation time were investigated in the fermentation in the 100-milliliter flask scale. Besides, a trial fermentation at the 1-liter scale was conducted to assess yeast performance. Results All treatments showed that the total sugar content decreased after 9 days of fermentation compared to the initial level. Temperature during fermentation has a direct effect on yeast activity. Temperature increases the growth of yeast and the speed of enzyme activity. The fermentation time changes depending on temperature, initial soluble solid contents, and yeast strains, leading to changes in the ethanol content after the end of fermentation. The results showed that the S. cerevisiae 2.1 was able to ferment at room temperature with an initial pH of 4.5, 24 °Brix, and a yeast density of 107 cells/mL. The appropriate fermentation conditions determined for S. cerevisiae 2.1 were 24 °Brix and incubation at room temperature (28-33°C) with a fermentation time of 11 days. In 1-L scale fermentation, three-leaf cayratia wine had 9.46% (v/v) and the fermentation efficiency was 90.34%. The wine produced had a unique color, flavor, and aroma that met the sensory evaluation of the Vietnamese national standard TCVN-3217:79. Concusion The results showed that the S. cerevisiae 2.1 was able to produce wine from Cayratia trifolia extract in suitable conditions with high ethanol content and organoleptic values. The results of this study supplied needed information for further studies on analysis of bioactive compounds produced by the fermentation.

                Background This study investigates the mediating role of comfort (CMT), convenience (CNV), and aesthetics (AST) in the relationship between the enablers of an age-friendly built environment for walkability (BEW) and outcomes such as increased physical activity level (IPL), increased socialization (ISL), and improved quality of life (IQL) in older adults. The research emphasizes the importance of creating age-friendly environments to support the well-being and quality of life of older adults, with implications for urban planners and policymakers to promote sustainable and inclusive design. Methods The research follows a positivist paradigm using a quantitative approach and survey strategy with a cross-sectional design. A sample of 333 older adults was selected using the convenience sampling technique, and data were gathered through a self-administered questionnaire. Results Findings from hypothesis testing indicate that, among the enablers, age-friendly urban design policies (AUP) are the most significant construct, positively impacting all three mediating variables. AST was found to have a significant positive effect on IPL and ISL, while CMT and CNV significantly influenced IPL and IQL, respectively. Conclusion These results suggest implications for urban planners and policymakers to enhance the contribution of BEW toward IPL, ISL, and IQL for older adults. The research offers valuable insights for academics and practitioners, emphasizing the importance of sustainable design while ensuring inclusivity to promote the well-being and quality of life of older adults.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1542/v2?src=rss">Assessment of occupational noise‐related hearing impairment among dental health personnel [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background Dental professionals are exposed to either high level of noise which often becomes annoying over a time, and it is largely related to turbines and suctions used during the procedure. We performed this study with an aim to examine the occupational noise related hearing impairment among dentists and to know the need for efforts to reduce its impact on young dentists. Methods The study group comprised of 102 dentists (53 males and 49 females) final year dental students, interns and board students of family dentistry, endodontics, prosthodontics was enrolled between the age of 22 years to 33 years having a mean age of 25.60 years. The sound level meter is switched on to know the base noise level in the clinics and to know hearing ability of the dentist through a pre – recorded verbal communication. When the dentist starts the procedure, the same verbal communication is re-introduced and based on his reaction the decibel level is increased to a point where he can understand it. The same is followed after the procedure. Results Using T – test the age and gender mean was assessed, while ANNOVA test was used to know the hearing impairment and its mean before, during and after procedure. We have found that before the procedure has started the mean general sound level in the clinics is 61.70 dB while during the procedure this mean sound level rises to 73.38dB suggesting there is an imminent increase of sound during the procedure and thereby associated impairment as males had a hearing mean of 58.37dB before the start of procedure which increased to 63.36dB during the procedure and after the procedure the mean is 61.91dB; while for the females it was 58.60dB before the start of procedure while during the procedure the mean increased to 64.51dB and after the procedure the mean is 61.03dB suggesting an eminent impairment in the hearing ability even though the procedure is completed. Discussion and Conclusion We have highlighted few guidelines from various studies which range from reducing multiple turbine usage at a given point of treatment wherever possible to a recommendation to use ear plugs for those procedures related to high noise levels. Although there are few noise cancellation devices in the market, dental professionals need something that is specific to their requirements, because commercially available products are built and developed for other purposes. Our study was not able to highlight which procedures have a greater noise impact to suggest specific recommendations.

                Background The Thai version of the World Health Organization Quality of Life Scale (WHOQOL-BREF-THAI) has been verified among a variety of populations. However, there is a lack of existing research on its comprehensive psychometric properties, specifically when used with nursing students. This study examined the WHOQOL-BREF’s unique psychometric features with Thai nursing students in northeast Thailand. Methods In this cross-sectional study, Thai nursing students were recruited using multi-stage simple random sampling from universities located in the northeast of Thailand. The data was collected via self-assessment questionnaires, and the 3,570 participants were then randomly split into two subsamples (group 1, n=2,000, and group 2, n=1,570). After reducing the number of items using statistical methods, an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was carried out on group 1 to explore the factor structure of the WHOQOL-BREF-THAI. Finally, group 2 was used in a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to validate the EFA’s modified structure along with an assessment of the construct validity of the WHOQOL-BREF-THAI. Results Principal component analysis on a random subsample supported a four-factor model with 24 items, originally suggested for factorial construct validity; these 24 items were distributed across the original four domain. The domain structure for the purpose showed a good fit in the CFA on the other subsample. Internal reliability was satisfactory (Cronbach’s alpha was greater than 0.70) for both the total scale and subscales. In terms of convergent validity, average variance extracted (AVE) revealed that all WHOQOL-BREF-THAI subscales achieved convergence, with AVE values ranging from 0.50 to 0.69. Conclusion These results reveal that the WHOQOL-BREF-THAI is a valid and reliable tool which health care providers can utilize to measure QOL among Thai nursing students. Therefore, the WHOQOL-BREF can serve as an essential tool for researching the factors influencing nursing students’ QOL, with implications for nursing education.

                <p>by Alexandra Teslya, Janneke Cornelia Maria Heijne, Maarten Franciscus Schim van der Loeff, Ard van Sighem, Jacob Aiden Roberts, Maartje Dijkstra, Godelieve J de Bree, Axel Jeremias Schmidt, Kai J Jonas, Mirjam E Kretzschmar, Ganna Rozhnova</p>

The number of new HIV infections among men who have sex with men (MSM) in the Netherlands has been decreasing, but additional efforts are required to bring it further down. This study aims to assess the impact of increased diagnosis of early HIV infection combined with immediate antiretroviral treatment (ART) initiation on reducing HIV transmission among MSM. We developed an agent-based model calibrated to HIV surveillance and sexual behavior data for MSM in the Netherlands in 2017-2022. Starting in 2023, we simulated a 10-year intervention that accelerates HIV diagnosis during the first 3 or 6 months after HIV acquisition across five levels of increased diagnosis rates (2, 4, 8, 16, and 32-fold), followed by immediate ART initiation. The upper limit of the intervention’s impact over 10 years is projected to result in the cumulative 298 (95-th QI: 162–451) HIV infections averted. A 32-fold increase in the diagnosis rate within 3 months after HIV acquisition (corresponding to 100% of all new HIV infections diagnosed within 3 months of acquisition) results in 269 (95-th QI: 147–400) infections averted, approaching closely maximum impact. By extending the scope of the intervention to individuals who acquired HIV infection within the previous 6 months, a smaller 8-fold increase in the diagnosis rate (corresponding to 97% of new HIV infections diagnosed within 6 months of acquisition) approaches closely the maximum impact of the intervention by averting 256 (95-th QI: 122–411) HIV infections. Our sensitivity analyses showed, that in an epidemiological context similar to the modern-day the Netherlands, immediate initiation of ART accompanying accelerated diagnosis of individuals with early HIV infection does not significantly affect HIV transmission dynamics. Accelerating early HIV diagnosis through increased awareness, screening, and testing can further reduce transmission among MSM. Meeting this goal necessitates a stakeholder needs assessment.

                <p>The physiological basis of cognitive decline remains largely uncharacterized. We identified a protein panel signature, in living humans, that correlates to improvement in neurocognition over a period of 5 years. Our signature is composed of complement proteins, coagulation cascade, and extracellular matrix regulators. In our cohort, SERPINF1 is associated with greater maximal oxygen uptake after an aerobic exercise intervention. Sleep quality is also a key factor in relation to inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor heavy chain H2, which was associated with greater sleep efficiency. Additionally, we validate that the coagulation profile of decliners’ plasma contains procoagulant agonists, leading to greater platelet activation. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                The Neuroscientist, Ahead of Print. <br/>As a monovalent cation channel, the transient receptor potential melastatin 4 (TRPM4) channel is a unique member of the transient receptor potential family. Abnormal TRPM4 activity has been identified in various neurologic disorders, such as stroke, spinal cord injury, traumatic brain injury, multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, pathologic pain, and epilepsy. Following brain hypoxia/ischemia and inflammation, TRPM4 up-regulation and enhanced activity contribute to the cell death of neurons, vascular endothelial cells, and astrocytes. Enhanced ionic influx via TRPM4 leads to cell volume increase and oncosis. Depolarization of membrane potential following TRPM4 activation and interaction between TRPM4 and N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors exacerbate excitotoxicity during hypoxia. Importantly, TRPM4 expression and activity remain low in healthy neurons, making it an ideal drug target. Current approaches to inhibit or modulate the TRPM4 channel have various limitations that hamper the interpretation of TRPM4 physiology in the nervous system and potentially hinder their translation into therapy. In this review, we discuss the pathophysiologic roles of TRPM4 and the different inhibitors that modulate TRPM4 activity for potential treatment of neurologic diseases.

                Hou et al. demonstrate that TOLLIP forms IDR-dependent condensates upon RNA viral infection. TOLLIP condensates promote the aggregation of SUMO protease SENP1 and enhance the interaction between SENP1 and MAVS in mitochondria, consequently leading to deSUMOylation of MAVS and attenuation of RLR signaling.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101825">Characterization of direct Purkinje cell outputs to the brainstem</a></h4>

              
                Purkinje cells (PCs) primarily project to cerebellar nuclei but also directly innervate the brainstem. Some PC-brainstem projections have been described previously, but most have not been thoroughly characterized. Here, we use a PC-specific cre line to anatomically and electrophysiologically characterize PC projections to the brainstem. PC synapses are surprisingly widespread, with the highest densities found in the vestibular and parabrachial nuclei. However, there are pronounced regional differences in synaptic densities within both the vestibular and parabrachial nuclei. Large optogenetically evoked PC-IPSCs are preferentially observed in subregions with the highest densities of putative PC boutons, suggesting that PCs selectively influence these areas and the behaviors they regulate. Unexpectedly, the pontine central gray and nearby subnuclei also contained a low density of putative PC boutons, and large PC-IPSCs are observed in a small fraction of cells. We combined electrophysiological recordings with immunohistochemistry to assess the molecular identities of two potential PC targets: PC synapses onto mesencephalic trigeminal neurons were not observed even though these cells are in close proximity to PC boutons; PC synapses onto locus coeruleus neurons are exceedingly rare or absent, even though previous studies concluded that PCs are a major input to these neurons. The availability of a highly selective cre line for PCs allowed us to study functional synapses, while avoiding complications that can accompany the use of viral approaches. We conclude that PCs directly innervate numerous brainstem nuclei, and in many nuclei they strongly inhibit a small fraction of cells. This suggests that PCs selectively target cell types with specific behavioral roles in the brainstem.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101127">PROTAC-induced protein structural dynamics in targeted protein degradation</a></h4>

              
                PROteolysis TArgeting Chimeras (PROTACs) are small molecules that induce target protein degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome system. PROTACs recruit the target protein and E3 ligase; a critical first step is forming a ternary complex. However, while the formation of a ternary complex is crucial, it may not always guarantee successful protein degradation. The dynamics of the PROTAC-induced degradation complex play a key role in ubiquitination and subsequent degradation. In this study, we computationally modelled protein complex structures and dynamics associated with a series of PROTACs featuring different linkers to investigate why these PROTACs, all of which formed ternary complexes with Cereblon (CRBN) E3 ligase and the target protein bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4<sup>BD1</sup>), exhibited varying degrees of degradation potency. We constructed the degradation machinery complexes with Culling-Ring Ligase 4A (CRL4A) E3 ligase scaffolds. Through atomistic molecular dynamics simulations, we illustrated how PROTAC-dependent protein dynamics facilitating the arrangement of surface lysine residues of BRD4<sup>BD1</sup> into the catalytic pocket of E2/ubiquitin cascade for ubiquitination. Despite featuring identical warheads in this PROTAC series, the linkers were found to affect the residue-interaction networks, and thus governing the essential motions of the entire degradation machine for ubiquitination. These findings offer a structural dynamic perspective on ligand-induced protein degradation, providing insights to guide future PROTAC design endeavors.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100735">Emerging cooperativity between Oct4 and Sox2 governs the pluripotency network in early mouse embryos</a></h4>

              
                During the first lineage segregation, mammalian embryos generate the inner cell mass (ICM) and trophectoderm (TE). ICM gives rise to the epiblast (EPI) that forms all cell types of the body, an ability referred to as pluripotency. The molecular mechanisms that induce pluripotency in embryos remain incompletely elucidated. Using knockout (KO) mouse models in conjunction with low-input ATAC-seq and RNA-seq, we found that Oct4 and Sox2 gradually come into play in the early ICM, coinciding with the initiation of Sox2 expression. Oct4 and Sox2 activate the pluripotency-related genes through the putative OCT-SOX enhancers in the early ICM. Furthermore, we observed a substantial reorganization of chromatin landscape and transcriptome from the morula to the early ICM stages, which was partially driven by Oct4 and Sox2, highlighting their pivotal role in promoting the developmental trajectory toward the ICM. Our study provides new insights into the establishment of the pluripotency network in mouse preimplantation embryos.

">Linking Motor Working Memory to Explicit and Implicit Motor Learning</a></h4>

              
                While explicit and implicit motor learning have been widely studied, the extent to which working memory for recent movements -- motor working memory (MWM) -- contributes to these processes remains unclear. Previous research suggests that visuospatial working memory may facilitate explicit motor learning but is either uninvolved in or detrimental to implicit learning. Here, we ask if and how these findings extend to non-visual MWM. Based on recent work pointing to separate effector-independent and effector-specific MWM codes, we hypothesized that: (1) explicit motor learning processes would correlate with effector-independent MWM, and (2) implicit motor learning processes would correlate with effector-specific MWM. To test these hypotheses, human participants completed both a MWM task and a visuomotor adaptation task. Our results revealed significant correlations between the quality of effector-independent MWM and the degree of explicit motor learning, extending previous findings on visuospatial working memory. Additionally, we present evidence supporting our second hypothesis, that effector-specific MWM correlates with implicit motor learning.

                Background. Processing faces and speech is supported by the right-lateralized social visual perception pathway (social pathway) involving medial temporal/visual 5 area (MT/V5) and superior temporal sulcus (STS). Little is known about development of the social pathway and its links with later social outcomes. We examined intrinsic functional connectivity (iFC) in the right social pathway in neurotypical neonates, compared it with iFC in the left social and bilateral dorsal attention pathways, and interrogated prospective links between iFC and social attention in neurodiverse neonates. Methods. iFC in the social and dorsal pathways was measured in 517 full-term neonates from the developing Human Connectome Project (dHCP) and 73 full-term Yale neonates [Mage=41.5 weeks (SD=1.9)]. Social attention was assessed in 36 Yale neonates at Mage=4.2 months (SD=0.4) months. Results. In the dHCP sample, the iFC indices were positive in all the pathways (all p-values < 0.001) and did not vary by sex [all p>0.275], but the iFC in the right-lateralized social pathway was higher than in the remaining pathways [all p<0.001] and was positively associated with age at scan [r(517)=0.251, p<0.011]. In the prospective neurodiverse Yale sample, the iFC in the right social pathway was positively associated with social attention at 4 months [p=0.007], and greater social attention at 4 months predicted better social functioning in the second year [p=0.010]. Conclusions. The early development of intrinsic functional connectivity in the right social perception pathway represents an area of interest for identifying neural mechanisms underlying emergence of atypical social attention associated with autism.

">Predictive Coding Explains Asymmetric Connectivity in the Brain: A Neural Network Study</a></h4>

              
                Seminal frameworks of predictive coding propose a hierarchy of generative modules, each attempting to infer the neural representation of the module one level below; the predictions are carried by top-down feedback projections, while the predictive error is propagated by reciprocal forward pathways. Such symmetric feedback connections support visual processing of noisy stimuli in computational models. However, neurophysiological studies have yielded evidence of asymmetric cortical feedback connections. We investigated the contribution of neural feedback during sensorimotor processes, in particular visual processing during grasp planning, by utilizing convolutional neural network models that had been augmented with predictive feedback and were trained to compute grasp positions for real-world objects. After establishing an ameliorative effect of symmetric feedback on grasp detection performance when evaluated on noisy stimuli, we characterized the performance effects of asymmetric feedback, similar to that observed in the cortex. Specifically, we tested model variants extended with short-, medium- and long-range feedback connections (i) originating at the same source layer or (ii) terminating at the same target layer. We found that the performance-enhancing effect of predictive coding under adverse conditions was optimal for medium-range asymmetric feedback. Moreover, this effect was most prominent when medium-range feedback originated at a level of representational abstraction that was proximal to the input layer, in contrast to more distal layers. To conclude, our simulations show that introducing biologically realistic asymmetric predictive feedback improves model robustness to noisy visual stimuli in a neural network model optimized for grasp detection.

">Extracellular matrix proteolysis maintains synapse plasticity during brain development</a></h4>

              
                Maintaining a dynamic neuronal synapse pool is critical to brain development. The extracellular matrix (ECM) regulates synaptic plasticity via mechanisms that are still being defined and are studied predominantly in adulthood. Using live imaging of excitatory synapses in zebrafish hindbrain we observed a bimodal distribution of short-lived (dynamic) and longer-lived (stable) synapses. Disruption of ECM via digestion or brevican deletion destabilized dynamic but not stable synapses and led to decreased synapse density. Conversely, loss of matrix metalloproteinase 14 (MMP14) led to accumulation of brevican and increased the stable synapse pool, resulting in increased synapse density. Microglial MMP14 was essential to these effects in both fish and human iPSC-derived cultures. Both MMP14 and brevican were required for experience-dependent synapse plasticity in a motor learning assay. These data, complemented by mathematical modeling, define an essential role of ECM remodeling in maintaining a dynamic subset of synapses during brain development.

">Copper supplementation mitigates Parkinson-like wild-type SOD1 pathology and nigrostriatal degeneration in a novel mouse model</a></h4>

              
                Wild-type superoxide dismutase 1 (disSOD1) protein misfolding and deposition is implicated in the death of substantia nigra (SN) dopamine neurons in Parkinson disease. Regionally reduced copper availability, and subsequent reduced copper binding to SOD1, is a key factor driving the development of this pathology, suggesting brain copper supplementation may constitute an effective means of preventing its formation. We evaluated the potential of the blood-brain-barrier-permeable copper delivery drug, CuATSM, to attenuate the misfolding and deposition of wild-type disSOD1, and associated neuron death, in a novel mouse model that expresses this pathology. Using proteomic and elemental mass spectrometry, together with biochemical and histological workflows, we demonstrated copper supplementation corrects altered post-translational modifications on soluble SOD1 and improves the enzymatic activity of the protein in the brains of these animals. These changes were associated with a significant reduction in disSOD1 pathology and preservation of dopamine neurons in the SN, which were highly correlated with tissue copper levels. These data position wild-type disSOD1 pathology as a novel drug target for Parkinson disease and suggest that brain copper supplementation may constitute an effective means of slowing SN dopamine neuron death in this disorder.

">Mapping Hand Function with Simultaneous Brain-Spinal Cord Functional MRI</a></h4>

              
                INTRODUCTION: Hand motor control depends on intricate brain-spinal cord interactions that regulate muscle activity. Hand function can be disrupted by injury to the brain, spinal cord, and peripheral nerves leading to weakness and impaired coordination. Functional MRI (fMRI) can map motor-related neural activity and potentially characterize the mechanisms underlying hand weakness and diminished coordination. Although brain motor control has been extensively studied, spinal cord mechanisms remain less explored. Here we use simultaneous brain-spinal cord fMRI to map neural activity related to hand strength and dexterity across the central nervous system using force matching and finger tapping tasks. This study pioneers the use of simultaneous brain-spinal cord fMRI to comprehensively map hand function, offering novel insights into coordinated motor processing across the central nervous system. METHODS: We performed simultaneous brain-spinal cord fMRI in 28 right-handed healthy volunteers (age: 40.0 {+/-} 13.8 years, 14 females, 14 males) using a 3T GE SIGNA Premier scanner equipped with a 21-channel head-neck coil. Participants performed a force-matching task at 10%, 20%, and 30% of maximum voluntary contraction using a hand dynamometer. For the finger tapping task, participants completed button-presses at 1 Hz with a 5-button response pad for three task levels: single-digit response with the second digit only (low), single-digit response with all digits in a sequential order (medium), single-digit response with all digits in a random order (high). Visual cues and feedback were provided during the tasks. Brain and spinal cord images were processed separately using FSL and the Spinal Cord Toolbox, with motion correction, physiological noise filtering, and spatial normalization to standard templates. Subject level activity maps were generated and entered into group level analyses to explore both activations and deactivations. For the brain, we used a mixed effect design with a voxelwise threshold of Z score > 3.10 and cluster threshold of p < 0.05. For the spinal cord, we used a fixed effect design with a voxelwise threshold of Z score > 1.64 and cluster threshold of p < 0.05. Region of interest (ROI) analyses were conducted to examine localized changes in activation across task levels RESULTS: Both tasks elicited activation in motor and sensory regions of the brain and spinal cord, with graded responses in the left primary motor (M1), left primary sensory (S1) cortex, and right spinal cord gray matter across task levels. Deactivation of the right M1 and S1 was also present for both tasks. Deactivation of the left spinal cord gray matter was present in the high task level of the force matching task. The ROI analysis findings complemented the group level activity maps. DISCUSSION: Our study provides a detailed map of brain-spinal cord interactions in hand function, revealing graded neural activation and inhibition patterns across motor and sensory regions. Interhemispheric inhibition, reflected in right M1 deactivation, likely restricts extraneous motor output during unilateral tasks. For force matching, the deactivation of the left ventral and dorsal horns of the spinal cord, provides the first evidence that the inhibition of motor areas during a unilateral motor task extends to the spinal cord. Whether this inhibition results from direct descending modulation from the brain or interneuronal inhibition in the cord remains to be interrogated. These findings expand our understanding of central motor control mechanisms and could inform rehabilitation strategies for individuals with motor impairments. CONCLUSIONS: Our simultaneous brain-spinal cord fMRI approach provides novel insights into the neural coordination of hand function, enhancing our understanding of motor control and its modulation. This approach may offer a foundation for studying motor dysfunction in conditions such as stroke, spinal cord injury, and neurodegenerative diseases.
