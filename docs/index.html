              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-480/v2?src=rss">How Smart Can Museums Be? The Role of Cutting-Edge Technologies in Making Modern Museums Smarter [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Despite extensive research on technology-mediated visitor experiences, a holistic approach to the smart museum remains underexplored. This paper addresses the gap by examining the intersection of museums and digital technologies through a cultural lens, with a focus on their role in redefining the museum experience. The concept and profile of the 21st-century smart museum were shaped through a synthesis of findings from 143 scholarly and institutional publications, combining 118 research outputs (2012–2025) across seven technological categories —Extended Reality (XR), Artificial Intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), Robotics, Fusion, Blockchain, and general Digital Technologies— with a complementary body of theoretical works (1989–2025) that strengthen its conceptual and cultural foundations. From this synthesis, 15 key attributes emerged, outlining the ideal smart museum model. Anchored in theoretical and institutional frameworks, these attributes conceptualize the smart museum as a culturally embedded, technologically enhanced, and human-centered institution. The paper provides a conceptual framework and strategic guide for cultural managers, museum professionals, and designers developing smart museum practices in the digital era.

                Background Effective performance monitoring is essential for improving academic productivity, especially in private higher education institutions. This study aimed to establish the perception of academic staff toward performance monitoring and how these perceptions influence academic staff performance in private chartered universities in Western Uganda. Guided by Expectancy Theory and Self-Determination Theory, the study explored how monitoring practices affect motivation and performance outcomes. Methods A convergent parallel mixed-methods design was employed. The quantitative strand involved 386 academic staff selected from five private chartered universities using stratified random sampling. Data were collected using structured questionnaires. In the qualitative strand, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 10 purposively selected Deans of Faculties. Quantitative data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, Pearson correlation, and regression analysis, while qualitative data were analyzed thematically. Results Findings revealed that 58.2% of academic staff had a moderately positive perception of existing performance monitoring practices. Pearson correlation analysis showed a moderate positive relationship between perception of performance monitoring and academic staff performance (r = .476, p < 0.01). Regression analysis further indicated that perception of performance monitoring significantly predicted academic staff performance (β = 0.394, p = 0.000), explaining 18.7% of the variance (R2 = 0.187). Qualitative data revealed challenges such as irregular feedback, lack of transparency, and limited involvement of academic staff in developing performance indicators. Conclusions The study concludes that academic staff performance can be enhanced when performance monitoring systems are perceived as fair, transparent, and participatory. It recommends the standardization of performance evaluation procedures, improved feedback mechanisms, and the active involvement of academic staff in setting performance targets. Strengthening these areas could improve motivation, engagement, and overall academic performance in private universities across the region.

                Background Many graduates are discouraged about the labor market.…” because of the abysmal increase in unemployment rates. While academics have tried to incorporate employable skills into curricula, graduates must understand social and humanitarian principles to meet globalization demands. This study investigated how service-learning influences the prosocial skills of economics undergraduate pre-service teachers and its impact on their future employment prospects. Method We adopted a mixed-method design of the sequential explanatory approach. A purposive random sampling technique was used to select 150 pre-service teachers (300 and 400 level) from five departments in the Faculty of Education at the University of Ibadan offering economics. A purposive sampling technique was used to sample 10 students for focus group discussions, who served as team leaders in service-learning courses. The Students’ Prosocial and Professional Competencies Questionnaire (r= 0.79) and a Focus Group Discussion Guide were used for data collection. Quantitative data were analyzed using mean, standard deviation and paired sample t-test at a significance level of 0.05, while qualitative data were analyzed thematically. Results The mean scores for the constructs were communication skills (2.61), teamwork (2.45), empathy (2.35), culture (2.30) and social responsibility (2.50). The mean for communication skills increased significantly from 2.61 before the intervention to 3.35. The reduction in the standard deviation indicates that the communication skills of pre-service teachers have become more consistent and prominent (F=24.87), confirming the statistical significance of these improvements. Similar improvements were observed in teamwork skills, with the mean score rising from 2.62 before intervention to 3.36 and statistically significant (F=9.71). Conclusion The undergraduate students had low overall prosocial ability scores, indicating a lack of prosocial competencies essential for effective teaching and professional success in education. Policymakers and stakeholders should recognize the value of service learning and support its integration into teacher education programs through funding, resources, and institutional encouragement.

                arXiv:2511.20179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scalable assessments of mental illness, the leading driver of disability worldwide, remain a critical roadblock toward accessible and equitable care. Here, we show that human-computer interactions encode multiple dimensions of self-reported mental health and their changes over time.
  We introduce MAILA, a MAchine-learning framework for Inferring Latent mental states from digital Activity. We trained MAILA to predict 1.3 million mental-health self-reports from 20,000 cursor and touchscreen recordings recorded in 9,000 online participants. The dataset includes 2,000 individuals assessed longitudinally, 1,500 diagnosed with depression, and 500 with obsessive-compulsive disorder. MAILA tracks dynamic mental states along three orthogonal dimensions, generalizes across contexts, and achieves near-ceiling accuracy when predicting group-level mental health. The model translates from general to clinical populations, identifies individuals living with mental illness, and captures signatures of psychological function that are not conveyed by language.
  Our results demonstrate how everyday human-computer interactions can power passive, reliable, dynamic, and maximally scalable mental health assessments. The ability to decode mental states at zero marginal cost sets new benchmarks for precision medicine and public health, while raising important questions about privacy, agency, and autonomy online.

                arXiv:2511.20532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The primary output of the nervous system is movement and behavior. While recent advances have democratized pose tracking during complex behavior, kinematic trajectories alone provide only indirect access to the underlying control processes. Here we present MIMIC-MJX, a framework for learning biologically-plausible neural control policies from kinematics. MIMIC-MJX models the generative process of motor control by training neural controllers that learn to actuate biomechanically-realistic body models in physics simulation to reproduce real kinematic trajectories. We demonstrate that our implementation is accurate, fast, data-efficient, and generalizable to diverse animal body models. Policies trained with MIMIC-MJX can be utilized to both analyze neural control strategies and simulate behavioral experiments, illustrating its potential as an integrative modeling framework for neuroscience.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19548">When Should Neural Data Inform Welfare? A Critical Framework for Policy Uses of Neuroeconomics</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2511.19548v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neuroeconomics promises to ground welfare analysis in neural and computational evidence about how people value outcomes, learn from experience and exercise self-control. At the same time, policy and commercial actors increasingly invoke neural data to justify paternalistic regulation, "brain-based" interventions and new welfare measures. This paper asks under what conditions neural data can legitimately inform welfare judgements for policy rather than merely describing behaviour. I develop a non-empirical, model-based framework that links three levels: neural signals, computational decision models and normative welfare criteria. Within an actor-critic reinforcement-learning model, I formalise the inference path from neural activity to latent values and prediction errors and then to welfare claims. I show that neural evidence constrains welfare judgements only when the neural-computational mapping is well validated, the decision model identifies "true" interests versus context-dependent mistakes, and the welfare criterion is explicitly specified and defended. Applying the framework to addiction, neuromarketing and environmental policy, I derive a Neuroeconomic Welfare Inference Checklist for regulators and for designers of NeuroAI systems. The analysis treats brains and artificial agents as value-learning systems while showing that internal reward signals, whether biological or artificial, are computational quantities and cannot be treated as welfare measures without an explicit normative model.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20162">While recognizing actions, LMMs struggle to detect core interaction events</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2511.20162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large multi-modal models (LMMs) show increasing performance in realistic visual tasks for images and, more recently, for videos. For example, given a video sequence, such models are able to describe in detail objects, the surroundings and dynamic actions. In this study, we explored the extent to which these models ground their semantic understanding in the actual visual input. Specifically, given sequences of hands interacting with objects, we asked models when and where the interaction begins or ends. For this purpose, we introduce a first of its kind, large-scale dataset with more than 20K annotated interactions on videos from the Something-Something-V2 dataset. 250 AMTurk human annotators labeled core interaction events, particularly when and where objects and agents become attached ('contact') or detached ('release'). We asked two LMMs (Qwen-2.5VL and GPT-4o) to locate these events in short videos, each with a single event. The results show that although the models can reliably name the target objects, identify the action and provide coherent reasoning, they consistently fail to identify the frame where the interaction begins or ends and cannot localize the event within the scene. Our findings suggest that in struggling to pinpoint the moment and location of physical contact that defines the interaction, the models lack the perceptual grounding required for deeper understanding of dynamic scenes.

                arXiv:2511.20392v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) results from an impact or concussion to the head with the injury being specifically characterized through pathological degradation at various biological length scales. Following injury, various mechanical modeling techniques have been proposed in the literature that seek to quantify neuronal-scale to tissue-scale metrics of brain damage. Broadly, the two categories of degradation encompass physiological deterioration of neurons and upregulation of chemical entities such as neurotransmitters which causes initiation of downstream pathophysiological effects. Despite the many contributing pathways, in this work, we delineate and model a potential glia-initiated injury pathway that leads to secondary injury. The goal of this work is to demonstrate a continuum framework which models the multiphysics of mechano-chemical interactions underlying TBI. Using a coupled PDE (partial differential equation) formulation and FEM (finite element method) discretization, the framework highlights evolution of field variables which spatio-temporally resolve mechanical metrics and chemical species across neuronal clusters. The modeling domain encompasses microglia, neurons and the extracellular matrix. The continuum framework used to model the mechano-chemical interactions assumes a three dimensional viscoelastic network to capture the mechanical response underlying proteins constituting the neuron microstructure and advection-diffusion equations modeling spatio-temporal evolution of chemical species. We use this framework to numerically estimate key concentrations of chemical species produced by the strain field. In this work, we identify key biomarkers within the labyrinth of molecular pathways and build a framework that captures the core mechano-chemical interactions. This framework is an attempt to quantify secondary injury and thus assist in developing targeted TBI treatments.

Abstract: Background: Brain network models offer insights into brain dynamics, but the utility of model-derived bifurcation parameters as biomarkers remains underexplored. Objective: This study evaluates bifurcation parameters from a whole-brain network model as biomarkers for distinguishing brain states associated with resting-state and task-based cognitive conditions. Methods: Synthetic BOLD signals were generated using a supercritical Hopf brain network model to train deep learning models for bifurcation parameter prediction. Inference was performed on Human Connectome Project data, including both resting-state and task-based conditions. Statistical analyses assessed the separability of brain states based on bifurcation parameter distributions. Results: Bifurcation parameter distributions differed significantly across task and resting-state conditions ($p < 0.0001$ for all but one comparison). Task-based brain states exhibited higher bifurcation values compared to rest. Conclusion: Bifurcation parameters effectively differentiate cognitive and resting states, warranting further investigation as biomarkers for brain state characterization and neurological disorder assessment.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02013">A Novel Brain-Computer Interface Architecture: The Brain-Muscle-Hand Interface for replicating the motor pathway</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2506.02013v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Myoelectric interfaces enable intuitive and natural control by decoding residual muscle activity, providing an effective pathway for motor restoration in individuals with preserved musculature. However, in patients with severe muscular atrophy or high-level spinal cord injury, the absence of reliable muscle activity renders myoelectric control infeasible. In such cases, motor brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) offer an alternative route. However, conventional brain-computer interface systems rely mainly on noisy cortical signals and classification-based decoding algorithms, which often result in low signal fidelity, limited controllability, and unstable real-time performance. Inspired by the motor pathway--an evolutionarily optimized system that filters, integrates, and transmits motor commands from the brain to the muscles--this study proposes the Brain-Muscle-Hand Interface (BMHI). BMHI decodes cortical EEG signals to reconstruct muscle-level EMG activity, functionally substituting for the muscles and enabling regression-based, continuous, and natural control via a myoelectric interface. To validate this architecture, we performed offline verification, comparative analysis, and online control experiments. Results demonstrate that: (1) the BMHI achieves a prediction accuracy of 0.79; (2) compared with conventional end-to-end brain-hand interfaces, it reduces training time by approximately eighteenfold while improving decoding accuracy; and (3) in online operation, the BMHI enables stable and efficient manipulation of both a virtual hand and a robotic arm. Compared with conventional BCIs, the BMHI, by replicating the motor pathway, enables continuous, stable, and naturally intuitive control.

                arXiv:2507.09045v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) involves atypical brain organization, yet the large-scale functional principles underlying these alterations remain incompletely understood. Here we examine whether coevolutionary balance-a network-level energy measure derived from signed interactions and nodal activity states-captures disruptions in resting-state functional connectivity in autistic adults. Using ABIDE I resting-state fMRI data, we constructed whole-brain networks by combining binarized fALFF activity with signed functional correlations and quantified their coevolutionary energy. Compared with matched typically developing adults, the ASD group showed a characteristic redistribution of coevolutionary energy, with more negative global energy but higher (less negative) energy within the default mode network and altered energy in its interactions with dorsal attention and salience networks, indicating a reorganization rather than a uniform loss of balance in intrinsic network organization. These effects replicated across validation analyses with null models designed to disrupt link or node structure. Coevolutionary energy also showed modest but significant associations with ADI-R social and communication scores. Finally, incorporating coevolutionary features into a leakage-safe machine-learning classifier supported above-chance ASD versus typically developing (TD) discrimination on a held-out test set. These findings suggest that coevolutionary balance offers a compact, interpretable descriptor of altered resting-state network dynamics in autism.

                arXiv:2511.14466v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, the effects of dopamine neurotransmitter within the Cortico-Striatal-Thalamo-Cortical (CSTC) loop have been investigated. Simulations confirmed dopamine facilitates movement via thalamic disinhibition. Analysis of its impact on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) revealed a complex, region-specific outcome: SNR increased in some regions (e.g., D2 Striatum: 3.41 dB to 6.25 dB), decreased in others (e.g., Thalamus VL: 6.24 dB to 3.93 dB), and remained stable elsewhere (e.g., M1: 3.16 dB to 3.13 dB). This heterogeneity stems from dopamine increasing the excitability of D1-receptor-expressing neurons, which amplifies channel conductance noise and reduces SNR in specific circuits. Thus, dopamine acts not as a uniform signal enhancer, but as a complex modulator that critically balances facilitation and noise within the CSTC loop.

                arXiv:2511.14555v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Decoded Neurofeedback (DecNef) is a flourishing non-invasive approach to brain modulation with wide-ranging applications in neuromedicine and cognitive neuroscience. However, progress in DecNef research remains constrained by subject-dependent learning variability, reliance on indirect measures to quantify progress, and the high cost and time demands of experimentation.
  We present DecNefLab, a modular and interpretable simulation framework that formalizes DecNef as a machine learning problem. Beyond providing a virtual laboratory, DecNefLab enables researchers to model, analyze and understand neurofeedback dynamics. Using latent variable generative models as simulated participants, DecNefLab allows direct observation of internal cognitive states and systematic evaluation of how different protocol designs and subject characteristics influence learning.
  We demonstrate how this approach can (i) reproduce empirical phenomena of DecNef learning, (ii) identify conditions under which DecNef feedback fails to induce learning, and (iii) guide the design of more robust and reliable DecNef protocols in silico before human implementation.
  In summary, DecNefLab bridges computational modeling and cognitive neuroscience, offering a principled foundation for methodological innovation, robust protocol design, and ultimately, a deeper understanding of DecNef-based brain modulation.

Abstract: Accurate simulations of electric fields (E-fields) in brain stimulation depend on tissue conductivity representations that link macroscopic assumptions with underlying microscopic tissue structure. Mesoscale conductivity variations can produce meaningful changes in E-fields and neural activation thresholds but remain largely absent from standard macroscopic models. Recent microscopic models have suggested substantial local E-field perturbations and could, in principle, inform mesoscale conductivity. However, the quantitative validity of microscopic models is limited by fixation-related tissue distortion and incomplete extracellular-space reconstruction. We outline approaches that bridge macro- and microscales to derive consistent mesoscale conductivity distributions, providing a foundation for accurate multiscale models of E-fields and neural activation in brain stimulation.

                arXiv:2511.19520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding how glioblastoma (GBM) emerges from initially healthy glial tissue requires models that integrate bioelectrical, metabolic, and multicellular dynamics. This work introduces an ASAL-inspired agent-based framework that simulates bioelectric state transitions in glial cells as a function of mitochondrial efficiency (Meff), ion-channel conductances, gap-junction coupling, and ROS dynamics. Using a 64x64 multicellular grid over 60,000 simulation steps, we show that reducing Meff below a critical threshold (~0.6) drives sustained depolarization, ATP collapse, and elevated ROS, reproducing key electrophysiological signatures associated with GBM. We further apply evolutionary optimization (genetic algorithms and MAP-Elites) to explore resilience, parameter sensitivity, and the emergence of tumor-like attractors. Early evolutionary runs converge toward depolarized, ROS-dominated regimes characterized by weakened electrical coupling and altered ionic transport. These results highlight mitochondrial dysfunction and disrupted bioelectric signaling as sufficient drivers of malignant-like transitions and provide a computational basis for probing the bioelectrical origins of oncogenesis.

                arXiv:2511.20018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Cognitive Buffer Hypothesis (CBH) posits that larger brains evolved to enhance survival in changing conditions. However, larger brains also carry higher energy demands, imposing additional metabolic burdens. Alongside brain size, brain organization plays a key role in cognitive ability and, with suitable architectures, may help mitigate energy challenges. This study evolves Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) used by Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents to investigate how environmental variability and energy costs influence the evolution of neural complexity, defined in terms of ANN size and structure. Results indicate that under energy constraints, increasing seasonality led to smaller ANNs. This challenges CBH and supports the Expensive Brain Hypothesis (EBH), as highly seasonal environments reduced net energy intake and thereby constrained brain size. ANN structural complexity primarily emerged as a byproduct of size, where energy costs promoted the evolution of more efficient networks. These results highlight the role of energy constraints in shaping neural complexity, offering in silico support for biological theory and energy-efficient robotic design.

                arXiv:2511.20333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Building self-improving AI systems remains a fundamental challenge in the AI domain. We present NNGPT, an open-source framework that turns a large language model (LLM) into a self-improving AutoML engine for neural network development, primarily for computer vision. Unlike previous frameworks, NNGPT extends the dataset of neural networks by generating new models, enabling continuous fine-tuning of LLMs based on closed-loop system of generation, assessment, and self-improvement. It integrates within one unified workflow five synergistic LLM-based pipelines: zero-shot architecture synthesis, hyperparameter optimization (HPO), code-aware accuracy/early-stop prediction, retrieval-augmented synthesis of scope-closed PyTorch blocks (NN-RAG), and reinforcement learning. Built on the LEMUR dataset as an audited corpus with reproducible metrics, NNGPT emits from a single prompt and validates network architecture, preprocessing code, and hyperparameters, executes them end-to-end, and learns from result. The PyTorch adapter makes NNGPT framework-agnostic, enabling strong performance: NN-RAG achieves 73% executability on 1,289 targets, 3-shot prompting boosts accuracy on common datasets, and hash-based deduplication saves hundreds of runs. One-shot prediction matches search-based AutoML, reducing the need for numerous trials. HPO on LEMUR achieves RMSE 0.60, outperforming Optuna (0.64), while the code-aware predictor reaches RMSE 0.14 with Pearson r=0.78. The system has already generated over 5K validated models, proving NNGPT as an autonomous AutoML engine. Upon acceptance, the code, prompts, and checkpoints will be released for public access to enable reproducibility and facilitate community usage.

Abstract: Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) pose a significant challenge in cybersecurity due to their stealthy and long-term nature. Modern supervised learning methods require extensive labeled data, which is often scarce in real-world cybersecurity environments. In this paper, we propose an innovative approach that leverages AutoEncoders for unsupervised anomaly detection, augmented by active learning to iteratively improve the detection of APT anomalies. By selectively querying an oracle for labels on uncertain or ambiguous samples, we minimize labeling costs while improving detection rates, enabling the model to improve its detection accuracy with minimal data while reducing the need for extensive manual labeling. We provide a detailed formulation of the proposed Attention Adversarial Dual AutoEncoder-based anomaly detection framework and show how the active learning loop iteratively enhances the model. The framework is evaluated on real-world imbalanced provenance trace databases produced by the DARPA Transparent Computing program, where APT-like attacks constitute as little as 0.004\% of the data. The datasets span multiple operating systems, including Android, Linux, BSD, and Windows, and cover two attack scenarios. The results have shown significant improvements in detection rates during active learning and better performance compared to other existing approaches.

Abstract: Advanced Persistent Threats (APT) pose a major cybersecurity challenge due to their stealth, persistence, and adaptability. Traditional machine learning detectors struggle with class imbalance, high dimensional features, and scarce real world traces. They often lack transferability-performing well in the training domain but degrading in novel attack scenarios. We propose a hybrid transfer framework that integrates Transfer Learning, Explainable AI (XAI), contrastive learning, and Siamese networks to improve cross-domain generalization. An attention-based autoencoder supports knowledge transfer across domains, while Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) select stable, informative features to reduce dimensionality and computational cost. A Siamese encoder trained with a contrastive objective aligns source and target representations, increasing anomaly separability and mitigating feature drift. We evaluate on real-world traces from the DARPA Transparent Computing (TC) program and augment with synthetic attack scenarios to test robustness. Across source to target transfers, the approach delivers improved detection scores with classical and deep baselines, demonstrating a scalable, explainable, and transferable solution for APT detection.

                arXiv:2505.22994v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One frequently wishes to learn a range of similar tasks as efficiently as possible, re-using knowledge across tasks. In artificial neural networks, this is typically accomplished by conditioning a network upon task context by injecting context as input. Brains have a different strategy: the parameters themselves are modulated as a function of various neuromodulators such as serotonin. Here, we take inspiration from neuromodulation and propose to learn weights which are smoothly parameterized functions of task context variables. Rather than optimize a weight vector, i.e. a single point in weight space, we optimize a smooth manifold in weight space with a predefined topology. To accomplish this, we derive a formal treatment of optimization of manifolds as the minimization of a loss functional subject to a constraint on volumetric movement, analogous to gradient descent. During inference, conditioning selects a single point on this manifold which serves as the effective weight matrix for a particular sub-task. This strategy for conditioning has two main advantages. First, the topology of the manifold (whether a line, circle, or torus) is a convenient lever for inductive biases about the relationship between tasks. Second, learning in one state smoothly affects the entire manifold, encouraging generalization across states. To verify this, we train manifolds with several topologies, including straight lines in weight space (for conditioning on e.g. noise level in input data) and ellipses (for rotated images). Despite their simplicity, these parameterizations outperform conditioning identical networks by input concatenation and better generalize to out-of-distribution samples. These results suggest that modulating weights over low-dimensional manifolds offers a principled and effective alternative to traditional conditioning.

Abstract: Autonomous Underwater vehicles must operate in strong currents, limited acoustic bandwidth, and persistent sensing requirements where conventional swarm optimisation methods are unreliable. This paper formulates an irreversible hydrodynamic deployment problem for Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) swarms and presents Nauplius Optimisation for Autonomous Hydrodynamics (NOAH), a novel nature-inspired swarm optimisation algorithm that combines current-aware drift, irreversible settlement in persistent sensing nodes, and colony- based communication. Drawing inspiration from the behaviour of barnacle nauplii, NOAH addresses the critical limitations of existing swarm algorithms by providing hydrodynamic awareness, irreversible anchoring mechanisms, and colony-based communication capabilities essential for underwater exploration missions. The algorithm establishes a comprehensive foundation for scalable and energy-efficient underwater swarm robotics with validated performance analysis. Validation studies demonstrate an 86% success rate for permanent anchoring scenarios, providing a unified formulation for hydrodynamic constraints and irreversible settlement behaviours with an empirical study under flow.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13053">Self-Organization and Spectral Mechanism of Attractor Landscapes in High-Capacity Kernel Hopfield Networks</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2511.13053v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kernel-based learning methods can dramatically increase the storage capacity of Hopfield networks, yet the dynamical mechanism behind this enhancement remains poorly understood. We address this gap by unifying the geometric analysis of the attractor landscape with the spectral theory of kernel machines. Using a novel metric, "Pinnacle Sharpness," we first uncover a rich phase diagram of attractor stability, identifying a "Ridge of Optimization" where the network achieves maximal robustness under high-load conditions. Phenomenologically, this ridge is characterized by a "Force Antagonism," where a strong driving force is balanced by a collective feedback force. Theoretically, we reveal that this phenomenon arises from a specific reorganization of the weight spectrum, which we term \textit{Spectral Concentration}. Unlike a simple rank-1 collapse, our analysis shows that the network on the ridge self-organizes into a critical state: the leading eigenvalue is amplified to maximize global stability (Direct Force), while the trailing eigenvalues are preserved to maintain high memory capacity (Indirect Force). These findings provide a complete physical picture of how high-capacity associative memories are formed, demonstrating that optimal performance is achieved by tuning the system to a spectral "Goldilocks zone" between rank collapse and diffusion.

                <p>ArfGAP, with dual PH domain-containing protein 1/Centaurin-&alpha;1 (ADAP1/CentA1), is a brain-enriched and highly conserved Arf6 GTPase-activating and Ras-anchoring protein. CentA1 is involved in dendritic outgrowth and arborization, synaptogenesis, and axonal polarization by regulating the actin cytoskeleton dynamics. CentA1 upregulation and association with amyloid plaques in the human Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain suggest the role of this protein in AD progression. To understand the role of CentA1 in neurodegeneration, we crossbred CentA1 knock-out (KO) mice with the J20 mouse model of AD. We evaluated AD-associated behavioral and neuropathological hallmarks and gene expression profiles in J20 and J20 crossed with CentA1 KO (J20xKO) male mice to determine the impact of eliminating CentA1 expression on AD-related phenotypes. Spatial memory assessed by the Morris water maze test showed significant impairment in J20 mice, which was rescued in J20xKO mice. Moreover, neuropathological hallmarks of AD, such as amyloid plaque deposits and neuroinflammation, were significantly reduced in J20xKO mice. To identify potential mediators of AD phenotype rescue, we analyzed differentially expressed genes between genotypes. We found that changes in the gene profile by deletion of CentA1 from J20 (J20xKO vs J20) were anticorrelated with changes caused by APP overexpression (J20 vs wild type), consistent with rescue of J20 phenotypes by CentA1 KO. In summary, our data indicate that CentA1 is required for the progression of AD phenotypes in this model and that targeting CentA1 signaling might have therapeutic potential for AD prevention or treatment.</p>

                <p>In natural, free-viewing settings, visual perception is driven by a series of saccades and fixations. Perceptual mechanisms are typically studied through averaged fixation-related potentials generated from simultaneous eye-tracking and EEG recordings. Lambda responses following fixation onsets signal the arrival of new visual input to the primary visual cortex. In our study, we investigate the use and preprocessing parameter dependence of independent component analysis (ICA) in separating the lambda response from other neural sources. In our experiment, 10 subjects (2 males and 8 females) viewed 80 art paintings in natural, free-viewing settings, during which EEG data were recorded. Our results show that unique lambda response components can be detected reliably and individual lambda waves can be extracted in a single-trial manner, without signal averaging. ICA decomposition is most sensitive to high-pass filtering producing best results with a minimum 1&nbsp;Hz filtering. We also propose a method that automatically and accurately identifies the lambda component among other independent components for further lambda peak detection. These individual lambda waves can then be used to study saccade-related modulation effects without losing temporal and spatial resolution. The novelty of our method is the automatic detection of lambda components and extraction lambda waves, which is a new approach in saccade/fixation and visual perception research under naturalistic viewing conditions.</p>

                Background Women’s financial empowerment is central to achieving inclusive and sustainable development in sub-Saharan Africa. Savings strategies, particularly within Savings and Credit Cooperative Organizations (SACCOs), play a pivotal role in enhancing women’s financial inclusion, independence, and decision-making capacity. Despite progress, rural women in Uganda continue to face barriers such as limited financial literacy, irregular income, and restrictive social norms. This study therefore examined the influence of savings strategies on women’s financial empowerment in Masaka District, Uganda, focusing on structured saving mechanisms and the moderating role of cultural factors. Methods A convergent mixed-methods design grounded in the pragmatic paradigm was employed. Quantitative data were collected from 340 women members of MAMIDECOT SACCO through structured questionnaires, while qualitative data were obtained from interviews with 10 SACCO managers and focus group discussions. Quantitative data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, Pearson correlation, and regression analysis in SPSS v25, whereas qualitative data were thematically analyzed to complement statistical results. Reliability (Cronbach’s α ≥ 0.70) and validity were confirmed, and ethical approval was obtained from the Kampala International University Research Ethics Committee. Findings Results revealed that savings strategies significantly enhanced women’s financial empowerment (R2 = 0.304, F(4,335) = 36.526, p < 0.001), strengthening financial independence, decision-making, and household influence. Group savings fostered mutual trust, accountability, and self-reliance among members. Cultural factors did not significantly moderate the relationship, indicating that structured savings mechanisms were broadly effective across diverse socio-cultural contexts. Conclusions Savings strategies are a critical driver of women’s financial empowerment in rural Uganda. Policymakers and SACCOs should expand gender-sensitive savings products, strengthen governance, and scale up financial literacy programs to sustain empowerment outcomes and promote inclusive economic participation among women.

                Background Entrepreneurial ecosystems are becoming increasingly relevant due to their crucial role in boosting economies through business development, although this concept and the measurement of its performance are still subjects of academic debate. Objective This article aims to analyze the metrics proposed in the literature for evaluating entrepreneurship ecosystems. Methods The PRISMA protocol was followed, enabling a systematic and transparent review. A total of 288 records were obtained from the Scopus and Web of Science databases, and after a thorough screening and detailed content review, a final selection of 39 relevant articles was made. Results The main findings identified key thematic lines related to regional entrepreneurship development, the measurement of global entrepreneurship, networks, benchmarking of entrepreneurial ecosystem policies, and metrics on the economic impact of entrepreneurship. The following main methodologies for measuring these ecosystems were identified: composite indices, network analysis, multicriteria analysis, qualitative methods, and mixed-method approaches. Finally, it is proposed that the five categories of metrics most used to measure the performance of entrepreneurship ecosystems are: outcome metrics, ecosystem condition metrics, composite indices, subjective and perception-based metrics, and other metrics. Conclusions This review provides a useful conceptual foundation for decision-makers, serving as rigorous input for future research and the design of public entrepreneurship policies.

                Background Obesity has been established as a risk factor of osteoarthritis (OA) and this is largely due to the higher mechanical loading on weight bearing joints. However, recent evidence indicates that earlier onset of obesity increases the rate of osteoarthritis formation through the influence of a complex obesogenic joint environment. Methods We performed a narrative literature review to analyze the mechanistic connections between obesity and early-onset osteoarthritis. PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science were searched to identify relevant human and animal studies (published 2010-2025), with a focus on biomechanical overload research, systemic inflammatory effects of adiposity, gut-joint axis (microbiome dysbiosis) and obesity-related epigenetic reprogramming research. Results Mechanical stress on joints was observed to grow with excess body weight, which resulted in the rapid wearing of cartilages and subchondral bone. Obesity is also associated with a systemic pro-inflammatory condition (through adipose-derived cytokines and adipokines), which has the potential to stimulate osteoarthritis in non-weight-bearing joints. Moreover, gut microbiome dysbiosis associated with obesity could impair the integrity of the intestinal barrier, which permits the entry of endotoxins into the circulation and worsens synovial inflammation and cartilage erosion. Chronic inflammation and abnormal mechanical loading of obesity may cause epigenetic changes in chondrocytes and synovial cells (including DNA hypermethylation and microRNA changes) that increase catabolic-related responses of joint tissues predisposing individuals to earlier osteoarthritis Conclusions The problem of obesity causes osteoarthritis in a number of interconnected pathways other than increased load such as systemic inflammation, changes in the gut microbiome, and the reprogramming of epigenetics in joint tissues. The realization of this multi-factorial interplay is the rationale behind the necessity for holistic solutions.

                Background Critical thinking (CT) is a fundamental skill in English Language Teaching (ELT) and a key requirement for 21st century education. Despite its pedagogical importance, a comprehensive understanding of research trends and developments in this field remains limited. This study aims to map the evolution of CT research within ELT by examining publication trends, influential authors and journals, thematic patterns, and existing research gaps. Methods Bibliometric approach was employed to analyse publications on CT in ELT from 2009 to 2024. Data was retrieved from the Scopus database, and 129 eligible publications were examined using VOSviewer, Biblioshiny (R 4.4.1), and Microsoft Excel. The analysis focused on publication growth, citation performance, author and country productivity, keyword co-occurrence mapping, and thematic structures. Results Findings indicate a consistent rise in CT related publications in ELT, with a significant increase between 2009 and 2024. Indonesia was identified as the most productive country, although international collaboration remains limited. The most influential journals include Theory and Practice in Language Studies and the Journal of Language Teaching and Research. Keyword Clustering revealed major themes centred on pedagogy, digital technology, and student engagement, indicating a shift from theoretical discussions toward more applied research directions. Conclusion The growing scholarly attention to CT in ELT highlights its increasing academic relevance but also exposes persistent gaps in empirical implementation and cross-national collaboration. Future research should prioritise inclusive, data driven, and longitudinal approaches that integrate pedagogical experimentation and sociocultural perspectives to strengthen CT development in diverse educational settings.

                <p>by Oluwatoyin Campbell, Dina Dahhan, Viviana Monje</p>

Proteins interact with lipid membranes to facilitate important cellular processes that underlie health and disease. Transmembrane proteins like ion channels are often composed of bound monomers forming specific contacts within the bilayer. However, molecular mechanisms of channel assembly are scarce. Understanding the role of lipids in this process may help further explain assembly of oligomeric proteins, which are often clinical drug targets. Using the hepatitis C virus p7 hexamer as a representative of proteins with complex transmembrane topology, this work characterizes early lipid-driven dimerization using molecular dynamics simulations. Comparing dimer interactions in aqueous solution versus on a lipid membrane model reveal that protein-lipid interactions critically guide inter-protein residue alignment and binding. Hydrophobic contacts and hydrogen bonding between key residues and phosphatidylcholine/phosphatidylinositol lipids drive essential helix interactions that promote p7 oligomerization, particularly involving the first helix. This study demonstrates that membrane lipids are essential, dynamic contributors to protein binding and aggregation in cellular membranes.

Dengue virus (DENV) is an increasingly important human pathogen, with already half of the globe’s population living in environments with transmission potential. Since many cases are missed by direct detection methods (RT-PCR or antigen tests), serological assays play an important role in the diagnostic process. However, individual assays can suffer from low sensitivity and specificity and interpreting results from multiple assays remains challenging, particularly because interpretations from multiple assays may differ, creating uncertainty over how to generate finalized interpretations. We develop a Bayesian mixture model that can jointly model data from multiple paired serological assays, to infer infection events. We first test the performance of our model using simulated data. We then apply our model to 677 pairs of acute and convalescent serum collected as a part of illness and household investigations across two longitudinal cohort studies in Kamphaeng Phet, Thailand, including data from 232 RT-PCR confirmed infections (gold standard). We compare the classification of the new model to prior standard interpretations that independently utilize information from either the hemagglutination inhibition assay (HAI) or the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (EIA). We find that additional serological assays improve accuracy of infection detection for both simulated and real world data. Models incorporating paired IgG and IgM data as well as those incorporating IgG, IgM, and HAI data consistently have higher accuracy when using PCR confirmed infections as a gold standard (87–90% F1 scores, a combined metric of sensitivity and specificity) than currently implemented cut-point approaches (82–84% F1 scores). Our results provide a probabilistic framework through which multiple serological assays across different platforms can be leveraged across sequential serum samples to provide insight into whether individuals have recently experienced a DENV infection. These methods are applicable to other pathogen systems where multiple serological assays can be leveraged to quantify infection history.

                <p>by August Guang, Casey W Dunn, Vlad Novitsky, Mark Howison, Rami Kantor</p>

Molecular epidemiology and HIV-1 transmission networks reconstruction can provide insights into transmission dynamics and inform public health strategies. Long HIV sequences, such as near full-length (nFL) genomes, can improve the accuracy of phylogenetic inference. However, relatively short pol sequences are still broadly used for inferring molecular HIV clusters. Whether a mix of long and short HIV-1 sequences can improve phylogenetic inference of molecular HIV clusters remains unknown.
We propose a flexible approach called T-shaped alignments that incorporates both nFL HIV-1 genomes and partial pol sequences, and investigate whether this approach improves phylogenetic reconstruction of molecular clusters. Under the assumption that clustering from 100% of long sequences is the most accurate, we obtained 1196 subtype B nFL HIV-1 sequences from the Los Alamos National Laboratory Database and a single-study subset, varied the proportion of long and short sequences in our T-shape alignments, systematically masked all non-pol regions with missing characters in proportional increments, and compared tree similarity and cluster inference among datasets.
With the full dataset, we found that when more than 50% of available sequences are nFL, the T-shaped alignment gradually yields results closer to the 100% n, with more and larger clusters identified. However, below the 50% threshold accuracy did not increase. Stringent bootstrap thresholds decreased cluster accuracy gaps but also decreased number of clusters found and mean cluster size. For the subset dataset, we found that the introduction of nFL sequences to the T-shaped alignment improves accuracy in clustering either after a 30% threshold or immediately depending on bootstrap choice.
Our new approach and results suggest that using T-shape alignments to mix HIV-1 sequences of different lengths can improve phylogenetic and clustering accuracy, with needed nFL proportion depending on analysis goals. The T-shape alignment provides a straightforward method for utilizing all available sequences to improve phylogenetic analysis.

                <p>by Nicholas Hananeia, Christian Ebner, Christos Galanis, Hermann Cuntz, Alexander Opitz, Andreas Vlachos, Peter Jedlicka</p>

Background: Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) induces long-term changes in synapses, but the mechanisms behind these modifications are not fully understood. Although there has been progress in the development of multi-scale modeling tools, no comprehensive module for simulating rTMS-induced synaptic plasticity in biophysically realistic neurons exists.
Objective: We developed a modelling framework that allows the replication and detailed prediction of long-term changes of excitatory synapses in neurons stimulated by rTMS.
Methods: We implemented a voltage-dependent plasticity model that has been previously established for simulating frequency-, time-, and compartment-dependent spatio-temporal changes of excitatory synapses in neuronal dendrites. The plasticity model can be incorporated into biophysical neuronal models and coupled to electrical field simulations.
Results: We show that the plasticity modelling framework replicates long-term potentiation (LTP)-like plasticity in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells evoked by 10-Hz repetitive magnetic stimulation (rMS). In line with previous experimental studies, this plasticity was strongly distance dependent and localised to the proximal synapses of the neuron. We predicted a decrease in the plasticity amplitude for 5 Hz and 1 Hz protocols with decreasing frequency. Finally, we successfully modelled plasticity in distal synapses upon local electrical theta-burst stimulation (TBS) and predicted proximal and distal plasticity for rMS TBS. Notably, the rMS TBS-evoked synaptic plasticity exhibited robust facilitation by dendritic spikes and low sensitivity to inhibitory suppression.
Conclusion: The plasticity modelling framework enables precise simulations of LTP-like cellular effects with high spatio-temporal resolution, enhancing the efficiency of parameter screening and the development of plasticity-inducing rTMS protocols.

                <p>by Evie R. Hodgson, Jenni A. Hayward, Rachel A. Leonard, F. Victor Makota, Giel G. van Dooren</p>

The assembly of iron–sulfur (FeS) clusters for cytosolic and nuclear proteins is essential for eukaryotic cell biology. This assembly is mediated by the Cytosolic Iron–sulfur Assembly (CIA) pathway, which localizes to the cytosol of most eukaryotes. We showed previously that the scaffold protein on which cytosolic FeS clusters assemble localizes to the mitochondrion of the apicomplexan parasite <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i>. The localization and importance of the remainder of the pathway in these parasites, however, remained unclear. Here, we undertake a comprehensive analysis of the CIA pathway in <i>T. gondii</i> parasites. We present evidence that the CIA pathway localizes predominantly to the mitochondrion of the parasite and is essential for parasite survival. We show that the three proteins that make up the CIA Targeting Complex (CTC), which facilitates the transfer of FeS clusters to cytosolic and nuclear client proteins, exhibit dual localization to the mitochondrion and cytosol. We reveal that mitochondrial targeting of the CTC is mediated by a novel loop on the CIA1 protein of the complex, and that this loop is critical for parasite survival. We show that an aromatic amino acid motif in the loop facilitates mitochondrial targeting, and that this loop is functionally conserved in apicomplexans and their closest free-living relatives. Our study provides a comprehensive analysis of the CIA pathway in an important group of intracellular parasites, and elucidates pivotal differences in an otherwise ancient and highly conserved biosynthetic pathway that may reflect an evolutionary fitness advantage conferred on <i>Toxoplasma</i> and related organisms.

                <p>by Lilia Kukovska, Katharina A. Wilmes, Natsumi Y. Homma, Claudia Clopath, Jasper Poort</p>

Inhibition is critical for balanced cortical activity and learning. Parvalbumin-expressing cells (PV) are the most common cortical inhibitory interneurons. Strong PV activation inactivates cortical regions. However, the effect of moderate activation on vision and dependence on activation strength, timing, and task difficulty is not established. We investigated these three major factors during visual discriminations in mice. Moderate PV activation in the primary visual cortex (V1) improved easy but not difficult discriminations. It did so only during the initial 120 ms after stimulus onset, corresponding to the initial feedforward processing sweep. Both easy and difficult discriminations required undisturbed late phase activity beyond 120 ms, highlighting the importance of sustained V1 activity. Combined optogenetic activation and two-photon imaging showed that behavioral effects were associated with V1 response selectivity changes. A circuit model with nonlinear activation and strong competitive interactions between V1 cells captured the data. This demonstrates that early and sustained V1 activity is crucial for perceptual discrimination and delineates conditions when PV activation shapes neuronal selectivity to improve behavior.

<i>Streptomyces</i> bacteria are renowned for their multicellular lifestyle and as Nature’s medicine makers, producing the majority of the clinical antibiotics. A landmark event during early development is the lytic dismantling of the substrate mycelium. Degradation of the hyphal cell-wall leads to the accumulation of <i>N</i>-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) in the colonies, which is a metabolic checkpoint during the onset of development and antibiotic production. Here, we show that GlcNAc sensing requires a toxicity pathway dependent on the enzyme GlcNAc-6P dehydratase (NagS). Dehydration of GlcNAc-6P by NagS to 6P-chromogen I is an unprecedented reaction in central metabolism that is highly conserved in – and limited to – the <i>Streptomycetaceae</i>. 6P-chromogen I is metabolized into a structural analogue of ribose by a promiscuous activity of GlcNAc-6P deacetylase NagA. Toxicity is relieved by supplementing the growth media with ribose. Structure-function analysis of NagS not only highlighted key residues in the active site of the enzyme in interaction with its substrate GlcNAc-6P, but also revealed 6-phosphogluconate as its catalytic inhibitor. Our work uncovers a conserved metabolic toxicity pathway in <i>Streptomyces</i> that revolves around a novel enzyme that plays a key role in nutrient signaling.

Roland, Ignacio Saez, Fady Girgis, Robert T. Knight, Noa Ofen, Elizabeth L. Johnson</p>

Episodic memory depends on the coordination of local processing, indexed by high-frequency broadband (HFB) activity, with global organization, indexed by theta oscillations. However, theta and HFB exhibit asynchronous timing, raising the question of how results of local processing are communicated. Using intracranial EEG in patients performing a recognition memory task, we examined this coordination across medial temporal (MTL) and prefrontal (PFC) regions. HFB peaks occurred earlier in the MTL than in the PFC. Contrasting analyses were anchored either to these internally driven HFB peaks or to the external event of stimulus presentation. We discovered three key results. First, the role of the PFC changed from encoding to retrieval. Specifically, PFC-MTL theta connectivity was aligned with internal PFC peaks during encoding, suggesting top-down initiation. By contrast, this connection was aligned with external stimulus presentation during retrieval, suggesting bottom-up initiation. Second, the anterior cingulate cortex exhibited connectivity that was aligned to internal HFB peaks only, suggesting that its role is evaluative, devoid of direct stimulus processing. Third, graph theoretic analysis of whole-brain connectivity patterns revealed that the connections predicting successful memory performance were embedded in transient, sparse network states. These results reveal that analyses triggered from internally-generated events yield different results when compared to classic analyses triggered using external events. The picture that emerges is a sequence of specific, short-lived, internally-generated states that drive episodic memory success.

Social interactions shape our perception of the world, influencing how we interpret incoming information. Alignment between interacting individuals’ sensory and cognitive processes is key to successful cooperation and communication, but the neural processes underlying this alignment remain unknown. Here, we leveraged Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA) on electroencephalography (EEG) hyperscanning data to investigate information alignment in 24 pairs of participants who performed a categorization task together based on agreed-upon rules. Significant interbrain information alignment emerged within 45 ms of stimulus presentation and persisted for hundreds of milliseconds. Early alignment (45–180 ms) occurred in both real and randomly matched pseudo-pairs, reflecting shared sensory responses. Importantly, alignment after 200 ms strengthened with practice and was unique to real pairs, driven by shared representations associated with, and extending beyond, the categorization rules they formed. Together, these findings highlight distinct processes underpinning interbrain information alignment during social interactions, that can be effectively captured and disentangled with Interbrain RSA.

                <p>by Martin B. L. McAndrew, Jonathan Cook, Amy Gill, Kavya Sahoo, Clare Thomas, Phillip J. Stansfeld, Allister Crow</p>

Type VII ABC transporters are ATP-powered membrane protein complexes that drive key biological processes in the bacterial cell envelope. In <i>Escherichia coli</i>, three of the four Type VII ABC systems have been extensively characterized, including: the FtsEX-EnvC cell division complex, the LolCDE-LolA lipoprotein trafficking machinery, and the MacAB-TolC efflux pump. Here we describe a fourth <i>E. coli</i> Type VII ABC system, YbbAP-TesA, which combines a Type VII ABC transporter with a multifunctional hydrolytic enzyme. Structures of the complete YbbAP-TesA complex, and of YbbAP with and without bound ATP analogues, capture implied long-range transmembrane conformational changes that are the hallmark of this ABC superfamily’s mechanotransmission mechanism. We further show that YbbAP-TesA can hydrolyze a variety of ester and thioester substrates and experimentally confirm a constellation of active site residues in TesA. Our data suggests YbbAP has a role in extracting hydrophobic molecules from the inner membrane and presenting these to TesA for hydrolysis. The work extends collective knowledge of the remarkable diversity of the ABC superfamily and establishes a new function for Type VII ABC transporters in bacterial cells.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-336/v2?src=rss">Evaluation of the effect of two conventional and one herbal mouthwash on the modulus of elasticity of three orthodontic wires: an in vitro study. [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background During fixed appliance therapy, maintaining good oral hygiene is crucial; however, certain mouthwashes can negatively impact orthodontic treatment by altering the mechanical properties of archwires. The study investigated the impact of conventional mouthwashes on orthodontic archwires’ Modulus of Elasticity (MoE). Methods It was an in vitro study that tested MoE of stainless steel (SS), nickel-titanium (NiTi), and β-titanium (β-Ti) archwires after immersing them in chlorhexidine (CHX), sodium fluoride (NaF), and HiORA mouthwashes along with distilled water (control) for one minute daily over three months. The wires were then subjected to a three-point bending test to measure their flexural modulus of elasticity (MoE) while applying loading and unloading forces at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, and 2.5 mm deflections. Statistical analysis included two-way ANOVA and Tukey’s Post Hoc test at significant α≤0.05. Results NaF reduced MoE for SS (loading 172.99 ± 7.71 GPa, unloading 148.88 ± 14.65 GPa), NiTi (Loading: 48.42 ± 6.13 GPa, unloading 30.60 ± 4.29 GPa), β-Ti wires (unloading 79.51 ± 1.62 GPa) than Control (loading 185.35 ± 8.06 GPa, unloading 199.78 ± 9.49 GPa) with p<0.05. CHX mouthwash reduced SS (loading -158.58 ± 4.47 GPa, unloading-138.54 ± 6.12 GPa), NiTi (unloading 37.05 ± 2.58 GPa), β-Ti (unloading 81.58 ± 7.94 GPa) with p<0.05. HiORA showed no significant differences in MoE for SS (loading 190.28 ± 7.54 GPa, unloading 185.58 ± 5.35 GPa), NiTi (loading 58.85 ± 2.39, unloading 37.05 ± 2.58), or β-Ti archwire (loading 89.92 ± 2.20, unloading 104.22 ± 5.00) compared to the controls with p<0.05. Conclusion HiORA herbal mouthwash is safe for NiTi, SS, and β-Ti archwires at all stages. Chlorhexidine (CHX) mouthwash should be prescribed briefly to prevent MoE degradation in NiTi and β-Ti archwires. NaF-based rinses should be cautiously used and monitored in SS, NiTi, and β-Ti archwires patients.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-1203/v2?src=rss">Navigating Barriers and Building Pathways: Inclusive Education for Children with Special Needs [version 2; peer review: 3 approved]</a></h4>

              
                This quantitative study investigates the current landscape of inclusive education for children with special needs in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, with a focus on identifying perceived barriers, assessing institutional support, and quantifying the attitudes of key stakeholders, including teachers, special educators, school administrators, and parents. Drawing on a sample of 550 participants across three major districts of Jeddah, the research utilized a structured questionnaire incorporating Likert-scale items to capture perceptions of inclusion, obstacles to implementation, and the systemic support available in schools. Descriptive analysis revealed generally positive attitudes toward inclusive education (M = 3.85), though moderate levels of perceived barriers (M = 2.90) and institutional support (M = 3.23) suggest significant implementation challenges remain. ANOVA and t-tests showed no statistically significant differences in attitudes across gender or professional roles, indicating a shared understanding of inclusive values across stakeholder groups. However, regression analysis showed no significant predictors of attitudes in a linear model, whereas path analysis revealed that institutional support had a strong positive effect (β = 0.431, p < 0.0001), and perceived barriers had a significant negative effect (β = -0.270, p < 0.0001). These findings underscore the importance of structural and systemic factors in shaping inclusive education outcomes. The study concludes with recommendations for improving institutional support, enhancing teacher training, and fostering inclusive infrastructure, while also noting limitations related to geography and self-reporting. The research contributes to Saudi Arabia’s broader Vision 2030 goals by offering evidence-based insights for creating a more inclusive and equitable education system.

                Dzama-Karels et al. identify the menin-MLL1 complex as crucial for hepatocellular carcinoma survival. Its disruption disturbs the PI3k/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway and chromatin accessibility. Menin inhibition promotes the redistribution of the NF-Y complex to sites associated with cell migration and invasion. Combining menin inhibition and NFYB knockout increases hepatocellular carcinoma cell death.

                Aluminum (Al) toxicity in acid soils inhibits primary root elongation. Kar et al. demonstrate that light plays an important role in modulating plant resistance against aluminum. Blue light via cryptochromes activates an HY5-STOP1 module to positively regulate ALMT1 and MATE expression to promote carboxylate exudation. This prevents Al entry into the root and promotes Al exclusion. In the dark, COP1 interacts with and degrades STOP1 and HY5 to inhibit root growth under Al. In conclusion, blue light promotes, whereas dark inhibits, Al resistance in Arabidopsis.

Using dense sampling in two female participants with typical cycles, one with endometriosis, and one using oral contraceptives, we show that distinct hormonal milieus influence widespread, coordinated fluctuations in brain volume across the cycle. These results highlight the importance of looking beyond the ‘typical’ menstrual cycle to understand how hormones drive structural brain plasticity in different conditions.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92964">Avoidance of hydrogen sulfide is modulated by external and internal states in Caenorhabditis elegans</a></h4>

              
                Hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S) acts as an energy source, a toxin, and a gasotransmitter across diverse biological contexts. We use the robust locomotory responses of <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> to high levels of H<sub>2</sub>S to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying its acute and adaptive responses. We find that the H<sub>2</sub>S-evoked behavioral response is shaped by multiple environmental factors including oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) levels and nutritional state and is modulated by various pathways such as insulin, TGF-β, and HIF-1 signaling, as well as by input from O<sub>2</sub>-sensing neurons. Prolonged exposure to H<sub>2</sub>S activates HIF-1 signaling, leading to the upregulation of stress-responsive genes, including those involved in H<sub>2</sub>S detoxification. This promotes an adaptive state in which locomotory speed is reduced in H<sub>2</sub>S, while responsiveness to other stimuli is preserved. In mutants deficient in HIF-1 signaling, iron storage, and detoxification mechanisms, animals display a robust initial response but rapidly enter a sleep-like behavior characterized by reduced mobility and diminished responsiveness to subsequent sensory stimuli. Furthermore, while acute production of mitochondria-derived reactive O<sub>2</sub> species (ROS) appears to initiate the avoidance response to H<sub>2</sub>S, persistently high ROS promotes an adaptive state, likely by activating various stress-response pathways, without substantially compromising cellular H<sub>2</sub>S detoxification capacity. Taken together, our study provides comprehensive molecular insights into the mechanisms through which <i>C. elegans</i> modulates and adapts its response to H<sub>2</sub>S exposure.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/102287">Decapping activators Edc3 and Scd6 act redundantly with Dhh1 in post-transcriptional repression of starvation-induced pathways</a></h4>

              
                Degradation of many yeast mRNAs involves decapping by the Dcp1:Dcp2 complex. Previous studies on decapping activators Edc3 and Scd6 suggested their limited roles in mRNA decay. RNA-seq analysis of mutants lacking one or both proteins revealed that Scd6 and Edc3 have largely redundant activities in targeting numerous mRNAs for degradation that are masked in the single mutants. These transcripts are frequently targeted by decapping activators Dhh1 and Pat1, and the collective evidence suggests that Scd6/Edc3 act interchangeably to recruit Dhh1 to Dcp2. Ribosome profiling shows that redundancy between Scd6 and Edc3 and their functional interactions with Dhh1 and Pat1 extend to translational repression of particular transcripts, including a cohort of poorly translated mRNAs displaying interdependent regulation by all four factors. Scd6/Edc3 also participate with Dhh1/Pat1 in post-transcriptional repression of proteins required for respiration and catabolism of alternative carbon sources, which are normally expressed only in limiting glucose. Simultaneously eliminating Scd6/Edc3 increases mitochondrial membrane potential and elevates metabolites of the tricarboxylic acid and glyoxylate cycles typically observed only during growth in low glucose. Thus, Scd6/Edc3 acts redundantly, in parallel with Dhh1 and in cooperation with Pat1, to adjust gene expression to nutrient availability by controlling mRNA decapping and decay.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/107309">Evolution of gene expression in seasonal environments</a></h4>

              
                The biological activities of organisms are closely linked to seasonality. Phenology, the temporal orchestration of biological activities, is governed by gene expression, yet the evolutionary dynamics underlying seasonal gene expression remain unclear. To investigate these dynamics, we compared genome-wide expression dynamics (molecular phenology) in four dominant evergreen Fagaceae species in Asia (<i>Quercus glauca</i>, <i>Q. acuta</i>, <i>Lithocarpus edulis</i>, and <i>L. glaber</i>), using leaf and bud tissues over two seasonal cycles. We assembled high-quality reference genomes, identifying 11749 single-copy orthologous genes. Seasonal transcriptomic profiling of these orthologous genes revealed highly conserved gene expression across species in winter when temperatures fall below ~10 °C. Rhythmic gene expression with significant periodic oscillations was more prevalent in buds (51.9%) than in leaves (40.6%), with most rhythmic genes (78.4–92.0%) exhibiting annual periodicity, while a smaller fraction (1.2–11.9%) followed half-annual cycles. The seasonal peaks of rhythmic genes were highly synchronized across species in winter but diverged during the growing season, reflecting species-specific timing of leaf flushing and flowering. These findings suggest that the four species share a common molecular calendar in winter, which constrains the evolution of gene expression under seasonal environments.

">A default-control network cortical gradient differentiates the imagination of social and solitary experiences</a></h4>

              
                Understanding the neural activity underlying spontaneous thought - when attention shifts from external tasks to internally generated content - is a central challenge in cognitive neuroscience. However, research on such internal states has lagged external task-related studies of brain activity, partly due to challenges surrounding controlling and recording self-generated thought. Recent advances suggest that a neural activation gradient underlies transitions between external and internally focused cognitive states, separating opposing activation/deactivation of frontoparietal control and default mode networks along a continuum. To characterize internal cognitive states associated with this neural gradient, we used functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) to measure brain activity while participants imagined a variety of personal scenarios prompted by generic text cues (e.g., party, housework), mimicking self-generated thought. Prior to scanning, participants verbally described the scenarios and rated their experiential features. Gradient-space analysis identified a cognitive transition between imagining (not undertaking) solitary activities (e.g., housework), which activated the frontoparietal network relative to the default mode network, and social activities (e.g., party), which exhibited the reverse pattern. Because all states were internally focused (i.e. imagined) and were self-generated under the same (non-interactive) task, these findings refine the cognitive interpretation of the frontoparietal to default mode gradient, showing that it does not strictly differentiate between external (task-positive) and internal (task-negative) cognitive states.

">Synaptic MEMOIR: mapping individual synapses of neurons with protein barcodes</a></h4>

              
                Obtaining wiring diagrams of brains has been a major achievement for neuroscience. However, an underlying challenge in connectomics is the fundamental tradeoff between the imaging resolution needed to resolve synapses and the volume of the brain that can be imaged. For example, electron microscopy (EM) visualizes synaptic sites with ~5 nm resolution, but is difficult to scale beyond volumes of 1 mm3. Here, we present Synaptic MEMOIR (Memory with Engineered Mutagenesis with Optical in situ Readout) that enables imaging of neuronal projections in animal brains with single-synapse resolution. Synaptic MEMOIR is built around three key design features. First, protein barcodes are transported to synapses to allow matching of synaptic barcodes to cell body barcodes without high resolution imaging and the error-prone process of tracing neuronal processes across long distances. Second, Synaptic MEMOIR uses continuous mutagenesis to generate a large diversity of barcodes to uniquely label cell bodies and synapses. Last, the timing of recombination and transport can be tuned to record synaptic age or projection information. Combining these features, we demonstrated projection mapping of 113 neurons in the Drosophila melanogaster optic lobe in a volume of 9.5 million m3. Because synapses are identified by transported barcodes with optical microscopy at 300 nm resolution, this approach can potentially scale to much larger volumes, similar at least to those imaged in recent mouse brain transcriptomics atlases. In addition, synaptic MEMOIR can match barcodes across brain sections, and does not require tissue clearing to track long-range projections. Together, these results provide the foundation for a scalable optical image-based system for reconstructing the neural wiring diagrams of brains across different developmental stages, genetic backgrounds and perturbations.

To guide behavior, the brain must extract information about object identities and their dynamics from entangled sensory inputs. How it accomplishes this feat remains an open question. Predictive coding theories propose that this ability arises by comparing predicted sensory signals with actual inputs and reducing the associated prediction errors. However, existing models rely on generative architectures that compute prediction errors directly in the input space, which is hard to reconcile with neural anatomy. Here, we develop a theory that avoids this issue by operating solely on internal representations. Specifically, we introduce recurrent predictive learning (RPL), a recurrent joint-embedding predictive architecture inspired by self-supervised machine learning, that learns abstract representations of object identity and their dynamics and predicts future object motion. Crucially, the model learns sequence representations that resemble successor-like representations observed in the primary visual cortex of humans. The model also develops abstract sequence representations comparable to those reported in the macaque prefrontal cortex. Finally, we outline how RPL's modular feedforward-recurrent organization could map onto canonical cortical microcircuits as a plausible model of cortical representation learning. Our work establishes a circuit-centric theory framework that unifies predictive processing with self-supervised learning, providing a fresh perspective on how the brain acquires an internal model of the world.

">Modelling mental disorders in zebrafish. Neurexins severely modulate anxiety, social behaviours and aggression.</a></h4>

              
                Can we reproduce mental disorders in zebrafish? To explore this question, we manipulated the neurexin gene family. Neurexin (nrxn) genes encode synaptic cell-adhesion molecules that have been repetitively associated with neurodevelopmental and mental disorders. While the zebrafish animal model offers tremendous advantages for dissecting neural development/function, no robust nrxn zebrafish models are currently available. In this study, we generated the first collection of zebrafish knockout lines for each nrxn gene, with mutations ranging from transmembrane domain- to full genomic locus-deletions. Surprisingly, all homozygous lines developed normally, presenting no gross neurodevelopmental or obvious early behavioural abnormalities. However, this absence of early phenotypes translated into profound, paralog-specific behavioural alterations emerging during juvenile-to-adult stages. All neurexin knockouts affected mating behaviour, complicating the generation and maintenance of homozygous lines. Except for this shared behavioural alteration, nrxn1, but not nrxn2 or nrxn3, led to marked changes in social behaviour and aggression. In contrast, nrxn2 mutants exhibited severe anxiety-like behaviours, including bottom-dwelling and repetitive freezing/seizure events. Strikingly, nrxn1 full-locus deletion mutants showed opposing behaviour, spending most of their time near the surface. The two also displayed opposite responses to open/closed field transitions; confinement alleviated nrxn2 anxiety but enhanced nrxn1 surface-dwelling. Meanwhile, nrxn3 mutants behaved normally in all our initial tests. In summary, our study introduces a complete set of zebrafish mutants covering the whole nrxn gene family, presenting striking juvenile/adult behavioural alterations despite the absence of noticeable early defects; echoing the delayed onset of human psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia. This work demonstrates the value of zebrafish to study mental disorders and unlock a novel platform to unravel the pathogenic contribution of neurexin and associated subtle neurodevelopmental changes/timing that drive the emergence of mental illnesses.

">Data-driven Cognitive Clusters in Persistent Developmental Dyslexia</a></h4>

              
                Developmental dyslexia is a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by persistent reading difficulties despite adequate intelligence and educational opportunities. The cognitive underpinnings of dyslexia remain incompletely understood. Although multiple causal pathways have been proposed, there is a gap in studies that can reliably identify dyslexia subtypes based on comprehensive evaluations that go beyond measures of reading and phonology. We employed one of the largest detailed samples of children with developmental dyslexia resistant to intervention, consisting of 147 extensively phenotyped school-age children aged 7-14 years who were recruited from specialized schools for students with learning differences. We implemented data-driven analyses leveraging a comprehensive neuropsychological assessment to delineate cognitive subdomains and characterize the heterogeneity in the sample. Hierarchical clustering of 24 cognitive measures aided in constructing a framework to subsequently interpret emerging clusters. Four clusters emerged, predominantly associated with: Processing Speed & Executive Function, Visuospatial & Mathematical Reasoning, Phonological Manipulation, and Verbal Short-term Memory & Word Retrieval. Subsequent latent profile analysis identified two distinct dyslexia profiles: one characterized by marked difficulties in executive functioning and processing speed, and another displaying impairments primarily in verbal short-term memory and word retrieval relative to the other profile. Importantly, both profiles exhibited comparable severity of persistent reading difficulties despite their divergent cognitive profiles. These findings show that phenotypically similar reading impairments can arise from distinct underlying cognitive factors, emphasizing the role of comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation in developing tailored interventions for affected children.

">Cognition Disconnected: The Influence of Domain-General Cognition (g) in Lesion-Deficit Mapping</a></h4>

              
                Lesion-deficit mapping is a premier technique for dissociating neural correlates of cognitive functions. However, the contribution of domain-general cognition (g) to the performance of virtually all complex behavioral tasks may encumber such efforts. This possibility has been largely unexplored. Here, we examined the influence of g in lesion-deficit mapping using a combination of structural equation modeling, lesion-behavior mapping (LBM), and structural (sLNM) and functional (fLNM) lesion network mapping. We modeled latent variables for visuospatial ability, processing speed, language, and anterograde memory among 473 patients with focal brain damage (age range 20-93, 257 men, 216 women), both with and without g-associated variance embedded within each factor. Lesion-deficit maps for domain-specific cognitive abilities were statistically significantly less spatially inter-correlated after partitioning out g (p = 0.010 for LBM; p = 0.003 for sLNM; p = 0.003 for fLNM). Lesion-deficit maps also implicated the existence of distinct neuroanatomy for specific cognitive domains that was, in many cases, only apparent and clearly distinct from lesion-deficit maps of g after partitioning out the influence of g. Overall, our findings suggest that, if left unaccounted for, domain-general cognitive variance could tangibly affect conclusions about the extent to which different cognitive functions rely on distinct neuroanatomy.

">Neuroanatomical signatures of depression and anxiety in at-risk adolescents: A symptom-oriented perspective</a></h4>

              
                Background: Major depressive disorder (MDD) and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) often emerge in adolescence. Identifying their symptom structures and neural biomarkers in youth with elevated risk is critical for early detection and developing interventions. This study investigated the central symptoms of MDD and GAD and identified the key brain regions (brain bridges) linking structural neuroanatomy to symptoms in at-risk adolescents. Methods: A total of 1,568 adolescents at high risk for MDD and 413 adolescents at high risk for GAD were identified from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study. Participants completed MDD and GAD symptom assessments and underwent Magnetic Resonance Imaging scanning. We constructed 10 psychological network models incorporating symptoms and brain structural indices to identify central symptoms and brain bridges. Results: Concentration difficulties emerged as the shared core symptom, while self-hatred and irritability were the unique central symptoms for MDD and GAD, respectively. Left- and right-pallidum volumes exhibited the highest bridge centrality for MDD symptoms, whereas left-nucleus accumbens volume showed the highest bridge centrality for GAD symptoms. Conclusion: Our findings highlight the pallidum and nucleus accumbens as key brain regions linking structural anatomy to symptom networks in high-risk youth. These results provide novel insights into early neurobiological markers of MDD and GAD from a symptom-oriented perspective and may inform targeted interventions.

">Dysregulated lactate metabolism synergizes with ALS genetic risk factors to accelerate motor decline</a></h4>

              
                Neurons rely on glial lactate shuttling for metabolic support, which declines with aging and in neurodegenerative disease. Full disruption of lactate shuttling in peripheral nerves causes progressive axon degeneration, but we were interested to understand how partial disruption, a scenario more relevant to aging and disease, contributes to neurodegeneration risk. Pyruvate and lactate are interconverted by lactate dehydrogenases (LDHA and LDHB) in both lactate producing and consuming cells. We therefore began by investigating Ldhb knockout mice (loss of LDHA, the dominant LDH in liver and muscle, caused embryonic lethality), and discovered that they develop progressive neuromuscular junction atrophy and functional decline without axon degeneration. Because even Ldhb+/- heterozygosity significantly affects motor behavior, we also wondered about a potential link to congenital disease and pursued this by identifying rare loss-of-function LDHB variants among ALS patients. Next, to better understand how LDHB loss leads to motor decline, we selectively deleted it in defined cell types. SC-specific deletion caused robust motor defects, whereas motor neuron-specific deletion has little effect. Reasoning that neuronal LDHB deficiency could model age-associated decline in lactate metabolism, we asked whether it would interact with ALS genetic risk. Indeed, motor-neuron LDHB deficiency synergizes with relatively mild ALS risk variants, TDP43-Q331K and Sod1-D83G knock-in alleles, to produce early motor neuropathy, indicating that LDHB loss enhances disease risk. These findings establish lactate metabolism as a modifier of motor system vulnerability and highlight it as a therapeutic target in peripheral as well as central neurodegeneration.

">Sex-Specific Induction of H3K27me1 in the Prefrontal Cortex Mediates the Enduring Effects of Early Life Stress</a></h4>

              
                Early life stress (ELS) is a strong risk factor for several neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders and is associated with persistent molecular alterations in corticolimbic regions, including the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Here, we combined unbiased proteomics profiling and viral-mediated gene transfer to characterize the enduring epigenetic changes in the PFC of male and female mice previously exposed to ELS. We found that ELS induced sex-specific and age-dependent accumulation of monomethylation of lysine 27 at histone H3 (H3K27me1), with a transient increase in adolescent females, and a delayed but enduring effect in adult males. ELS-induced H3K27me1 accumulation in the PFC involved changes of SUZ12, a subunit of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), which controls H3K27 methylation patterns. Indeed, expression of the catalytic domain of SUZ12, VEFS, in PFC neurons during adolescence led to sex differences in social and cognitive alterations in adulthood. Together, our results demonstrate that H3K27me1 functions as a chromatin scar in the PFC, mediating lifelong susceptibility to ELS in a sex-specific manner.

">Synthesizing images to map neural networks to the human brain</a></h4>

              
                Computational models can be used to generate hypotheses about the brain. In the visual system, this approach has revealed similarities between how natural images are represented in convolutional neural networks and in cortical regions. However, natural images generate highly correlated representations across the hierarchy of model layers, meaning that each brain region will not correspond selectively to a single layer. Because each model layer performs additional image transformations, gaining a more selective mapping between individual layers and regions could reveal how specific algorithmic stages of processing are instantiated in the brain. To enable this mapping, we developed a generative framework for image synthesis that minimizes the similarity of image representational similarity matrices across model layers, aiming to orthogonalize the distances between the patterns of unit activations evoked by the same set of images. With the patterns orthogonalized, the resulting similarity matrix for each layer provides a fingerprint of the unique computational role of that layer. To test this approach, we synthesized 16 artificial images from the Inception-V1/GoogLeNet model and scanned participants with fMRI while they viewed these images repeatedly in random order. Image-specific patterns of voxel activity were used to compute image-by-image similarity matrices across the whole brain with searchlights. Most layers could be mapped to circumscribed cortical regions, and these mappings overlapped less than the mappings obtained with natural images. Given the prevalence of existing fMRI datasets with natural images, we used the synthesis method as a benchmark to develop an alternative residual method that can achieve comparable performance for natural image datasets. These approaches could be extended to other neural network architectures and stimulus modalities for targeted mappings of model computations to the brain and behavior.

">Memory traces bias new learning for hippocampal generalization</a></h4>

              
                The ability to use generalized prior experience to guide behavior in novel situations is a fundamental cognitive function. While recent evidence suggests that the hippocampus supports generalization how this is accomplished is poorly understood. Here we combined longitudinal optical imaging in head-fixed mice with computational modeling to examine generalization in hippocampal area CA1. We found that prior training accelerated behavioral adaptation to a novel environment and that this was accompanied by highly stable hippocampal representations. We identified putative memory traces from prior experience that enabled this generalization at multiple levels. At the population level, novel-context network dynamics rapidly aligned with low-dimensional neural subspaces established during prior experience. At the cellular level, spatially-informative weak ''residual'' activity reflecting generalizable information about the task structure appeared to bias which neurons form place fields (PFs) and where via behavioral timescale synaptic plasticity (BTSP). Finally, this was an active process as many PFs changed their reference frame in the novel environment to reflect the consistent task structure. In sum, the influence of memory traces on new PF formation may allow past experience to guide new learning such that representations are based on generalizable features, thus enabling rapid adaptive behavior in new contexts.

">Mapping the Developmental Trajectory of Functional Brain Networks in Early Infancy: Insights into Typical Maturation</a></h4>

              
                Early infancy is a crucial period for brain development, during which fundamental functional and structural frameworks are established. Understanding the maturation of large-scale brain networks during this stage is essential for characterizing normative neurodevelopment and identifying potential deviations linked to neurodevelopmental disorders. In this study, we investigated developmental changes in the spatial organization of functional brain networks in infants using a longitudinal resting-state fMRI dataset comprising 137 scans from 74 low-likelihood developing infants aged 0-6 months. We applied independent component analysis to extract large-scale brain networks and utilized advanced spatial metrics, including network-averaged spatial similarity (NASS) to assess alignment with group-level patterns, network strength to quantify neural engagement based on voxel intensities, and network size to examine spatial distribution. Our findings reveal significant age-related increases in NASS across multiple networks, indicating greater consistency in functional organization over time. Additionally, most networks demonstrated increased network strength, reflecting heightened neural involvement, while network size exhibited distinct developmental trajectories, with some networks expanding and others remaining stable. These results highlight the dynamic evolution of functional brain architecture during early infancy, providing critical insights into neurodevelopmental processes.

">Altered striatal dopamine dynamics and behavior in Grin2a mutant mice, a genetic mouse model of schizophrenia</a></h4>

              
                Schizophrenia (SCZ), a complex psychiatric disorder with a strong genetic basis, is thought to involve, at least in part, dopamine dysregulation in the striatum. Recent large-scale exome sequencing has identified multiple SCZ risk genes, including GRIN2A (encoding an NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptor subunit) and AKAP11 (encoding a protein kinase A binding protein), which is also a risk gene for bipolar disorder (BD). However, the mechanisms by which these genetic risk factors perturb dopamine circuits and cause psychotic symptoms remain poorly understood. We asked how behavior, dorsomedial striatal dopamine (DA) dynamics and the activity of D1-/D2-spiny projection neurons (SPNs) were altered in Grin2a and Akap11 mutants. In the open field, Grin2a knockout mice display hyperlocomotion and an abnormal organization of naturalistic behaviors. They also displayed heightened behavioral responses to objects and auditory stimuli. Grin2a heterozygous animals mostly showed intermediate phenotypes, suggesting a dose-dependent effect of Grin2a loss. Further, Grin2a knockout mutants exhibited aberrant dopamine events, altered coupling of dopamine with locomotor features, and exaggerated stimuli-evoked dopamine responses. Notably, heterozygous animals also showed altered striatal SPN events in the open field reflecting dysregulated neural activity in both dSPNs and iSPNs. Compared to Grin2a mutants, Akap11 mutants displayed opposite phenotypes, showing reduced locomotion with a shift from high- to low-velocity movement and distinct alterations in striatal neural activity. Together, GRIN2A (SCZ risk) and AKAP11 (BD/SCZ risk) mutations induce different, often opposite, effects on striatal dopamine signaling and behavior, suggesting that these two risk genes act through distinct mechanisms.

">SPATIAL DISSIMILARITY TRAJECTORIES REVEAL RAPID FUNCTIONAL NETWORK REFINEMENT DURING EARLY INFANCY</a></h4>

              
                The first six months of life mark a critical window for human brain development, characterized by rapid synaptic formation, axonal growth, and network reorganization. During this period' large-scale functional networks progressively mature. Although prior infant fMRI studies have characterized temporal functional connectivity, the spatial organization and refinement of brain networks during early infancy remain underexplored. In this study, we analyzed longitudinal resting-state fMRI from 74 typically developing infants (0-6 months; 137 scans) using group independent component analysis (ICA) with group-information-guided ICA (GIG-ICA) back-reconstruction. Spatial dissimilarity between each infants spatial map and the group-level map was quantified using cosine dissimilarity and Euclidean distance. Generalized additive models were applied to model age-related trends. Both cosine and Euclidean dissimilarity metrics showed significant decreases with age, indicating a progressive convergence of individual network topographies toward the group-level architecture. These findings reveal increasing spatial coherence and refinement of large-scale brain networks during early infancy, suggesting that spatial maturation complements the well-established functional integration observed in temporal connectivity studies.

">Neurodegeneration in the olfactory system in Niemann Pick type C1 disease</a></h4>

              
                Niemann-Pick type C1 (NPC1) disease is a rare neurodegenerative disorder linked to defective cholesterol biosynthesis and altered lipid regulation. In patients, the most common variant in the Npc1 gene is a missense mutation that leads to a misfolded and non-functional NPC1 protein. We used a mouse model carrying this mutation (I1061T, Npc1tm(I1061T)Dso) to investigate the olfactory system since olfaction is often negatively impacted in many neurodegenerative disorders, with olfactory decline frequently preceding other neurodegenerative symptoms. We characterized cell types in the olfactory epithelium (OE) in wild-type, heterozygous, and homozygous Npc1tm(I1061T)Dso mice to analyze neurodegeneration at two time points, namely 36 and 60 days after birth. In homozygous Npc1tm(I1061T)Dso mice the density of olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) at 36 days after birth is decreased compared to wild type and heterozygous mice while the density of immature OSNs and the stem cell niche seems to not be affected. In the OE of the homozygous Npc1tm(I1061T)Dso mice we found an increased density of apoptotic cells and clear sign of neuroinflammation in macrophage/microglia infiltrating the OE. We analyzed the lipid profile of OE by positive MALDI-TOF and found increased markers of neuroinflammation homozygous Npc1tm(I1061T)Dso mice. These structural changes affected the functionality of the OE since we found reduced odorant responses in Npc1tm(I1061T)Dso mice compared to wild type. Additionally, our olfactory behavioral tests revealed deficits in odor-guided food-seeking tests in Npc1tm(I1061T)Dso but not in the wild type and heterozygous mice. We also analyzed the olfactory abilities of a family of three with the parents carrying two different mutations of the Npc1 gene, with the child carrying both mutations and being diagnosed with NPC1 disease. Using the Sniffin Sticks olfactory test, we found that all three were hyposmic with the child having severe hyposmia. Our work extensively characterized the OE structurally and functionally proposing it as a sentinel to monitor disease progression. We are the first to show that NPC1 patients are affected by severe hyposmia and that heterozygous parents could be monitored for olfactory abilities since it could be a biomarker for future neurological disorders.

">Consistent Neural Representation of Affective States between Watching and Recall using fNIRS</a></h4>

              
                People tend to recall similar feelings when remembering the same event. Yet the neural mechanisms by which emotional valence and arousal are represented during perception and later recall remain unclear. Here, we used functional near-infrared spectroscopy to record prefrontal cortex activity while participants viewed and then freely recalled short video clips designed to elicit four affective states (amusement, calmness, disgust, and sadness). Multidimensional scaling revealed that both modality-general (shared across viewing and recall) and modality-specific (unique to each phase) dimensions of valence and arousal were significant, and cross-modal classification successfully decoded valence and arousal. Our results support a hierarchical model in which a stable core affect is preserved across perception and memory, while context-dependent refinements adapt emotional representations during recall. This work highlights fNIRS as a useful tool for studying emotional memory in ecologically valid settings and lays groundwork for multimodal imaging of affective replay.

">Chronotype-specific impacts of sleep-wake schedule on behavioral, physiological and psychological parameters</a></h4>

              
                Diurnal variations in human performance are known to be associated with chronotype, which reflects individual differences in preferred sleep -wake cycles. Early chronotypes (ECs) exhibit superior motor and cognitive functions in the morning, whereas late chronotypes (LCs) tend to perform better in the evening. However, previous studies have examined these patterns under socially imposed nighttime sleep schedules, without considering individuals' preferred sleep timing. Thus, it remains unclear whether these chronotype-dependent performance peaks persist when individuals follow their preferred sleep schedules. To address this question, we measured subjective states, sleep pressure (using electroencephalography), and motor and cognitive functions at 1.5 and 12.5 hours after awakening under two conditions: the Clock-Time condition (10:30 PM - 6:30 AM sleep aligned with social rhythms) and the Self-Time condition (8 hours of sleep aligned with individual preferences). The results revealed distinct chronotype-specific patterns. ECs exhibited increases in fatigue and sleepiness dependent on awake duration, showing typical sleep pressure accumulation . LCs were more affected by sleep timing and showed atypical patterns of sleep pressure accumulation compared with ECs. Motor ability tended to improve in the afternoon in both chronotypes, irrespective of sleep-wake schedule, whereas cognitive performance peaked at different stages of wakefulness -earlier for ECs and later for LCs- independent of the time of day. These findings suggest that chronotype-aligned sleep-wake schedules could help optimize fatigue management, cognitive performance, and motor control. Diurnal variations in performance cannot be attributed to clock time alone but emerge from the combined effects of chronotype, awake duration, and sleep-wake regulation.

">Asymmetric blood flow within a shared capillary network links the nucleus of the solitary tract and area postrema</a></h4>

              
                The nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) and the area postrema (AP) form a tightly coupled dorsal medullary complex that integrates visceral and humoral signals governing autonomic and cardiometabolic regulation. While their neural interconnections are well characterized, the organization and functional significance of their shared vascular network remain poorly understood. Here, we used in vivo two-photon microscopy in rats, combined with fluorescent vascular labeling and retrograde neuronal tracing, to visualize and quantify blood flow within the AP-NTS microcirculation. We identified direct capillary connections between the two regions, confirming a continuous vascular network previously inferred from ex vivo studies. Analysis of red blood cell trajectories revealed that blood flow across these junctions is predominantly unidirectional, from the NTS toward the AP. Morphometric measurements showed that AP capillaries are nearly twice the diameter of those in the NTS, implying a lower local vascular resistance and providing a structural basis for this directionality. Despite these geometric differences, capillary flow velocities were similar between regions, consistent with active regulation that maintains stable perfusion dynamics. Together, these findings uncover a previously unrecognized, functionally asymmetric vascular pathway within the dorsal medulla. By enabling the directed transfer of diffusible neurohumoral signals from the NTS to the AP, this specialized microvascular network adds a novel layer of communication between two key brainstem autonomic centers and may represent an additional mechanism for the integration of visceral and circulating information.

">Fronto-Parietal Oscillatory Dynamics of Emotion Regulation as a Function of Adult Attachment Orientations</a></h4>

              
                Emotion regulation enables individuals to modulate emotional experiences and behaviors according to situational demands. Within attachment theory, individual differences in attachment anxiety and avoidance are conceived as interpersonal dispositions that influence the quality and efficiency of emotion regulation strategies, potentially shaping the underlying neural dynamics. This study examined cortical oscillatory activity during two regulation strategies-cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression-focusing on theta (4-8 Hz) and beta (15-30 Hz) bands at the source level. Forty adults (21 male, 18 female, 1 gender-unspecified; M = 27.58 years, SD = 8.71) performed an emotion regulation task involving emotionally evocative images from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS) while EEG was recorded. Cortical sources were reconstructed using standardized low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (sLORETA). Linear mixed-effects models (LMMs) assessed the effects of condition, region of interest (ROI), and attachment orientations on oscillatory power. Results showed that higher attachment anxiety predicted reduced theta power in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) during reappraisal, indicating attenuated recruitment of cognitive control mechanisms. In the beta band, suppression reduced activity in the right parietal lobe/precuneus - a region involved in self-referential and attentional processes - across participants, while during reappraisal, attachment anxiety was linked to lower beta power and attachment avoidance to higher beta power in the left dlPFC. Together, these findings indicate that cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression engage distinct cortical oscillatory systems, and that interpersonal dispositions modulate their neural implementation. Frontal theta appears to index top-down control during reappraisal, whereas beta activity shows a dual pattern: frontal beta variations reflect differences in control stability associated with attachment orientations, and parietal beta decreases during suppression suggest attentional disengagement from self-referential processing.

                Neurons have long, thin axons and branched dendritic processes which rely on an extensive microtubule network that functions as a cellular scaffold and substrate for cargo transport. Microtubule defects are a defining pathological feature of neurological disorders. The highly arborized, long, polarized neuronal processes pose challenges for imaging-based assays. Available methods use either dispersed cultures, which are inefficient for compartment-specific analyses, or microfluidic chambers, which allow clear separation of somatodendritic and axonal compartments but are expensive and difficult to maintain. Here, we introduce an i3Neurosphere culture model of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived human cortical i3Neurons that enables high-throughput imaging of hundreds of axons without specialized equipment. We characterize neurite outgrowth, polarization, microtubule dynamics, and motility of diverse cargo, providing a reference for future work on microtubule processes in this system. The high-throughput compartment-specific imaging we present, combined with facile genetic engineering in i3Neurons provides a powerful tool to study human neurons.

">Injury-induced tau pathology promotes aggressive behavior in Drosophila without neurodegeneration.</a></h4>

              
                The microtubule-associated protein tau is implicated in neurodegenerative diseases, but its physiological roles remain poorly understood. Here, we find that pan-neuronal expression of human tau (HsTau) in Drosophila coupled with injury triggers hyper-aggression in male flies, which is absent in flies expressing non-phosphorylatable tau. These behavioral manifestations result from activation of dopaminergic circuits without neurodegeneration. Using in vitro reconstitution assays, we find that phosphorylated HsTau maintains microtubule binding but loses its ability to suppress catastrophes, thereby promoting microtubule dynamicity. In contrast, unphosphorylated HsTau and fly tau (DmTau) stabilize microtubules by reducing catastrophe frequency. Our findings challenge the canonical view of tau as a simple microtubule stabilizer and instead position it as a dynamic regulator of microtubule function and neuronal excitability. These results reveal how acute tau phosphorylation can alter neural circuit function and behavior prior to neurodegeneration, providing new insights into tau's physiological and pathological roles.

">Hypovolemia Evokes Conserved Inverse Neurovascular Coupling in the Supraoptic Nucleus Independent of Heart Failure</a></h4>

              
                Vasopressin (AVP) neurons in the hypothalamic supraoptic nucleus (SON) are activated by systemic challenges that threaten fluid balance. Beyond their classical activity-dependent release of their neuropeptide cargo into the systemic circulation, these neurons also release AVP somatodendritically, enabling local modulation of neuronal excitability and vascular tone. We previously showed that a systemic salt challenge triggers inverse neurovascular coupling (iNVC) in the SON, in which activity-dependent dendritic AVP release induces parenchymal arteriole vasoconstriction and local hypoxia. In rats with heart failure (HF), however, the polarity of this salt-evoked response is reversed: microglia-derived adenosine acting on A2A receptors overrides an enhanced AVP-mediated vasoconstriction, producing net vasodilation. Still, whether AVP activation by non-osmotic stimuli engages similar neurovascular mechanisms is unknown. Here, we examined whether hypovolemia induced by intraperitoneal polyethylene glycol (PEG) evokes comparable vascular responses in control and HF rats. PEG produced a sustained rise in plasma protein concentration and vasoconstriction of SON parenchymal arterioles in both control and sham rats. In HF rats, PEG still induced vasoconstriction at 60 min, but vascular diameters returned to baseline by 90 min despite persistent hypovolemia. These findings indicate that hypovolemia engages a conserved AVP-mediated iNVC program that remains largely intact in HF, and that the previously described polarity reversal during HF is stimulus-specific, emerging during osmotic but not hypovolemic activation of AVP neurons.

                Immune-mediated inflammatory responses exacerbate brain injury and affect the prognosis in acute ischemic stroke (AIS). We characterized longitudinal complement activation after AIS using serial plasma samples from 10 patients and 8 controls. Initial markers of classical (C1q), lectin (mannose-binding lectin [MBL]), and alternative (Factor Bb [CFBb]) pathways, as well as regulatory (Factor H [CFH]) and downstream markers (C3a, C5a and C5b-9) were measured by ELISA at 9 time points. Stroke patients showed broad complement activation with increased C1q, MBL, CFBb, C3a, C5a, and C5b-9, and reduced CFH. C1q, MBL, and CFBb peaked around day 17. MBL was higher in patients with poor outcome, CFBb was higher with good outcome, and C5b-9 in severe strokes. These findings reveal pathway-specific complement dynamics after AIS and support complement as a target for stage-specific therapy.

">Vascular dementia increases levels of methylenetetrahydro-folate reductase and cystathionine β-synthase in female patients and changes gene expression of acetylcholine and glutamate clathrin-sculpted transport vesicles</a></h4>

              
                Deficiencies in one-carbon (1C) metabolism are linked to the onset of vascular dementia (VaD). Our previous work using mouse models has demonstrated that reduced dietary intake of folic acid or genetic deficiencies in 1C metabolism result in worse outcomes using a model of VaD. This study aims to provide a detailed molecular portrait of 1C metabolism within the context of VaD, shedding light on potential molecular mechanisms. In cortical post-mortem tissue from female and male VaD patients and controls we measured the folate receptor (FR) and 1C enzymes including methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), thymidylate synthase (TS), choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), acetylcholinesterase (AChE), cystathionine {beta}-synthase (CBS), with NeuN and DAPI as markers. Additionally, spatial transcriptomics was performed on 4 samples. VaD and gender impacted levels of FR. Both male and female VaD had increased levels of ChAT. Female VaD patients had higher levels of MTHFR and CBS when compared to males. Spatial transcriptomics revealed reduced expression of the glutamate and acetylcholine clathrin-sculpted transport vesicles and increase in glutamatergic neurons. VaD is a complex disease; the results of this study demonstrate that VaD impacts levels of 1C, as well as gene expression. Dietary sup-plementation with 1C may be beneficial for affected patients.

">Sensory Circuit Dynamics in a Mouse Model of Epileptic Encephalopathy</a></h4>

              
                Epileptic encephalopathies (EEs) are severe developmental disorders with abnormal EEG activity that worsens neurodevelopmental deficits, yet underlying sensory and cognitive impairment mechanisms are unclear. We studied cortical circuit dynamics in Ank3-1b mutant mice, an EE model with parvalbumin interneuron dysfunction, using laminar electrophysiology, spike-field coherence (SFC), single-unit analyses, and behavioral assays. Ank3-1b mutant mice showed disrupted excitatory-inhibitory (E/I) balance, with reduced sink/source ratios (p = 0.0279) and elevated net currents (AVREC; p < 0.01), indicating hyperexcitability. In awake states, sensory-evoked intra-columnar connectivity was impaired, with lower Pearson correlations (p < 0.001) and increased low-frequency (3-30 Hz) SFC (p < 0.001), but intact gamma-band coherence, suggesting aberrant synchronization. Inhibitory neuron latencies were delayed in infragranular layers under anesthesia (p < 0.001) and supragranular layers when awake (p = 0.005), implying thalamocortical deficits. Despite preserved sensory adaptation and recognition memory, Ank3-1b mutant mice exhibited heightened anxiety (p < 0.05) and variable circadian rhythms, indicating selective affective and regulatory deficits. These results show that Ank3-1b loss disrupts cortical E/I balance and synchrony, delaying sensory processing, while compensatory mechanisms maintain critical sensory functions. This study links ANK3 mutations to layer-specific circuit dysfunction, offering insights into EE pathophysiology and sensory deficits.

">Predictive Neural Signals during Natural Mandarin Speech Comprehension</a></h4>

              
                Language comprehension requires transforming continuous speech into hierarchical linguistic representations, from phonemes to words to sentences. Prediction has been proposed as a key mechanism supporting this process across languages. Here, we extend this framework to Mandarin Chinese, a tonal language with a distinct phonological structure. Using magnetoencephalography (MEG), we recorded neural responses from native speakers listening to an audiobook, and applied linear regression modeling to examine how linguistic features modulate brain activity. We found that listeners segmented continuous speech into multiple linguistic units, and that surprisal modulated neural responses at several representational levels, though not at the finest phonemic level. Tonal information was not independently predicted, but played a critical role when integrated with its segmental component. Finally, entropy reduction--an information-theoretic measure that quantifies how much a word reduces uncertainty about future words in a sentence--elicited a later and temporally distinct neural response from surprisal, indicating independent contributions of these two information-theoretic measures. Together, our findings suggest that predictive mechanisms in language comprehension are universal in their computational principles, but implemented in ways shaped by language-specific structural features, and that local surprisal resolution precedes the global updating of sentence interpretation.

">Exposure to Maternal Pre- and Postnatal Psychological Distress: Associations with Brain Structure in 5-year-old Children</a></h4>

              
                Background: Maternal mental health is an important contributor to child neurodevelopment. While there are multiple studies on prenatal exposure, early postnatal exposure has received little attention in neuroimaging research. Methods: 5-year-old children (n = 173) were recruited from the FinnBrain Birth Cohort study. Maternal distress was assessed using questionnaires on depressive and anxiety symptoms at 14, 24 and 34 gestational weeks and postnatally at 3, 6 and 24 months. T1-weighted structural images were processed using a voxel-based morphometry pipeline to map associations between maternal distress exposure and regional gray matter (GM) volumes, while accounting for potential confounders. Results: We found widespread associations between maternal distress symptoms and offspring brain morphology. Higher prenatal distress at 14 gestational weeks was positively associated with regional GM volume in the right superior parietal lobe and precuneus. In contrast, postnatal distress at 3 months was negative associated with GM volumes in multiple motor regions, the left anterior insula, right superior frontal areas and supramarginal gyrus. Postnatal distress at 6 months demonstrated a positive relationship with GM volumes in the right calcarine and lingual gyri, while distress at 24 months was negatively associated with GM volumes in the left supramarginal and right superior frontal gyri. Conclusions: This study provides support for hypotheses proposing that fetal and early life exposure to maternal distress can influence the structural development of the brain. Furthermore, it highlights the role of early postnatal period and calls for further research into this so far overlooked period and pathways that explain the associations.

">Sex and experience dependent regulation of synaptic protein turnover</a></h4>

              
                Synaptic transmission can be carefully tuned through plasticity mechanisms that regulate synaptic strength, structure, and number. In vivo measurements demonstrate remarkable spine dynamics, with subsets of synapses persisting for months. This correlates with the extreme longevity of certain memories, which can persist for an organisms lifetime. The molecular basis supporting the long-term stability of specific synapses and the long-term durability of memories remains unknown. At the protein level, most proteins persist for a relatively short amount of time before they are degraded and replaced with new molecules. However, recent work has identified a population of proteins, including those present at the synapse, that are exceptionally long-lived. It has been speculated that long-lived proteins (LLPs) could contribute to long-term synapse stability, function, and memory. Here, we used stable isotope labeling in mammals (SILAM) to first identify LLPs in the post synaptic density (PSD) of the hippocampus and subsequently determine if protein turnover rates varied by sex or following learning. We identified novel synaptic LLPs and found that both sex and experience can regulate synaptic protein turnover rates. We identified sex-dependent changes in protein turnover rates in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) risk genes, including increased stability of Gabrg2, a GABA-A receptor subunit, in male mice. Furthermore, we observed stabilization of a subset of PSD proteins, such as Shank3, following contextual fear conditioning. We propose that sex and experience dependent changes in protein turnover rates could help explain sex-differences in psychiatric risk and aid our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that support learning and memory.

">Distinct Roles of Deep and Superficial Cortical Layers in Tone Prediction, Comparison, and Adaptation in Human Auditory Cortex</a></h4>

              
                Auditory perception relies on prior sensations both to form expectations about upcoming sounds and to adapt to repeated inputs. Yet, how these processes interact with bottom-up frequency-specific stimulus drive, and how they are organised across cortical depth, remains unclear. Using ultra-high-field functional magnetic resonance imaging (7T fMRI), participants listened to stochastic tone sequences whose repetition structure and predictability varied over time. For each voxel independently, we used computational modelling to estimate responses for stimulus drive, repetition suppression, and expectations. We then partitioned the unique and shared variance of these components to estimate their relative importance in modulating BOLD activity across cortical layers in auditory cortex. Expectation-related signals explained most unique variance in deep (infagranular) layers, in line with accounts that place internal model representations and belief updates in deeper cortical populations. Variance jointly explained by stimulus drive and expectation was instead strongest in superficial layers, consistent with these compartments expressing computations that combine bottom-up input with top-down predictions, such as prediction error signalling. Finally, repetition suppression accounted for variance uniformly across depth, suggesting an adaptation-like mechanism that modulates responsiveness without a clear laminar bias. Together, the data suggest that deep layers contain content-specific predictive models, superficial layers register prediction-input alignment, and repetition suppression provides a depth-invariant, local gain control that complements predictive processing.

">The brain architecture of punishment learning</a></h4>

              
                Learning which actions cause harm is essential for survival, yet how the brain transforms this knowledge into adaptive control of behavior remains unclear. We combined whole-brain analysis, multisite chemogenetic silencing, spatial transcriptomics, and longitudinal calcium imaging to map how punishment learning reorganizes brain networks across scales. Learning reshaped mesoscale community organization into a network anchored by the amygdala, subthalamic hypothalamic zone, and ventral midbrain tegmentum. These regions contributed distinct components of adaptive avoidance and engaged diverse transcriptional programs across multiple neuronal subclasses. Within this network, the amygdala acted as a hub, partitioning action and outcome information and remapping neural geometry to segregate punished from safe actions. Together, these results identify a multiscale neural architecture through which aversive experience can be transformed into flexible behavioral control.

                Background Effective learning strategies are essential for inclusive elementary classrooms, particularly in Indonesian language education, where students have diverse learning needs and digital access levels. Although social media has become a common educational tool, its structured use as a pedagogical model for inclusive learning in Indonesian schools is limited. Previous studies have largely focused on general online learning, leaving a gap in understanding how social media can foster inclusion and language skill development. This study addresses that gap by exploring how social media can be systematically integrated into Indonesian language learning and by developing a strategy that promotes inclusivity, collaboration, and student engagement. Methods A qualitative case study approach was employed to capture in-depth insights from classroom practices. Data were collected from 15 elementary school teachers across five Indonesian provinces (West Java, Central Java, East Java, Yogyakarta, and South Kalimantan) using semi-structured interviews and open-ended questionnaires. Data were coded and analyzed thematically using NVivo 14 to identify emerging categories, patterns, and interconnections among teachers’ experiences and perceptions. Results The findings indicate that social media effectively supports both collaborative and independent learning, enhances digital literacy, and increases motivation among students. Teachers reported that platforms such as WhatsApp and YouTube foster communication, creativity, and resource sharing. However, they also highlighted challenges related to unequal internet access, data privacy, and managing online behavior. Three key themes emerged: (1) social media as a catalyst for collaboration, (2) digital literacy development through authentic media interaction, and (3) the need for clear guidelines to maintain safety and equity. Conclusions This study proposes the Social Media Networking (SMN) framework, offering practical steps for teachers to integrate social media into inclusive pedagogy. The SMN framework demonstrates that social media can function as a structured, participatory, and equitable learning strategy that strengthens inclusivity and engagement in Indonesian language classrooms.

                Streptomyces sp. BTA 1-131 was isolated from the marine sponge Melophlus sarasinorum collected in Indonesia. The crude extracts of this strain displayed antibacterial and cytotoxic activity, and therefore, to further investigate the bioactive potential of the strain, whole genome sequencing was performed in this study. The whole genome sequencing of Streptomyces sp. BTA 1-131 was conducted using both Illumina NextSeq and Oxford Nanopore platforms with a de novo hybrid assembly approach. The high-quality genome obtained is 10.23 Mbp with a GC content of 71.57%. It is organised into a single chromosomal contig, two linear plasmids, and one circular plasmid. Interestingly, a long-terminal inverted repeat (L-TIR) sequence of 1.5 Mbp has been confirmed in the strain genome. Phylogenomic analysis suggested that the strain BTA 1-131 likely represents a new species within the genus Streptomyces. To the best of our knowledge, the genome data described here would be the first report on the hybrid genome sequence of Streptomyces associated with the rarely reported sponge Melophlus sarasinorum from Indonesia, with a unique feature of L-TIR. The complete genome data generated here will provide compelling information for further analysis of the biosynthetic potential of the strain BTA 1-131 to produce new bioactive compounds.

                Background Endocrine-disrupting chemical (EDCs) is an artificial or naturally occurring any compound that is capable of interfering with endocrine system and it presents a threat not only to the environment but also to the health of human being. These xenobiotics are becoming more widespread in the environment and can cause a whole spectrum of metabolic and developmental disorders. They can be long-term with many of their effects being dependent on the time and associated exposure time and some of them are irreversible. Methods The review summarizes existing evergreen publications about the classification, origin, and biological effects that EDCs have. It discusses how various organisms are vulnerable to being exposed to EDCs and how the latter interfere with endocrine action. The review also considers different bioassays that are applied in toxicological testing in evaluation of EDC activity. Results All EDCs can be classified into industrial chemicals, pesticides, plasticizers, pharmaceuticals and heavy metals. Lipophilic EDCs have the potential of bioaccumulation that gives rise to long-term biological impacts. Reproductive and developmental abnormalities have been found their way into wildlife studies; infertility, obesity, diabetes, and hormone-related cancers linked in humans being exposed to it. Mechanistically, EDCs act as mimics or antagonists to naturally produced hormones, change the expression of receptor in cells, hormone synthesis and metabolism. Bioassays like the in vitro receptor binding, reporter gene and in vivo animal model are also very useful in assessing EDC toxicity. Conclusions The tendency of even greater persistence of EDC in the environment poses as testimony to the dire necessity of intensified monitoring, regulation, and spread of sensitivity among general public. There is a strong need to research further to learn about the long term effects to health, improve methods of detection, and make certain chemical alternatives that are safe. The issue of EDC exposure is of importance when it comes to protecting the natural balance of the environment and human health.

                Introduction The quality of robusta coffee beans (Coffea canephora var. Robusta) can be modulated by using a specific fermentation method. Fermentation is an important process in coffee bean processing because it greatly determines the final quality of coffee beans, especially their taste. A starter culture is one way to perform a particular process of fermentation. Methods In this study, fermentation was carried out at different temperatures (35°C and 40°C) and times (24 h and 48 h) using kefir as a specific starter culture and the Controlled Semi-Carbonic Maceration Method. Research parameters are: population number of lactic acid bacteria, caffeine content, reducing sugar content, pH, lightness value, the density, and titrated acid value. Results The results of this study indicate that the lactic acid bacteria population showed optimum growth at 24 h of fermentation, which was around 7.67-7.72 log10 cfu/mL. Changes in the chemical and physical characteristics of Robusta coffee beans fermented with a kefir starter were that the caffeine content decreased from 1.41% to 0.46%, the reducing sugar content decreased from 2.42% to 0.29%, the pH decreased from 6.12 to 4.43, the lightness value decreased from 41.68 to 30.54, and the density decreased from 0.50 g/mL to 0.39 g/mL. Still, the total titrated acid value increased from 0.40% to 0.99%. Conclusion This indicates that the addition of kefir as a starter in semi-carbonic coffee fermentation maceration has been successful, as evidenced by the results of data in the form of a decrease in caffeine, reducing sugar, pH, and a decrease in density and lightness. Meanwhile, the total titrated acid increased.

                Abstract* Against the backdrop of the digital economy, government subsidies, as a key macroeconomic regulation tool, interact with enterprises’ digital marketing investment and consumer behavior, yet relevant in-depth research remains scarce. This study aims to explore the complex relationships between national subsidy policies, enterprises’ digital marketing strategies, and consumer purchase intentions, with a focus on the second-hand product market. Based on a review of existing literature, five core hypotheses are proposed: national subsidy policies significantly enhance enterprises’ digital marketing investment; enterprises’ digital marketing strategies under subsidies positively impact consumer purchase intentions; consumers’ awareness of subsidy policies strengthens their purchase intentions; consumers’ trust in digital marketing platforms moderates the impact of digital marketing on purchase intentions; and national subsidy policies reduce consumers’ willingness to purchase second-hand products. This research bridges the existing research gap, constructs a comprehensive theoretical framework for the interaction between government, enterprises, and consumers in the digital age, and provides theoretical basis and practical guidance for policy makers and business decision-makers.

                The application of digital literacy in elementary schools is a curriculum-driven approach to create independent and student-centered learning through the effective and efficient use of digital technology. This study explores teachers’ perceptions of the application of digital literacy in the curriculum to improve the quality of elementary schools. The research uses a quasi-qualitative approach. Data was collected through structured interviews with 48 teachers from 26 elementary schools, while data analysis used thematic analysis. The results of the study summarize the statements of elementary school teachers that revealed three main themes: the urgency, strategy, and positive and negative impacts of implementing digital literacy in the curriculum in elementary schools. The teachers stated that implementing digital literacy is critical because it impacts the efficiency and effectiveness of the use of school resources, improves the quality of schools, and helps develop 21st-century skills. This study concludes that school principals need to manage the curriculum and prepare regulations that regulate the availability of infrastructure for implementing digital literacy in elementary schools. This study also recommends that the Indonesian government make policies on the rules for implementing digital literacy in elementary schools and elementary schools can implement digital literacy in a sustainable manner and be prepared based on the curriculum according to the potential and culture of the school.

                Background Periodontal disease is a significant complication in patients with type-2 diabetes mellitus, further complicated by impaired immune response and increased susceptibility to infections. Effective management is essential as it influences both oral health and glycemic control. Traditional therapies frequently prove inadequate, necessitating the exploration of adjunctive treatments. Chitosan, known for its antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and regenerative properties, offers potential benefits due to its non-toxicity, biodegradability, and biocompatibility. This study aims to systematically compare and evaluate the clinical outcomes and antimicrobial efficacy of 2mg resorbable Chitosan membranes versus 2mg resorbable tetracycline fibers (suspended in 25mg collagen) when used as adjuncts to scaling and root planing in patients with type-2 diabetes mellitus undergoing periodontal maintenance. Materials and methodology In parallel study design, 26 patients with type II diabetes mellitus, undergoing maintenance therapy and diagnosed with periodontitis, were treated with scaling and root planing. Test group was given chitosan membranes, while control group received tetracycline fibers as local drug delivery agents in residual pockets with depth of 5mm or more. Clinical evaluations, including Plaque Index, Modified Sulcus Bleeding Index, probing pocket depth, attachment loss, and microbiological analysis, were conducted at baseline and again at 3 months. This trial was prospectively registered with Clinical Trials Registry – India (Trial REF/2022/04/053476; Registration number: CTRI/2023/10/058766). Results Both groups showed significant improvements in plaque index (PI), sulcus bleeding index (SBI), probing pocket depth (PD), and clinical attachment level (CAL) from baseline to three months, with no significant intergroup differences. The presence of Streptococcus mitis/oralis did not differ significantly between groups at any point. Actinomyces israelii and Fusobacterium nucleatum showed significant differences at baseline but not at three months. Conclusion Within the limits of the study, chitosan membrane showed similar results to tetracycline fibers at 3 months, making it a promising alternate modality in maintenance patients with chronic periodontitis.

                Background Carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB) is an important nosocomial pathogen with high biofilm-forming ability and multidrug resistance. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of the pgaABCD locus in clinical CRAB isolates and its relationship with biofilm production and antimicrobial resistance. Methods A total of 150 non-duplicate clinical A. baumannii isolates were collected from healthcare facilities in Shahrekord, Iran. Identification was performed by PCR and biochemical tests. Antimicrobial susceptibility was determined using disk diffusion, and biofilm formation was assessed by the crystal violet method. PCR was used to detect pgaABCD genes. Hemolytic and proteolytic activities were evaluated on blood and skim milk agar. Statistical analyses included chi-square tests and heatmap clustering of resistance profiles. Results Results showed that all isolates were multidrug-resistant, showing the highest resistance to ciprofloxacin (100%), ceftazidime (90%), and cefepime (86.66%). Of these, 90 (60%) were CRAB, all forming biofilms, with 55.5% producing strong biofilms. Hemolytic activity occurred in 14% of isolates and was significantly associated with strong biofilm formation (p < 0.0001). Proteolytic activity was observed in all isolates without significant association. The pgaA and pgaD genes were detected in 100% of isolates, while pgaB and pgaC were found in 84.4% and 93.3%, respectively. Strong biofilm formation correlated significantly with pgaB (p < 0.0001) and pgaC (p = 0.0002). Heatmap analysis showed higher antibiotic resistance in strong biofilm producers. Conclusion Strong biofilm formation in CRAB is associated with pgaB/pgaC genes and hemolysin production, highlighting the importance of anti-biofilm strategies and molecular monitoring in clinical settings.

                <p>by Fatemeh Keikha, Chuanyuan Wang, Zhixia Yang, Zhi-Ping Liu</p>

The identification of state specific biomarkers that reflect dynamic changes in gene regulatory networks is critical for understanding cancer progression and enhancing diagnostic precision. While multilayer network models have been proposed for analyzing disease evolution, most existing methods rely solely on topological features, neglecting structural rewiring and expression variability across disease states. In this study, we introduce TransMarker, a framework designed to detect genes with regulatory role transitions, those with meaningful shifts in regulatory roles during disease progression, as dynamic biomarkers via cross-state alignment of multi-state single-cell data. TransMarker encodes each disease state as a distinct layer in a multilayer graph, integrating prior interaction data with state-specific expression to construct attributed gene networks. Contextualized embeddings for each stage are generated for each state using Graph Attention Networks (GATs), and structural shifts are quantified via Gromov-Wasserstein optimal transport. Genes with significant changes are ranked using a Dynamic Network Index (DNI), which captures their regulatory variability. These prioritized biomarkers are then applied in a deep neural network for disease state classification. We validate our approach on synthetic simulated and real world dataset of gastric adenocarcinoma (GAC), to evaluate performance across diverse scenarios and assess generalizability. TransMarker outperforms existing multilayer network ranking techniques in classification accuracy, robustness, and biomarker relevance. Ablation studies confirm the contribution of each step to overall performance. Our findings suggest that combining regulatory rewiring, temporal expression dynamics, and cross-state alignment provides a powerful strategy for identifying biologically meaningful biomarkers and modeling disease progression at single cell resolution.

                <p>by Raiki Yoshimura, Naotoshi Nakamura, Takeru Matsuura, Takeo Toshima, Takasuke Fukuhara, Kazuyuki Aihara, Katsuhito Fujiu, Shingo Iwami, Tomoharu Yoshizumi</p>

Liver transplantation is almost the only way to save patients with end-stage liver disease. Particularly, living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) has gained importance in recent years thanks to the shorter waiting times and better graft quality than with deceased donor liver transplantation (DDLT). However, some patients experience graft loss due to unexpected infections, sepsis, or immune-mediated rejection of the transplanted organ. An urgent need exists to clarify which patients experience graft loss. Several models have been proposed, but most analyze the classic DDLT, and knowledge about LDLT is lacking. In this study, we retrospectively analyzed clinical data from 748 patients who underwent LDLT. By adapting machine learning methods, we predicted early graft loss (within 180 days postoperatively) with better performance than conventional models. The model enabled us to stratify a highly heterogeneous sample of patients into five groups. By focusing on survival time, we next categorized the patients into three groups with early, intermediate, and late or no graft loss. Notably, we identified the intermediate-loss group as a distinct population similar to the early-loss population but with different survival times. Additionally, by proposing a hierarchical prediction method, we developed an approach to distinguish these populations using data up to 30 days postoperatively. Our findings will enable the early identification of individuals at risk of graft loss, particularly those in the early- and intermediate-loss groups. This will allow for appropriate patient care, such as switching to DDLT, identifying other living donors for LDLT, or preparing for re-transplantation, leading to a bottom-up improvement in transplant success rates.

                <p>by Roberta Moreira Wichmann, Murilo Afonso Robiati Bigoto, Alexandre Dias Porto Chiavegatto Filho</p>

We evaluated Federated Learning (FL) strategies for predicting COVID-19 mortality using a multicenter sample of 17,022 patients from 21 diverse Brazilian hospitals. We tested horizontal FL architectures employing Logistic Regression (LR) and a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) via parameter aggregation, alongside a novel Federated Random Forest (RF) using ensemble aggregation. Performance gain (<i>Δ</i>AUC, calculated as AUC federated minus AUC local) was quantified using bootstrap analysis to determine 95% confidence intervals. FL models demonstrated a beneficial collaborative effect. The average <i>Δ</i>AUC across the network was +0.0018 for LR, +0.0599 for MLP, and +0.0528 for RF. Crucially, the gain’s magnitude and statistical significance showed a strong inverse correlation with local patient volume (N). Substantial and statistically significant gains concentrated in data-limited institutions (N < 500). For example, the smallest hospital (N=86) achieved a remarkable <i>Δ</i>AUC of 0.3682 (95% CI [0.0908, 0.6307]) with the RF model. However, interpreting these benefits requires caution because the 95% CIs for <i>Δ</i>AUC crossed zero for the majority of hospitals, suggesting the collaborative model’s statistical advantage is not universally certain at every site. This trade-off was particularly evident with the MLP model which, despite achieving the highest average <i>Δ</i>AUC, was the most volatile algorithm, registering the maximum performance degradation in the network (<i>Δ</i>AUC = –0.0884, 95% CI [–0.1527, –0.0273]) due to its high sensitivity to local data distribution disparities (non-IID). This study validates FL as an equity-enabling mechanism that effectively enhances predictive capacity where local data scarcity is highest. Our findings underscore that maximizing the most statistically certain benefits of FL requires continuous monitoring and local validation for successful clinical deployment across diverse settings.

                <p>by Daniel Suárez-Barrera, Lucas Bayones, Norberto Encinas-Rodríguez, Sergio Parra, Viktor Monroy, Sebastián Pujalte, Bernardo Andrade-Ortega, Héctor Díaz, Manuel Alvarez, Antonio Zainos, Alessio Franci, Román Rossi-Pool</p>

Spike sorting is one of the cornerstones of extracellular electrophysiology. By leveraging advanced signal processing and data analysis techniques, spike sorting makes it possible to detect, isolate, and map single neuron spiking activity from both in vivo and in vitro extracellular electrophysiological recordings. A crucial step of any spike sorting pipeline is to reduce the dimensionality of the recorded spike waveform data. Reducing the dimensionality of the processed data is a near-universal practice, fundamentally motivated by the use of clustering algorithms responsible to detect, isolate, and sort the recorded putative neurons. In this paper, we propose and illustrate on both synthetic and experimental data that employing the nonlinear dimensionality reduction technique Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) can drastically improve the performance, efficiency, robustness, and scalability of spike sorting pipelines without increasing their computational cost. We show how replacing the linear or ad hoc, expert-defined, supervised nonlinear dimensionality reduction methods commonly used in spike sorting pipelines by the unsupervised, mathematically grounded, nonlinear dimensionality reduction method provided by UMAP drastically increases the number of correctly sorted neurons, makes the identification of quieter, seldom spiking neurons more reliable, enables deeper and more precise explorations and analysis of the neural code, and paves new ways toward more efficient and end-to-end automatable spike sorting pipelines of large-scale extracellular neural recording as those produced by high-density multielectrode arrays.

Amyloid precursor protein (APP)-null mice exhibit significant deficits in motor performance, including reduced grip strength and impaired locomotion; however, the underlying neurophysiological mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we show that conditional knockdown of APP selectively in Purkinje cells (PCs) recapitulates these motor deficits, while exogenous expression of APP in APP-null mice rescues motor function. Electrophysiological analysis revealed that APP deficiency leads to aberrant firing patterns in PCs and reduces inhibitory synaptic transmission onto neurons of the deep cerebellar nucleus (DCN). We identified a marked reduction in Nav1.6-mediated sodium currents as the key mechanism underlying abnormal action potential firing and propagation in APP-deficient PCs. Importantly, all electrophysiological and behavioral deficits were rescued by PC-specific APP reconstitution. These findings reveal a novel and essential role for APP in cerebellar motor control by regulating Nav1.6 channel activity and PC excitability.

                <p>by Romuald Haase, Bingjian Ren, Albert Tell i Puig, Alessandro Bonavoglia, Jean-Baptiste Marq, Rémy Visentin, Nicolas Dos Santos Pacheco, Bohumil Maco, Ricardo Mondragón-Flores, Oscar Vadas, Dominique Soldati-Favre</p>

The conoid is a dynamic, tubulin-based structure conserved across the Apicomplexa that undergoes extrusion during egress, gliding motility, and invasion in <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i>. This organelle traverses the apical polar ring (APR) in response to calcium waves and plays a critical role in controlling parasite motility. While the actomyosin-dependent extrusion of the conoid is beginning to be elucidated, the mechanism by which it remains apically anchored to the APR is still unclear. RNG2, a protein localized to both the conoid and the APR, has emerged as a strong candidate for mediating this connection. Biochemical analysis revealed that RNG2 is an unstable protein, undergoing extensive proteolytic cleavage both in the parasite and in heterologous expression systems. Its biochemical properties, with the presence of large coiled-coil domains, likely facilitate the formation of concatenated assemblies, enabling RNG2 to serve as a dynamic and resilient bridge between the conoid and the APR. Using a combination of iterative ultrastructure expansion microscopy and immunoelectron microscopy, we confirmed the localization of RNG2 to the 22 tethering elements bridging the APR and the conoid. Conditional depletion of RNG2 led to the striking detachment of the intact conoid organelle from the APR, supporting an essential role for RNG2 as a tether. Cryo-electron tomography of conoid-less parasites revealed that, in the absence of RNG2, the apical vesicle remains anchored to the plasma membrane, while the rhoptries follow the detached conoid. Although RNG2 depletion only mildly reduces microneme secretion, the parasites are immotile and exhibit impaired rhoptry discharge, highlighting the critical role of proper conoid anchorage in motility and host cell invasion. Comprehensive mutagenesis of RNG2 identified distinct regions responsible for binding to the conoid and the APR, and demonstrated that the full-length, intact protein is essential for bridging these two structures and for its functional activity. Altogether, RNG2 emerges as a pivotal protein that ensures conoid functionality and coordination in Coccidia.

                <p>by Fengyi Mao, Sai Wu, Derek B. Allison, Daheng He, Yifan Kong, Chaohao Li, Zhiguo Li, Yanquan Zhang, Xinyi Wang, Qiongsi Zhang, Chi Wang, Xiaoqi Liu</p>

Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1), a critical cell cycle regulator, is associated with cancer progression and negatively correlates with patient survival in cutaneous melanoma based on clinical database analysis. In a melanoma mouse model induced by <i>BRaf</i><sup>CA</sup> mutation and <i>Pten</i>-deficiency, we observed that PLK1 overexpression mediated metabolic reprogramming to markedly accelerate tumor growth, promote metastasis, and shortened mice survival. Mechanistically, PLK1 stabilizes BTB domain and CNC homolog 1 (BACH1), which serves as a crucial transcription factor for genes involved in cancer metabolism and metastasis. Moreover, the PLK1/BACH1 axis confers resistance to Vemurafenib, a BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> inhibitor, in melanoma. In light of this finding, we attempted an innovative pharmacological combination targeting both BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> and PLK1, identifying a synergistic efficiency to this approach to suppress tumor growth. Overall, we have discovered a novel function of PLK1 that is independent of the cell cycle, which could pave new ways for melanoma therapies.

                <p>by Lin Xie, Lijuan Gao, Weihong Fu, Gangyun Wu, Hua Li, Wenxiu Ning</p>

Decoding the complexities of signaling pathways is fundamental for deciphering the mechanisms underlying tissue development, homeostasis, and disease pathogenesis. Proximity labeling tools have been instrumental in identifying upstream or downstream effectors of specific proteins within signaling pathways. However, currently, there are no tools available to directly label and capture intermediary proteins that bridge two non-interacting proteins. Here, we developed Split-TurboID and PUP-IT based Protein Identification Tool (STUPPIT), a novel method combining split-TurboID and PUP-IT to biotinylate intermediary proteins of two non-interacting proteins through a two-step enzymatic reaction. STUPPIT was validated using three well-characterized protein triads, including YAP1/AMOT/β-actin, YAP1/LATS1/MOB1A, and β-catenin/α-catenin/β-actin using HEK293T human cell lines. Combining STUPPIT and proteomics, we identified novel intermediary proteins including ERC1 and USP7, which interacted both with β-catenin and SMAD4, key components of the Wnt and BMP signaling pathways. In conclusion, STUPPIT represents a powerful tool for labeling and capturing intermediary proteins between non-interacting partners, offering new insights into protein-protein interactions and advancing signal transduction research.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Limited evidence has led to ongoing debate about the benefits of thymectomy for late-onset myasthenia gravis (LOMG). This study aims to compare the outcomes of patients with LOMG who underwent thymectomy versus those who received medical treatment alone, and evaluate the incidence of surgical adverse events.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Non-thymomatous acetylcholine-receptor antibody positive patients with LOMG were selected from a multi-center longitudinal clinical database. Rates of and time to response (remission and minimal manifestations status) were compared between 2 groups by propensity score matching (PSM), Kaplan–Meier analysis, and Cox regression models. Additionally, the incidence of adverse events about thymectomy was compared between LOMG and younger patients with myasthenia gravis (MG) aged 40 to 50 years old.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 55 and 210 patients with LOMG were enrolled in the thymectomy and medical treatment groups, respectively. The thymectomy group exhibited significantly younger onset age (56.31 ± 6.15 vs. 62.04 ± 7.83, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). After PSM adjustment, thymectomy demonstrated a greater cumulative probability (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), and the 2.356-fold (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.537–3.612, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) higher chance of better outcomes compared to medical treatment. In subgroup analysis, thymectomy showed significantly higher response rates compared to medical treatment alone at 24 ± 2 months (48.9%, 95% CI = 33.7–64.1% vs 23.8%, 95% CI = 14.2–33.3%, <i>p</i> = 0.004), and 36 ± 2 months (59.5%, 95% CI = 42.9–76.1% vs 28.9%, 95% CI = 18.5–39.4%, <i>p</i> = 0.002). The incidences of adverse events were comparable between patients with LOMG and younger patients with MG (32.0% vs 22.4%, <i>p</i> = 0.286).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Thymectomy may be an effective therapeutic option for LOMG. Our findings highlight the need for further development of a randomized trial targeting patients with LOMG. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>We aimed to investigate timing of occurrence of peri-ictal MRI abnormalities – a potential risk biomarker of status epilepticus-related cerebral injury (t2).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This prospective study enrolled adult patients with status epilepticus and acute magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); patients with peri-ictal MRI abnormalities underwent follow-up MRI 4 weeks later. Predictive model, using logistic regression, integrated clinical factors (duration, semiology, and etiology of status epilepticus and the patients’ level of consciousness) to prognosticate occurrence of peri-ictal MRI abnormalities. Cerebral injury due to status epilepticus was assessed by comparative volumetric analysis of acute and follow-up MRIs.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Among 256 patients, 137 (53%) had peri-ictal MRI abnormalities. The likelihood of their occurrence increased over time under the influence of semiology and etiology of status epilepticus as well as the patients’ level of consciousness: it was highest in non-convulsive status epilepticus caused by acute primary or secondary etiologies at 10 minutes after onset in patients with stupor/coma (81–85%); it increased at 24 hours to 92%; and at 48 hours to 95%. Conversely, in alert/somnolent patients with prominent motor symptoms and acute triggering factors associated with epilepsy, the possibility of developing peri-ictal MRI abnormalities at 24 hours was 4 to 5% and at 48 hours it was 6 to 11%. In 28 of 45 (62%) of follow-up MRIs, structural long-term consequences of status epilepticus were observed in the form of either cortical and hippocampal atrophy or global cerebral volume loss.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>In this novel multimodal approach based on MRI data, the patients’ level of consciousness, etiology, and duration of status epilepticus offers insights into the risk of possible brain injury in status epilepticus. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To evaluate the real-world safety and efficacy for standard surgical risk patients with extracranial internal carotid artery disease undergoing transcarotid artery revascularization.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>ROADSTER 3 is a prospective, multicenter, single-arm post-approval study. Patients &lt;80 years old without anatomic or physiologic high-risk factors were included. Thirty-day incidence of major adverse events (stroke, death, or myocardial infarction) and cranial nerve injury were assessed. An independent clinical events committee adjudicated events, and independent certified health care personnel performed neurological assessments.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Between 2022 and 2024, 344 patients (intent to treat population) were enrolled at 48 sites in the United States. Because of 24 major protocol deviations, 320 patients remained in the Food and Drug Administration's analysis population (per protocol). In the per protocol population, there were 136 (42.5%) females and 49 (15.3%) symptomatic patients. Among symptomatic patients, 12 (24.5%) were treated within 2 weeks of the prior event. Technical success was 100%. For the entire study population, there were strokes in 3 patients with no instances of death or myocardial infarction. The 2 instances of cranial nerve injury (0.6%; 95% CI, 0.1–2.2% in the per protocol population) both resolved within 6 months. The composite 30-day stroke/death/myocardial infarction rate was 0.6% (95% CI, 0.1–2.2%) for the per protocol population and 0.9% (95% CI, 0.2–2.5%) for the intent to treat population.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The 30-day results of the ROADSTER 3 study confirm that transcarotid artery revascularization is safe and effective in the standard-risk population. Longer-term follow-up is pending to confirm durable stroke prevention for these patients. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                The visual system can function across variable scene statistics and behavioral contexts. This flexibility arises in part from neural feedback, which shapes visual processing to align with prevailing stimulus conditions and behavioral goals. In the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, extensive genetic and connectome resources allow feedback connections of identified cells to be linked to their functions in the visual system. Here, we review key mechanisms and functions of feedback in the Drosophila visual system, drawing parallels to vertebrate models, where feedback also plays an important role in visual processing. We conclude by arguing that connectomes are critical in this task and that cracking feedback circuits in flies can help guide our understanding of feedback in larger brains.

                Eddings et al. illustrate that synaptic membrane trafficking can be studied with millisecond resolution in resected human brain tissues using the technique “zap-and-freeze” time-resolved electron microscopy. Using this method, they find that synaptic vesicles are recycled via ultrafast endocytosis in human neocortical slices.

                Brodin and Shupliakov demonstrate that synaptic activity triggers the formation of an actin cage that encapsulates the synaptic vesicle cluster. Disruption of this cage leads to the detachment of the cluster from the release site. These findings explain how the synaptic vesicle liquid phase can remain in place during activity.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/107132">RBMX2 links Mycobacterium bovis infection to epithelial–mesenchymal transition and lung cancer progression</a></h4>

              
                Tuberculosis (TB) is a complex disease caused by the interaction of pathogen, host, and environmental factors. In 2022, TB affected 10.6 million people and caused 1.3 million deaths globally. In high-burden zoonotic TB regions, <i>Mycobacterium bovis</i> accounts for ~10% of human TB cases. The immune evasion and latency of <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> hinder understanding of host responses. Here, we identify RNA-binding motif protein X-linked 2 (RBMX2) as a novel host factor facilitating <i>M. bovis</i> infection. RBMX2 expression is significantly upregulated in multiple cell types, including EBL, BoMac, bovine alveolar primary cells, and human A549 cells. Multi-omics analyses, cell adhesion assays, and ChIP-PCR demonstrate that RBMX2 suppresses cell adhesion and tight junctions while enhancing <i>M. bovis</i> adhesion and invasion via p65 signaling. Integrated transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic data reveal that RBMX2 regulates epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process linked to cancer progression. TIMER2.0 analysis shows elevated RBMX2 expression in lung adenocarcinoma and lung squamous cell carcinoma tissues, validated by immunofluorescence. Using an <i>M. bovis</i>-induced BoMac-EBL EMT model and H1299 cells, we show that RBMX2 promotes EMT through p65/MMP-9 pathway activation. Collectively, RBMX2 is a novel host factor that enhances <i>M. bovis</i> infection and drives infection-induced EMT. These findings provide new insight into TB pathogenesis and highlight RBMX2 as a potential target for TB vaccine and therapeutic development.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95607">Generation of biophysical neuron model parameters from recorded electrophysiological responses</a></h4>

              
                Recent advances in connectomics, biophysics, and neuronal electrophysiology warrant modeling of neurons with further details in both network interaction and cellular dynamics. Such models may be referred to as ElectroPhysiome, as they incorporate the connectome and individual neuron electrophysiology to simulate neuronal activities. The nervous system of <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> is considered a viable framework for such ElectroPhysiome studies due to advances in connectomics of its somatic nervous system and electrophysiological recordings of neuron responses. In order to achieve a simulated ElectroPhysiome, the set of parameters involved in modeling individual neurons needs to be estimated from electrophysiological recordings. Here, we address this challenge by developing a deep generative estimation method called ElectroPhysiomeGAN (EP-GAN), which, once trained, can instantly generate parameters associated with the Hodgkin–Huxley neuron model (HH-model) for multiple neurons with graded potential response. The method combines generative adversarial network (GAN) architecture with recurrent neural network encoder and can generate an extensive number of parameters (&gt;170) given the neuron’s membrane potential responses and steady-state current profiles. We validate our method by estimating HH-model parameters for 200 simulated neurons with graded membrane potential followed by nine experimentally recorded neurons (where six of them are newly recorded) in the nervous system of <i>C. elegans</i>. Comparison of EP-GAN with existing estimation methods shows EP-GAN's advantage in the accuracy of estimated parameters and inference speed for both small and large numbers of parameters being inferred. In addition, the architecture of EP-GAN permits input with arbitrary clamping protocols, allowing inference of parameters even when partial membrane potential and steady-state currents profiles are given as inputs. EP-GAN is designed to leverage the generative capability of GAN to align with the dynamical structure of the HH-model and thus is able to achieve such performance.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Visual perceptual decoding of facial expressions is a key focus in affective neuroscience. Developing a mapping model between visual content and signals is crucial for decoding. Most previous visual decoding models focused on brain responses to static images, neglecting temporal-dynamic feature modeling. Additionally, they input all visual cortices as a whole into the model, overlooking that visual information flows bidirectionally between the lower and higher visual cortices based on bottom-up and top-down visual mechanisms, thus hard to capture bidirectional information between visual regions located in different spatial positions. Here, we present a spatio-temporal bidirectional long short-term memory-based model to decode 3 categories of facial expressions from multi-time functional magnetic resonance imaging data. Specifically, we used the spatio-temporal bidirectional long short-term memory module with the ability to simulate time series to grasp the temporal-dependence from visual cortices, and its forward and backward directions simulate bidirectional information flow between visual cortices to capture the bidirectional spatial information. Experimental outcomes indicate that the mean decoding accuracy employing beta estimates of multi-time response signals (Repetition Times（TR）1-6 1 to 6) from 5 participants is significantly higher than that of other time points signals, unidirectional connections, and publicly available models. These results reveal that our model captures temporal-dependencies and bidirectional spatial information from the visual cortices, enhancing decoding performance.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The inhibitory effect of interhemispheric signal propagation (ISP) is believed to be aligned with GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor mediated inhibitory neurotransmission and related to interhemispheric connectivity. Repetitive Transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a safe and potent strategy for altering brain connectivity. However, it remains unclear if rTMS modulates ISP. With pretreatment of baclofen, a GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor agonist, this study characterized rTMS effects on ISP and the influence of GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor neurotransmission. ISP was measured with TMS and electroencephalography co-registration (TMS-EEG). Excitatory rTMS (&gt; 5 Hz) was found to increase interhemispheric inhibition indexed by ISP. This effect was reduced by baclofen pretreatment, potentially reflecting competition for GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors neurotransmission between baclofen and rTMS. Beyond evoked potentials, our data also identified TMS-evoked gamma oscillation as a reliable indicator of intracortical inhibition. These novel findings help to clarify the effects of rTMS on interhemispheric connectivity, which may help to optimize rTMS treatments for various psychiatric disorders.</span>

Mounting evidence suggests that subtle variations in respiratory patterns—including their neural underpinnings—may serve as sensitive indicators of affective processes, yet the specific phases of spontaneous breathing have rarely been studied in detail. Here, we present a cross-sectional, exploratory investigation combining high-temporal-resolution respiratory measures, resting-state magnetoencephalography data, and psychological assessments in 46 healthy adults. Our analysis distinguishes three distinct phases—inspiration, expiration, and the brief but functionally significant post-expiratory pause (PEP). By correlating time-averaged Salience Network connectivity with aggregate respiratory metrics, we identify trait-level associations specific to the PEP in beta and gamma frequencies. Individuals with longer and more variable PEPs show distinct connectivity patterns associated with heightened depression and reduced life satisfaction. Connectivity patterns involving the right insula, bilateral anterior cingulate cortex, and left amygdala show robust correlations with these affective parameters, suggesting that this brief respiratory interval may serve as a window into interoceptive and emotional processing. Our findings highlight the overlooked role of the PEP in capturing meaningful interactions between respiration, neural circuits, and psychological well-being.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The capacity to pursue goals, across a series of intermediate stages, is a distinctive achievement of human cognition. Scientific investigations of goal-directed action have emphasized either of two different aspects of this capacity. Research on executive function has described coordination of extended action sequences that solve multi-part problems. Meanwhile, research on voluntary action has emphasized the processes of endogenous generation and autonomy, which are essential for many complex problems, particularly those involving creativity and insight. Because many complex problems can be solved in several ways, choosing and generating a path through the problem space requires a convergence of executive intelligence and volitional control. Here we use fMRI to explore the links between volition and problem-solving in the human brain. Participants performed the Tower of London task (a classical neuropsychological problem-solving challenge) either by generating their own solutions or by following stepwise instructions for each move. We showed behavioral signatures of action planning, associated with a distributed network of frontal and parietal activations, when participants generated their own solutions. We also showed the crucial role of medial frontal cortex, traditionally associated with endogenous generation of very simple willed actions, in goal-directed problem-solving, based on its connectivity with a wider prefrontal network.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Insomnia disorder is the most common sleep disorder affecting millions of people. Brain research has linked insomnia to dysfunction in large-scale brain networks, not only during sleep but also in wakeful rest. Yet, the underlying brain dynamics remain little understood. In the present study, we directly addressed this using a data-driven framework for evaluating time-varying large-scale brain activity. We used functional magnetic imaging to compare participants with insomnia disorder to matched controls with no sleep complaints. Using Hidden Markov modeling (HMM) for a completely data-driven characterization of the brain dynamics of whole-brain activity, we found that insomnia disorder is characterized by significantly reduced switching rates between large-scale brain states. In particular, HMM was used to compare insomnia patients to controls, which showed that their brains spent significantly less time in two whole-brain states—the default mode network and a fronto-parietal network—complemented by increased time spent in a global activation state. Overall, the findings reveal the brain dynamics of insomnia to show that insomnia disorder is characterized by less flexible transitions between brain states at wakeful rest. This highlights the importance of evaluating the spatiotemporal dynamics of brain activity to advance the understanding of the neural underpinnings of insomnia disorder.</span>

A comprehensive search was performed using electronic databases, including Scopus and PubMed, to identify relevant studies published between 2014 and 2024. Eligible studies included full-text, peer-reviewed articles that used quantitative or qualitative designs and addressed postpartum complications in accordance with the PEO framework. Descriptive analysis was used to synthesize findings. Results A total of 907 records were identified, and 13 studies met the inclusion criteria. The findings highlight a range of factors significantly associated with postpartum complications, including postpartum hemorrhage, maternal age >35 years, depressive and anxiety disorders, preeclampsia, multiple pregnancies, type of vaginal delivery, infant-related health concerns, childhood trauma, low social support, low educational attainment of both mothers and husbands, perceived social isolation, and marital dissatisfaction. While early detection and intervention were not directly evaluated in these studies, the identification of these risk factors suggests that targeted screening and supportive strategies may be beneficial in mitigating postpartum complications. Conclusions This review identifies multiple psychosocial, demographic, and clinical factors associated with postpartum complications. These findings underscore the importance of early detection and comprehensive postpartum care to mitigate risks and improve maternal health outcomes.
