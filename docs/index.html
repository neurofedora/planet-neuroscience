     alt="Loss of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-receptor 1 and TNF-receptor 2 partially replicate effects of TNF deficiency on dendritic spines of granule cells in mouse dentate gyrus"/>
<p>Hippocampal granule cells of adult mice lacking canonical TNF-Rs were filled with Alexa568 and immunolabeled for Synaptopodin. Morphometric analysis of their spines revealed that TNF-R mutants partially replicate changes previously reported for TNF-deficient mice. Since TNF tunes network excitability via TNF-Rs, TNF deficiency and altered TNF-R-signaling may cause morphological spine changes.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is involved in the regulation of physiological and pathophysiological processes in the central nervous system. In previous work, we showed that mice lacking constitutive levels of TNF exhibit a reduction in spine density and changes in spine head size distribution of dentate granule cells. Here, we investigated which TNF-receptor pathway is responsible for this phenotype and analyzed granule cell spine morphology in TNF-R1-, TNF-R2-, and TNF-R1/R2-deficient mice. Single granule cells were filled with Alexa568 in fixed hippocampal brain slices and immunostained for the actin-modulating protein synaptopodin (SP), a marker for strong and stable spines. An investigator blind to genotype investigated dendritic spines using deconvolved confocal image stacks. Similar to TNF-deficient mice, TNF-R1 and TNF-R2 mutants showed a decrease in the size of small spines (SP−negative) with TNF-R1/R2-KO mice exhibiting an additive effect. TNF-R1 mutants also showed an increase in the size of large spines (SP−positive), mirroring the situation in TNF-deficient mice. Unlike the TNF-deficient mouse, none of the TNF-R mutants exhibited a reduction in their granule cell spine densities. Since TNF tunes the excitability of networks, lack of constitutive TNF reduces network excitation. This may explain why we observed alterations in spine head size distributions in TNF- and TNF-R-deficient granule cells. The changes in spine density observed in the TNF-deficient mouse could not be linked to canonical TNF-R-signaling. Instead, noncanonical pathways or unknown developmental functions of TNF may cause this phenomenon.</p>

	<p>Although the introduction of HAART has completely changed the natural course of HIV infection, the number of chronic forms of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND) has risen. It is estimated that up to half of subjects undergoing HAART therapy exhibit mild cognitive impairments. In the current study, we apply the gene co-expression network modular analysis, a well-established system biology approach, to the gene expression profiles of cases from the National NeuroAIDS Tissue Consortium (NNTC). We observed a negative enrichment for genes associated with the control of immune responses and putatively regulated by the transcription factors IRF8 and SPI1 and by both type I and II interferons. Our study provides evidence of altered immune responses, which are likely associated with the occurrence of HAND in the absence of HIV encephalitis (HIVE).</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Family size desires and intentions in the lowest fertility region in Vietnam [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Vietnam's total fertility rate has been relatively stable around the replacement level since 2005. Meanwhile, fertility in the Southeast of Vietnam has always been far below the replacement level. As reproductive desires and intentions are important determinants of fertility, the article estimates family size desires and intentions in the Southeast and analyse related sociodemographic factors, contributing insights to the low fertility in this region. Methods: Based on data from a survey of people aged 18-45 in the Southeast in 2020, bivariate analysis and multinomial logistic regressions were applied to examine family size desires and intentions in this region.  Results: Most respondents want two (57.3%) or more (33.1%) children, and only 8.4% of them want to have fewer than two children. There are wide gaps within reproductive desires and intentions and the actual fertility. The mean intended family size is nearly 2.1, lower than the mean desired family size but much higher than the total fertility rate in 2020. Young people and unmarried females are more likely to have desires and intentions of fewer than two children. The most frequent reason for no intention of attaining desired family sizes is the fear of not having enough financial resources to raise their children as their expectations. Discussion and Conclusion: The low fertility in the Southeast of Vietnam is not due to a substantial decline in the value of children, but mainly because socioeconomic conditions are not favourable for having two or more children. In the current context in the Southeast, when most people of reproductive age still want and intend to have at least two children, support policies to reduce difficulties and obstacles to having would be much more effective in increasing the fertility rate than later when the desire of fewer than two children become more popular.

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Decreased Dorsomedial Striatum Direct Pathway Neuronal Activity Is Required for Learned Motor Coordination</a></h4>

              
                <p>It has been suggested that the dorsomedial striatum (DMS) is engaged in the early stages of motor learning for goal-directed actions, whereas at later stages, control is transferred to the dorsolateral striatum (DLS), a process that enables learned motor actions to become a skill or habit. It is not known whether these striatal regions are simultaneously active while the expertise is acquired. To address this question, we developed a mouse "Treadmill Training Task" that tracks changes in mouse locomotor coordination during running practice and simultaneously provides a means to measure local neuronal activity using photometry. To measure change in motor coordination over treadmill practice sessions, we used DeepLabCut (DLC) and custom-built code to analyze body position and paw movements. By evaluating improvements in motor coordination during training with simultaneous neuronal calcium activity in the striatum, we found that DMS direct pathway neurons exhibited decreased activity as the mouse gained proficiency at running. In contrast, direct pathway activity in the DLS was similar throughout training. Pharmacological blockade of D1 dopamine receptors in these subregions during task performance demonstrated that dopamine neurotransmission in the direct pathway activity is necessary for efficient motor coordination learning. These results provide new tools to measure changes in fine motor skills with simultaneous recordings of brain activity and reveal fundamental features of the neuronal substrates of motor learning.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Correcting the hebbian mistake: Toward a fully error-driven hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Yicong Zheng, Xiaonan L. Liu, Satoru Nishiyama, Charan Ranganath, Randall C. O’Reilly</p>

The hippocampus plays a critical role in the rapid learning of new episodic memories. Many computational models propose that the hippocampus is an autoassociator that relies on Hebbian learning (i.e., “cells that fire together, wire together”). However, Hebbian learning is computationally suboptimal as it does not learn in a way that is driven toward, and limited by, the objective of achieving effective retrieval. Thus, Hebbian learning results in more interference and a lower overall capacity. Our previous computational models have utilized a powerful, biologically plausible form of error-driven learning in hippocampal CA1 and entorhinal cortex (EC) (functioning as a sparse autoencoder) by contrasting local activity states at different phases in the theta cycle. Based on specific neural data and a recent abstract computational model, we propose a new model called Theremin (Total Hippocampal ERror MINimization) that extends error-driven learning to area CA3—the mnemonic heart of the hippocampal system. In the model, CA3 responds to the EC monosynaptic input prior to the EC disynaptic input through dentate gyrus (DG), giving rise to a temporal difference between these two activation states, which drives error-driven learning in the EC→CA3 and CA3↔CA3 projections. In effect, DG serves as a teacher to CA3, correcting its patterns into more pattern-separated ones, thereby reducing interference. Results showed that Theremin, compared with our original Hebbian-based model, has significantly increased capacity and learning speed. The model makes several novel predictions that can be tested in future studies.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Co-occurring anthropogenic stressors reduce the timeframe of environmental viability for the world’s coral reefs</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Renee O. Setter, Erik C. Franklin, Camilo Mora</p>

Anthropogenic disturbances are posing unprecedented challenges to the persistence of ecosystems worldwide. The speed at which these disturbances reach an ecosystem’s tolerance thresholds will determine the time available for adaptation and conservation. Here, we aim to calculate the year after which a given environmental stressor permanently exceeds the bounds of an ecosystem’s tolerance. Ecosystem thresholds are here defined as limits in a given stressor beyond which ecosystems have showed considerable changes in community assembly and functioning, becoming remnants of what they once were, but not necessarily leading to species extirpation or extinction. Using the world’s coral reefs as a case example, we show that the projected effects of marine heatwaves, ocean acidification, storms, land-based pollution, and local human stressors are being underestimated considerably by looking at disturbances independently. Given the spatial complementarity in which numerous disturbances impact the world’s coral reefs, we show that the timelines of environmental suitability are halved when all disturbances are analyzed simultaneously, as opposed to independently. Under business-as-usual scenarios, the median year after which environmental conditions become unsuitable for the world’s remaining coral reefs was, at worse, 2050 for any one disturbance alone (28 years left); but when analyzed concurrently, this date was shortened to 2035 (13 years left). When analyzed together, disturbances reduced the date of environmental suitability because areas that may remain suitable under one disturbance could become unsuitable by any of several other variables. The significance of co-occurring disturbances at reducing timeframes of environmental suitability was evident even under optimistic scenarios. The best-case scenario, characterized by strong mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions and optimistic human development, resulted in 41% of global coral reefs with unsuitable conditions by 2100 under any one disturbance independently; yet when analyzed in combination up to 64% of the world’s coral reefs could face unsuitable environmental conditions by one disturbance or another. Under the worst-case scenario, nearly all coral reef ecosystems worldwide (approximately 99%) will permanently face unsuitable conditions by 2055 in at least one of the disturbances analyzed. Prior studies have indicated the projected dire effects of climate change on coral reefs by mid-century; by analyzing a multitude of projected disturbances, our study reveals a much more severe prognosis for the world’s coral reefs as they have significantly less time to adapt while highlighting the urgent need to tackle available solutions to human disturbances.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Potential of in vivo stress reporter models to reduce animal use and provide mechanistic insights in toxicity studies [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Chemical risk assessment ensures protection from the toxic effects of drugs and manmade chemicals. To comply with regulatory guidance, studies in complex organisms are required, as well as mechanistic studies to establish the relevance of any toxicities observed to man. Although in vitro toxicity models are improving, in vivo studies remain central to this process. Such studies are invariably time-consuming and often involve large numbers of animals. New regulatory frameworks recommend the implementation of “smart” in vivo approaches to toxicity testing that can effectively assess safety for humans and comply with societal expectations for reduction in animal use. A major obstacle in reducing the animals required is the time-consuming and complexity of the pathological endpoints used as markers of toxicity. Such endpoints are prone to inter-animal variability, subjectivity and require harmonisation between testing sites. As a consequence, large numbers of animals per experimental group are required. To address this issue, we propose the implementation of sophisticated stress response reporter mice that we have developed. These reporter models provide early biomarkers of toxic potential in a highly reproducible manner at single-cell resolution, which can also be measured non-invasively and have been extensively validated in academic research as early biomarkers of stress responses for a wide range of chemicals at human-relevant exposures. In this report, we describe a new and previously generated models in our lab, provide the methodology required for their use and discuss how they have been used to inform on toxic risk. We propose our in vivo approach is more informative (refinement) and reduces the animal use (reduction) compared to traditional toxicity testing. These models could be incorporated into tiered toxicity testing and used in combination with in vitro assays to generate quantitative adverse outcome pathways and inform on toxic potential.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Characterization of virulence factors and antibiotic resistance pattern of uropathogenic Escherichia coli strains in a tertiary care center [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Urinary tract infections (UTI) are the most prevalent bacterial infection in humans. The uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC) expresses a range of virulence factors that contribute to their pathogenicity. The emergence of multidrug resistance (MDR)-associated UTI is increasing. This study monitors the distribution of virulence factors among UPEC strains to note the antibiogram, outcome and type of associated UTI. Methods: A prospective cross-sectional time-bound study of six months was done on clinically significant urinary isolates of Escherichia coli. Detection of haemolysin production and serum resistance was done by phenotypic methods. Genotypic characterization of the virulence genes (papC, iutA, hlyA, cnf1) was done by multiplex PCR. Demographic data, clinical history, antibiogram and type of UTI was collected from clinical case records. Results:75 E.coli isolates from patients with suspected UTIs were included. Females had a higher preponderance of UTI (66.7%). 93% of patients were adults and the remaining 7% were from paediatrics.  24 (32%) isolates showed haemolysis by plate haemolysis and all isolates were serum-resistant. Out of 75 isolates, 65 were positive for at least one of four targeted genes, while remaining ten isolates were negative for all four genes. Multidrug resistance was found in 40 (53.3%) isolates. 97.4% of the UTI cases had a favourable clinical outcome at discharge. Mortality due to urosepsis was 2.6%. Conclusion: Association of hemolysin production with resistance to imipenem and norfloxacin in UPEC strains was significant. Presence of hlyA gene is positively associated with ceftazidime resistance. Nitrofurantoin, piperacillin, tazobactam, and cefaperazone sulbactam are possible candidates for empirical therapy of UTIs. Drugs like aminoglycosides, carbapenems and fosfomycin may be used as reserve drugs in the treatment of MDR-UTI. However, inappropriate usage can increase antibiotic resistance. Hence proper selection of antibiotics in hospitals taking into account the local antibiogram is needed to reduce the emergence of antibiotic resistance.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Trans‐synaptic degeneration following acute optic neuritis in multiple sclerosis</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Explore longitudinal changes in brain volumetric measures and retinal layer thicknesses following acute optic neuritis (AON) in people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS), to investigate the process of trans-synaptic degeneration and determine its clinical relevance.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>PwMS were recruited within 40 days of AON onset (n=49) and underwent baseline retinal optical coherence tomography (OCT) and brain MRI followed by longitudinal tracking for up to 5 years. A comparator cohort of PwMS without a recent episode of AON were similarly tracked (n=73). Mixed-effects linear regression models were used.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Accelerated atrophy of the occipital gray matter (GM), calcarine GM, and thalamus was seen in the AON cohort, as compared to the non-AON cohort (-0.76% versus -0.22% per year [p=0.01] for occipital GM, -1.83% versus -0.32% per year [p=0.008] for calcarine GM, -1.17% versus -0.67% per year [p=0.02] for thalamus), while rates of whole brain, cortical GM, non-occipital cortical GM atrophy and T2 lesion accumulation did not differ significantly between the cohorts. In the AON cohort, greater AON-induced reduction in ganglion cell+inner plexiform layer (GCIPL) thickness over the first year was associated with faster rates of whole brain (r=0.32, p=0.04), white matter (r=0.32, p=0.04) and thalamic (r=0.36, p=0.02) atrophy over the study period. Significant relationships were identified between faster atrophy of the subcortical GM and thalamus, with worse visual function outcomes after AON.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>These results provide <i>in-vivo</i> evidence for anterograde trans-synaptic degeneration following AON in PwMS, and suggest that trans-synaptic degeneration may be related to clinically-relevant visual outcomes.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Olfactory neuron Prokineticin‐2 as a potential target in Parkinson's disease</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To outline dynamics of Prokineticin-2 pathway in relation to clinical-pathological features of Parkinson’s disease by examining olfactory neurons of patients.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Thirty-eight patients (26 <i>de novo</i>, newly diagnosed) and 31 sex/age-matched healthy controls underwent non-invasive mucosa brushing for olfactory neurons collection, and standard clinical assessment. Gene expression levels of Prokineticin-2, Prokineticin-2 receptors type 1 and 2, and Prokineticin-2-long peptide were measured in olfactory neurons by Real Time-PCR; moreover, the Prokineticin-2 protein and α-synuclein species (total and oligomeric) were quantified by immunofluorescence staining.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Prokineticin-2 expression was significantly increased in Parkinson’s disease. <i>De novo</i> patients had higher Prokineticin-2 levels, directly correlated with MDS-UPDRS pars III motor score. Also oligomeric α-synuclein was higher in Parkinson’s disease and directly correlated with Prokineticin-2 protein levels. Total α-synuclein did not differ between patients and controls.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Prokineticin-2 is a chemokine showing neuroprotective effects in experimental models of Parkinson’s disease, but translational proofs of its role in patients is still lacking. Here, we used olfactory neurons as the ideal tissue to analyse molecular stages of neurodegeneration <i>in vivo</i>, providing unprecedented evidence that Prokineticin-2 pathway is activated in Parkinson’s patients. Specifically, Prokineticin-2 expression in olfactory neurons was higher at early disease stages, proportional to motor severity, and associated with oligomeric α-synuclein accumulation. These data, consistently with preclinical findings, support Prokineticin-2 as candidate target in Parkinson’s disease, and validate reliability of olfactory neurons to reflect pathological changes of the disease.</p>

                Background: The “drive by wire” mechanism for managing the throttle is not applied to every modern motorcycle, but it is often managed through a steel wire. Here, there is a cam on the throttle control. Its shape allows the throttle opening to be faster or slower and its angle of rotation, required for full opening, to be greater or less. The maximum angle a rider's wrist can withstand depends on numerous musculoskeletal mobility factors, often limited by falls or surgery. Methods: Using a Progrip knob with interchangeable cams allows the customization of a special cam profile, to ensure the best engine response to throttle rotation and ergonomics for the rider. The use of FEA software and lattice structures, allows to realize a lightweight and efficient design, targeted for fabrication with additive manufacturing technologies. Results: The cam was manufactured by exploiting MSLA technology. Finally, a dimensional inspection procedure was performed before assembly. The main result is to have obtained a lighter and cheaper component than the original. Conclusions: This study has allowed the design of a mechanical component consisting of innovative shape, light weight, and ergonomics. Furthermore, it demonstrates the effectiveness in the use of lattice structures to enable weight optimization of a component while minimizing the increase in its compliance.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Responses of chemosensory perception to stimulation of the human brain</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Significant advances have been made in our understanding of the neural substrates of human chemosensory processing, involving the piriform cortex, insula and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). However, the important and challenging issues are to localize the brain regions with high anatomic precision that can causally produce chemosensory perception and further delineate the topography of different classifications of chemosensory perception.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We quantitatively measured subjective responses of chemosensory perception to intracranial electrical stimulation over the brain in neurosurgical patients (n = 302) with medically refractory epilepsy.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The chemosensory perceptions including olfaction, gustation and chemesthesis were elicited in 21 of 302 patients (7%). Chemosensory responses were evoked in 53 (0.2%) of 21,661 stimulated sites. The highest response rate (1.8%) was in the insula (37/2,051 stimulated sites from 15/163 patients). The chemosensory perception emerged predominantly during stimulations of the insula along the central sulcus axis. Notably, there existed a distinct pattern that the anteroventral insula predominately represented orthonasal olfaction, while different chemosensory modalities converged in the mid-dorsal insula.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This study provided a detailed characterization of chemosensory perception across the brain, especially in the insula. These results suggest that the cortex along the banks of the central sulcus of the insula may play a role in producing the supramodal sensation of flavor. It also indicates that dysfunction of the central insula should be considered during the evaluation of chemosensory-related epileptic seizures.</p>

<p><i>npy</i>, <i>agrp</i>, <i>cart</i>, and <i>pomc</i> were expressed in feeding-related regions, including hypothalamus of Atlantic salmon (<i>Salmo salar</i>). In the hypothalamic lateral tuberal nucleus, the putative homolog to the mammalian arcuate nucleus, <i>npya</i>, <i>agrp1</i>, <i>cart2b</i>, and <i>pomca</i> were predominantly localized in distinct neurons; however, some neurons coexpressed <i>cart2b/pomca</i>.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The melanocortin system is a key regulator of appetite and food intake in vertebrates. This system includes the neuropeptides neuropeptide y (NPY), agouti-related peptide (AGRP), cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART), and pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC). An important center for appetite control in mammals is the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus, with neurons that coexpress either the orexigenic NPY/AGRP or the anorexigenic CART/POMC neuropeptides. In ray-finned fishes, such a center is less characterized. The Atlantic salmon (<i>Salmo salar</i>) has multiple genes of these neuropeptides due to whole-genome duplication events. To better understand the potential involvement of the melanocortin system in appetite and food intake control, we have mapped the mRNA expression of <i>npy</i>, <i>agrp</i>, <i>cart</i>, and <i>pomc</i> in the brain of Atlantic salmon parr using in situ hybridization. After identifying hypothalamic mRNA expression, we investigated the possible intracellular coexpression of <i>npy/agrp</i> and <i>cart/pomc</i> in the tuberal hypothalamus by fluorescent in situ hybridization. The results showed that the neuropeptides were widely distributed, especially in sensory and neuroendocrine brain regions. In the hypothalamic lateral tuberal nucleus, the putative homolog to the mammalian arcuate nucleus, <i>npya</i>, <i>agrp1</i>, <i>cart2b</i>, and <i>pomca</i> were predominantly localized in distinct neurons; however, some neurons coexpressed <i>cart2b/pomca</i>. This is the first demonstration of coexpression of <i>cart2b/pomca</i> in the tuberal hypothalamus of a teleost. Collectively, our data suggest that the lateral tuberal nucleus is the center for appetite control in salmon, similar to that of mammals. Extrahypothalamic brain regions might also be involved in regulating food intake, including the olfactory bulb, telencephalon, midbrain, and hindbrain.</p>

                <img src="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/06a83ccd-db36-445c-8073-cf9040cae9b3/cne25423-gra-0001-m.png"
     alt="Chromatic organization of retinal photoreceptors during eye migration of Atlantic halibut (Hippoglossus hippoglossus)"/>
<p>Flatfishes undergo a pronounced metamorphosis whereby a bilateral, pelagic larva transforms into a flattened, benthic juvenile with both eyes on the same side of the head. The changes in photoreceptor visual pigment protein (opsin) expression during this period of eye migration are unknown. Here, we describe the chromatic organization of photoreceptors during eye migration using antibodies that label blue (SWS2) opsin, and green (RH) and red (LWS) opsins simultaneously. Our results reveal opsin co-expression within individual cone photoreceptors and a gradient in SWS2-expressing cones that may guide the creation of the square mosaic from an hexagonal mosaic.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The retinas of fishes often have single and double cone photoreceptors that are organized in lattice-like mosaics. In flatfishes experiencing eye migration (i.e., the metamorphic process whereby one eye migrates to the other side of the head), the hexagonal lattice of single cones present in the larva undergoes major restructuring resulting in a dominant square mosaic postmetamorphosis consisting of four double cones surrounding each single cone. The expression of different opsin types during eye migration has not been examined despite its importance in understanding photoreceptor plasticity and whether cell fate (in terms of spectral phenotype) could influence square mosaic formation. Here, we probed the retina of Atlantic halibut undergoing eye migration for opsin expression using two antibodies, AHblue and AB5407, that labeled short wavelength sensitive 2 (SWS2) opsin and longer wavelength (predominantly middle wavelength sensitive, RH2) opsins, respectively. Throughout the retina, double and triple cones labeled with AB5407 exclusively, whereas the vast majority of single cones labeled with AHblue. A minority (&lt;5%) of single cones in the square mosaic of the centroventral retina labeled with AB5407. In regions of mosaic transition and near peripheral growth zones, some single cones co-expressed at least two opsins as they labeled with both antibodies. Short wavelength (SWS2 expressing, or S) cones formed a nonrandom mosaic gradient from central to dorsal retina in a region dominated by the larval single cone mosaic. Our results demonstrate the expression of at least two opsins throughout the postmetamorphic retina and suggest opsin switching as a mechanism to create new cone spectral phenotypes. In addition, the S cone gradient at the onset of eye migration may underlie a plastic, cell induction mechanism by which a cone's phenotype determines that of its neighbors and the formation of the square mosaic.</p>

     alt="In vivo tracking of KCC2b expression during early brain development"/><p>We used CRISPR/Cas9 transgenesis to generate a KCC2b:mCitrine fluorescence reporter zebrafish line and characterized KCC2b regional distribution and dynamics in vivo during early brain development. We demonstrate KCC2b expression in postmigration stage neurons and suppression of KCC2b expression by exposure to bisphenol-A. KCC2b:mCitrine zebrafish present a new method for visualizing this protein's complex dynamics during brain development and screening compounds aimed at modulating chloride homeostasis through KCC2b.

<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The neuronal chloride (Cl−) exporter, KCC2, regulates neuron excitability and development and undergoes a stereotypical pattern of delayed upregulation as neurons mature. KCC2 upregulation favors neural inhibition by establishing a negative Cl− gradient, ensuring GABA-induced Cl− currents are inward and inhibitory. We developed a zebrafish fluorescent reporter line, KCC2b:mCitrine, to track KCC2 expression in vivo during early brain development. KCC2b:mCitrine was first detected at 16 h postfertilization and by day 6 labeled most central and peripheral neurons and processes. At 20 h, expression was greatest in the soma-dense basal neuroepithelium but largely absent in apical and mantle zones where differentiation and migration primarily occur, and time lapse imaging at this stage supports a postmigration upregulation of KCC2b. Central dopamine neurons showed low KCC2b expression as observed in other species. KCC2b:mCitrine fluorescence was stable over minutes in most neurons, but brightness transients observed in single cells fit our expectation for real-time tracking of KCC2b upregulation in new neurons. To further assess whether fluorescence brightness tracks KCC2b expression, zebrafish embryos were exposed to bisphenol-A (BPA), which is known to suppress KCC2 expression. Fluorescence decreased after 6 days of BPA exposure but not after 2 or 4 days, suggesting that it is an accurate but delayed indicator of KCC2b expression. KCC2b:mCitrine zebrafish present a new method for visualizing KCC2b's complex dynamics during brain development, and potentially screening compounds aimed at modulating KCC2 expression.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">A fungal GPI-anchored protein gene functions as a virulence and antiviral factor</a></h4>

              
                Chun et al. show that a C. parasitica GPI-anchored protein (GPI-AP) is essential for virulence and phytotoxicity through an antioxidant activity-dependent mechanism. They furthermore show that GPI-AP functions as an antiviral factor against the mycovirus CHV1.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Maternal gut microbiota mediate intergenerational effects of high-fat diet on descendant social behavior</a></h4>

              
                Di Gesù, Matz et al. find that maternal high-fat diet results in intergenerational (F1, F2), but not transgenerational (F3), descendant social dysfunction. Metataxonomic sequencing and fecal microbiota transplant data implicate dysbiosis of the maternal gut microbiome in intergenerational social deficits, which can be restored by post-weaning Limosilactobacillus reuteri-6475 supplementation.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">The tempo and mode of gene regulatory programs during bacterial infection</a></h4>

              
                Avital et al. show that bacterial infection induces discrete transcriptomic states in macrophages that correspond to different response functions. One of these states captures inflammatory activation characterized by four gene modules. The dynamics of this inflammatory trajectory can be impacted by modulation of bacterial stimulus, infection duration, and presence of toxins.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">A mechanical G2 checkpoint controls epithelial cell division through E-cadherin-mediated regulation of Wee1-Cdk1</a></h4>

              
                Donker et al. show that epithelia adapt their rate of cell division to fluctuations in cell number by sensing corresponding changes in intercellular forces. These forces are transduced by E-cadherin adhesions to control cell-cycle progression through G2 phase via regulation of the kinase Wee1 and downstream inhibition of Cdk1.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Alternative somatic and germline gene-regulatory strategies during starvation-induced developmental arrest</a></h4>

              
                Webster et al. show that the transcriptional response to starvation is mounted early in larval somatic cells supporting survival but that it wanes over time. In contrast, they show that the germline remains transcriptionally quiescent deep into starvation, supporting reproductive potential, while maintaining its transcriptome via transcript stability.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Novel multicellular prokaryote discovered next to an underground stream</a></h4>

              
                A diversity of prokaryotes currently exhibit multicellularity with different generation mechanisms in a variety of contexts of ecology on Earth. In the present study, we report a new type of multicellular bacterium, HS-3, isolated from an underground stream. HS-3 self-organizes its filamentous cells into a layer-structured colony with the properties of a nematic liquid crystal. After maturation, the colony starts to form a semi-closed sphere accommodating clusters of coccobacillus daughter cells and selectively releases them upon contact with water. This is the first report that shows that a liquid-crystal status of cells can support the prokaryotic multicellular behavior. Importantly, the observed behavior of HS-3 suggests that the recurrent intermittent exposure of colonies to water flow in the cave might have been the ecological context that cultivated the evolutionary transition from unicellular to multicellular life. This is the new extant model that underpins theories regarding a role of ecological context in the emergence of multicellularity.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A single cell transcriptional roadmap of human pacemaker cell differentiation</a></h4>

              
                Each heartbeat is triggered by the sinoatrial node (SAN), the primary pacemaker of the heart. Studies in animal models have revealed that pacemaker cells share a common progenitor with the (pro)epicardium, and that the pacemaker cardiomyocytes further diversify into ‘transitional’, ‘tail’, and ‘head’ subtypes. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms, especially of human pacemaker cell development, are poorly understood. Here, we performed single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and trajectory inference on human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) differentiating to SAN-like cardiomyocytes (SANCMs) to construct a roadmap of transcriptional changes and lineage decisions. In differentiated SANCM, we identified distinct clusters that closely resemble different subpopulations of the in vivo SAN. Moreover, the presence of a side population of proepicardial cells suggested their shared ontogeny with SANCM, as also reported in vivo. Our results demonstrate that the divergence of SANCM and proepicardial lineages is determined by WNT signaling. Furthermore, we uncovered roles for TGFβ and WNT signaling in the branching of transitional and head SANCM subtypes, respectively. These findings provide new insights into the molecular processes involved in human pacemaker cell differentiation, opening new avenues for complex disease modeling in vitro and inform approaches for cell therapy-based regeneration of the SAN.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Cannabinoid signaling modulation through JZL184 restores key phenotypes of a mouse model for Williams–Beuren syndrome</a></h4>

              
                Williams–Beuren syndrome (WBS) is a rare genetic multisystemic disorder characterized by mild-to-moderate intellectual disability and hypersocial phenotype, while the most life-threatening features are cardiovascular abnormalities. Nowadays, there are no pharmacological treatments to directly ameliorate the main traits of WBS. The endocannabinoid system (ECS), given its relevance for both cognitive and cardiovascular function, could be a potential druggable target in this syndrome. We analyzed the components of the ECS in the complete deletion (CD) mouse model of WBS and assessed the impact of its pharmacological modulation in key phenotypes relevant for WBS. CD mice showed the characteristic hypersociable phenotype with no preference for social novelty and poor short-term object-recognition performance. Brain cannabinoid type-1 receptor (CB1R) in CD male mice showed alterations in density and coupling with no detectable change in main endocannabinoids. Endocannabinoid signaling modulation with subchronic (10 days) JZL184, a selective inhibitor of monoacylglycerol lipase, specifically normalized the social and cognitive phenotype of CD mice. Notably, JZL184 treatment improved cardiovascular function and restored gene expression patterns in cardiac tissue. These results reveal the modulation of the ECS as a promising novel therapeutic approach to improve key phenotypic alterations in WBS.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Touch-sensitive stamens enhance pollen dispersal by scaring away visitors</a></h4>

              
                Animal-pollinated plants have to get pollen to a conspecific stigma while protecting it from getting eaten. Touch-sensitive stamens, which are found in hundreds of flowering plants, are thought to function in enhancing pollen export and reducing its loss, but experimental tests are scarce. Stamens of <i>Berberis</i> and <i>Mahonia</i> are inserted between paired nectar glands and when touched by an insect’s tongue rapidly snap forward so that their valvate anthers press pollen on the insect’s tongue or face. We immobilized the stamens in otherwise unmodified flowers and studied pollen transfer in the field and under enclosed conditions. On flowers with immobilized stamens, the most common bee visitor stayed up to 3.6× longer, yet removed 1.3× fewer pollen grains and deposited 2.1× fewer grains on stigmas per visit. Self-pollen from a single stamen hitting the stigma amounted to 6% of the grains received from single bee visits. Bees discarded pollen passively placed on their bodies, likely because of its berberine content; nectar has no berberine. Syrphid flies fed on both nectar and pollen, taking more when stamens were immobilized. Pollen-tracking experiments in two <i>Berberis</i> species showed that mobile-stamen-flowers donate pollen to many more recipients. These results demonstrate another mechanism by which plants simultaneously meter out their pollen and reduce pollen theft.

                Early events during axolotl limb regeneration include an immune response and the formation of a wound epithelium. These events are linked to a clearance of damaged tissue prior to blastema formation and regeneration of the missing structures. Here, we report the resorption of calcified skeletal tissue as an active, cell-driven and highly regulated event. This process, carried out by osteoclasts, is essential for a successful integration of the newly formed skeleton. Indeed, the extent of resorption is directly correlated with the integration efficiency and treatment with zoledronic acid resulted in osteoclast function inhibition and failed tissue integration. Moreover, we identified the wound epithelium as a regulator of skeletal resorption, likely releasing signals involved in recruitment/differentiation of osteoclasts. Finally, we reported a correlation between resorption and blastema formation, particularly, a coordination of resorption with cartilage condensation. In sum, our results identify resorption as a major event upon amputation, playing a critical role in the overall process of skeletal regeneration.

                Precise control of protein degradation is critical for life, yet how natural genetic variation affects this essential process is largely unknown. Here, we developed a statistically powerful mapping approach to characterize how genetic variation affects protein degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). Using the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we systematically mapped genetic influences on the N-end rule, a UPS pathway in which protein N-terminal amino acids function as degradation-promoting signals. Across all 20 possible N-terminal amino acids, we identified 149 genomic loci that influence UPS activity, many of which had pathway- or substrate-specific effects. Fine-mapping of four loci identified multiple causal variants in each of four ubiquitin system genes whose products process (NTA1), recognize (UBR1 and DOA10), and ubiquitinate (UBC6) cellular proteins. A cis-acting promoter variant that modulates UPS activity by altering UBR1 expression alters the abundance of 36 proteins without affecting levels of the corresponding mRNAs. Our results reveal a complex genetic basis of variation in UPS activity.

                Tissue clearing for whole organ cell profiling has revolutionized biology and imaging for exploration of organs in three-dimensional space without compromising tissue architecture. But complicated, laborious procedures, or expensive equipment, as well as the use of hazardous, organic solvents prevent the widespread adoption of these methods. Here, we report a simple and rapid tissue clearing method, EZ Clear, that can clear whole adult mouse organs in 48 hr in just three simple steps. Samples stay at room temperature and remain hydrated throughout the clearing process, preserving endogenous and synthetic fluorescence, without altering sample size. After wholemount clearing and imaging, samples processed with EZ Clear can be subjected to downstream applications, such as tissue embedding and cryosectioning followed by standard histology or immunofluorescent staining without loss of fluorescence signal from endogenous or synthetic reporters. Furthermore, we demonstrate that wholemount adult mouse brains processed with EZ Clear can be successfully immunolabeled for fluorescent imaging while still retaining signal from endogenous fluorescent reporters. Overall, the simplicity, speed, and flexibility of EZ Clear make it easy to adapt and implement in diverse imaging modalities in biomedical research.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Prior information improves tactile representation in primary somatosensory cortex</a></h4>

              
                Successful navigation through the world requires the integration of sensory input with prior information about the environment. Although it has been shown that stimuli which match prior expectations can be detected faster and more accurately, little is known about the integration of prior information with incoming tactile stimulation in human somatosensory areas. It is also unknown if prior information can induce somatotopic activity in the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) in the absence of tactile stimuli. Based on a vibrotactile detection paradigm we assess how prior information impacts the behavioral performance of participants and how it concurrently modulates BOLD activity and multivariate representations of tactile stimuli in somatosensory areas within a human neuroimaging study. The supra-voxel somatotopic organization of S1 allows us to dissociate representations of tactile stimuli and the modulation thereof by prior information with the resolution permitted by fMRI. We find that vibrotactile stimuli that match the expectations of participants enhance stimulus perception, and that this behavioral enhancement is associated with higher decoding accuracies of stimulus representations in the S1 and a concurrent decrease in BOLD levels in the area. Additionally, we show that prior cues are capable of inducing somatotopic BOLD activity even prior to the onset of tactile stimulation, that tactile stimuli can be decoded from this preparatory activity and that the precision of the decoding is related to the upcoming behavioral performance of participants.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Febrile seizure unleashes spreading depolarizations in Scn1a deficient mice</a></h4>

              
                Objective: Spreading depolarization (SD) is a massive wave of cellular depolarization that slowly migrates across brain gray matter. SD is frequently generated following brain injury and is associated with various acute and chronic neurological deficits. Here we report that spontaneous cortical SD waves are a common EEG abnormality in the Scn1a deficient mouse model (Scn1a+/R1407X). Method: Chronic DC-band EEG recording detected SDs, seizures, and seizure-SD complexes during prolonged monitoring in awake adult Scn1a+/R1407X mice. The effect of hyperthermic seizure and memantine was tested. Results: The spontaneous incidence of events is low and varied among animals, but SDs outnumber seizures. SD waves almost always spread unilaterally from parietal to frontal cortex. On average, spontaneous SD frequency robustly increased by 4.2-fold following a single hyperthermia-evoked seizure, persisting for days to a week without altering the kinetics of individual events. Combined video image and electromyogram analyses revealed that a single interictal SD is associated with prodromal motor activation followed by minutes-lasting immobility upon invasion of frontal cortex. Similar behavioral sequelae also appeared during postictal SD. Memantine treatment was effective in preventing SD exacerbation when given before and after the hyperthermic seizure, suggesting chronic activation of NMDA-receptor contributed to the prolonged SD aftermath. Interpretation: Our results reveal that cortical SD is a prominent electro-behavioral phenotype in this Scn1a deficient mouse model, and SD frequency is robustly sensitive to hyperthermic seizure induced mechanisms likely involving excess NMDAR signaling. The high susceptibility to SD may contribute to co-morbid pathophysiology in developmental epileptic encephalopathy.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Genome-wide RNA binding analysis of C9orf72 poly(PR) dipeptides</a></h4>

              
                An intronic GGGGCC repeat expansion in C9orf72 is a common genetic cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia. The repeats are transcribed in both sense and antisense directions to generate distinct dipeptide repeat proteins, of which poly(GA), poly(GR) and poly(PR) have been implicated in contributing to neurodegeneration. Poly(PR) binding to RNA may contribute to toxicity, but analysis of poly(PR)-RNA binding on a genome-wide scale has not yet been carried out. We therefore performed crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (CLIP) analysis in human cells to identify the RNA binding sites of poly(PR). We found that poly(PR) binds to nearly 600 RNAs, with the sequence GAAGA enriched at the binding sites. In vitro experiments showed that polyGAAGA RNA binds poly(PR) with higher affinity than control RNA and induces phase-separation of poly(PR) into condensates. These data indicate that poly(PR) preferentially binds to polyGAAGA-containing RNAs, which may have physiological consequences.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The enzymatic and neurochemical outcomes of a mutation in Mexican cavefish MAO reveal teleost-specific aspects of brain monoamine homeostasis</a></h4>

              
                Monoamine oxidases (MAO; MAO-A and MAO-B in mammals) are enzymes catalyzing the degradation of biogenic amines, including monoamine neurotransmitters. In humans, coding mutations in MAOs are extremely rare and deleterious. Here, we assessed the structural and biochemical consequences of a point mutation (P106L) in the single mao gene of the blind cavefish Astyanax mexicanus. This mutation decreased mao enzymatic activity by ~3-fold, probably as a result of decreased flexibility in one of the three loops forming the entrance of the active site, thus reducing the access of substrates. HPLC measurements in brains of mutant and non-mutant larvae and adults of the cave and surface morphs of the species showed major disturbances in serotonin, dopamine and noradrenalin (and metabolites) contents in mutants, demonstrating that the P106L mao mutation is fully responsible for monoaminergic disequilibrium in the P106L mao mutant cavefish brain. The outcomes of the mutation were different in the posterior brain (containing the raphe nucleus) and the anterior brain (containing fish-specific hypothalamic serotonergic clusters), revealing contrasting properties in neurotransmitter homeostasis in these different neuronal groups. We also discovered that the effects of the mutation were partially compensated by a decrease in activity of the tph, the serotonin biosynthesis rate-limiting enzyme. Finally, the neurochemical outcomes of the mao P106L mutation differed in many respects from a treatment with deprenyl, an irreversible MAO inhibitor, showing that genetic and pharmacological interference with MAO function are not the same. Our results shade light on our understanding of cavefish evolution, on the specificities of fish monoaminergic systems, and on MAO-dependent homeostasis of brain neurochemistry in general.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A machine learning based approach towards high-dimensional mediation analysis</a></h4>

              
                Mediation analysis is used to investigate the role of intermediate variables (mediators) that lie in the path between an exposure and an outcome variable. While significant research has focused on developing methods for assessing the influence of mediators on the exposure-outcome relationship, current approaches do not easily extend to settings where the mediator is high-dimensional. These situations are becoming increasingly common with the rapid increase of new applications measuring massive numbers of variables, including brain imaging, genomics, and metabolomics. In this work, we introduce a novel machine learning based method for identifying high dimensional mediators. The proposed algorithm iterates between using a machine learning model to map the high-dimensional mediators onto a lower-dimensional space, and using the predicted values as input in a standard three-variable mediation model. Hence, the machine learning model is trained to maximize the likelihood of the mediation model. Importantly, the proposed algorithm is agnostic to the machine learning model that is used, providing significant flexibility in the types of situations where it can be used. We illustrate the proposed methodology using data from two functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) studies. First, using data from a task-based fMRI study of thermal pain, we combine the proposed algorithm with a deep learning model to detect distributed, network-level brain patterns mediating the relationship between stimulus intensity (temperature) and reported pain at the single trial level. Second, using resting-state fMRI data from the Human Connectome Project, we combine the proposed algorithm with a connectome-based predictive modeling approach to determine brain functional connectivity measures that mediate the relationship between fluid intelligence and working memory accuracy. In both cases, our multivariate mediation model links exposure variables (thermal pain or fluid intelligence), high dimensional brain measures (single-trial brain activation maps or resting-state brain connectivity) and behavioral outcomes (pain report or working memory accuracy) into a single unified model. Using the proposed approach, we are able to identify brain-based measures that simultaneously encode the exposure variable and correlate with the behavioral outcome.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Engaging in word recognition elicits highly specific modulations in visual cortex</a></h4>

              
                The ability to read depends on a region in ventral occipito-temporal cortex known as the "visual word form area" (VWFA). The VWFA, which has several sub-regions, lies amidst a collection of areas involved in visual recognition. Although it responds best to written words, its selectivity is not absolute, and it exhibits top-down modulations that are not well understood. Here, we used fMRI to investigate the interaction of bottom-up visual factors and top-down cognitive factors in the VWFA and neighboring regions. We presented participants with strings of letters and non-letter shapes at a range of visual field locations. For each stimulus type, participants performed a task in which the stimuli were task-relevant (lexical decision and gap localization, respectively), and a task in which the stimuli were irrelevant (detecting fixation dot color changes). Standard models of attention predict that all stimuli would evoke larger responses when task-relevant than irrelevant, throughout visual cortex. To the contrary, the data showed surprising patterns specific to the VWFA. Letter strings did evoke much larger responses when they were task-relevant than irrelevant, even when presented too far in the periphery to be recognized. In contrast, non-letter shapes evoked smaller responses when they were task-relevant. Connectivity analyses suggest that these task effects are due to flexible communication between the VWFA and Broca's area. We conclude that top-down modulations in visual cortex do not merely enhance representations of attended stimuli, but can boost processing in specific brain regions, contingent on engagement in specific tasks.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Sex differences in social synchronization of conditioned fear.</a></h4>

              
                Coordinated behaviors are prevalent in the animal kingdom as they promote the survival of social specie. Meanwhile, the distinct social roles of males and females predict sex differences in behavioral coordination. Because of its complexity, behavioral coordination and the underlying circuits have not been studied extensively in laboratory animals. Recently, we established a mouse model of social synchronization of conditioned fear, which revealed a sex difference and identified the ventral hippocampus to the amygdala pathway as the integrator of the affective and social information. Here, we investigated the sex differences further by manipulating the social cues or emotional state. Familiarity with social cues increased fear synchrony in male but not female dyads. The emotional distress from brief immobilization disrupted fear synchrony in males but enhanced it in females. Finally, inactivation of the ventral hippocampus abolished fear synchrony in both sexes but elicited negative synchrony in females only. These findings reveal that conspecific identity and emotional state are sex-specific modulators of social synchrony, suggesting sex-specific functions within the socio-emotional integrator, which includes the ventral hippocampus and yet unknown circuits.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neural dynamics and geometry for transitive inference</a></h4>

              
                The ability to make inferences using abstract rules and relations has long been understood to be a hallmark of human intelligence, as evidenced in logic, mathematics, and language. Intriguingly, modern work in animal cognition has established that this ability is evolutionarily widespread, indicating an ancient and possibly foundational role in natural intelligence. Despite this importance, it remains an open question how inference using abstract rules is implemented in the brain - possibly due to a lack of competing hypotheses at the level of collective neural activity and of behavior. Here we report the generation and analysis of a collection of neural networks (NNs) that perform transitive inference (TI), a classical cognitive task that requires inference of a single abstract relation between novel combinations of inputs (if A > B and B > C, then A > C). We found that NNs generated using standard training methods (i) generalize fully (i.e. to all novel combinations of inputs), (ii) generalize when inference requires working memory (WM), a capacity thought to be essential for inference in living subjects, (iii) express multiple emergent behaviors long documented in humans and animals, in addition to novel behaviors not previously studied, and (iv) adopt different solutions that yield alternative predictions for both behavior and collective neural activity. Further, a subset of NNs expressed a "subtractive" solution that was characterized in neural activity space by a simple dynamical pattern (an oscillation) and geometric arrangement (ordered collinearity). Together, these findings show how collective neural activity can accomplish generalization according to an abstract rule, and provide a series of testable hypotheses not previously established in the study of TI. More broadly, these findings suggest new ways to understand how neural systems realize abstract rules and relations.

                The knowledge that brain functional connectomes are both unique and reliable has enabled The knowledge that brain functional connectomes are both unique and reliable has enabled behaviourally relevant inferences at a subject level. However, it is unknown whether such fingerprints persist under altered states of consciousness. Ayahuasca is a potent serotonergic psychedelic which elicits a widespread dysregulation of functional connectivity. Used communally in religious ceremonies, its shared use may highlight relevant novel interactions between mental state and FC inherency. Using 7T fMRI, we assessed resting-state static and dynamic FCs for 21 Santo Daime members after collective ayahuasca intake in an acute, within-subject study. Here, connectome fingerprinting revealed a shared functional space, accompanied by a spatiotemporal reallocation of keypoint edges. Importantly, we show that interindividual differences in higher-order FCs motifs are relevant to experiential phenotypes, given that they can predict perceptual drug effects. Collectively, our findings offer an example as to how individualised connectivity markers can be used to trace a subjects functional connectome across altered states of consciousness.

	<p>Neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID) is a rare neurodegenerative disease with highly heterogeneous manifestations. Curvilinear hyperintensity along the corticomedullary junction on diffusion-weighted images (DWI) is a vital clue for diagnosing NIID. DWI hyperintensity tends to show an anterior-to-posterior propagation pattern as the disease progresses. The rare cases of its disappearance may lead to misdiagnosis. Here, we reported a NIID patient with mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like (MELAS-like) episode, and reversible DWI hyperintensities. A review of the literature on NIID with MELAS-like episodes was conducted. A 69-year-old woman stated to our clinics for recurrent nausea/vomiting, mixed aphasia, altered mental status, and muscle weakness for 2 weeks. Neurological examination showed impaired mental attention and reaction capacity, miosis, mixed aphasia, decreased muscle strength in limbs, and reduced tendon reflex. Blood tests were unremarkable. The serological examination was positive for antibody against dipeptidyl-peptidase-like protein 6 (DPPX) (1:32). Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed hyperintensities in the left temporal occipitoparietal lobe on DWI and correspondingly elevated lactate peak in the identified restricted diffusion area on magnetic resonance spectroscopy, mimicking the image of MELAS. Skin biopsy and genetic testing confirmed the diagnosis of NIID. Pulse intravenous methylprednisolone and oral prednisolone were administered, ameliorating her condition with improved neuroimages. This case highlights the importance of distinguishing NIID and MELAS, and reversible DWI hyperintensities can be seen in NIID.</p>

	<p>Isofraxidin is an active component of several traditional and functional plants that have beneficial properties for neurodegenerative diseases. In this study, we examined whether isofraxidin exhibited antidepressant-like effects in chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS)-induced mice. Firstly, isofraxidin could reverse CUMS-induced decrease in body weight gain in mice. Additionally, in the sucrose preference test (SPT), isofraxidin reversed the decrease in sucrose consumption due to CUMS-induced depressive-like behavior. Isofraxidin also increased locomotor activity in the open field test (OFT) and alleviated immobility duration in the forced swimming test (FST) and tail-suspension test (TST). Furthermore, isofraxidin decreased levels of corticosterone (CORT), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), and hypothalamus corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH) in the serum after CUMS-induced hyperactivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Also, isofraxidin suppresses tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-&amp;amp;alpha;, interleukin (IL)-1&amp;amp;beta;, and IL-6 expression in the hippocampus of CUMS mice. Further investigations demonstrated that isofraxidin inhibited CUMS-induced activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-&amp;amp;kappa;B) and NOD-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasomes in the hippocampus. Summarily, in CUMS-induced mice, isofraxidin reduced depressive-like behaviors, accompanied by its inhibitory effects on hyperactivity of the HPA axis and NF-&amp;amp;kappa;B /NLRP3 inflammasomes pathways.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Considerable evidence from mouse models and human postmortem brain suggests loss of Muscleblind-like protein 2 (MBNL2) function in brain is a major driver of CNS symptoms in Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1). Increased hypersomnia, fatigue, and surgical complications associated with general anesthesia suggest possible sensitivity to GABAergic inhibition in DM1. To test the hypothesis that MBNL2 depletion leads to behavioral sensitivity to GABA<SUB>A</SUB> receptor (GABA<SUB>A</SUB>-R) modulation, <I>Mbnl2</I> knock-out (KO) and wild-type (WT) littermates were treated with the anesthetic sevoflurane, the benzodiazepine diazepam, the imidazopyridine zolpidem, and the benzodiazepine rescue agent, flumazenil (Ro 15-1788), and assessed for various behavioral metrics. <I>Mbnl2</I> KO mice exhibited delayed recovery following sevoflurane, delayed emergence and recovery from zolpidem, and enhanced sleep time at baseline that was modulated by flumazenil. A significantly higher proportion of <I>Mbnl2</I> KO mice also loss their righting reflex [loss of righting reflex (LORR)] from a standard diazepam dose. We further examined whether MBNL2 depletion affects total GABA<SUB>A</SUB>-R mRNA subunit levels and validated RNA-sequencing data of mis-spliced <I>Gabrg2</I>, whose isoform ratios are known to regulate GABA sensitivity and associated behaviors. While no other GABA<SUB>A</SUB>-R subunit mRNA levels tested were altered in <I>Mbnl2</I> KO mouse prefrontal cortex, <I>Gabrg2S/L</I> mRNA ratio levels were significantly altered. Taken together, our findings indicate that loss of MBNL2 function affects GABAergic function in a mouse model of myotonic dystrophy (DM1).</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Despite increased prevalence of maternal cannabis use, little is understood regarding potential long-term effects of prenatal cannabis exposure (PCE) on neurodevelopmental outcomes. While neurodevelopmental cannabis exposure increases the risk of developing affective/mood disorders in adulthood, the precise neuropathophysiological mechanisms in male and female offspring are largely unknown. Given the interconnectivity of the endocannabinoid (ECb) system and the brain&rsquo;s fatty acid pathways, we hypothesized that prenatal exposure to <sup>9</sup>-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) may dysregulate fetal neurodevelopment through alterations of fatty-acid dependent synaptic and neuronal function in the mesolimbic system. To investigate this, pregnant Wistar rats were exposed to vehicle or THC (3 mg/kg) from gestational day (GD)7 until GD22. Anxiety-like, depressive-like, and reward-seeking behavior, electrophysiology, and molecular assays were performed on adult male/female offspring. Imaging of fatty acids using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization imaging mass spectrometry (MALDI IMS) was performed at prepubescence and adulthood. We report that PCE induces behavioral, neuronal, and molecular alterations in the mesolimbic system in male and female offspring, resembling neuropsychiatric endophenotypes. Additionally, PCE resulted in profound dysregulation of critical fatty acid pathways in the developing brain lipidome. Female progeny exhibited significant alterations to fatty acid levels at prepubescence but recovered from these deficits by early adulthood. In contrast, males exhibited persistent fatty acid deficits into adulthood. Moreover, both sexes maintained enduring abnormalities in glutamatergic/GABAergic function in the nucleus accumbens (NAc). These findings identify several novel long-term risks of maternal cannabis use and demonstrate for the first time, sex-related effects of maternal cannabinoid exposure directly in the developing neural lipidome.</p>

     alt="Convergence of bilateral auditory midbrain inputs on neurons in the auditory thalamus of chicken"/><p>In chicken, the nucleus mesencephalicus lateralis pars dorsalis projects to bilateral nucleus ovoidalis (Ov), and ipsilateral projection is stronger than the contralateral one. A subpopulation of Ov neurons receive input from both sides of Ov. 

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>In the avian ascending auditory pathway, the nucleus mesencephalicus lateralis pars dorsalis (MLd; the auditory midbrain center) receives inputs from virtually all lower brainstem auditory nuclei and sends outputs bilaterally to the nucleus ovoidalis (Ov; the auditory thalamic nucleus). Axons from part of the MLd terminate in a particular domain of Ov, thereby suggesting a formation of segregated pathways point-to-point from lower brainstem nuclei via MLd to the thalamus. However, it has not yet been demonstrated whether any spatial clustering of thalamic neurons that receive inputs from specific domains of MLd exists. Ov neurons receive input from bilateral MLds; however, the degree of laterality has not been reported yet. In this study, we injected a recombinant avian adeno-associated virus, a transsynaptic anterograde vector into the MLd of the chick, and analyzed the distribution of labeled postsynaptic neurons on both sides of the Ov. We found that fluorescent protein-labeled neurons on both sides of the Ov were clustered in domains corresponding to subregions of the MLd. The laterality of projections was calculated as the ratio of neurons labeled by comparing ipsilateral to contralateral projections from the MLd, and it was 1.86 on average, thereby indicating a slight ipsilateral projection dominance. Bilateral inputs from different subdomains of the MLd converged on several single Ov neurons, thereby implying a possibility of a de novo binaural processing of the auditory information in the Ov.</p>

                Background: To evaluate functional visceral adipose tissue (VAT) activity assessed by 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) as a predictive factor of metastases in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. Methods: We reviewed study protocols and PET/CT data of 534 CRC patients; 474 patients were subsequently excluded for various reasons. The remaining 60 patients with histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma were then prospectively assessed and were exposed to 18F-FDG PET/CT after a surgical treatment and chemoradiotherapy. Age, histology, stage, and tumor grade data were recorded. Functional VAT activity was verified with maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) using 18F-FDG PET/CT and tested as a predictive factor of later metastases in eight subdomains of abdominal regions (RE – epigastric region, RLH – left hypochondriac region, RRL – right lumbar region, RU – umbilical region, RLL – left lumbar region, RRI – right inguinal region, RP – hypogastric (pubic) region, RLI – left inguinal region) and pelvic cavity (P) in the adjusted regression models. In addition, we studied the best areas under the curve (AUC) for SUVmax with the corresponding sensitivity (Se) and specificity (Sp). Results: In both adjusted for age regression models and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, 18F-FDG accumulation in RLH (cut-off SUVmax 0.74; Se 75%; Sp 61%; AUC 0.668; p=0.049), RU (cut-off SUVmax 0.78; Se 69%; Sp 61%; AUC 0.679; p=0.035), RRL (cut-off SUVmax 1.05; Se 69%; Sp 77%; AUC 0.682; p=0.032) and RRI (cut-off SUVmax 0.85; Se 63%; Sp 61%; AUC 0.672; p=0.043) could predict later metastases in CRC patients, as opposed to age, sex, primary tumor location, tumor grade and histology. Conclusions: Functional VAT activity was importantly related to later metastases in CRC patients and can be used as their predictive factor.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Perception of health care students towards lectures as a teaching and learning method in the COVID era - A multicentric cross-sectional study from India [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                The sudden precipitation of the pandemic forced undergraduates to take refuge at home, deserting the campus. Consequently, the age-old classroom in person teaching-learning (T-L) method shifted and lessons had to be conducted online. In previous decades, archetypical classroom lectures survived a lot of criticism in the face of the quasi-passive nature of T-L  methodology. There are very few studies that reflect undergraduate students' perceptions of lectures. This study aimed to evaluate undergraduate students’ perceptions of lectures using an online questionnaire with 13 items, which was circulated to undergraduate students of medical, physiotherapy, and nursing courses in three settings at different locations of private and public health schools. There was a total of 877 responses. The surveyed students were in favor of lectures and considered them indispensable for undergraduate learning. They preferred it as a kind of organized learning through the teacher’s own experiences. Our study suggests that it is not the ‘lecture’ that requires mending but possibly teachers require better training, application of effective audio-visual aids, and innovative techniques to sustain students' interest in the class.

                Introduction: Overweight and obesity affects over 70% of the UK population and is a major risk factor for the development of co-morbidities, including type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. There now exists a considerable evidence base for the management of obesity. However, this is not the case for the prevention of obesity. Preventing weight gain in periods of life where there is an elevated risk of fat mass expansion could be beneficial to preventing associated diseases in later life. This protocol investigates the impact of novel food ingredient inulin propionate ester (IPE) in the prevention of weight gain. This trial aims to investigate the primary hypothesis that IPE has a superior effect on preventing body weight gain, compared with inulin, in young (<40 years old) adults over 12 months, whilst also investigating several complementary mechanisms that may explain the prevention of weight gain and improved long-term energy balance from consuming IPE.    Methods: In this multi-centre, double-blind, randomised, parallel-group study, eligible participants will be randomly assigned to consume 10g IPE or 10g inulin (control) daily for 12 months. Study visits will be conducted at baseline, two-month, six-month and 12-month time points. The primary outcome is weight gain from baseline to 12 months. Secondary outcomes will examine changes in metabolic and cardiovascular health biomarkers, body composition and appetite. A mechanistic sub-group will explore causal mechanisms around energy balance, body composition, appetite regulation and the gut microbiota. Based on the power calculation, the sample size required is 270 participants or 135 per study group. Ethics and dissemination: The trial protocol and participant-facing documents have been reviewed and approved, by the London Hampstead Ethics Committee (REC Reference 19/LO/0095, 29th January 2019). Upon completion, the trial results will be published in peer-reviewed journals and presented at scientific conferences. Trial registration number: ISRCTN16299902, 1st March 2018.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">(Re)conceptualizing vulnerability in health under the syndemics perspective: protocol for a scoping review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                The concept of vulnerability has been widely used in global health research to assess susceptibility to diseases and disasters in individuals and groups. This perspective has proven to be useful for policy making by bringing attention to the unequal distribution of risks and impacts in specific populations and contexts. However, it is often insufficient to explain interactions between environmental, zoonotic, and social realms involved in the experience of health and disease. Theoretical developments proposed under the syndemics approach have intended to explore this gap by studying the underlying political, economic, and social dynamics affecting the occurrence of overlapping health issues. During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the term syndemics has been used to refer to underlying conditions and social factors impacting disease outcomes. This scoping review aims to explore the contributions of the syndemics perspective to the (re)conceptualization of vulnerability during the COVID-19 pandemic. We intend to do so by identifying social and environmental arrangements so far described in original research, opinion pieces or reviews published since December 2019. Variations in the explanations provided about the role played by socio-environmental dynamics in the observed interactions in populations, settings, and interacting conditions will be subsequently examined. Finally, we will track the contributions and limitations of the syndemics perspective to the study of vulnerability in health in light of the evidence produced around COVID-19.

                Background: Depression and anxiety are disorders related to insomnia that generally affect quality of life, especially if they are related to traumatic events. One of the therapeutic methods that has shown effectiveness in treating depression, anxiety and insomnia associated with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is the visualization method, which is a cognitive behavioral method. The aim of this case study is to investigate the effectiveness of visualization in treating symptoms of depression, anxiety and insomnia associated with posttraumatic experiences. Methods: Sulaiman is a university student who suffered with his family a painful traffic accident, and he has become unable to slee p. This affected his general life, so he became anxious and depressed and had nightmares when sleeping, which lasted for more than a year. He was trained on visualization exercises, including laughter, music, directed visualization, receptive visualization, programmed visualization, and others, which lasted for 17 sessions. Results: The results showed an average improvement of 77.8% for each of the symptoms of anxiety, depression, insomnia, and the number of minutes it takes to fall asleep. The results of the nonparametric test also showed that there were statistically significant differences in the ranks of measures, as it showed z-values for each of insomnia (z= -2.32, p=0.008), depression (z= -2.54, p=0.04), anxiety (z= -3.08, p=0.03), the time taken to enter sleep (z= -2.64, p=0.04), and the time spent asleep (z= -2.44, p=0.02). Conclusions: Sulaiman reported that he became more effective and said that depression, rumination, symptoms of anxiety and stressful thoughts had been reduced to a minimum due to learning more positive alternatives and effective and healthy fantasies.

<p>Monosynaptic tracing analysis demonstrates the direct connectivity of Dmrt3 neurons to proprioceptors and brain centers involved in motor control, suggesting a sensorimotor integrative role for Dmrt3 interneurons in a neuronal path for motion and locomotion.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>In the spinal cord, sensory-motor circuits controlling motor activity are situated in the dorso–ventral interface. The neurons identified by the expression of the transcription factor Doublesex and mab-3 related transcription factor 3 (Dmrt3) have previously been associated with the coordination of locomotion in horses (<i>Equus caballus</i>, Linnaeus, 1758), mice (<i>Mus musculus</i>, Linnaeus, 1758), and zebrafish (<i>Danio rerio</i>, F. Hamilton, 1822). Based on earlier studies, we hypothesized that, in mice, these neurons may be positioned to receive sensory and central inputs to relay processed commands to motor neurons. Thus, we investigated the presynaptic inputs to spinal Dmrt3 neurons using monosynaptic retrograde replication-deficient rabies tracing. The analysis showed that lumbar Dmrt3 neurons receive inputs from intrasegmental neurons, and intersegmental neurons from the cervical, thoracic, and sacral segments. Some of these neurons belong to the excitatory V2a interneurons and to plausible Renshaw cells, defined by the expression of Chx10 and calbindin, respectively. We also found that proprioceptive primary sensory neurons of type Ia2, Ia3, and Ib, defined by the expression of calbindin, calretinin, and Brn3c, respectively, provide presynaptic inputs to spinal Dmrt3 neurons. In addition, we demonstrated that Dmrt3 neurons receive inputs from brain areas involved in motor regulation, including the red nucleus, primary sensory–motor cortex, and pontine nuclei. In conclusion, adult spinal Dmrt3 neurons receive inputs from motor-related brain areas as well as proprioceptive primary sensory neurons and have been shown to connect directly to motor neurons. Dmrt3 neurons are thus positioned to provide sensory–motor control and their connectivity is suggestive of the classical reflex pathways present in the spinal cord.</p>

                Background: Xerostomia is a condition that has been shown to have a negative impact on the quality of life. Thus, exploring the associated risk factors and conditions needs special attention. There is still a lack of complete information regarding this condition among the Saudi population. Methods: In this cross-sectional questionnaire-based survey, 30-70 years old were included. Demographic data with systemic and dental- related history was collected. The presence of xerostomia and the risk factors such as age, sex, history of smoking, history of systemic disease, and medication history are noted. All the results were tabulated and subjected to statistical analysis using SPSS. Results: The prevalence of xerostomia was 42.3%. The prevalence of xerostomia was found to be increasing with age. For gender, xerostomia was significantly higher among women than men (p<0.05). There was a statistically significant association between xerostomia and associated diseases such as gastrointestinal disorders, endocrine disorder, blood diseases, cardiovascular disorders, and allergies (p<0.001). Only 12.5% of participants who had xerostomia were smokers and 44.2% of participants who had xerostomia were  using medications. Conclusions: There is a high prevalence of xerostomia among the Saudi population, with a higher prevalence in the older age group and women. An association between systemic disease and medication history was also noted. Dental practitioners need to be alert to this condition.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">EpiLPS: A fast and flexible Bayesian tool for estimation of the time-varying reproduction number</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Oswaldo Gressani, Jacco Wallinga, Christian L. Althaus, Niel Hens, Christel Faes</p>

In infectious disease epidemiology, the instantaneous reproduction number R t is a time-varying parameter defined as the average number of secondary infections generated by an infected individual at time <i>t</i>. It is therefore a crucial epidemiological statistic that assists public health decision makers in the management of an epidemic. We present a new Bayesian tool (EpiLPS) for robust estimation of the time-varying reproduction number. The proposed methodology smooths the epidemic curve and allows to obtain (approximate) point estimates and credible intervals of R t by employing the renewal equation, using Bayesian P-splines coupled with Laplace approximations of the conditional posterior of the spline vector. Two alternative approaches for inference are presented: (1) an approach based on a maximum a posteriori argument for the model hyperparameters, delivering estimates of R t in only a few seconds; and (2) an approach based on a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) scheme with underlying Langevin dynamics for efficient sampling of the posterior target distribution. Case counts per unit of time are assumed to follow a negative binomial distribution to account for potential overdispersion in the data that would not be captured by a classic Poisson model. Furthermore, after smoothing the epidemic curve, a “plug-in’’ estimate of the reproduction number can be obtained from the renewal equation yielding a closed form expression of R t as a function of the spline parameters. The approach is extremely fast and free of arbitrary smoothing assumptions. EpiLPS is applied on data of SARS-CoV-1 in Hong-Kong (2003), influenza A H1N1 (2009) in the USA and on the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic (2020-2021) for Belgium, Portugal, Denmark and France.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Rapid detection and recognition of whole brain activity in a freely behaving Caenorhabditis elegans</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Yuxiang Wu, Shang Wu, Xin Wang, Chengtian Lang, Quanshi Zhang, Quan Wen, Tianqi Xu</p>

Advanced volumetric imaging methods and genetically encoded activity indicators have permitted a comprehensive characterization of whole brain activity at single neuron resolution in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>. The constant motion and deformation of the nematode nervous system, however, impose a great challenge for consistent identification of densely packed neurons in a behaving animal. Here, we propose a cascade solution for long-term and rapid recognition of head ganglion neurons in a freely moving <i>C. elegans</i>. First, potential neuronal regions from a stack of fluorescence images are detected by a deep learning algorithm. Second, 2-dimensional neuronal regions are fused into 3-dimensional neuron entities. Third, by exploiting the neuronal density distribution surrounding a neuron and relative positional information between neurons, a multi-class artificial neural network transforms engineered neuronal feature vectors into digital neuronal identities. With a small number of training samples, our bottom-up approach is able to process each volume—1024 × 1024 × 18 in voxels—in less than 1 second and achieves an accuracy of 91% in neuronal detection and above 80% in neuronal tracking over a long video recording. Our work represents a step towards rapid and fully automated algorithms for decoding whole brain activity underlying naturalistic behaviors.

                <p>by Behzad D. Karkaria, Angelika Manhart, Alex J. H. Fedorec, Chris P. Barnes</p>

Predictability is a fundamental requirement in biological engineering. As we move to building coordinated multicellular systems, the potential for such systems to display chaotic behaviour becomes a concern. Therefore understanding which systems show chaos is an important design consideration. We developed a methodology to explore the potential for chaotic dynamics in small microbial communities governed by resource competition, intercellular communication and competitive bacteriocin interactions. Our model selection pipeline uses Approximate Bayesian Computation to first identify oscillatory behaviours as a route to finding chaotic behaviour. We have shown that we can expect to find chaotic states in relatively small synthetic microbial systems, understand the governing dynamics and provide insights into how to control such systems. This work is the first to query the existence of chaotic behaviour in synthetic microbial communities and has important ramifications for the fields of biotechnology, bioprocessing and synthetic biology.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Multiple bumps can enhance robustness to noise in continuous attractor networks</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Raymond Wang, Louis Kang</p>

A central function of continuous attractor networks is encoding coordinates and accurately updating their values through path integration. To do so, these networks produce localized bumps of activity that move coherently in response to velocity inputs. In the brain, continuous attractors are believed to underlie grid cells and head direction cells, which maintain periodic representations of position and orientation, respectively. These representations can be achieved with any number of activity bumps, and the consequences of having more or fewer bumps are unclear. We address this knowledge gap by constructing 1D ring attractor networks with different bump numbers and characterizing their responses to three types of noise: fluctuating inputs, spiking noise, and deviations in connectivity away from ideal attractor configurations. Across all three types, networks with more bumps experience less noise-driven deviations in bump motion. This translates to more robust encodings of linear coordinates, like position, assuming that each neuron represents a fixed length no matter the bump number. Alternatively, we consider encoding a circular coordinate, like orientation, such that the network distance between adjacent bumps always maps onto 360 degrees. Under this mapping, bump number does not significantly affect the amount of error in the coordinate readout. Our simulation results are intuitively explained and quantitatively matched by a unified theory for path integration and noise in multi-bump networks. Thus, to suppress the effects of biologically relevant noise, continuous attractor networks can employ more bumps when encoding linear coordinates; this advantage disappears when encoding circular coordinates. Our findings provide motivation for multiple bumps in the mammalian grid network.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Credibility assessment of patient-specific computational modeling using patient-specific cardiac modeling as an exemplar</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Suran Galappaththige, Richard A. Gray, Caroline Mendonca Costa, Steven Niederer, Pras Pathmanathan</p>

Reliable and robust simulation of individual patients using patient-specific models (PSMs) is one of the next frontiers for modeling and simulation (M&S) in healthcare. PSMs, which form the basis of digital twins, can be employed as clinical tools to, for example, assess disease state, predict response to therapy, or optimize therapy. They may also be used to construct virtual cohorts of patients, for <i>in silico</i> evaluation of medical product safety and/or performance. Methods and frameworks have recently been proposed for evaluating the credibility of M&S in healthcare applications. However, such efforts have generally been motivated by models of medical devices or generic patient models; how best to evaluate the credibility of PSMs has largely been unexplored. The aim of this paper is to understand and demonstrate the credibility assessment process for PSMs using patient-specific cardiac electrophysiological (EP) modeling as an exemplar. We first review approaches used to generate cardiac PSMs and consider how verification, validation, and uncertainty quantification (VVUQ) apply to cardiac PSMs. Next, we execute two simulation studies using a publicly available virtual cohort of 24 patient-specific ventricular models, the first a multi-patient verification study, the second investigating the impact of uncertainty in personalized and non-personalized inputs in a virtual cohort. We then use the findings from our analyses to identify how important characteristics of PSMs can be considered when assessing credibility with the approach of the ASME V&V40 Standard, accounting for PSM concepts such as inter- and intra-user variability, multi-patient and “every-patient” error estimation, uncertainty quantification in personalized vs non-personalized inputs, clinical validation, and others. The results of this paper will be useful to developers of cardiac and other medical image based PSMs, when assessing PSM credibility.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Probabilistic edge weights fine-tune Boolean network dynamics</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Dávid Deritei, Nina Kunšič, Péter Csermely</p>

Biological systems are noisy by nature. This aspect is reflected in our experimental measurements and should be reflected in the models we build to better understand these systems. Noise can be especially consequential when trying to interpret specific regulatory interactions, i.e. regulatory network edges. In this paper, we propose a method to explicitly encode edge-noise in Boolean dynamical systems by probabilistic edge-weight (PEW) operators. PEW operators have two important features: first, they introduce a form of edge-weight into Boolean models through the noise, second, the noise is dependent on the dynamical state of the system, which enables more biologically meaningful modeling choices. Moreover, we offer a simple-to-use implementation in the already well-established BooleanNet framework. In two application cases, we show how the introduction of just a few PEW operators in Boolean models can fine-tune the emergent dynamics and increase the accuracy of qualitative predictions. This includes fine-tuning interactions which cause non-biological behaviors when switching between asynchronous and synchronous update schemes in dynamical simulations. Moreover, PEW operators also open the way to encode more exotic cellular dynamics, such as cellular learning, and to implementing edge-weights for regulatory networks inferred from omics data.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Structured random receptive fields enable informative sensory encodings</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Biraj Pandey, Marius Pachitariu, Bingni W. Brunton, Kameron Decker Harris</p>

Brains must represent the outside world so that animals survive and thrive. In early sensory systems, neural populations have diverse receptive fields structured to detect important features in inputs, yet significant variability has been ignored in classical models of sensory neurons. We model neuronal receptive fields as random, variable samples from parameterized distributions and demonstrate this model in two sensory modalities using data from insect mechanosensors and mammalian primary visual cortex. Our approach leads to a significant theoretical connection between the foundational concepts of receptive fields and random features, a leading theory for understanding artificial neural networks. The modeled neurons perform a randomized wavelet transform on inputs, which removes high frequency noise and boosts the signal. Further, these random feature neurons enable learning from fewer training samples and with smaller networks in artificial tasks. This structured random model of receptive fields provides a unifying, mathematically tractable framework to understand sensory encodings across both spatial and temporal domains.

Large programs of dynamic gene expression, like cell cyles and circadian rhythms, are controlled by a relatively small “core” network of transcription factors and post-translational modifiers, working in concerted mutual regulation. Recent work suggests that system-independent, quantitative features of the dynamics of gene expression can be used to identify core regulators. We introduce an approach of iterative network hypothesis reduction from time-series data in which increasingly complex features of the dynamic expression of individual, pairs, and entire collections of genes are used to infer functional network models that can produce the observed transcriptional program. The culmination of our work is a computational pipeline, Iterative Network Hypothesis Reduction from Temporal Dynamics (Inherent dynamics pipeline), that provides a priority listing of targets for genetic perturbation to experimentally infer network structure. We demonstrate the capability of this integrated computational pipeline on synthetic and yeast cell-cycle data.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Obsessive-compulsive disorder is characterized by decreased Pavlovian influence on instrumental behavior</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Ziwen Peng, Luning He, Rongzhen Wen, Tom Verguts, Carol A. Seger, Qi Chen</p>

Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is characterized by uncontrollable repetitive actions thought to rely on abnormalities within fundamental instrumental learning systems. We investigated cognitive and computational mechanisms underlying Pavlovian biases on instrumental behavior in both clinical OCD patients and healthy controls using a Pavlovian-Instrumental Transfer (PIT) task. PIT is typically evidenced by increased responding in the presence of a positive (previously rewarded) Pavlovian cue, and reduced responding in the presence of a negative cue. Thirty OCD patients and thirty-one healthy controls completed the Pavlovian Instrumental Transfer test, which included instrumental training, Pavlovian training for positive, negative and neutral cues, and a PIT phase in which participants performed the instrumental task in the presence of the Pavlovian cues. Modified Rescorla-Wagner models were fitted to trial-by-trial data of participants to estimate underlying computational mechanism and quantify individual differences during training and transfer stages. Bayesian hierarchical methods were used to estimate free parameters and compare the models. Behavioral and computational results indicated a weaker Pavlovian influence on instrumental behavior in OCD patients than in HC, especially for negative Pavlovian cues. Our results contrast with the increased PIT effects reported for another set of disorders characterized by compulsivity, substance use disorders, in which PIT is enhanced. A possible reason for the reduced PIT in OCD may be impairment in using the contextual information provided by the cues to appropriately adjust behavior, especially when inhibiting responding when a negative cue is present. This study provides deeper insight into our understanding of deficits in OCD from the perspective of Pavlovian influences on instrumental behavior and may have implications for OCD treatment modalities focused on reducing compulsive behaviors.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">The inner nuclear membrane protein NEMP1 supports nuclear envelope openings and enucleation of erythroblasts</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Didier Hodzic, Jun Wu, Karen Krchma, Andrea Jurisicova, Yonit Tsatskis, Yijie Liu, Peng Ji, Kyunghee Choi, Helen McNeill</p>

Nuclear envelope membrane proteins (NEMPs) are a conserved family of nuclear envelope (NE) proteins that reside within the inner nuclear membrane (INM). Even though <i>Nemp1</i> knockout (KO) mice are overtly normal, they display a pronounced splenomegaly. This phenotype and recent reports describing a requirement for NE openings during erythroblasts terminal maturation led us to examine a potential role for Nemp1 in erythropoiesis. Here, we report that <i>Nemp1</i> KO mice show peripheral blood defects, anemia in neonates, ineffective erythropoiesis, splenomegaly, and stress erythropoiesis. The erythroid lineage of <i>Nemp1</i> KO mice is overrepresented until the pronounced apoptosis of polychromatophilic erythroblasts. We show that NEMP1 localizes to the NE of erythroblasts and their progenitors. Mechanistically, we discovered that NEMP1 accumulates into aggregates that localize near or at the edge of NE openings and <i>Nemp1</i> deficiency leads to a marked decrease of both NE openings and ensuing enucleation. Together, our results for the first time demonstrate that NEMP1 is essential for NE openings and erythropoietic maturation in vivo and provide the first mouse model of defective erythropoiesis directly linked to the loss of an INM protein.

Developing tissues can self-organize into a variety of patterned structures through the stabilization of stochastic fluctuations in their molecular and cellular properties. While molecular factors and cell dynamics contributing to self-organization have been identified in vivo, events channeling self-organized systems such that they achieve stable pattern outcomes remain unknown. Here, we described natural variation in the fidelity of self-organized arrays formed by feather follicle precursors in bird embryos. By surveying skin cells prior to and during tissue self-organization and performing species-specific ex vivo drug treatments and mechanical stress tests, we demonstrated that pattern fidelity depends on the initial amplitude of cell anisotropy in regions of the developing dermis competent to produce a pattern. Using live imaging, we showed that cell shape anisotropy is associated with a limited increase in cell motility for sharp and precisely located primordia formation, and thus, proper pattern geometry. These results evidence a mechanism through which initial tissue properties ensure stability in self-organization and thus, reproducible pattern production.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">A genome-wide screen identifies SCAI as a modulator of the UV-induced replicative stress response</a></h4>

Ronato, Yuandi Gao, François Bélanger, Sari Gezzar-Dandashi, Aimé Boris Kimenyi Ishimwe, Christina Sawchyn, Dominique Lévesque, Mary McQuaid, François-Michel Boisvert, Frédérick A.

Helix-destabilizing DNA lesions induced by environmental mutagens such as UV light cause genomic instability by strongly blocking the progression of DNA replication forks (RFs). At blocked RF, single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) accumulates and is rapidly bound by Replication Protein A (RPA) complexes. Such stretches of RPA-ssDNA constitute platforms for recruitment/activation of critical factors that promote DNA synthesis restart. However, during periods of severe replicative stress, RPA availability may become limiting due to inordinate sequestration of this multifunctional complex on ssDNA, thereby negatively impacting multiple vital RPA-dependent processes. Here, we performed a genome-wide screen to identify factors that restrict the accumulation of RPA-ssDNA during UV-induced replicative stress. While this approach revealed some expected “hits” acting in pathways such as nucleotide excision repair, translesion DNA synthesis, and the intra-S phase checkpoint, it also identified SCAI, whose role in the replicative stress response was previously unappreciated. Upon UV exposure, SCAI knock-down caused elevated accumulation of RPA-ssDNA during S phase, accompanied by reduced cell survival and compromised RF progression. These effects were independent of the previously reported role of SCAI in 53BP1-dependent DNA double-strand break repair. We also found that SCAI is recruited to UV-damaged chromatin and that its depletion promotes nascent DNA degradation at stalled RF. Finally, we (i) provide evidence that EXO1 is the major nuclease underlying ssDNA formation and DNA replication defects in SCAI knockout cells and, consistent with this, (ii) demonstrate that SCAI inhibits EXO1 activity on a ssDNA gap in vitro. Taken together, our data establish SCAI as a novel regulator of the UV-induced replicative stress response in human cells.

                Background: Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) and Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) are both as classified blood-borne viruses since they are transmitted through contact with contaminated blood. Approximately 1.3 million of the 2.75 million global HIV/HCV carriers inject drugs (PWID). HIV co-infection has a harmful effect on the progression of HCV, resulting in greater rates of HCV persistence after acute infection, higher viral levels, and accelerated progression of liver fibrosis and end-stage liver disease. In this study, we developed and investigated a mathematical model for the dynamical behavior of HIV/AIDS and HCV co-infection, which includes therapy for both diseases, vertical transmission in HIV cases, unawareness and awareness of HIV infection, inefficient HIV treatment follow-up, and efficient condom use. Methods: Positivity and boundedness of the model under investigation were established using well-known theorems. The equilibria were demonstrated by bringing all differential equations to zero. The associative reproduction numbers for mono-infected and dual-infected models were calculated using the next-generation matrix approach. The local and global stabilities of the models were validated using the linearization and comparison theorem and the negative criterion techniques of bendixson and dulac, respectively. Results: The growing prevalence of HIV treatment dropout in each compartment of the HIV model led to a reduction in HIV on treatment compartments while other compartments exhibited an increase in populations. In dually infected patients, treating HCV first reduces co-infection reproduction number Rech, which reduces liver cancer risk. Conclusions: From the model's results, we infer various steps that policymakers could take to reduce the number of mono-infected and co-infected individuals.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Machine learning (ML) algorithms have emerged as powerful predictive tools in the field stroke. Here, we examine the predictive accuracy of ML models for predicting functional outcomes using 24-hour post-treatment characteristics in the Systematic Evaluation of Patients Treated With Neurothrombectomy Devices for Acute Ischemic Stroke (STRATIS) Registry.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>ML models, adaptive boost, random forest (RF), classification and regression tree (CART), C5.0 decision tree (C5.0), support vector machine (SVM), least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), and logistic regression (LR), and traditional LR models were used to predict 90-day functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale score 0-2). Twenty-four-hour National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) was examined as a continuous or dichotomous variable in all models. Model accuracy was assessed using the area under characteristic curve (AUC).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The 24-Hour NIHSS score was a top-predictor of functional outcome in all models. ML models using the continuous 24-hour NIHSS scored showed moderate-to-good predictive performance (range mean AUC:0.76-0.92); however, RF (AUC:0.92±0.028) outperformed all ML models, except LASSO (AUC:0.89±0.023, p=0.0958). Importantly, RF demonstrated a significantly higher predictive value than LR (AUC:0.87±0.031, p=0.048) and traditional LR (AUC:85±0.06, p=0.035) when utilizing the 24-hour continuous NIHSS score. Predictive accuracy was similar between the 24-hour NIHSS score dichotomous and continuous ML models.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>In this substudy, we found similar predictive accuracy for functional outcome when utilizing the 24-hr NIHSS score as a continuous or dichotomous variable in ML models. ML models had moderate-to-good predictive accuracy, with RF outperforming LR models. External validation of these ML models is warranted.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">MRI images implicate glymphatic alterations mediate cognitive dysfunction in AD</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The glymphatic system cleans amyloid and tau proteins from the brain in animal studies of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, there is no direct evidence showing this in humans.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Participants (n = 50; 62.6 ± 5.4 years; 36 women) with AD and normal controls (NCs) underwent amyloid positron emission tomography (PET), tau PET, structural T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging and neuropsychological evaluation. Whole-brain glymphatic activity was measured by diffusion tensor image analysis along the perivascular space (DTI-ALPS).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>ALPS-indexes showed negative correlations with deposition of amyloid and tau on PET images and positive correlations with cognitive scores even after adjusting for age, sex, years of education, and APOE4 genotype covariates in multiple AD-related brain regions (all Ps &lt; 0.05). Mediation analysis showed that ALPS-index acted as a significant mediator between regional standardized uptake value ratios (SUVRs) of amyloid and tau images and cognitive dysfunction even after correcting for multiple covariates in AD-related brain regions. These regions are responsible for attention, memory and executive function, which are vulnerable to sleep deprivation.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Glymphatic system activity may act as a significant mediator in AD-related cognitive dysfunction even after adjusting for multiple covariates and gray matter volumes. ALPS-index may provide useful disease progression or treatment biomarkers for patients with AD as an indicator of modulation of glymphatic activity.</p>

                The purpose of this case report was to demonstrate the efficacy of Tocilizumab in the treatment of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in obese patients who presented with a week's history of fever and one day of shortness of breath (SOB). It is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2). COVID-19 has rapidly spread throughout the world, resulting in a global pandemic. Severe COVID-19 causes proinflammatory cytokine release and is associated with a high morbidity and mortality rate. Furthermore, obesity is an independent risk factor for developing severe COVID-19 complications with a high mortality. Stopping this cascade early in the disease's progression has resulted in a significant improvement in outcome. Tocilizumab in conjunction with systemic corticosteroids as part of the standard of care for halting pro-inflammatory cytokine cascades in early disease courses and prone positioning has been shown to improve respiratory parameters while also reducing the need for mechanical ventilation and Intensive Care Unit (ICU) stay (14 days as in our case).

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Case Report: Localized Ewing’s sarcoma of the scapula in an adult [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Ewing’s sarcoma (ES) of the scapula is a rare entity. It is often discovered late at the metastatic stage of the disease because of its deep location. This neoplasm is common in children and adolescents. We present the first reported case of a localized Ewing’s sarcoma of the scapula in an adult over 40 years-old. Case presentation: A 48-year-old man presented with left shoulder pain evolving for one year. Physical examination showed a painful, ill-defined swelling of the left shoulder measuring 5 x 3 cm. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed showing a mass of the left scapula invading the soft tissues of the shoulder suggestive of a sarcoma. The patient underwent a surgical biopsy finding an ES of the scapula with no secondary localization on the computerized tomography (CT) scan nor on the bone scintigraphy. Neo-adjuvant multiagent chemotherapy was started obtaining a total response. Therefore, the patient underwent a total left scapulectomy. Histopathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of ES with a complete response to chemotherapy. Adjuvant chemotherapy was then indicated. After 3 years of follow-up, no local or distant recurrence was found. Discussion: ES is a high-grade aggressive lesion that most commonly originates in bone. The ES may affect any bone but is frequent in femur, tibia and ilium, the tumors arising from the scapula comprise fewer than 4% of all ES. No cases of localized Ewing’s sarcoma in adults have been reported to our knowledge. The diagnosis is confirmed by immunohistochemical examination and cytogenic. A multimodal treatment approach including a combination of chemotherapy, surgery, and radiation can modestly improve local tumor outcomes. Metastatic tumors still have poor diagnosis. Conclusions: ES occurs rarely in adults greater than 20 years-old, and tumors localized in the scapula are even rarer. Histopathology differentiates it from other primary bone/soft tissues tumors.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Surfing Corona waves – instead of breaking them: Rethinking the role of natural immunity in COVID-19 policy [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Current COVID-19 response policies have aimed to break Corona waves through non-pharmaceutical interventions and mass vaccination. However, for long-term strategies to be effective and efficient, and to avoid massive disruption and social harms, it is crucial to introduce the role of natural immunity in our thinking about COVID-19 control and prevention. We argue that any Corona control policy must appropriately balance five key elements simultaneously: balancing the various fundamental interests of the nation, as well as the various interventions within the health sector; tailoring the prevention measures and treatments to individual needs; limiting social interaction restrictions; and balancing the role of vaccinations against the role of naturally induced immunity. Given the high infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 and its differential impact on population segments, we examine this last element in more detail and argue that an important aspect of ‘living with the virus’ will be to better understand the role of naturally induced immunity in our overall COVID-19 policy response. In our eyes, a policy approach that factors natural immunity should be considered for persons without major comorbidities and those having ‘encountered’ the antigen in the past.

     alt="Neuronal density and expression of calcium-binding proteins across the layers of the superior colliculus in the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus)"/>
<p>Using stereological sampling, we demonstrate that neuronal density decreases across layers of the superior colliculus in marmoset monkeys. Neuronal density in this structure tends to be lower at rostral levels, compared to caudal levels. Neurons expressing different calcium-binding proteins (calbindin, calretinin, and parvalbumin) display variable gradients of density across layers in the superior colliculus. Calbindin- and calretinin-expressing neurons show markedly higher densities in the upper layers, while the distribution of parvalbumin-expressing neurons is more uniform.

</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The superior colliculus (SC) is a layered midbrain structure with functions that include polysensory and sensorimotor integration. Here, we describe the distribution of different immunohistochemically identified classes of neurons in the SC of adult marmoset monkeys (<i>Callithrix jacchus</i>). Neuronal nuclei (NeuN) staining was used to determine the overall neuronal density in the different SC layers. In addition, we studied the distribution of neurons expressing different calcium-binding proteins (calbindin [CB], parvalbumin [PV] and calretinin [CR]). Our results indicate that neuronal density in the SC decreases from superficial to deep layers. Although the neuronal density within the same layer varies little across the mediolateral axis, it tends to be lower at rostral levels, compared to caudal levels. Cells expressing different calcium-binding proteins display differential gradients of density according to depth. Both CB- and CR-expressing neurons show markedly higher densities in the stratum griseum superficiale (SGS), compared to the stratum opticum and intermediate and deep layers. However, CR-expressing neurons are twice as common as CB-expressing neurons outside the SGS. The distribution of PV-expressing cells follows a shallow density gradient from superficial to deep layers. When normalized relative to total neuronal density, the proportion of CR-expressing neurons increases between the superficial and intermediate layers, whereas that of CB-expressing neurons declines toward the deep layers. The proportion of PV-expressing neurons remains constant across layers. Our data provide layer-specific and accurate estimates of neuronal density, which may be important for the generation of biophysical models of how the primate SC transforms sensory inputs into motor signals.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The olfactory placode (OP) of vertebrates generates several classes of migrating cells, including hypothalamic gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH)-producing neurons, which play essential roles in the reproduction system. Previous studies using OP cell labeling have demonstrated that OP-derived non-GnRH cells enter the developing forebrain; however, their final fates and phenotypes are less well understood. In chick embryos, a subpopulation of migratory cells from the OP that is distinct from GnRH neurons transiently expresses somatostatin (SS). We postulated that these cells are destined to develop into brain neurons. In this study, we examined the expression pattern of SS mRNA in the olfactory-forebrain region during development, as well as the destination of OP-derived migratory cells, including SS mRNA-expressing cells. Utilizing the Tol2 genomic integration system to induce long-term fluorescent protein expression in OP cells, we found that OP-derived migratory cells labeled at embryonic day (E) 3 resided in the olfactory nerve and medial forebrain at E17–19. A subpopulation of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-labeled GnRH neurons that remained in the olfactory nerve was considered to comprise terminal nerve neurons. In the forebrain, GFP-labeled cells showed a distribution pattern similar to that of GnRH neurons. A large proportion of GFP-labeled cells expressed the mature neuronal marker NeuN. Among the GFP-labeled cells, the percentage of GnRH neurons was low, while the remaining GnRH-negative neurons either expressed SS mRNA, neuropeptide Y, or calbindin D-28k or did not express any of them. These results indicate that a diverse population of OP-derived neuronal cells, other than GnRH neurons, integrates into the chick medial forebrain.</p>

     alt="Localization of chemical synapses and modulatory release sites in the cardiac ganglion of the crab, Cancer borealis"/>
<p>The crustacean cardiac ganglion is a heavily modulated nine-neuron central pattern generator. We describe the distribution of chemical synapses and several neuromodulators within this system, which includes unusual clusters of synapsin-like immunoreactivity surrounding motor neuron cell bodies. These putative synapses near somata colocalize with many neuromodulators including the excitatory peptide proctolin (shown).

<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The crustacean cardiac ganglion (CG) comprises nine neurons that provide rhythmic drive to the heart. The CG is the direct target of multiple modulators. Synapsin-like immunoreactivity was found clustered around the somata of the large cells (LC) and in a neuropil at the anterior branch of the CG trunk of <i>Cancer borealis</i>. This implicates the soma as a key site of synaptic integration, an unusual configuration in invertebrates. Proctolin is an excitatory neuromodulator of the CG, and proctolin-like immunoreactivity exhibited partial overlap with putative chemical synapses near the LCs and at the neuropil. A proctolin-like projection was also found in a pair of excitatory nerves entering the CG. GABA-like immunoreactivity was nearly completely colocalized with chemical synapses near the LCs but absent at the anterior branch neuropil. GABA-like projections were found in a pair of inhibitory nerves entering the CG. <i>C. borealis</i> Allatostatin B1 (CbASTB), red pigment concentrating hormone, and FLRFamide-like immunoreactivity each had a unique pattern of staining and co-localization with putative chemical synapses. These results provide morphological evidence that synaptic input is integrated at LC somata in the CG. Our findings provide a topographical organization for some of the multiple inhibitory and excitatory modulators that alter the rhythmic output of this semi-autonomous motor circuit.</p>

<h2>Graphical Abstract</h2>
<p>The large black beetle, the chafer <i>Holotrichia parallela</i>, shows a unique ca. 48-h endogenous rhythm (viz., a circabidian rhythm) in appearance on the ground. The ecological significance and the molecular mechanism remain obscure, but a previous study implied that the circadian clock system is responsible for the 2-day rhythm. In the present study, we investigated neuropeptide pigment-dispersing factor-immunoreactive (PDF-ir) neurons in the brain of <i>H. parallela</i> in order to search for circadian neural components since PDF is a well-known output neuromodulator of circadian pacemakers in several insects. We anatomically identified ∼ 100 PDF-ir cells near the accessory medulla (AME) in the optic lobe, which is a site for circadian pacemakers in the cockroach and flies, and furthermore, we found that their varicose terminal arbors in the lateral protocerebrum form output synapses upon unknown fibers as well as other PDF-ir fibers. Their conceivable function in the circabidian rhythm was discussed based on the anatomical insights.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Pigment-dispersing factor (PDF) is a well-known output neuropeptide modulator of circadian pacemakers in insects. Here, we investigated PDF-immunoreactive (ir) neurons in the brain of the large black chafer <i>Holotrichia parallela</i> to search for circadian neural components, which are potentially involved in its circabidian rhythm. PDF-ir cells were exclusively detected near the accessory medulla (AME) as a cluster of ∼ 100 cells with almost homogeneous size. No other cells exhibited immunoreactivity. The PDF-ir cells send beaded fibers into the proximal half of the AME and ventral elongation in an anterior region between the medulla (ME) and lobula (LO). Neither the lamina, ME, LO, nor lobula plate receives PDF-ir fibers. Primary axons derived from the PDF-ir cells extend toward the contralateral hemisphere through the dorsolateral protocerebrum anterior to the calyx to connect the bilateral AME. The axons form varicose outgrowths exclusively in the lateral protocerebrum. Double labeling with antisynapsin revealed partial overlaps between PDF-ir varicosities and synapsin-ir puncta. Thus, it was assumed that the PDF-ir fibers form output synapses there. To verify this, we investigated the ultrastructure of the PDF-ir varicosities in the lateral protocerebrum by preembedding immunoelectron microscopy. The PDF-ir profiles contain small clear synaptic vesicles as well as both PDF-positive and PDF-negative dense-core vesicles, and the profiles form output synapses upon unknown profiles and receive synapses from other PDF-ir profiles. PDF neurons near the AME are considered to be prominent circadian pacemakers in the cockroach and flies. Their possible function in the circabidian rhythm was discussed based on these anatomical insights.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that is ultimately fatal. Currently, millions of Americans are living with AD, and this number is predicted to grow with increases in the aging population. Interestingly, despite the prevalence of AD in human populations, the full AD phenotype has not been observed in any nonhuman primate (NHP) species, and it has been suggested that NHPs are immune to neurodegenerative diseases such as AD.</p>
<p>Here, we review the typical age-related changes and pathologies in humans along with the neuropathologic changes associated with AD, and we place this information in the context of the comparative neuropathology of NHPs. We further propose the use of induced pluripotent stem cell technology as a way of addressing initial molecular processes and changes that occur in neurons and glia (in both humans and NHPs) when exposed to AD-inducing pathology prior to cell death.</p>

<p>Kersten et al. present a brain atlas of the carrion crow, <i>Corvus corone</i>, a corvid songbird.

This atlas will help to compare avian species and guide future neurobiological studies of corvids.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Corvidae, passerine songbirds such as jays, crows, and ravens known as corvids, have become model systems for the study of avian cognition. The superior cognitive capabilities of corvids mainly emerge from a disproportionally large telencephalon found in these species. However, a systematic mapping of the neuroanatomy of the corvid brain, and the telencephalon in particular, is lacking so far. Here, we present a brain atlas of the carrion crow, <i>Corvus corone</i>, with special emphasis on the telencephalic pallium. We applied four staining techniques to brain slices (Nissl, myelin, combination of Nissl and myelin, and tyrosine hydroxylase targeting catecholaminergic neurons). This allowed us to identify brain nuclei throughout the brain and delineate the known pallial subdivisions termed hyperpallium, entopallium, mesopallium, nidopallium, arcopallium, and hippocampal complex. The extent of these subdivisions and brain nuclei are described according to stereotaxic coordinates. In addition, 3D depictions of pallial regions were reconstructed from these slices. While the overall organization of the carrion crow's brain matches other songbird brains, the relative proportions and expansions of associative pallial areas differ considerably in agreement with enhanced cognitive skills found in corvids. The presented global organization of the crow brain in stereotaxic coordinates will help to guide future neurobiological studies in corvids.</p>

     alt="Small sensory spinal lesions that affect hand function in monkeys greatly alter primary afferent and motor neuron connections in the cord"/><p>The segmental organization of primate spinal cord differs depending on modality, and these modalities are differentially affected by spinal cord injury. Sensory inputs from the hand have a widespread input range which span 10 segments of cervical and thoracic cord. These inputs are drastically reduced by a dorsal root/dorsal column lesion (DRL/DCL) affecting digits 1-3 of one hand. In contrast, digit related motor neurons (MNs) have a tight distribution across only 2 spinal segments, and their numbers are unaffected by a DRL/DCL. However, individual synaptic inputs to motor neurons are altered which means that even focal sensory injuries to the spinal cord can have a profound effect on motor output.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Small sensory spinal injuries induce plasticity across the neuraxis, but little is understood about their effect on segmental connections or motor neuron (MN) function. Here, we begin to address this at two levels. First, we compared afferent input distributions from the skin and muscles of the digits with corresponding MN pools to determine their spatial relationship, in both the normal state and 4–6 months after a unilateral dorsal root/dorsal column lesion (DRL/DCL), affecting digits 1–3. Second, we looked at specific changes to MN inputs and membrane properties that likely impact functional recovery. Monkeys received a targeted unilateral DRL/DCL, and 4–6 months later, cholera toxin subunit B (CT-B) was injected bilaterally into either the distal pads of digits 1–3, or related intrinsic hand muscles, to label inputs to the cord, and corresponding MNs. In controls (unlesioned side), cutaneous and proprioceptive afferents from digits 1–3 showed different distribution patterns but similar rostrocaudal spread within the dorsal horn from C1 to T2. In contrast, MNs were distributed across just two segments (C7–8). Following the lesion, sensory inputs were significantly diminished across all 10 segments, though this did not alter MN distributions. Afferent and monoamine inputs, as well as KCC2 cotransporters, were also significantly altered on the cell membrane of CT-B labeled MNs postlesion. In contrast, inhibitory neurotransmission and perineuronal net integrity were not altered at this prechronic timepoint.  Our findings indicate that even a small sensory injury can significantly impact sensory and motor spinal neurons and provide new insight into the complex process of recovery.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Depression is one of the most common mental illnesses and seriously affects all aspects of life. Running exercise has been suggested to prevent or alleviate the occurrence and development of depression; however, the underlying mechanisms of these effects remain unclear. Independent studies have indicated that astrocytes play essential roles and that the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is an important brain region involved in the pathology underlying depression. However, it is unknown whether running exercise achieves antidepressant effects by affecting the number of astrocytes and glutamate transport function in the mPFC. Here, animal models of depression were established using chronic unpredictable stress (CUS), and depression-like behavior was assessed by the sucrose preference test. After successfully establishing the depression model, experimental animals performed running exercise. Glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive (GFAP<sup>+</sup>) cell number in the mPFC was precisely quantified using immunohistochemical and stereological methods<span style="text-decoration:underline">,</span> and the densities of bromodeoxyuridine-positive (BrdU<sup>+</sup>) and BrdU<sup>+</sup>/GFAP<sup>+</sup> cells in the mPFC were measured using a semiquantitative immunofluorescence assay. Changes in glutamate transporter gene expression in mPFC astrocytes were detected by mRNA sequencing and qRT–PCR. We found that running exercise reversed CUS-induced decreases in sucrose preference, increased astrocyte number and the density of newborn astrocytes, and reversed decreases in gene expression levels of GFAP, S100b, and the glutamate transporters GLT-1 and GLAST in the mPFC of CUS animals. These results suggested that changes in astrocyte number and glutamate transporter function may be potential meditators of the effects of running exercise in the treatment of depression.</p>

     alt="Analysis of the distribution of vagal afferent projections from different peripheral organs to the nucleus of the solitary tract in rats"/>
<p>We injected retrograde pseudotyped adeno-associated viruses into different peripheral organs and mapped the axonal projections of vagal viscerosensory neurons within the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS). We observed no obvious viscerotopy, with axons from different organs overlapping in NTS subnuclei and with NTS neurons of different neurochemical phenotype. The implications for deciphering this viscerosensory code are discussed.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Anatomical tracing studies examining the vagal system can conflate details of sensory afferent and motor efferent neurons. Here, we used a serotype of adeno-associated virus that transports retrogradely and exhibits selective tropism for vagal afferents, to map their soma location and central termination sites within the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS). We examined the vagal sensory afferents innervating the trachea, duodenum, stomach, or heart, and in some animals, from two organs concurrently. We observed no obvious somatotopy in the somata distribution within the nodose ganglion. The central termination patterns of afferents from different organs within the NTS overlap substantially. Convergence of vagal afferent inputs from different organs onto single NTS neurons is observed. Abdominal and thoracic afferents terminate throughout the NTS, including in the rostral NTS, where the 7th cranial nerve inputs are known to synapse. To address whether the axonal labeling produced by viral transduction is so widespread because it fills axons traveling to their targets, and not just terminal fields, we labeled pre and postsynaptic elements of vagal afferents in the NTS . Vagal afferents form multiple putative synapses as they course through the NTS, with each vagal afferent neuron distributing sensory signals to multiple second-order NTS neurons. We observe little selectivity between vagal afferents from different visceral targets and NTS neurons with common neurochemical phenotypes, with afferents from different organs making close appositions with the same NTS neuron. We conclude that specific viscerosensory information is distributed widely within the NTS and that the coding of this input is probably determined by the intrinsic properties and projections of the second-order neuron.</p>

                Large-scale neuroimaging datasets allow deep learning methods to be practical for medical imaging research. However, their success is limited to specific tasks and data domains. Dinsdale et al. explore the challenges of data availability, interpretability and trust, evaluation, and logistics.

Evidence for why this happens offers a surprising perspective on how evolution helps to maintain colour variations.

                The most common cause of human congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG) are mutations in the phosphomannomutase gene <i>PMM2</i>, which affect protein <i>N</i>-linked glycosylation. The yeast gene <i>SEC53</i> encodes a homolog of human <i>PMM2</i>. We evolved 384 populations of yeast harboring one of two human-disease-associated alleles, <i>sec53-</i>V238M and <i>sec53</i>-F126L, or wild-type <i>SEC53</i>. We find that after 1,000 generations, most populations compensate for the slow-growth phenotype associated with the <i>sec53</i> human-disease-associated alleles. Through whole-genome sequencing we identify compensatory mutations, including known <i>SEC53</i> genetic interactors. We observe an enrichment of compensatory mutations in other genes whose human homologs are associated with Type 1 CDG, including <i>PGM1</i>, which encodes the minor isoform of phosphoglucomutase in yeast. By genetic reconstruction, we show that evolved <i>pgm1</i> mutations are dominant and allele-specific genetic interactors that restore both protein glycosylation and growth of yeast harboring the <i>sec53</i>-V238M allele. Finally, we characterize the enzymatic activity of purified Pgm1 mutant proteins. We find that reduction, but not elimination, of Pgm1 activity best compensates for the deleterious phenotypes associated with the <i>sec53</i>-V238M allele. Broadly, our results demonstrate the power of experimental evolution as a tool for identifying genes and pathways that compensate for human-disease associated alleles.

                Synapses contain a limited number of synaptic vesicles (SVs) that are released in response to action potentials (APs). Therefore, sustaining synaptic transmission over a wide range of AP firing rates and timescales depends on SV release and replenishment. Although actin dynamics impact synaptic transmission, how presynaptic regulators of actin signaling cascades control SV release and replenishment remains unresolved. Rac1, a Rho GTPase, regulates actin signaling cascades that control synaptogenesis, neuronal development, and postsynaptic function. However, the presynaptic role of Rac1 in regulating synaptic transmission is unclear. To unravel Rac1’s roles in controlling transmitter release, we performed selective presynaptic ablation of Rac1 at the mature mouse calyx of Held synapse. Loss of Rac1 increased synaptic strength, accelerated EPSC recovery after conditioning stimulus trains, and augmented spontaneous SV release with no change in presynaptic morphology or AZ ultrastructure. Analyses with constrained short-term plasticity models revealed faster SV priming kinetics and, depending on model assumptions, elevated SV release probability or higher abundance of tightly docked fusion-competent SVs in Rac1-deficient synapses. We conclude that presynaptic Rac1 is a key regulator of synaptic transmission and plasticity mainly by regulating the dynamics of SV priming and potentially SV release probability.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Dynamics of cooperative excavation in ant and robot collectives</a></h4>

              
                The solution of complex problems by the collective action of simple agents in both biologically evolved and synthetically engineered systems involves cooperative action. Understanding the resulting emergent solutions requires integrating across the organismal behaviors of many individuals. Here we investigate an ecologically relevant collective task in black carpenter ants Camponotus pennsylvanicus: excavation of a soft, erodible confining corral. Individual ants show a transition from individual exploratory excavation at random locations to spatially localized collective exploitative excavation and eventual excavate out from the corral. An agent minimal continuum theory that coarse-grains over individual actions and considers their integrated influence on the environment leads to the emergence of an effective phase space of behaviors in terms of excavation strength and cooperation intensity. To test the theory over the range of both observed and predicted behaviors, we used custom-built robots (RAnts) that respond to stimuli to characterize the phase space of emergence (and failure) of cooperative excavation. By tuning the amount of cooperation between RAnts, we found that we could vary the efficiency of excavation and synthetically generate the other macroscopic phases predicted by our theory. Overall, our approach shows how the cooperative completion of tasks can arise from simple rules that involve the interaction of agents with a dynamically changing environment that serves as both an enabler and a modulator of behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Unrestrained growth of correctly oriented microtubules instructs axonal microtubule orientation</a></h4>

              
                In many eukaryotic cells, directed molecular transport occurs along microtubules. Within neuronal axons, transport over vast distances particularly relies on uniformly oriented microtubules, whose plus-ends point towards the distal axon tip (anterogradely polymerizing, or plus-end-out). However, axonal microtubules initially have mixed orientations, and how they orient during development is not yet fully understood. Using live imaging of primary <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> neurons, we found that, in the distal part of the axon, catastrophe rates of plus-end-out microtubules were significantly reduced compared to those of minus-end-out microtubules. Physical modelling revealed that plus-end-out microtubules should therefore exhibit persistent long-term growth, while growth of minus-end-out microtubules should be limited, leading to a bias in overall axonal microtubule orientation. Using chemical and physical perturbations of microtubule growth and genetic perturbations of the anti -catastrophe factor p150, which was enriched in the distal axon tip, we confirmed that the enhanced growth of plus-end-out microtubules is critical for achieving uniform microtubule orientation. Computer simulations of axon development integrating the enhanced plus-end-out microtubule growth identified here with previously suggested mechanisms, that is, dynein-based microtubule sliding and augmin-mediated templating, correctly predicted the long-term evolution of axonal microtubule orientation as found in our experiments. Our study thus leads to a holistic explanation of how axonal microtubules orient uniformly, a prerequisite for efficient long-range transport essential for neuronal functioning.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The landscape of transcriptional and 1translational changes over 22 years of bacterial adaptation</a></h4>

              
                Organisms can adapt to an environment by taking multiple mutational paths. This redundancy at the genetic level, where many mutations have similar phenotypic and fitness effects, can make untangling the molecular mechanisms of complex adaptations difficult. Here we use the E. coli long-term evolution experiment (LTEE) as a model to address this challenge. To understand how different genomic changes could lead to parallel fitness gains, we characterize the landscape of transcriptional and translational changes across 12 replicate populations evolving in parallel for 50,000 generations. By quantifying absolute changes in mRNA abundances, we show that not only do all evolved lines have more mRNAs but that this increase in mRNA abundance scales with cell size. We also find that despite few shared mutations at the genetic level, clones from replicate populations in the LTEE are remarkably similar in their gene expression patterns at both the transcriptional and translational levels. Furthermore, we show that the majority of the expression changes are due to changes at the transcriptional level with very few translational changes. Finally, we show how mutations in transcriptional regulators lead to consistent and parallel changes in the expression levels of downstream genes. These results deepen our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying complex adaptations and provide insights into the repeatability of evolution.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Decoding the IGF1 signaling gene regulatory network behind alveologenesis from a mouse model of bronchopulmonary dysplasia</a></h4>

              
                Lung development is precisely controlled by underlying Gene Regulatory Networks (GRN). Disruption of genes in the network can interrupt normal development and cause diseases such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD)–a chronic lung disease in preterm infants with morbid and sometimes lethal consequences characterized by lung immaturity and reduced alveolarization. Here, we generated a transgenic mouse exhibiting a moderate severity BPD phenotype by blocking IGF1 signaling in secondary crest myofibroblasts (SCMF) at the onset of alveologenesis. Using approaches mirroring the construction of the model GRN in sea urchin’s development, we constructed the IGF1 signaling network underlying alveologenesis using this mouse model that phenocopies BPD. The constructed GRN, consisting of 43 genes, provides a bird’s-eye view of how the genes downstream of IGF1 are regulatorily connected. The GRN also reveals a mechanistic interpretation of how the effects of IGF1 signaling are transduced within SCMF from its specification genes to its effector genes and then from SCMF to its neighboring alveolar epithelial cells with WNT5A and FGF10 signaling as the bridge. Consistently, blocking WNT5A signaling in mice phenocopies BPD as inferred by the network. A comparative study on human samples suggests that a GRN of similar components and wiring underlies human BPD. Our network view of alveologenesis is transforming our perspective to understand and treat BPD. This new perspective calls for the construction of the full signaling GRN underlying alveologenesis, upon which targeted therapies for this neonatal chronic lung disease can be viably developed.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">N-myc downstream regulated gene 1 (ndrg1) functions as a molecular switch for cellular adaptation to hypoxia</a></h4>

              
                Lack of oxygen (hypoxia and anoxia) is detrimental to cell function and survival and underlies many disease conditions. Hence, metazoans have evolved mechanisms to adapt to low oxygen. One such mechanism, metabolic suppression, decreases the cellular demand for oxygen by downregulating ATP-demanding processes. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this adaptation are poorly understood. Here, we report on the role of <i>ndrg1a</i> in hypoxia adaptation of the anoxia-tolerant zebrafish embryo. <i>ndrg1a</i> is expressed in the kidney and ionocytes, cell types that use large amounts of ATP to maintain ion homeostasis. <i>ndrg1a</i> mutants are viable and develop normally when raised under normal oxygen. However, their survival and kidney function is reduced relative to WT embryos following exposure to prolonged anoxia. We further demonstrate that Ndrg1a binds to the energy-demanding sodium-potassium ATPase (NKA) pump under anoxia and is required for its degradation, which may preserve ATP in the kidney and ionocytes and contribute to energy homeostasis. Lastly, we show that sodium azide treatment, which increases lactate levels under normoxia, is sufficient to trigger NKA degradation in an Ndrg1a-dependent manner. These findings support a model whereby Ndrg1a is essential for hypoxia adaptation and functions downstream of lactate signaling to induce NKA degradation, a process known to conserve cellular energy.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Phorbolester-activated Munc13-1 and ubMunc13-2 exert opposing effects on dense-core vesicle secretion</a></h4>

              
                Munc13 proteins are priming factors for SNARE-dependent exocytosis, which are activated by diacylglycerol (DAG)-binding to their C1-domain. Several Munc13 paralogs exist, but their differential roles are not well understood. We studied the interdependence of phorbolesters (DAG mimics) with Munc13-1 and ubMunc13-2 in mouse adrenal chromaffin cells. Although expression of either Munc13-1 or ubMunc13-2 stimulated secretion, phorbolester was only stimulatory for secretion when ubMunc13-2 expression dominated, but inhibitory when Munc13-1 dominated. Accordingly, phorbolester stimulated secretion in wildtype cells, or cells overexpressing ubMunc13-2, but inhibited secretion in Munc13-2/<i>Unc13b</i> knockout (KO) cells or in cells overexpressing Munc13-1. Phorbolester was more stimulatory in the Munc13-1/<i>Unc13a</i> KO than in WT littermates, showing that endogenous Munc13-1 limits the effects of phorbolester. Imaging showed that ubMunc13-2 traffics to the plasma membrane with a time-course matching Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent secretion, and trafficking is independent of Synaptotagmin-7 (Syt7). However, in the absence of Syt7, phorbolester became inhibitory for both Munc13-1 and ubMunc13-2 driven secretion, indicating that stimulatory phorbolester x Munc13-2 interaction depends on functional pairing with Syt7. Overall, DAG/phorbolester, ubMunc13-2 and Syt7 form a stimulatory triad for dense-core vesicle priming.

                A forward mutagenesis assay using the <i>supF</i> gene has been widely employed for the last several decades in studies addressing mutation frequencies and mutation spectra associated with various intrinsic and environmental mutagens. In this study, by using a <i>supF</i> shuttle vector and non-SOS-induced <i>Escherichia coli</i> with short read Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technology, we present an advanced method for the study of mutations, which is simple, versatile, and cost-effective. We demonstrate the performance of our newly developed assay via pilot experiments with UV-irradiation, the results from which emerge more relevant than expected. The NGS data obtained from samples of the indicator <i>E. coli</i> grown on titer plates provides mutation frequency and spectrum data, and uncovers obscure mutations that cannot be detected by a conventional <i>supF</i> assay. Furthermore, a very small amount of NGS data from selection plates reveals the almost full spectrum of mutations in each specimen and offers us a novel insight into the mechanisms of mutagenesis, despite them being considered already well-known. We believe that the method presented here will contribute to future opportunities for research on mutagenesis, DNA repair, and cancer.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Transient regulation of focal adhesion via Tensin3 is required for nascent oligodendrocyte differentiation</a></h4>

              
                The differentiation of oligodendroglia from oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) to complex and extensive myelinating oligodendrocytes (OLs) is a multistep process that involves largescale morphological changes with significant strain on the cytoskeleton. While key chromatin and transcriptional regulators of differentiation have been identified, their target genes responsible for the morphological changes occurring during OL myelination are still largely unknown. Here, we show that the regulator of focal adhesion, Tensin3 (Tns3), is a direct target gene of Olig2, Chd7, and Chd8, transcriptional regulators of OL differentiation. Tns3 is transiently upregulated and localized to cell processes of immature OLs, together with integrin-b1, a key mediator of survival at this transient stage. Constitutive <i>Tns3</i> loss-of-function leads to reduced viability in mouse and humans, with surviving knockout mice still expressing Tns3 in oligodendroglia. Acute deletion of <i>Tns3 in vivo</i>, either in postnatal neural stem cells (NSCs) or in OPCs, leads to a two-fold reduction in OL numbers. We find that the transient upregulation of Tns3 is required to protect differentiating OPCs and immature OLs from cell death by preventing the upregulation of p53, a key regulator of apoptosis. Altogether, our findings reveal a specific time window during which transcriptional upregulation of Tns3 in immature OLs is required for OL differentiation likely by mediating integrin-b1 survival signaling to the actin cytoskeleton as OL undergo the large morphological changes required for their terminal differentiation.

                Are there common mechanisms of neurogenesis used throughout an entire nervous system? Making use of the well-defined and relatively small size of the nervous system of the nematode C. elegans, we explored to what extent canonical proneural class I/II bHLH complexes are responsible for neurogenesis throughout the entire C. elegans nervous system. Distinct, lineage-specific proneural class II bHLH factors are generally thought to operate via interaction with a common, class I bHLH subunit, encoded by Daugtherless in flies, the E (E2A, E2-2, HEB) proteins in vertebrates, and hlh-2 in C. elegans. To eliminate function of all proneuronal class I/II bHLH complexes, we therefore genetically removed maternal and zygotic hlh-2 gene activity. We observed broad effects on neurogenesis, but still detected normal neurogenesis in many distinct neuron-producing lineages of the central and peripheral nervous system. Moreover, we find that hlh-2 selectively affects some aspects of neuron differentiation while leaving others unaffected. While our studies confirm the function of proneuronal class I/II bHLH complexes in many different lineages throughout a nervous system, we conclude that their function is not universal, but rather restricted by lineage, cell type and components of differentiation programs affected.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Unattended visual stimuli do not produce prediction error responses despite being initially encoded</a></h4>

              
                Prediction error is a basic component of predictive-coding theory of brain processing. According to the theory, each stage of brain processing of sensory information generates a model of the current sensory input; subsequent input is compared against the model and only if there is a mismatch, a prediction error, is further processing performed. Recently, Smout et al. found that a signature of prediction error, the visual (v) mismatch negativity (MMN), for a fundamental property of visual input--its orientation--was absent without attention on the stimuli. This is remarkable because the weight of evidence for MMNs from audition and vision is that they occur without attention. To resolve this discrepancy, we conducted an experiment addressing two alternative explanations for Smout et al.'s finding: that it was from a lack of reproducibility or that participants' visual systems did not encode the stimuli when attention was on something else. We conducted a similar experiment to Smout et al.'s. We showed 21 participants sequences of identically oriented Gabor patches, standards, and, unpredictably, otherwise identical, Gabor patches differing in orientation by {+/-}15{degrees}, {+/-}30{degrees}, and {+/-}60{degrees}, deviants. To test whether participants encoded the orientation of the standards, we varied the numbers of standards preceding a deviant, allowing us to search for a decrease in activity with the number of repetitions of standards--repetition suppression. We diverted participants' attention from the oriented stimuli with a central, letter-detection task. We reproduced Smout et al.'s finding of no vMMN without attention, strengthening their finding. We also found that our participants showed repetition suppression: they did encode the stimuli pre-attentively. We also found early processing of deviants. We discuss whether this earlier processing of deviants may be why no further processing, in the vMMN time window, occurs.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Drosophila epidermal cells are intrinsically mechanosensitive and drive nociceptive behavioral outputs</a></h4>

              
                Somatosensory neurons (SSNs) that detect and transduce mechanical, thermal, and chemical stimuli densely innervate an animal's skin. However, despite the fact that epidermal cells provide the first point of contact for sensory stimuli. our understanding of roles that epidermal cells play in SSN function, particularly nociception, remains limited. Here, we show that stimulating Drosophila epidermal cells elicits activation of SSNs including nociceptors and triggers a variety of behavior outputs, including avoidance and escape. Further, we find that epidermal cells are intrinsically mechanosensitive and that epidermal mechanically evoked calcium responses require the store-operated calcium channel Orai. Epidermal cell stimulation augments larval responses to acute nociceptive stimuli and promotes prolonged hypersensitivity to subsequent mechanical stimuli. Hence, epidermal cells are key determinants of nociceptive sensitivity and sensitization, acting as primary sensors of noxious stimuli that tune nociceptor output and drive protective behaviors.

                Schizophrenia (SZ) is a severe mental disorder characterized by failure of functional integration (aka dysconnection) across the brain. Recent functional connectivity (FC) studies have adopted functional parcellations to define subnetworks of large-scale networks, and to characterize the (dys)connection between them, in normal and clinical populations. While FC examines statistical dependencies between observations, model-based effective connectivity (EC) can disclose the causal influences that underwrite the observed dependencies. In this study, we investigated resting state EC between the subnetworks of seven large-scale networks, in 66 SZ and 74 healthy subjects from a public dataset. The results showed that a remarkable 33% of the effective connections (among subnetworks) of the cognitive control network had been pathologically modulated in SZ. Further dysconnection was identified within the visual, default mode and sensorimotor networks of SZ subjects, with 24%, 20% and 11% aberrant couplings. Overall, the proportion of diagnostic connections was remarkably larger in EC (24%) than FC (1%) analysis. Subsequently, to study the neural correlates of impaired cognition in SZ, we conducted a canonical correlation analysis between the EC parameters and the cognitive scores of the patients. As such, the self-inhibitions of supplementary motor area and paracentral lobule (in the sensorimotor network) and the excitatory connection from parahippocampal gyrus to inferior temporal gyrus (in the cognitive control network) were significantly correlated with the social cognition, reasoning/problem solving and working memory capabilities of the patients. Future research can investigate the potential of whole-brain EC as a biomarker for diagnosis of brain disorders and for cognitive assessment.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Fast prediction in marmoset reach-to-grasp movements for dynamic prey</a></h4>

              
                Primates have evolved sophisticated visually guided reaching behaviors for interacting with dynamic objects, such as insects during foraging. Reaching control in dynamic natural conditions requires active prediction of the target's future position in order to compensate for visuo-motor processing delays and enhance online movement adjustments. Past reaching research in non-human primates mainly focused on seated subjects engaged in repeated ballistic arm movements to either stationary targets, or targets that step once during the movement. However, those highly constrained approaches also impose task constraints that limit the natural dynamics of reaching. A recent field study in marmoset monkeys highlights predictive aspects of visually-guided reaching during insect prey capture among wild marmoset monkeys (Ngo et. al. 2022). To examine the complementary dynamics for similar natural behavior within a laboratory context we developed an ecologically motivated unrestrained reach-to-grasp task involving live crickets. We used multiple high-speed video cameras to capture the movements of marmosets and crickets stereoscopically and applied machine vision algorithms for marker-free object and hand tracking. Contrary to estimates under traditional constrained reaching paradigms, we find that prediction for dynamic targets can operate at incredibly short visuo-motor delays, rivaling the speeds that are typical of the oculomotor systems during closed-loop visual pursuit. Multivariate linear regression modeling of the kinematic relationships between the hand and cricket velocity revealed a visuo-motor delay below 100ms. Predictive corrections for moving crickets were incorporated into hand motion especially during the latter stage of the reach-to-grasp trajectory. This approach reveals that the marmoset motor system for reaching can operate at short visuo-motor delays comparable to the oculomotor system under natural dynamic conditions.

                The existence of a neural representation for whole words(i.e.,a lexicon) is a common feature of many models of speech processing. Prior studies have provided evidence for a visual lexicon containing representations of whole written words in an area of the ventral visual stream known as the "Visual Word Form Area" (VWFA). Similar experimental support for an auditory lexicon containing representations of spoken words has yet to be shown. Using fMRI rapid adaptation techniques, we provide evidence for an auditory lexicon in the "Auditory Word Form Area" (AWFA) in the human left anterior superior temporal gyrus that contains representations highly selective for individual spoken words. Furthermore, we show that familiarization with novel auditory words sharpens their selectivity in the AWFA. These findings reveal strong parallels in how the brain represents written and spoken words, showing convergent processing strategies across speech modalities in the visual and auditory ventral streams.

                Recording and modulating neural activity in vivo enables investigations of neural circuits during behavior. However, there is a dearth of tools for simultaneous recording and localized receptor modulation in large animal models. We address this limitation by translating multifunctional fiber-based neurotechnology previously only available for rodent studies to enable cortical and subcortical neural modulation in macaques. We record single unit and local field potential activity before, during, and after intracranial GABA infusions in the premotor cortex and putamen. We apply state-space models to characterize changes in neural activity and investigate how neural activity evoked by a working memory task varies in the presence of local inhibition. The recordings provide detailed insight into the electrophysiological effect of neurotransmitter receptor modulation in both cortical and subcortical structures in an awake, behaving macaque. Our results demonstrate a first-time translation of multifunctional fibers for causal studies in behaving non-human primates.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Generalized habitual tendencies in alcohol dependent rats</a></h4>

              
                Habitual responses and ultimately compulsive behavior are thought to be at the core of addiction including alcohol use disorder (AUD). Little is known whether the habitization concerns exclusively the response towards alcohol or generalizes to other daily activities. Here, we address this question in a well-established animal model of AUD - the post-dependent rat model - by testing habitual responses towards a sweet palatable reward in two striatal learning paradigms: spatial navigation and reward conditioning. For the spatial navigation task, alcohol-dependent and control rats were tested on a sequential decision-making test after short and prolonged T-Maze training; for the reward conditioning task, rats were trained under a random interval schedule for a short and prolonged period and tested in a satiety devaluation test at each time point. Another cohort of alcohol-naive rats was trained and tested on both paradigms under DREADD (designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs)-mediated inactivation of the dorsomedial striatum (DMS) which controls goal-directed behavior. Our results show that alcohol-dependent rats displayed increased habitual behavior to obtain saccharin reward on both paradigms, with overall more habitual choices after prolonged training on the spatial navigation task, and increased habitual responses already after short training on the reward conditioning task. Finally, DREADD-mediated inactivation of the DMS increased habitual behavior in non-dependent rats on both paradigms. Our results provide evidence that a history of alcohol dependence produces a bias towards habitual responding that generalizes to a natural reward in rats. Similarly, a habitual bias was induced in non-dependent rats after inactivation of the DMS, thus confirming the critical role of this region in maintaining goal-directed behavior and suggesting its diminished control in AUD.

                We consider a model of associative storage and retrieval of compositional memories in an extended cortical network. Our model network is comprised of Potts units, which represent patches of cortex, interacting through long-range connections. The critical assumption is that a memory is composed of a limited number of items, each of which has a pre-established representation: storing a new memory only involves acquiring the connections, if novel, among the participating items. The model is shown to have a much lower storage capacity than when it stores simple unitary representations. It is also shown that an input from the hippocampus facilitates associative retrieval. When it is absent, it is advantageous to cue rare rather than frequent items. The implications of these results for emerging trends in empirical research are discussed.

                Copy number variations at 7q11.23 cause neurodevelopmental disorders with shared and opposite manifestations. Deletion causes Williams-Beuren syndrome (WBS), while duplication causes 7q11.23 microduplication syndrome (7Dup). Converging evidence indicates GTF2I, from the 7q11.23 locus, is a key mediator of the cognitive-behavioral phenotypes associated with WBS and 7Dup. Here we integrate molecular profiling of patient-derived cortical organoids (COs) and transgenic mouse models to dissect 7q11.23 disease mechanisms. Proteomic and transcriptomic profiling of COs revealed opposite dynamics of neural progenitor proliferation and transcriptional imbalances, leading to precocious excitatory neuron production in 7Dup. The accelerated excitatory neuron production in 7Dup COs could be rescued by GTF2I knockdown. Transgenic mice with Gtf2i duplication recapitulated early neuronal differentiation defects and ASD-like behaviors. Remarkably, inhibition of LSD1, a downstream effector of GTF2I, was sufficient to rescue ASD-like phenotypes. We propose that the GTF2I-LSD1 axis constitutes a molecular pathway amenable to therapeutic intervention.

                Motor symptoms of Parkinson's Disease (PD) are associated with dopamine deficits and pathological oscillation of basal ganglia (BG) neurons in the beta range ([12-30] Hz). However, how the dopamine depletion affects the oscillation dynamics of BG nuclei is still unclear. With a spiking neurons model, we here captured the features of BG nuclei interactions leading to oscillations in dopamine-depleted condition. We found that both the loop between subthalamic nucleus and Globus Pallidus pars externa (GPe) and the loop between striatal fast spiking and medium spiny neurons and GPe displayed resonances in the beta range, and synchronized to a common beta frequency through interaction. Crucially, the synchronization depends on dopamine depletion: the two loops were largely independent for high levels of dopamine, but progressively synchronized as dopamine was depleted due to the increased strength of the striatal loop. Our results highlight the role of the interplay between the GPe-STN and the GPe-striatum loop in generating sustained beta oscillations in PD subjects, and explain how this interplay depends on the level of dopamine. This paves the way to the design of therapies specifically addressing the onset of pathological beta oscillations.

                With the emerging role of the autophagic machinery in healthy brain development and aging, there is a pressing need to better characterize its functions in different neuronal populations, providing cellular insight into autophagy-related brain diseases. Here, we generated and characterized mice with conditional ablation of atg5 in GABAergic neurons expressing parvalbumin (PV-atg5KO), mostly comprising fast-spiking interneurons, as well as Purkinje cells in the cerebellum. Using light-sheet microscopy to image PV neurons throughout the brain, we reveal that autophagy is required for the sustenance of Purkinje cells but not of PV-interneurons. Yet, proteomic analysis showed that autophagy deficiency in cortical and hippocampal PV-interneurons alters the proteostasis of key synaptic proteins, as well as the surface expression of glutamate receptor subunits. Consistently, hippocampal autophagy-deficient PV-interneurons exhibit reduced inhibitory neurotransmission and PV-atg5KO mice display excitation-inhibition imbalance in the hippocampus and memory deficits. Our findings demonstrate a neuronal type-specific vulnerability to autophagy deficiency, while also identifying PV-interneurons as cellular substrates where autophagy is required for memory.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">7q11.23 CNV alters protein synthesis and REST-mediated neuronal intrinsic excitability</a></h4>

              
                Copy number variations (CNVs) at 7q11.23 cause Williams-Beuren (WBS) and 7q microduplication syndromes (7Dup), two neurodevelopmental disorders with shared and opposite cognitive-behavioral phenotypes. Using patient-derived and isogenic neurons, we integrated transcriptomics, translatomics and proteomics to elucidate the molecular underpinnings of this dosage effect. We found that 7q11.23 CNVs cause opposite alterations in neuronal differentiation and excitability. Genes related to neuronal transmission chiefly followed 7q11.23 dosage and appeared transcriptionally controlled, while translation and ribosomal protein genes followed the opposite trend and were post-transcriptionally buffered. Mechanistically, we uncovered REST regulon as a key mediator of observed phenotypes and rescued transcriptional and excitability alterations through REST inhibition. We identified downregulation of global protein synthesis, mGLUR5 and ERK-mTOR pathways activity in steady-state in both WBS and 7Dup, whereas BDNF stimulation rescued them specifically in 7Dup. Overall, we show that 7q11.23 CNVs alter protein synthesis and neuronal firing-established molecular and cellular phenotypes of neurodevelopmental disorders.

	<p>Background: Despite promising results, the role of intra-arrest hypothermia in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) remains controversial. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of trans-nasal evaporative cooling (TNEC) during resuscitation on neurological recovery in OHCA patients admitted alive to the hospital. Methods: A post hoc analysis of the PRINCESS trial, including only patients admitted alive to the hospital, either assigned to TNEC or standard of care during resuscitation. The primary endpoint was favorable neurological outcome (FO) defined as a Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) of 1&amp;amp;ndash;2 at 90 days. The secondary outcomes were overall survival at 90 days and CPC 1 at 90 days. Subgroup analyses were performed according to the initial cardiac rhythm. Results: A total of 149 patients in the TNEC and 142 in the control group were included. The number of patients with CPC 1&amp;amp;ndash;2 at 90 days was 56/149 (37.6%) in the intervention group and 45/142 (31.7%) in the control group (p = 0.29). Survival and CPC 1 at 90 days was observed in 60/149 patients (40.3%) vs. 52/142 (36.6%; p = 0.09) and 50/149 (33.6%) vs. 35/142 (24.6%; p = 0.11) in the two groups. In the subgroup of patients with an initial shockable rhythm, the number of patients with CPC 1 at 90 days was 45/83 (54.2%) in the intervention group and 27/78 (34.6%) in the control group (p = 0.01). Conclusions: In this post hoc analysis of admitted OHCA patients, no statistically significant benefits of TNEC on neurological outcome at 90 days was found. In patients with initial shockable rhythm, TNEC was associated with increased full neurological recovery.</p>

	<p>Background: Although chronic subdural hematoma (CSDH) has been known for over several hundred years, the etiology and pathogenesis of it are still not completely understood. Neurosurgical procedures resulting in CSDH are a rare clinical complication, and there was no report about how subdural effusion (SDE) evolves into CSDH after deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery. The formation mechanism of CSDH after surgery, especially in DBS surgery, and the effect of recovery, need to be explored. Methods: We present two cases, complicated with SDE after DBS surgery, serious dysfunction complications such as hemiplegia and aphasia occurred on the postoperative day 36 and 49 individually, and images showed CSDH. Fusion image showed the bilateral electrodes were significantly shifted. Then, they were performed to drill craniotomy with a closed system drainage. Result: The symptoms of hemiplegia and aphasia caused by CSDH were completely recovered, and the follow-up images showed CSDH was disappeared. However, DBS stimulation is poorly effective, it cannot reach the preoperative level, especially in the ipsilateral side of CSDH. Conclusions: The iatrogenic SDE that evolved into CSDH in the present two cases shows that SDE is one of the causes of CSDH. Patients develop SDE after DBS, which increases the risk of developing CSDH. CSDH after DBS can be successfully treated. however, the postoperative efficacy of DBS will decline.</p>

                To what extent do speech and music processing rely on domain-specific and domain-general neural networks? Adopting a dynamical system framework, we investigate the presence of frequency-specific and network-level selectivity and combine it with a statistical approach in which a clear distinction is made between shared, preferred, and category-selective neural responses. Using intracranial EEG recordings in 18 epilepsy patients listening to natural and continuous speech and music, we show that the majority of focal and network-level neural activity is shared between speech and music processing. Our data also reveal an absence of regional selectivity. Instead, neural selectivity is restricted to distributed and frequency-specific coherent oscillations, typical of spectral fingerprints. Our work addresses a longstanding debate and redefines an epistemological posture on how to map cognitive and brain functions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The effects of biological sex on estimates of persistent inward currents in the human lower limb</a></h4>

              
                Non-invasive recordings of motor unit (MU) spike trains help us understand how neural drive is modulated by various motor commands and/or physiological conditions. The majority of study participants in human and non-human animal physiology studies are male, and it is assumed mechanisms uncovered in these studies are shared between males and females. However, sex differences in neurological impairment and physical performance warrant the study of sex as a biological variable in human physiology and performance. To begin addressing this gap in the study of biophysical properties of human motoneurons, we quantified MU discharge rates and estimates of persistent inward current (PIC) magnitude in both sexes by quantifying {Delta}F. We decomposed MU spike trains from the tibialis anterior (TA), medial gastrocnemius (MG), and soleus (SOL) using high-density surface electromyography and blind source separation algorithms. Ten participants of each sex performed slow triangular (10s up and down) isometric contractions to a peak of 30% of their maximum voluntary contraction. We then used linear mixed effects models to determine if peak discharge rate and {Delta}F were predicted by the fixed effects of sex, muscle, and their interaction. Despite similar peak discharge rates across all muscles, {Delta}F was larger ({chi}2(1) = 6.26, p = 0.012) in females (4.73 [0.242 pps]) than males (3.81 [0.240 pps]). These findings suggest that neuromodulatory drive and/or biophysical properties of motoneurons differ between the sexes and may contribute to differences in MU discharge patterns.

                Epileptic seizure is typically characterized by highly synchronized episodes of neural activity. Existing stimulation therapies focus purely on suppressing the pathologically synchronized neuronal firing patterns during the ictal (seizure) period. While these strategies are effective in suppressing seizures when they occur, they fail to prevent the re-emergence of seizures once the stimulation is turned off. Previously, we developed a novel neurostimulation motif, which we refer to as "Forced Temporal Spike-Time Stimulation" (FTSTS) [1] that has shown remarkable promise in long-lasting desynchronization of excessively synchronized neuronal firing patterns by harnessing synaptic plasticity. In this paper, we build upon this prior work [1] by optimizing the parameters of the FTSTS protocol in order to efficiently desynchronize the pathologically synchronous neuronal firing patterns that occur during epileptic seizures using a recently published computational model of neocortical-onset seizures [2]. We show that the FTSTS protocol applied during the ictal period can modify the excitatory-to inhibitory synaptic weight in order to effectively desynchronize the pathological neuronal firing patterns even after the ictal period. Our investigation opens the door to a possible new neurostimulation therapy for epilepsy.

                Glaucoma is an age-related neurodegenerative disease of the visual system, affecting both the eye and the brain. Yet its underlying metabolic mechanisms and neurobehavioral relevance remain largely unclear. Here, using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy and functional magnetic resonance imaging, we investigated the GABAergic and glutamatergic systems in the visual cortex of glaucoma patients, as well as neural specificity, which is shaped by GABA and glutamate signals and underlies efficient sensory and cognitive functions. Our study showed that among the older adults, both GABA and glutamate levels decrease with increasing glaucoma severity regardless of age. Further, the reduction of GABA but not glutamate predicted the neural specificity. This association was independent of the impairments on the retina structure and age. Our results suggest that glaucoma-specific decline of GABA undermines neural specificity in the visual cortex and that targeting GABA could improve the neural specificity in glaucoma.

                Resilience to Alzheimer's disease (RAD) is an uncommon combination of high disease burden without dementia that may provide critical insights into limiting the clinical impact of this incurable disease. In this study, we used mass spectrometry-based proteomics to quantify regional protein differences that characterize RAD. Starting with over 700 brain donations, we identified 43 extensively annotated research participants who met stringent inclusion exclusion criteria and analyzed matched isocortical regions, hippocampus, and caudate nucleus. Differential expression analysis of 7,115 soluble proteins identified lower isocortical and hippocampal soluble A{beta}; peptide levels as a significant feature of RAD. Protein co-expression analysis revealed a group of 181 densely-interacting proteins significantly associated with RAD that were enriched for actin filament-based process, cellular detoxification, and wound healing in isocortex and hippocampus. We further support our findings using data from 689 human isocortical samples from four independent external cohorts that were the closest approximations of our clinico-pathologic groups. The molecular basis of RAD, a widely replicated state in older adults for which there is no experimental model, likely holds important insights into therapeutic interventions for Alzheimer's disease.

                Apolipoprotein 4 (APOE) {epsilon}4 genotype is the most prevalent risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Although APOE4 differs from its non-pathological APOE3 isoform only by the C112R mutation, the mechanism of its proteinopathy is poorly understood. Here, we combine experimental and computational techniques to uncover a domino-like effect of C112R mutation on APOE4 behavior. We found that C112R substitution in APOE4 induces long-distance (>15 [A]) conformational changes leading to the formation of a T-shaped dimeric unit that is geometrically different and more aggregation-prone than the APOE3 structure. AD drug candidate tramiprosate and its metabolite 3-sulfopropanoic acid induce APOE3-like conformational behavior in APOE4 and suppress its aggregation propensity. Analysis of APOE {varepsilon}4/{varepsilon}4 cerebral organoids treated with tramiprosate revealed its effect on cholesteryl esters, the storage products of excess cholesterol. Overall, our results connect the APOE4 structure with its aggregation propensity, providing a new druggable target for neurodegeneration and ageing.

                Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by expanded ([&ge;]40) glutamine-encoding CAG repeats in the huntingtin gene, which leads to dysfunction and death of predominantly striatal and cortical neurons. While the genetic profile and behavioural signs of the disease are better known, changes in the functional architecture of the brain, especially before the behavioural signs become apparent, are not fully and consistently characterized. In this study, we sought markers at pre, early and late manifest states of phenotypic progression in the heterozygous (HET) zQ175 delta-neo (DN) mouse model, using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (RS-fMRI). This mouse model shows molecular, cellular, and circuitry alterations that resemble those seen in HD in humans. Specifically, we investigated, longitudinally, changes in co-activation patterns (CAPs) that are the transient states of brain activity constituting the resting-state networks (RSNs). Most robust changes in the temporal properties of CAPs occurred at the late manifest state; the durations of two anti-correlated CAPs, characterized by simultaneous co-activation of the default-mode-like network (DMLN) and co-deactivation of the lateral-cortical network (LCN) and vice-versa, were reduced in the zQ175 DN HET animals compared to the wild-type mice. Changes in the spatial properties, measured in terms of activation levels of different brain regions, during CAPs were found at all three states and became progressively more pronounced at the manifest states. We then assessed the cross-validated predictive power of CAP metrics to distinguish HET animals from controls. Spatial properties of CAPs performed significantly better than the chance level at all three states with 80% classification accuracy at the early and late manifest states.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">1H-MRS characterization of metabolic changes induced by photoperiod in the sheep brain: a promising eye into in-vivo adult neurogenesis?</a></h4>

              
                The hypothalamus is a central structure of the mammalian brain, which controls physiological, endocrine and metabolic brain homeostasis. Despite this essential role, little is known about the normal and altered neurochemical changes occurring within the hypothalamic structures. Here, the metabolism of the hypothalamus of ewes was investigated at 3T using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS). We used the sensitivity of these animals to photoperiod i.e. the ratio of day to night length, to investigate the hypothalamic metabolic changes and their relationship to hypothalamic adult neurogenesis. A longitudinal study involving 4 ewes per timepoint was conducted at 4 time points (P01, P02, P03 and P04) during long days (LD) and 4 time points during short days (SD). Significant metabolic changes were found between LD and SD at all time points in particular for glutamate (Glu), glutamine, myo-inositol and total N-acetyl-Aspartate (NAA). During SD, glutamate and glutamine concentrations were significantly smaller at P01 compared to all other time points while significant neurochemical changes occurred during the entire LD period. Neurochemical changes relative to P01 remained stable during LD and SD except for Glu and Gln which increased between P01 and P02 during SD. Relative metabolic changes were significantly higher on average for NAA and Glu and significantly smaller on average for total choline during SD compared to LD, respectively, paralleling the average changes in the numbers of neural stem cells and glial and oligodendrocyte progenitors found by immunohistochemistry. Despite important differences between MRS and immunohistochemistry in terms of spatial resolution, both techniques suggest complementary findings that should contribute to a better characterization of the hypothalamus during photoperiodism and adult neurogenesis. We conclude that 1H-MRS could be a promising non-invasive translational technique to investigate the existence of adult neurogenesis in-vivo in gyrencephalic

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Entorhinal grid-like codes and time-locked network dynamics track others navigating through space</a></h4>

              
                Navigating through crowded, dynamically changing social environments requires the ability to keep track of other individuals. Grid cells in the entorhinal cortex are a central component of self-related navigation but whether they also track others' movement is unclear. Here, we propose that entorhinal grid-like codes make an essential contribution to socio-spatial navigation. Sixty human participants underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while observing and re-tracing different paths of a demonstrator that navigated a virtual reality environment. Results revealed that grid-like codes in the entorhinal cortex tracked the other individual navigating through space. Further, the activity of grid-like codes was time-locked to increases in co-activation and entorhinal-cortical connectivity that included the striatum, the hippocampus, parahippocampal and right posterior parietal cortices, altogether modulated by accuracy when subsequently re-tracing the paths. This suggests that network dynamics time-locked to entorhinal grid-cell-related activity might serve to distribute information about the "socio-spatial map" throughout the brain.

	<p>Psychiatric disorders are a class of complex disorders characterized by brain dysfunction with varying degrees of impairment in cognition, emotion, consciousness and behavior, which has become a serious public health issue. The NGFR gene encodes the p75 neurotrophin receptor, which regulates neuronal growth, survival and plasticity, and was reported to be associated with depression, schizophrenia and antidepressant efficacy in human patient and animal studies. In this study, we investigated its association with schizophrenia and major depression and its role in the behavioral phenotype of adult mice. Four NGFR SNPs were detected based on a study among 1010 schizophrenia patients, 610 patients with major depressive disorders (MDD) and 1034 normal controls, respectively. We then knocked down the expression of NGFR protein in the hippocampal dentate gyrus of the mouse brain by injection of shRNA lentivirus to further investigate its behavioral effect in mice. We found significant associations of s2072446 and rs11466162 for schizophrenia. Ngfr knockdown mice showed social and behavioral abnormalities, suggesting that it is linked to the etiology of neuropsychiatric disorders. We found significant associations between NGFR and schizophrenia and that Ngfr may contribute to the social behavior of adult mice in the functional study, which provided meaningful clues to the pathogenesis of psychiatric disorders.</p>

	<p>Shooting is a sport dominated by psychological factors. Hence, disturbing the shooter&amp;amp;rsquo;s sensory function during aiming will seriously affect his psychological state and shooting performance. Electroencephalograph (EEG) measurements of 30 skilled marksmen in the shooting preparation stage under noisy disturbance, weak light, and normal conditions were recorded. Therefore, the differences in neural mechanisms in the shooter&amp;amp;rsquo;s brain during shooting aiming in different disturbance conditions were explored using an analytical approach that employs functional connectivity and brain network analysis based on graph theory. The relationship between these brain network characteristics and shooting performance was also compared. The results showed that (1) the average connection strength in the beta frequency band and connection intensity in the left and right temporal lobes of the shooters under noise disturbance were significantly higher than those under the other two conditions, and their brain networks also showed a higher global and local efficiency. In addition, (2) the functional connection intensity in the occipital region of the beta band was higher than that in the normal condition in the weak-light condition. The information interaction in the left parietal region also increased continually during the shooting process. (3) Furthermore, the shooters&amp;amp;rsquo; eigenvector centrality in the temporal and occipital regions with limited sensory function in the two conditions was lower than those in the normal condition. These findings suggest that noise disturbance activates the arousal level of the shooter&amp;amp;rsquo;s brain and enhances the information processing efficiency of the brain network; however, it increases the mental workload. In weak-light conditions, shooters focus more on visual information processing during aiming and strengthen the inhibition of functions in the brain regions unrelated to shooting behavior. Audiovisual disturbance renders the cortical regions equivalent to the audiovisual perception function in the shooter&amp;amp;rsquo;s brain less important in the entire brain network than in the normal condition. Therefore, these findings reveal the effect of audiovisual disturbance on the functional network of the cortex in the shooting preparation stage and provide a theoretical basis for further understanding the neural mechanism of the shooting process under sensory disturbances.</p>

	<p>Postoperative delirium (POD) is a complication characterized by disturbances in attention, awareness, and cognitive function that occur shortly after surgery or emergence from anesthesia. Since it occurs prevalently in neurosurgical patients and poses great threats to the well-being of patients, much emphasis is placed on POD in neurosurgical units. However, there are intricate theories about its pathogenesis and limited pharmacological interventions for POD. In this study, we review the recent insights into its pathogenesis, mainly based on studies within five years, and the five dominant pathological theories that account for the development of POD, with the intention of furthering our understanding and boosting its clinical management.</p>

	<p>Background: Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s dementia (AD) is a degenerative disease that impairs cognitive function, initially, and then motor or other function, eventually. Motor coordination function impairment usually accompanies cognition impairment but it is seldom examined whether it can reflect the clinical outcomes of AD. Methods: 113 clinically diagnosed AD patients with a mean age of 78.9 &amp;amp;plusmn; 6.9 years underwent an annual neuropsychological assessment using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), the Cognitive Abilities Screening Instrument (CASI), the Sum of Boxes of Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR-SB), and the CDR. The cerebral coordination function was evaluated through correlations among 15 joints with a kinetic depth sensor annually. An intra-individual comparison of both cognitive and motor coordination functions was performed to examine their correlations. Results: The changes in coordination function in the lower limbs can significantly reflect the clinical outcomes, MMSE (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), CASI (p = 0.006), CDR (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), and CDR-SB (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), but the changes in upper limbs can only reflect the clinical outcome in CDR (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). Conclusions: The use of a kinetic depth sensor to determine the coordination between joints, especially in lower limbs, can significantly reflect the global functional and cognitive outcomes in AD. Such evaluations could be another biomarker used to evaluate non-cognitive outcomes in AD for clinical and research purposes.</p>

	<p>This study aims to investigate distractibility quantified by recording and analyzing eye movements during task-irrelevant distraction in children with and without ADHD and in children with and without neurological disorders. Gaze behavior data and press latencies of 141 participants aged 6&amp;amp;ndash;17 that were collected during a computerized distraction paradigm with task-irrelevant stimuli (IDistrack) were analyzed. Children using attention-regulating medication were excluded from participation. Data were analyzed for subgroups that were formed based on the presence of neurological disorders and the presence of ADHD separately. Participants with ADHD and participants with neurological disorders spent less time fixating on the target stimuli compared to their peers without ADHD (p = 0.025) or their peers without neurological disorders (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). Participants with and without ADHD had equal press latencies (p = 0.79). Participants with neurological disorders had a greater press latency compared to their typically developing peers (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). Target fixation duration shows a significant association with parent-reported attention problems (r = &amp;amp;minus;0.39, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). We conclude that eye tracking during a distraction task reveals potentially valid clinical information that may contribute to the assessment of dysfunctional attentional processes. Further research on the validity and reliability of this paradigm is recommended.</p>

	<p>Abstract: Multisensory integration refers to sensory inputs from different sensory modalities being processed simultaneously to produce a unitary output. Surrounded by stimuli from multiple modalities, animals utilize multisensory integration to form a coherent and robust representation of the complex environment. Even though multisensory integration is fundamentally essential for animal life, our understanding of the underlying mechanisms, especially at the molecular, synaptic and circuit levels, remains poorly understood. The study of sensory perception in Caenorhabditis elegans has begun to fill this gap. We have gained a considerable amount of insight into the general principles of sensory neurobiology owing to C. elegans&amp;amp;rsquo; highly sensitive perceptions, relatively simple nervous system, ample genetic tools and completely mapped neural connectome. Many interesting paradigms of multisensory integration have been characterized in C. elegans, for which input convergence occurs at the sensory neuron or the interneuron level. In this narrative review, we describe some representative cases of multisensory integration in C. elegans, summarize the underlying mechanisms and compare them with those in mammalian systems. Despite the differences, we believe C. elegans is able to provide unique insights into how processing and integrating multisensory inputs can generate flexible and adaptive behaviors. With the emergence of whole brain imaging, the ability of C. elegans to monitor nearly the entire nervous system may be crucial for understanding the function of the brain as a whole.</p>

	<p>The present work is a replication article based on the paper &amp;amp;ldquo;Are there shared neural correlates between dyslexia and ADHD? A meta-analysis of voxel-based morphometry studies&amp;amp;rdquo; by McGrath and Stoodley (2019). In the original research, the authors used activation likelihood estimation (ALE), a technique to perform coordinate-based meta-analysis (CBMA), to investigate the existence of brain regions undergoing gray matter alteration in association with both attention-deficit/hyper-activity disorder (ADHD) and dyslexia. Here, the same voxel-based morphometry dataset was analyzed, while using the permutation-subject images version of signed differential mapping (PSI-SDM) in place of ALE. Overall, the replication converged with the original paper in showing a limited overlap between the two conditions. In particular, no significant effect was found for dyslexia, therefore precluding any form of comparison between the two disorders. The possible influences of biological sex, age, and medication status were also ruled out. Our findings are in line with literature about gray matter alteration associated with ADHD and dyslexia, often showing conflicting results. Therefore, although neuropsychological and clinical evidence suggest some convergence between ADHD and dyslexia, more future research is sorely needed to reach a consensus on the neuroimaging domain in terms of patterns of gray matter alteration.</p>

	<p>Proper brain development requires the precise coordination and orchestration of various molecular and cellular processes and dysregulation of these processes can lead to neurological diseases. In the past decades, post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression has been shown to contribute to various aspects of brain development and function in the central nervous system. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), short non-coding RNAs, are emerging as crucial players in post-transcriptional gene regulation in a variety of tissues, such as the nervous system. In recent years, miRNAs have been implicated in multiple aspects of brain development, including neurogenesis, migration, axon and dendrite formation, and synaptogenesis. Moreover, altered expression and dysregulation of miRNAs have been linked to neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a powerful imaging technology to obtain high-quality, detailed structural and functional information from the brains of human and animal models in a non-invasive manner. Because the spatial expression patterns of miRNAs in the brain, unlike those of DNA and RNA, remain largely unknown, a whole-brain imaging approach using MRI may be useful in revealing biological and pathological information about the brain affected by miRNAs. In this review, we highlight recent advancements in the research of miRNA-mediated modulation of neuronal processes that are important for brain development and their involvement in disease pathogenesis. Also, we overview each MRI technique, and its technological considerations, and discuss the applications of MRI techniques in miRNA research. This review aims to link miRNA biological study with MRI analytical technology and deepen our understanding of how miRNAs impact brain development and pathology of neurological diseases.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Stroke is a leading cause of human death and disability. Effective early treatments with reasonable therapeutic windows remain critically important to improve the outcomes of stroke. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is an established noninvasive technique that has been applied clinically and in animal research for multiple brain disorders, but few studies have examined acute neuroprotection against ischemic stroke. The present investigation tested the novel approach of low-frequency repetitive TMS (rTMS) as an acute treatment after ischemic stroke.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Adult male rats received focal ischemic surgery through occlusion of the right middle cerebral artery for 60 minutes. The rats received either rTMS or sham treatment with 1.5-, 3-, 4-, or 7-hour delay after the onset of stroke. Low-frequency and low-intensity rTMS was applied to the rat brain for two 30-minute episodes separated by a 1-hour interval.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Three days after stroke, compared to stroke controls, rats receiving rTMS treatment with a 1.5-hour delay showed a 35% reduction of infarct volume. Protective effects were also seen with 3- or 4-hour-delayed treatments by rTMS, shown as reduced infarct volume and cell death. rTMS treatment upregulated the antiapoptotic factor Bcl-2 and downregulated the proapoptotic caspase-3 cleavage, expressions of Bax and matrix metallopeptidase-9. In sensorimotor functional assessments 3 to 21 days after stroke, rats receiving rTMS treatment with a 1.5- or 3-hour delay showed significantly better performance compared to stroke controls.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>These results support the inference that low-frequency rTMS may be feasible as a neuroprotective acute treatment after ischemic stroke. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>
