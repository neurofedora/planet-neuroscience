              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10969861/most-recent">Developmental refinement of visual callosal inputs to ferret area 17</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Corticocortical connections link visual cortical areas in both the ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres. We studied the postnatal refinement of callosal connections linking multiple cortical areas with ferret area 17 during the period from just before eye opening (4 weeks) to 10 weeks of age. We aimed to determine (a) whether callosal projections from multiple visual cortical areas to area 17 refine with a similar rate and (b) whether the refinement of callosal projections parallels that of intrahemispheric cortical circuits. We injected the bidirectional tracer CTb into area 17, and mapped the areal and laminar distribution of labeled cells in visual areas of the contralateral hemisphere. Like intrahemispheric projections, callosal inputs to area 17 before eye opening are dominated by Suprasylvian area Ssy (with lesser and comparable input from areas 17, 18, 19, and 21), but within two weeks of eye opening are jointly dominated by area 18 Ssy inputs; however, there are fewer labeled cells in the contralateral hemisphere. Unlike intrahemispheric projections, there is no laminar reorganization of callosal inputs; in all visual areas and at all ages studied the greatest proportion of callosal projections arises from the infragranular layers. Also unlike intrahemispheric projections, the peak density of callosal cells in each area projecting to area 17 declines more modestly. These results reveal important similarities and differences in the postnatal reorganization of inter- and intrahemispheric projections to area 17.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Efficacy of mesenchymal stromal cells in preclinical models of necrotizing enterocolitis: a systematic review protocol [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: Necrotizing enterocolitis is an acute inflammatory disease of the intestine that can lead to necrosis and bowel perforation. It is a severe complication of preterm birth. It’s mortality rate is up to 50% and survival after necrotizing enterocolitis leads to long-term complications. The current treatment is supportive and includes bowel rest and decompression and antibiotics. Thus, new treatments are necessary to reduce mortality and morbidity. Mesenchymal stromal cells are known to have anti-inflammatory properties and might be a promising option for treatment. Here we present a protocol for a systematic review with the aim to explore the efficacy of cell therapies with mesenchymal stromal cells in animal models of necrotizing enterocolitis. The primary outcome is histological signs of necrotizing enterocolitis. Additional outcomes include survival, bowel perforation, gut permeability, gut motility, levels of inflammatory markers, cytokine levels and adverse events. Methods: We will conduct a systematic search of MEDLINE, Embase, and Web of Science databases. The retrieved records will be screened individually by two investigators. We will include all preclinical in vivo animal models of experimentally induced necrotizing enterocolitis that evaluate the efficacy of mesenchymal stromal cells or other cell therapy treatments. Outcome data will be extracted from each article and risk of bias assessment performed. Funnel plots and SYRCLE’s risk of bias tool for animal studies will be used. Data will be reported as ratios, divided in predefined subgroups where relevant. Conclusions: This systematic review aims to examine the efficacy of mesenchymal stromal cells in preclinical models of necrotizing enterocolitis and whether there is sufficient evidence to support a clinical trial of efficacy and safety of the treatment with mesenchymal stromal cells in infants with necrotizing enterocolitis.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Spatio-temporal deep learning model for distortion classification in laparoscopic video [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Laparoscopy is a surgery performed in the abdomen without making large incisions in the skin and with the aid of a video camera, resulting in laparoscopic videos. The laparoscopic video is prone to various distortions such as noise, smoke, uneven illumination, defocus blur, and motion blur. One of the main components in the feedback loop of video enhancement systems is distortion identification, which automatically classifies the distortions affecting the videos and selects the video enhancement algorithm accordingly. This paper aims to address the laparoscopic video distortion identification problem by developing fast and accurate multi-label distortion classification using a deep learning model. Current deep learning solutions based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can address laparoscopic video distortion classification, but they learn only spatial information. Methods: In this paper, utilization of both spatial and temporal features in a CNN-long short-term memory (CNN-LSTM) model is proposed as a novel solution to enhance the classification. First, pre-trained ResNet50 CNN was used to extract spatial features from each video frame by transferring representation from large-scale natural images to laparoscopic images. Next, LSTM was utilized to consider the temporal relation between the features extracted from the laparoscopic video frames to produce multi-label categories. A novel laparoscopic video dataset proposed in the ICIP2020 challenge was used for training and evaluation of the proposed method. Results: The experiments conducted show that the proposed CNN-LSTM outperforms the existing solutions in terms of accuracy (85%), and F1-score (94.2%). Additionally, the proposed distortion identification model is able to run in real-time with low inference time (0.15 sec). Conclusions: The proposed CNN-LSTM model is a feasible solution to be utilized in laparoscopic videos for distortion identification.

                Determining a Hofstee cut-off point in medical education student assessment is problematic: traditional methods can be time-consuming, inaccurate, and inflexible.  To counter this, we developed a simple Android app that receives raw, unsorted student assessment data in .csv format, allows for multiple judges’ inputs, mean or median inputs, calculates the Hofstee cut-off mathematically, and outputs the results with other guiding information. The app contains a detailed description of its functionality.

                Coronavirus Disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic is caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 that has infected in a year more than 200 million people and has killed almost 4.5 million people worldwide. This infection affects mainly certain groups of people that have high susceptibility to present severe COVID-19 due to comorbidities. Moreover, the long-COVID-19 comprises a series of symptoms that may remain in some patients for months after infection that further compromises health of individuals. Therefore, this pandemic poses a serious emergency worldwide. Thus, since this pandemic is profoundly affecting economic and social life of societies, a deeper understanding of SARS-CoV-2 infection cycle could help to envisage novel therapeutic alternatives that limit or stop COVID-19. Several recent findings have unexpectedly found that mitochondria play a critical role in SARS-CoV-2 cell infection. Indeed, it has been suggested that this organelle could be the origin of its replication niches, the double membrane vesicles (DMV), as its been observed with another virus. In this regard, mitochondria derived vesicles (MDV), involved in mitochondria quality control, were discovered more than 10 years ago and interestingly there is a population characterized by a double membrane. MDV shedding is induced by mitochondrial stress and it has a fast assembly dynamic, reason that perhaps has precluded their identification in electron microscopy or tomography studies. These and other features of MDV together with recent SARS-CoV-2 protein interactome with the host and other findings linking SARS-CoV-2 to mitochondria, support that these vesicles are the precursors of SARS-CoV-2 induced DMV. In this work, the celular, molecular, phenotypical and biochemical evidence that supports this hypothesis is reviewed and integrated into the current model of SARS-CoV-2 cell infection. In this scheme, some relevant questions are raised as pending topics for research that would help in the near future to test this hypothesis. The intention (abstract truncated).

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">DeepCellState: An autoencoder-based framework for predicting cell type specific transcriptional states induced by drug treatment</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Ramzan Umarov, Yu Li, Erik Arner</p>

Drug treatment induces cell type specific transcriptional programs, and as the number of combinations of drugs and cell types grows, the cost for exhaustive screens measuring the transcriptional drug response becomes intractable. We developed DeepCellState, a deep learning autoencoder-based framework, for predicting the induced transcriptional state in a cell type after drug treatment, based on the drug response in another cell type. Training the method on a large collection of transcriptional drug perturbation profiles, prediction accuracy improves significantly over baseline and alternative deep learning approaches when applying the method to two cell types, with improved accuracy when generalizing the framework to additional cell types. Treatments with drugs or whole drug families not seen during training are predicted with similar accuracy, and the same framework can be used for predicting the results from other interventions, such as gene knock-downs. Finally, analysis of the trained model shows that the internal representation is able to learn regulatory relationships between genes in a fully data-driven manner.

                <p>by Bikash K. Bhandari, Chun Shen Lim, Daniela M. Remus, Augustine Chen, Craig van Dolleweerd, Paul P. Gardner</p>

Recombinant protein production is a key process in generating proteins of interest in the pharmaceutical industry and biomedical research. However, about 50% of recombinant proteins fail to be expressed in a variety of host cells. Here we show that the accessibility of translation initiation sites modelled using the mRNA base-unpairing across the Boltzmann’s ensemble significantly outperforms alternative features. This approach accurately predicts the successes or failures of expression experiments, which utilised <i>Escherichia coli</i> cells to express 11,430 recombinant proteins from over 189 diverse species. On this basis, we develop TIsigner that uses simulated annealing to modify up to the first nine codons of mRNAs with synonymous substitutions. We show that accessibility captures the key propensity beyond the target region (initiation sites in this case), as a modest number of synonymous changes is sufficient to tune the recombinant protein expression levels. We build a stochastic simulation model and show that higher accessibility leads to higher protein production and slower cell growth, supporting the idea of protein cost, where cell growth is constrained by protein circuits during over expression.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>In the highly dynamic metabolic landscape of a neuron, mitochondrial membrane architectures can provide critical insight into the unique energy balance of the cell. Current theoretical calculations of functional outputs like ATP and heat often represent mitochondria as idealized geometries and therefore can miscalculate the metabolic uxes. To analyze mitochondrial morphology in neurons of mouse cerebellum neuropil, 3D tracings of complete synaptic and axonal mitochondria were constructed using a database of serial TEM tomography images and converted to watertight meshes with minimal distortion of the original microscopy volumes with a granularity of 1.64 nanometer isotropic voxels. The resulting in silico representations were subsequently quanti ed by di erential geometry methods in terms of the mean and Gaussian curvatures, surface areas, volumes, and membrane motifs, all of which can alter the metabolic output of the organelle. Finally, we identify structural motifs present across this population of mitochondria, which may contribute to future modeling studies of mitochondrial physiology and metabolism in neurons.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The implications of Industry 4.0 on supply chains amid the COVID-19 pandemic: a systematic review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: COVID-19 has caused significant disruptions in supply chains. It has increased the demand for products and decreased the supply of raw materials. This has interrupted many production processes. The emerging technologies of Industry 4.0 have the potential to streamline supply chains by improving time-sensitive customized solutions during this emergency. Purpose: This research examines the effects of the epidemic on supply chains and how these effects are reduced through Industry 4.0 technology. Design/methodology/approach: An extensive literature review using the “Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis” method was carried out on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on supply chains and Industry 4.0 technologies. The study was undertaken by selecting keywords validated by experts and a search was conducted in the Scopus, ProQuest, and Google Scholar databases. Publications from the leading journals on these topics were selected. The bibliographical search resulted in 1484 articles followed by multiple layers of filtering. Finally, the most pertinent articles were selected for reviewing, and a total of 53 articles were analysed. Findings: This study discusses the impact of COVID-19 on the supply chain and how the emerging technologies of Industry 4.0 can help manufacturers to ease the impact. These technologies will enhance the production system through the automation and optimization of production flow convergence, enabling efficiencies and improvements among the suppliers, manufacturers, and consumers in the COVID-19 situation. Originality/value: The study summarizes the impact of the COVID-19 on supply chains and shows the potential of Industry 4.0 technologies to lessen the impact on manufacturing supply chains. This is valuable information for policymakers and practitioners so that they can get insights and take necessary actions.

                The lack of effective treatments for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and congenital hydrocephalus (CH) reflects the limited understanding of the biology underlying these common neurodevelopmental disorders. Although ASD and CH have been extensively studied as independent entities, recent human genomic and preclinical animal studies have uncovered shared molecular pathophysiology. Here, we review and discuss phenotypic, genomic, and molecular similarities between ASD and CH, and identify the PTEN–PI3K–mTOR (phosphatase and tensin homolog–phosphoinositide 3-kinase–mammalian target of rapamycin) pathway as a common underlying mechanism that holds diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic promise for individuals with ASD and CH.

                Duan et al. reveal a key role of mitophagy in anxiety induced by chronic psychogenic stress. Mitophagy is enhanced by stress to cause mitochondrial loss, leading to synaptic weakening in the anxiolytic pathway mediated by the extended amygdala.

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/neuron/inpress.rss">Flexible inhibitory control of visually evoked defensive behavior by the ventral lateral geniculate nucleus</a></h4>

              
                Animals can act upon or ignore stimuli, depending on their prior knowledge. Here, Fratzl et al. identify the vLGN as critical for the control of defensive responses evoked by visual stimuli in mice. vLGN activity reflects previous experience of threat, and this nucleus, thus, regulates escape from visual threat depending on the animal’s knowledge.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">cAMP triggers Na+ absorption by distal airway surface epithelium in cystic fibrosis swine</a></h4>

              
                Hyperactive epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC) is believed to contribute to excessive Na+ and fluid reabsorption in cystic fibrosis airways. This hypothesis has been challenged by studies in CFTR−/− swine showing no increased Na+ reabsorption. Luan et al. report that cAMP-stimulated distal airways of CFTR−/− swine suffer from ENaC-mediated Na+ reabsorption.

                Muzzu and Saleem find neurons in the mouse visual cortex responding to stops or perturbations of open-loop visual flow. Perturbation responses are enhanced by running, and responsive neurons prefer low visual speeds. These results suggest concurrent selectivity for low visual speeds and running can explain sensorimotor mismatch signals in the visual cortex.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Functional drug susceptibility testing using single-cell mass predicts treatment outcome in patient-derived cancer neurosphere models</a></h4>

              
                Stockslager et al. find in a retrospective study that functional drug susceptibility testing predicts the response of patients with glioblastoma to chemotherapy. By detecting subtle changes in tumor cell mass after ex vivo drug exposure, treatment response can be predicted with power comparable to the standard-of-care genomic biomarker.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">c-FOS drives reversible basal to squamous cell carcinoma transition</a></h4>

              
                Kuonen et al. use a multi-omics approach to decipher the molecular mechanisms of skin cancer plasticity. They demonstrate that c-FOS drives basal to squamous cell carcinoma transition (BST) through AP-1-related non-genetic modifications. Based on BST reversibility, they identify targetable candidates, offering a therapeutic opportunity to prevent tumor plasticity and improve patient outcomes.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">PIWI-mediated control of tissue-specific transposons is essential for somatic cell differentiation</a></h4>

              
                Chromatin reorganization is an essential part of cell differentiation but risks reactivation of silenced repetitive elements. Li et al. show that planarians use continuous surveillance by a nuclear PIWI protein to chaperone the chromatin transition from pluripotent to differentiated cell, which is crucial for the planarian’s impressive regeneration and homeostasis.

                Trigg et al. demonstrate a mechanistic link between paternal insult (acrylamide) and downstream alterations in male reproductive tract biochemistry, sperm-sncRNA profiles, dysregulation of the early embryo transcriptome, and ultimately, compromise of embryonic developmental potential. This represents an important step toward alleviating environmental effects on the sperm sncRNA profile.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Regulation of CYLD activity and specificity by phosphorylation and ubiquitin-binding CAP-Gly domains</a></h4>

              
                Elliott et al. show that the catalytic activity of CYLD relies on ubiquitin binding via its CAP-Gly3 domain, and they identify a phosphorylation switch that stimulates cleavage of Lys63-Ub. Cellular work provides evidence that phosphorylated CYLD balances Lys63- and Met1-linked polyubiquitin at receptor signaling complexes to promote LUBAC signaling.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Collective regulation of chromatin modifications predicts replication timing during cell cycle</a></h4>

              
                Van Rechem et al. establish that collective histone mark dynamics and their associated regulation modulate replication timing (RT). Four primary chromatin states define 97% of the mappable genome and associate with RT patterns. The K9/K36me3 demethylase KDM4A controls 11% of RT genome-wide through broad histone marks, especially H3K36me2, and enhancers.

                Borgmeyer et al. provide a resource of lipid and protein content of forebrain synaptic junctions. This Multiomics is suitable to generate hypotheses on lipid signaling pathways that are altered by enriched environment in mice. The data suggest that changes in endocannabinoid signaling might affect synaptic plasticity.

                The dramatically expanding COVID-19 needs multiple effective countermeasures. Neutralizing nanobodies (Nbs) are a potential therapeutic strategy for treating COVID-19. Here, we characterize several RBD-specific Nbs isolated from an Nb library derived from an alpaca immunized with SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (S); among them, three Nbs exhibit picomolar potency against SARS-CoV-2 live virus, pseudotyped viruses, and circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants. To improve the efficacy, various configurations of Nbs are engineered.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Cell-to-cell heterogeneity in Sox2 and Bra expression guides progenitor motility and destiny</a></h4>

              
                Although cell-to-cell heterogeneity in gene and protein expression within cell populations has been widely documented, we know little about its biological functions. By studying progenitors of the posterior region of bird embryos, we found that expression levels of transcription factors Sox2 and Bra, respectively involved in neural tube (NT) and mesoderm specification, display a high degree of cell-to-cell heterogeneity. By combining forced expression and downregulation approaches with time-lapse imaging, we demonstrate that Sox2-to-Bra ratio guides progenitor’s motility and their ability to stay in or exit the progenitor zone to integrate neural or mesodermal tissues. Indeed, high Bra levels confer high motility that pushes cells to join the paraxial mesoderm, while high levels of Sox2 tend to inhibit cell movement forcing cells to integrate the NT. Mathematical modeling captures the importance of cell motility regulation in this process and further suggests that randomness in Sox2/Bra cell-to-cell distribution favors cell rearrangements and tissue shape conservation.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Microglia and CD206+ border-associated mouse macrophages maintain their embryonic origin during Alzheimer's disease</a></h4>

              
                Brain microglia and border-associated macrophages (BAMs) display distinct spatial, developmental, and phenotypic features. Although at steady-state, the origins of distinct brain macrophages are well-documented, the dynamics of their replenishment in neurodegenerative disorders remain elusive, particularly for activated CD11c<sup>+</sup> microglia and BAMs. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive fate-mapping analysis of murine microglia and BAMs and their turnover kinetics during Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression. We used a novel inducible AD mouse model to investigate the contribution of bone marrow cells to the pool of foetal-derived brain macrophages during the development of AD. We demonstrated that microglia remain a remarkably stable embryonic-derived population even during the progression of AD pathology, indicating that neither parenchymal macrophage subpopulation originates from, nor are replenished by, bone marrow (BM)-derived cells. At the border-associated brain regions, bona fide CD206<sup>+ </sup>BAMs are minimally replaced by BM-derived cells, and their turnover rates are not accelerated by AD. In contrast, all other myeloid cells are swiftly replenished by BM progenitors. This information further elucidates the turnover kinetics of these cells not only at steady-state, but also in neurodegenerative diseases, which is crucial for identifying potential novel therapeutic targets.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Visually induced changes in cytokine production in the chick choroid</a></h4>

              
                Postnatal ocular growth is regulated by a vision-dependent mechanism which acts to minimize refractive error through coordinated growth of the ocular tissues. Of great interest is the identification of the chemical signals that control visually-guided ocular growth. Here we provide evidence that the pro-inflammatory cytokine, Interleukin-6 (IL-6), may play a pivotal role in the control of ocular growth using a chicken model of myopia. Microarray, real time RT-qPCR, and ELISA analyses identified IL-6 upregulation in the choroids of chick eyes under two visual conditions that introduce myopic defocus and slow the rate of ocular elongation (recovery from induced myopia and compensation for positive lenses). Intraocular administration of atropine, an agent known to slow ocular elongation, also resulted in an increase in choroidal IL-6 gene expression. Nitric oxide appears to directly or indirectly upregulate choroidal IL-6 gene expression, as administration of the non-specific nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, L-NAME, inhibited choroidal IL-6 gene expression, and application of a nitric oxide donor stimulated IL-6 gene and protein expression in isolated chick choroids. Considering the pleiotropic nature of IL-6 and involvement in many biological processes, these results suggest that IL-6 may mediate many aspects of the choroidal response in the control of ocular growth.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Protective mitochondrial fission induced by stress-responsive protein GJA1-20k</a></h4>

              
                The Connexin43 gap junction gene <i>GJA1</i> has one coding exon, but its mRNA undergoes internal translation to generate N-terminal truncated isoforms of Connexin43 with the predominant isoform being only 20 kDa in size (GJA1-20k). Endogenous GJA1-20k protein is not membrane bound and has been found to increase in response to ischemic stress, localize to mitochondria, and mimic ischemic preconditioning protection in the heart. However, it is not known how GJA1-20k benefits mitochondria to provide this protection. Here, using human cells and mice, we identify that GJA1-20k polymerizes actin around mitochondria which induces focal constriction sites. Mitochondrial fission events occur within about 45 s of GJA1-20k recruitment of actin. Interestingly, GJA1-20k mediated fission is independent of canonical Dynamin-Related Protein 1 (DRP1). We find that GJA1-20k-induced smaller mitochondria have decreased reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and, in hearts, provide potent protection against ischemia-reperfusion injury. The results indicate that stress responsive internally translated GJA1-20k stabilizes polymerized actin filaments to stimulate non-canonical mitochondrial fission which limits ischemic-reperfusion induced myocardial infarction.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Modelling the neural code in large populations of correlated neurons</a></h4>

              
                Neurons respond selectively to stimuli, and thereby define a code that associates stimuli with population response patterns. Certain correlations within population responses (noise correlations) significantly impact the information content of the code, especially in large populations. Understanding the neural code thus necessitates response models that quantify the coding properties of modelled populations, while fitting large-scale neural recordings and capturing noise correlations. In this paper we propose a class of response model based on mixture models and exponential families. We show how to fit our models with expectation-maximization, and that they capture diverse variability and covariability in recordings of macaque primary visual cortex. We also show how they facilitate accurate Bayesian decoding, provide a closed-form expression for the Fisher information, and are compatible with theories of probabilistic population coding. Our framework could allow researchers to quantitatively validate the predictions of neural coding theories against both large-scale neural recordings and cognitive performance.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Redefining innate natural antibodies as important contributors to anti-tumor immunity</a></h4>

              
                Myeloid, T and NK cells are key players in the elimination phase of cancer immunoediting, also referred to as cancer immunosurveillance. However, the role of B cells and NAbs, which are present prior to the encounter with cognate antigens, has been overlooked. One reason is due to the popular use of a single B cell-deficient mouse model, muMT mice. Cancer models using muMT mice display a similar tumor burden as their WT counterparts. Empirically, we observe what others have previously reported with muMT mice. However, using two other B cell-deficient mouse models (IgHELMD4 and CD19<sup>creDTA</sup>), we show a 3 to 5-fold increase in tumor burden relative to WT mice. In addition, using an unconventional, non-cancer-related, immune neoantigen model where hypoxic conditions and cell clustering are absent, we provide evidence that B cells and their innate, natural antibodies (NAbs) are critical for the detection and elimination of neoantigen-expressing cells. Finally, we find that muMT mice display anti-tumor immunity because of an unexpected compensatory mechanism consisting of significantly enhanced Type 1 interferon (IFN)-producing plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), which recruit a substantial number of NK cells to the tumor microenvironment compared to WT mice. Diminishing this compensatory pDC-IFN-NK cell mechanism revealed that muMT mice develop a 3 to 5-fold increase in tumor burden compared to WT mice. In summary, our findings suggest that NAbs are part of an early defense against not only microorganisms and dying cells, but precancerous cells as well.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">HIV status alters disease severity and immune cell responses in beta variant SARS-CoV-2 infection wave</a></h4>

              
                There are conflicting reports on the effects of HIV on COVID-19. Here we analyzed disease severity and immune cell changes during and after SARS-CoV-2 infection in 236 participants from South Africa, of which 39% were people living with HIV (PLWH), during the first and second (beta dominated) infection waves. The second wave had more PLWH requiring supplemental oxygen relative to HIV negative participants. Higher disease severity was associated with low CD4 T cell counts and higher neutrophil to lymphocyte ratios (NLR). Yet, CD4 counts recovered and NLR stabilized after SARS-CoV-2 clearance in wave 2 infected PLWH, arguing for an interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and HIV infection leading to low CD4 and high NLR. The first infection wave, where severity in HIV negative and PLWH was similar, still showed some HIV modulation of SARS-CoV-2 immune responses. Therefore, HIV infection can synergize with the SARS-CoV-2 variant to change COVID-19 outcomes.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">3D Cell neighbour dynamics in growing pseudostratified epithelia</a></h4>

              
                During morphogenesis, epithelial sheets remodel into complex geometries. How cells dynamically organize their contact with neighbouring cells in these tightly packed tissues is poorly understood. We have used light-sheet microscopy of growing mouse embryonic lung explants, three-dimensional cell segmentation, and physical theory to unravel the principles behind 3D cell organization in growing pseudostratified epithelia. We find that cells have highly irregular 3D shapes and exhibit numerous neighbour intercalations along the apical-basal axis as well as over time. Despite the fluidic nature, the cell packing configurations follow fundamental relationships previously described for apical epithelial layers, i.e., Euler's formula, Lewis' law, and Aboav-Weaire's law, at all times and across the entire tissue thickness. This arrangement minimizes the lateral cell-cell surface energy for a given cross-sectional area variability, generated primarily by the distribution and movement of nuclei. We conclude that the complex 3D cell organization in growing epithelia emerges from simple physical principles.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Dynamic dichotomy of accumbal population activity underlies cocaine sensitization</a></h4>

              
                Locomotor sensitization (LS) is an early behavioral adaptation to addictive drugs, driven by the increase of dopamine in the Nucleus Accumbens (NAc). However, the effect on accumbal population activity remains elusive. Here we used single cell calcium imaging in mice to record the activity of dopamine-1-receptor (D1R) and dopamine-2-receptor (D2R) expressing spiny projection neurons (SPNs) during cocaine LS. Acute exposure to cocaine elevated D1R SPN activity and reduced D2R SPN activity, albeit with high variability between neurons. During LS, the number of D1R and D2R neurons responding in opposite directions increased. Moreover, preventing LS by inhibition of the ERK signaling pathway decreased the number of cocaine responsive D1R SPNs, but had little effect on D2R SPNs. These results indicate that accumbal population dichotomy is dynamic and contains a subgroup of D1R SPNs that eventually drives LS. Insights into the drug-related activity dynamics provides a foundation for understanding the circuit-level addiction pathogenesis.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A sex-specific evolutionary interaction between ADCY9 and CETP</a></h4>

              
                Pharmacogenomic studies have revealed associations between rs1967309 in the adenylyl cyclase type 9 (<i>ADCY9</i>) gene and clinical responses to the cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) modulator dalcetrapib, however, the mechanism behind this interaction is still unknown. Here, we characterized selective signals at the locus associated with the pharmacogenomic response in human populations and we show that rs1967309 region exhibits signatures of positive selection in several human populations. Furthermore, we identified a variant in <i>CETP</i>, rs158477, which is in long-range linkage disequilibrium with rs1967309 in the Peruvian population. The signal is mainly seen in males, a sex-specific result that is replicated in the LIMAA cohort of over 3,400 Peruvians. Analyses of RNA-seq data further suggest an epistatic interaction on <i>CETP</i> expression levels between the two SNPs in multiple tissues, which also differs between males and females. We also detected interaction effects of the two SNPs with sex on cardiovascular phenotypes in the UK Biobank, in line with the sex-specific genotype associations found in Peruvians at these loci. We propose that <i>ADCY9 </i>and <i>CETP </i>coevolved during recent human evolution due to sex-specific selection, which points towards a biological link between dalcetrapib’s pharmacogene <i>ADCY9 </i>and its therapeutic target <i>CETP.</i>

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">DDK/Hsk1 phosphorylates and targets fission yeast histone deacetylase Hst4 for degradation to stabilize stalled DNA replication forks</a></h4>

              
                In eukaryotes, paused replication forks are prone to collapse, which leads to genomic instability, a hallmark of cancer. Dbf4 Dependent Kinase (DDK)/Hsk1<sup>Cdc7 </sup>is a conserved replication initiator kinase with conflicting roles in replication stress response. Here, we show that fission yeast DDK/Hsk1 phosphorylates sirtuin, Hst4 upon replication stress at C-terminal serine residues. Phosphorylation of Hst4 by DDK marks it for degradation via the ubiquitin ligase SCF<sup>pof3</sup>. Phosphorylation defective<i> hst4</i> mutant (<i>4SA-hst4</i>) displays defective recovery from replication stress, faulty fork restart, slow S-phase progression and decreased viability. The highly conserved Fork Protection Complex (FPC) stabilizes stalled replication forks. We found that the recruitment of FPC components, Swi1 and Mcl1 to the chromatin is compromised in the <i>4SA-hst4 </i>mutant, although whole cell levels increased. These defects are dependent upon H3K56ac and independent of intra S-phase checkpoint activation. Finally, we show conservation of H3K56ac dependent regulation of Timeless, Tipin and And-1 in human cells. We propose that degradation of Hst4 via DDK increases H3K56ac, changing the chromatin state in the vicinity of stalled forks facilitating recruitment and function of FPC. Overall, this study identified a crucial role of DDK and FPC in the regulation of replication stress response with implications in cancer therapeutics.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Visualizing formation of the active site in the mitochondrial ribosome</a></h4>

              
                Ribosome assembly is an essential and conserved process that is regulated at each step by specific factors. Using cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), we visualize the formation of the conserved peptidyl transferase center (PTC) of the human mitochondrial ribosome. The conserved GTPase GTPBP7 regulates the correct folding of 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) helices and ensures 2ʹ-O-methylation of the PTC base U3039. GTPBP7 binds the RNA methyltransferase NSUN4 and MTERF4, which sequester H68-71 of the 16S rRNA and allow biogenesis factors to access the maturing PTC. Mutations that disrupt binding of their <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> orthologs to the large subunit potently activate mitochondrial stress and cause viability, development, and sterility defects. Next-generation RNA sequencing reveals widespread gene expression changes in these mutant animals that are indicative of mitochondrial stress response activation. We also answer the long-standing question of why NSUN4, but not its enzymatic activity, is indispensable for mitochondrial protein synthesis.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Unbiased identification of novel transcription factors in striatal compartmentation and striosome maturation</a></h4>

              
                Many diseases are linked to dysregulation of the striatum. Striatal function depends on neuronal compartmentation into striosomes and matrix. Striatal projection neurons are GABAergic medium spiny neurons (MSNs), subtyped by selective expression of receptors, neuropeptides, and other gene families. Neurogenesis of the striosome and matrix occurs in separate waves, but the factors regulating compartmentation and neuronal differentiation are largely unidentified. We performed RNA- and ATAC-seq on sorted striosome and matrix cells at postnatal day 3, using the <i>Nr4a1</i>-EGFP striosome reporter mouse. Focusing on the striosome, we validated the localization and/or role of <i>Irx1</i>, <i>Foxf2</i>, <i>Olig2</i>, and <i>Stat1/2</i> in the developing striosome and the in vivo enhancer function of a striosome-specific open chromatin region 4.4 Kb downstream of <i>Olig2</i>. These data provide novel tools to dissect and manipulate the networks regulating MSN compartmentation and differentiation, including in human iPSC-derived striatal neurons for disease modeling and drug discovery.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">β-Catenin-NFkB-CFTR interactions in cholangiocytes regulate inflammation and fibrosis during ductular reaction</a></h4>

              
                Expansion of biliary epithelial cells (BECs) during ductular reaction (DR) is observed in liver diseases including cystic fibrosis (CF), and associated with inflammation and fibrosis, <i>albeit</i> without complete understanding of underlying mechanism. Using two different genetic mouse knockouts of b-catenin, one with b-catenin loss is hepatocytes and BECs (KO1), and another with loss in only hepatocytes (KO2), we demonstrate disparate long-term repair after an initial injury by 2-week choline-deficient ethionine-supplemented diet. KO2 show gradual liver repopulation with BEC-derived b-catenin-positive hepatocytes, and resolution of injury. KO1 showed persistent loss of b-catenin, NF-kB activation in BECs, progressive DR and fibrosis, reminiscent of CF histology. We identify interactions of b-catenin, NFkB and CF transmembranous conductance regulator (CFTR) in BECs. Loss of CFTR or b-catenin led to NF-kB activation, DR and inflammation. Thus, we report a novel b-catenin-NFkB-CFTR interactome in BECs, and its disruption may contribute to hepatic pathology of CF.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Neural excitability and sensory input determine intensity perception with opposing directions in initial cortical responses</a></h4>

              
                Perception of sensory information is determined by stimulus features (e.g., intensity) and instantaneous neural states (e.g., excitability). Commonly, it is assumed that both are reflected similarly in evoked brain potentials, that is, larger amplitudes are associated with a stronger percept of a stimulus. We tested this assumption in a somatosensory discrimination task in humans, simultaneously assessing (i) single-trial excitatory post-synaptic currents inferred from short-latency somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs), (ii) pre-stimulus alpha oscillations (8–13 Hz), and (iii) peripheral nerve measures. Fluctuations of neural excitability shaped the perceived stimulus intensity already during the very first cortical response (at ~20 ms) yet demonstrating opposite neural signatures as compared to the effect of presented stimulus intensity. We reconcile this discrepancy via a common framework based on the modulation of electro-chemical membrane gradients linking neural states and responses, which calls for reconsidering conventional interpretations of brain potential magnitudes in stimulus intensity encoding.

                Here, we present evidence showing Piezo1 expression in the primary sensory neurons (PSNs) and non-neuronal cells of rat peripheral nervous system. Using a knockdown/knockout validated antibody, we detected Piezo1 immunoreactivity (IR) in ~80% of PSNs of rat dorsal root ganglia (DRG) with higher IR density in the small- and medium-sized neurons, and within axons extending to both central presynaptic terminals innervating to the spinal dorsal horn and peripheral cutaneous sensory terminals in the skin. Piezo-IR was clearly identified in DRG perineuronal glia, including satellite glial cells (SGCs) and non-myelinating Schwann cells; in sciatic nerve Schwann cells surrounding the axons and cutaneous afferent endings; and in skin epidermal Merkel cells and melanocytes. Neuronal and non-neuronal Piezo1 channels were functional, since various cells (dissociated PSNs and SGCs from DRGs, isolated Schwann cells, and primary human melanocytes) exhibited a robust response to Piezo1 agonist Yoda1 by an increase of intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i). These responses were abolished by Piezo1 antagonist GsMTx4. Immunoblots showed elevated Piezo1 protein in DRG proximal to peripheral nerve injury-induced painful neuropathy, while PSNs and SGCs from rats with neuropathic pain showed greater Yuda1-evoked elevation of [Ca2+]i and an increased frequency of cells responding to Yoda1, compared to controls. Ipsilateral sciatic nerve application of GsMTx4 alleviated mechanical hypersensitivity following nerve injury. Overall, our data show that Piezo1 is widely expressed by the neuronal and non-neuronal cells in the peripheral sensory pathways and that painful nerve injury is associated with activation of Piezo1 in PSNs and peripheral glia cells.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Linking contrast sensitivity to cortical magnification in human primary visual cortex</a></h4>

              
                The size and organization of primary visual cortex (V1) varies across individuals. Across individuals, V1 size varies more than twofold. Within individuals, cortical magnification varies with eccentricity and polar angle. Contrast sensitivity has been hypothesized to be limited by cortical resources, and specifically by the number of activated V1 neurons. Here, we quantify the relation between contrast sensitivity and V1 cortical magnification as a function of both individual observers and polar angle. We measured contrast sensitivity at four polar angle meridians in 29 observers. We then used fMRI to measure the size of V1 in the same observers, and the amount of surface area representing the same four meridians as the contrast sensitivity measurements (wedge-ROIs within 15 deg of the meridians, extending from 1 to 8 deg eccentricity). We found that: First, average contrast sensitivity per observer (averaged across polar angles) was predicted by the overall size of V1. Second, contrast sensitivity at each polar angle location was correlated with the surface area of the wedge-ROIs centered at the corresponding meridian. Third, the increases for contrast sensitivity and cortical magnification at the horizontal compared to vertical meridian (horizontal-vertical anisotropy, 'HVA') were strongly correlated: a larger HVA in contrast sensitivity corresponded to a larger HVA in cortical magnification. These results reveal that contrast sensitivity and cortical magnification co-vary across observers and demonstrate a link between perceptual polar angle asymmetries and cortical anatomy. Broadly, the results show a link between visual perception and the idiosyncratic cortical organization of V1 of neurotypical observers.

                Experience-dependent learning depends on synaptic plasticity. While plasticity in individual synapses has been extensively investigated, the mechanisms underlying coordinated changes across sets of synapses on multiple dendrites, likely needed to encode effective adaptations to a salient stimulus, are not well understood. The extracellular matrix is uniquely well suited to fulfill this function, as rapid glia-driven remodeling of its local composition powerfully impact synaptic plasticity. We show that extracellular matrix microenvironments, named CS6 clusters, dynamically form around several dendrites in response to sensory stimuli in coincidence to stimulus-driven synaptic plasticity. CS6 clusters, formed by glia-dependent secretion of extracellular matrix components surrounding sets of adjacent dendrites, may represent a novel structure supporting coordinated synaptic plasticity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Video-evoked fMRI BOLD responses are highly consistent across different data acquisition sites</a></h4>

              
                Naturalistic imaging paradigms, in which participants view complex videos in the scanner, are increasingly used in human cognitive neuroscience. Videos evoke temporally synchronized brain responses that are similar across subjects as well as within subjects, but the reproducibility of these brain responses across different data acquisition sites has not yet been quantified. Here we characterize the consistency of brain responses across independent samples of participants viewing the same videos in fMRI scanners at different sites (Indiana University and Caltech). We compared brain responses collected at these different sites for two carefully matched datasets with identical scanner models, acquisition, and preprocessing details, along with a third unmatched dataset in which these details varied. Our overall conclusion is that for matched and unmatched datasets alike, video-evoked brain responses have high consistency across these different sites, both when compared across groups and across pairs of individuals. As one might expect, differences between sites were larger for unmatched datasets than matched datasets. Residual differences between datasets could in part reflect participant-level variability rather than scanner- or data- related effects. Altogether our results indicate promise for the development and, critically, generalization of video fMRI studies of individual differences in healthy and clinical populations alike.

                N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDAR) are downregulated in schizophrenia possibly through microRNAs (miRNAs) that are differentially expressed in this condition. We screened the miRNAs that are altered in schizophrenia against the targets, Grin2A and Grin2B subunits of NMDAR using bioinformatic tools. Among the predicted miRNAs some interacted with the 3`UTR sequences of Grin2A (miR-296, miR-148b, miR-129-2, miR-137) and Grin2B (miR-296, miR-148b, miR-129-2, miR-223) in dual luciferase assays. This was supported by downregulation of the GluN2B protein in primary hippocampal neurons upon overexpressing Grin2B targeting miRNAs. In two models of schizophrenia- pharmacological MK-801 model and neurodevelopmental methylazoxymethanol acetate (MAM) model which showed cognitive deficits - protein levels of GluN2A and GluN2B were downregulated but their transcript levels were upregulated. MiR-296-3p, miR-148b-5p and miR-137 levels showed upregulation in both models which could have interacted with Grin2A/Grin2B transcripts resulting in translational arrest. In MAM model, reciprocal changes in the expression of the 3p and 5p forms of miR-148b and miR-137 were observed. Expression of neuregulin 1 (NRG1), BDNF and CaMKII, genes implicated in schizophrenia, were also altered in these models. This is the first report of downregulation of GluN2A and GluN2B by miR-296, miR-148b and miR-129-2. Mining miRNAs regulating NMDA receptors might give insights into the pathophysiology of this disorder, providing avenues in therapeutics.

                Consciousness is not explained by a single mechanism, rather it involves multiple specialized neural systems overlapping in space and time. We hypothesize that synergistic, large-scale subcortical and cortical attention and signal processing networks encode conscious experiences. To identify brain activity in conscious perception without overt report, we classified visual stimuli as perceived or not using eye measurements. Report-independent event-related potentials and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signals both occurred at early times after stimuli. Direct recordings revealed a novel thalamic awareness potential linked to conscious visual perception based on report. fMRI showed thalamic and cortical detection, arousal, attentional salience, task-positive, and default mode networks were involved independent of overt report. These findings identify a specific sequence of neural mechanisms in human conscious visual perception.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">DLPFC controls the rapid neural response to visual threat: An ERP and rTMS study</a></h4>

              
                Individuals are faster at detecting threatening stimuli than neutral stimuli. While generally considered a rapid bottom-up response, this threat superiority effect is also modulated by top-down mechanisms known to rely on the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). What remains unclear is whether the response is modulated only at later stages of processing, or whether rapid attention to threat itself is controlled in a top-down manner. To test this, we used repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to inhibit activity in the DLPFC, and measured EEG to index the immediate neural response to threat. Participants attended two sessions where they performed a visual search task with threatening or neutral targets. Prior to this, they received 15 minutes of 1 Hz inhibitory or sham rTMS targeting the right DLPFC. We measured the impact of rTMS on the P1, a rapid visually-evoked potential that is modulated by attention. We found that threatening targets increased the amplitude of the P1 in the sham condition, but inhibition of the DLPFC abolished this increase. These results suggest that the neural signature of rapid attentional detection of threat, even at its earliest stage, is influenced in a top-down fashion by the right DLPFC.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Reactivating Memories from a Mathematical Task over a Period of Sleep</a></h4>

              
                Sleep, especially slow-wave sleep (SWS), has been found to facilitate memory consolidation for many types of learning. Mathematical learning, however, has seldom been examined in this context. Solving multiplication problems involves multiple steps before problems can be mastered or answers memorized, and thus it can depend on both skill learning and fact learning. Here we aimed to test the hypothesis that memory reactivation during sleep contributes to multiplication learning. To do so, we used a technique known as targeted memory reactivation (TMR), or the pairing of newly learned information with specific stimuli that are later presented during sleep. With TMR, specific memories can be reactivated over a period of sleep without disrupting ongoing sleep. We applied TMR during an afternoon nap to reactivate half of the multiplication problems that had previously been practiced. Results showed no effect of TMR on response time or accuracy of multiplication problem solving. Because these results were unexpected, we also used a variation of this paradigm to examine results in subjects who remained awake. Comparisons between the wake and sleep groups showed no difference in response time or accuracy in either the initial test or the final test. Although neither TMR nor sleep differentially influenced multiplication performance, correlational analysis provided some clues about mathematical problem solving and sleep. On the basis of these findings, even though they did not provide convincing support for our hypotheses, we suggest future experiments that could help produce a better understanding of the relevance of sleep and memory reactivation for this type of learning.

                Adolescence is a crucial developmental period in terms of behavior and mental health. Therefore, understanding how the brain develops during this stage is a fundamental challenge for neuroscience. Recent studies have modelled the brain as a network or connectome, mainly applying measures from graph theory, showing a change in its functional organization such as an increase in its segregation and integration. Topological Data Analysis (TDA) complements such modelling by extracting high-dimensional features across the whole range of connectivity values, instead of exploring a fixed set of connections. This study enquiries into the developmental trajectories of such properties using a longitudinal sample of typically developing participants (N = 98; 53/45 F/M; 6.7-18.1 years), applying TDA into their functional connectomes. In addition, we explore the effect of puberty on the individual developmental trajectories. Results showed that compared to random networks, the adolescent brain is more segregated at the global level, but more densely connected at the local level. Furthermore, developmental effects showed nonlinear trajectories for the integration of the whole brain and fronto-parietal networks, with an inflection point and increasing trajectories after puberty onset. These results add to the insights in the development of the functional organization of the adolescent.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">CNN MouseNet: A biologically constrained convolutional neural network model for mouse visual cortex</a></h4>

              
                Convolutional neural networks trained on object recognition derive inspiration from the neural architecture of the visual system in primates, and have been used as models of the feedforward computation performed in the primate ventral stream. In contrast to the deep hierarchical organization of primates, the visual system of the mouse has a shallower arrangement. Since mice and primates are both capable of visually guided behavior, this raises questions about the role of architecture in neural computation. In this work, we introduce a novel framework for building a biologically constrained convolutional neural network model of the mouse visual cortex. The architecture and structural parameters of the network are derived from experimental measurements, specifically the 100-micrometer resolution interareal connectome, the estimates of numbers of neurons in each area and cortical layer, and the statistics of connections between cortical layers. This network is constructed to support detailed task-optimized models of mouse visual cortex, with neural populations that can be compared to specific corresponding populations in the mouse brain. Using a well-studied image classification task as our working example, we demonstrate the computational capability of this mouse-sized network. Given its relatively small size, MouseNet achieves roughly 2/3rds the performance level on ImageNet as VGG16. In combination with the large scale Allen Brain Observatory Visual Coding dataset, we use representational similarity analysis to quantify the extent to which MouseNet recapitulates the neural representation in mouse visual cortex. Importantly, we provide evidence that optimizing for task performance does not improve similarity to the corresponding biological system beyond a certain point. We demonstrate that the distributions of some physiological quantities are closer to the observed distributions in the mouse brain after task training. We encourage the use of the MouseNet architecture by making the code freely available.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Selective behavioural impairments in mice heterozygous for the cross disorder psychiatric risk gene DLG2</a></h4>

              
                Mutations affecting DLG2 are emerging as a genetic risk factor associated with neurodevelopmental psychiatric disorders including schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorder and bipolar disorder. Discs large homolog 2 (DLG2) is a member of the membrane-associated guanylate kinase protein superfamily of scaffold proteins, a component of the post-synaptic density in excitatory neurons and regulator of synaptic function and plasticity. It remains an important question whether and how haploinsuffiency of DLG2 contributes to impairments in basic behavioural and cognitive functions that may underlie symptomatic domains in patients that cross diagnostic boundaries. Using a heterozygous Dlg2 mouse model we examined the impact of reduced Dlg2 expression on functions commonly impaired in neurodevelopmental psychiatric disorders including motor co-ordination and learning, pre-pulse inhibition and habituation to novel stimuli. The heterozygous Dlg2 mice exhibited behavioural impairments in long-term motor learning and long-term habituation to a novel context, but not motor co-ordination, initial responses to a novel context, PPI of acoustic startle or anxiety. We additionally showed evidence for the reduced regulation of the synaptic plasticity-associated protein cFos in the motor cortex during motor learning. The sensitivity of selective behavioural and cognitive functions, particularly those dependent on synaptic plasticity, to reduced expression of DLG2 give further credence for DLG2 playing a critical role in specific brain functions but also a mechanistic understanding of symptom expression shared across psychiatric disorders.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning Model Explains Individual Differences in Attentional Set Shifting</a></h4>

              
                Attentional set shifting refers to the ease with which the focus of attention is directed and switched. Cognitive tasks such as CANTAB IED reveal great variation in set shifting ability in the general population, with notable impairments in those with psychiatric diagnoses. The attentional and learning processes underlying this cognitive ability, and how they lead to the observed variation remain unknown. To directly test this, we used a modelling approach on two independent large-scale online general-population samples performing CANTAB IED and psychiatric symptom assessment. We found a hierarchical model that learnt both feature values and dimension attention best explained the data, and that compulsive symptoms were associated with slower learning and higher attentional bias to the first relevant stimulus dimension. This data showcase a new methodology to analyse data from the CANTAB IED task, and suggest a possible mechanistic explanation for the variation in set shifting performance, and its relationship to compulsive symptoms.

                Theories of predictive coding hypothesize that cortical networks learn internal models of environmental regularities to generate expectations that are constantly compared with sensory inputs. The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is thought to be critical for predictive coding. Here, we show how prefrontal neuronal ensembles encode a detailed internal model of sequences of visual events and their violations. We recorded PFC ensembles in a visual local-global sequence paradigm probing low and higher-order predictions and mismatches. PFC ensembles formed distributed, overlapping representations for all aspects of the dynamically unfolding sequences, including information about image identity as well as abstract information about ordinal position, anticipated sequence pattern, mismatches to local and global structure, and model updates. Model and mismatch signals were mixed in the same ensembles, suggesting a revision of predictive processing models that consider segregated processing. We conclude that overlapping prefrontal ensembles may collectively encode all aspects of an ongoing visual experience, including anticipation, perception, and surprise.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Domain-selective BET inhibition attenuates transcriptional and behavioral responses to cocaine</a></h4>

              
                Epigenetic pharmacotherapies have emerged as a promising treatment option for substance use disorder (SUD) due to their ability to reverse maladaptive transcriptional and behavioral responses to drugs of abuse. In particular, inhibitors of bromodomain and extra terminal domain (BET) reader proteins have been shown to reduce cocaine- and opioid-seeking behaviors in rodents. However, only pan-BET inhibitors, small molecules that bind to both bromodomains (BD1 and BD2) with all BET proteins, have been investigated in animal models of SUD. Given the potential side effects associated with pan-BET inhibitors, safer and more selective strategies are needed to advance BET therapeutics as a potential treatment for SUD. Here, we show that RVX-208, a clinically tested, BD2-selective BET inhibitor, dose-dependently reduced cocaine conditioned place preference in male mice, similar to the pan-BET inhibitor JQ1. In other behavioral experiments, RVX-208 treatment did not alter distance traveled, anxiety-like behavior, or novel object recognition memory. At the transcriptional level, RVX-208 attenuated the expression of multiple cocaine-induced genes in the nucleus accumbens. RVX-208 produced a distinct transcriptional response in stimulated primary neurons compared to JQ1 but had little effect on gene expression in non-stimulated neurons. Together, these data indicate that targeting domain-specific BET mechanisms may be an effective and safer strategy to reduce cocaine-induced neurobehavioral adaptations.

                Systemic perturbations can drive a neuroimmune cascade after surgical trauma, including affecting the blood-brain barrier (BBB), activating microglia, and contributing to cognitive deficits such as delirium. Delirium superimposed on dementia (DSD) is a particularly debilitating complication that renders the brain further vulnerable to neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration, albeit these molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here we have used an orthopedic model of tibial fracture/fixation in APPSwDI/mNos2-/- AD (CVN-AD) mice to investigate relevant pathogenetic mechanisms underlying DSD. We conducted the present study in 6 months-old CVN-AD mice, an age at which we speculated amyloid-{beta} pathology had not saturated BBB and neuroimmune functioning. We found that URMC-099, our brain-penetrant anti-inflammatory neuroprotective drug, prevented inflammatory endothelial activation, synapse loss, and microglial activation in our DSD model. Taken together, our data link post-surgical endothelial activation, microglial MafB immunoreactivity, and synapse loss as key substrates for DSD, all of which can be reversed by URMC-099.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Sex differences in behavioral responding and dopamine release during early Pavlovian learning</a></h4>

              
                Learning associations between cues and rewards requires the mesolimbic dopamine system. The dopamine response to cues signals differences in reward value in well-trained animals. These value-related dopamine responses are absent during early learning when cues signal differences in the reward rate, which suggests cue-evoked dopamine release conveys differences between outcomes only after extensive training. However, it is unclear if this lack of value coding by cue-evoked dopamine release during early learning is unique to when cues signal differences in reward rate, or if this is also evident when cues signal differences in other value-related parameters such as reward size. To address this, we utilized a Pavlovian conditioning task in which one audio cue was associated with a small reward (one pellet) and another audio cue was associated with a large reward (three pellets). We performed fast-scan cyclic voltammetry to record changes in dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens of male and female rats throughout early learning. Cue-evoked dopamine release did not encode differences in reward value, and there were no differences in this response between males and females. However, female rats exhibited higher levels of conditioned responding and a faster latency to respond. Reward-evoked dopamine release scaled with reward size in both sexes, though there were transient sex differences in the dynamics of this response. We additionally identified sex differences in the number of post-reward head entries. Collectively these data illustrate sustained sex differences in behavioral responding as well as transient sex differences in reward-evoked dopamine release.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Sequential Temporal Anticipation Characterized by Neural Power Modulation and in Recurrent Neural Networks</a></h4>

              
                Complex human behaviors involve perceiving continuous stimuli and planning actions at sequential time points, such as in perceiving/producing speech and music. To guide adaptive behavior, the brain needs to internally anticipate a sequence of prospective moments. How does the brain achieve this sequential temporal anticipation without relying on any external timing cues? To answer this question, we designed a premembering task: we tagged three temporal locations in white noise by asking human listeners to detect a tone presented at one of the temporal locations. We selectively probed the anticipating processes guided by memory in trials with only flat noise using novel modulation analyses. A multiscale anticipating scheme was revealed: the neural power modulation in the delta band encodes noise duration on a supra-second scale; the modulations in the alpha-beta band range mark the tagged temporal locations on a subsecond scale and correlate with tone detection performance. To unveil the functional role of those neural observations, we turned to recurrent neural networks (RNNs) optimized for the behavioral task. The RNN hidden dynamics resembled the neural modulations; further analyses and perturbations on RNNs suggest that the neural power modulations in the alpha/beta band emerged as a result of selectively suppressing irrelevant noise periods and increasing sensitivity to the anticipated temporal locations. Our neural, behavioral, and modelling findings convergingly demonstrate that the sequential temporal anticipation involves a process of dynamic gain control: to anticipate a few meaningful moments is also to actively ignore irrelevant events that happen most of the time.

                The behavioral state of a mammal impacts how the brain responds to visual stimuli as early as in the dorsolateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus (dLGN), the primary relay of visual information to the cortex. A clear example of this is the markedly stronger response of dLGN neurons to higher temporal frequencies of the visual stimulus in alert as compared to quiescent animals. The dLGN receives strong feedback from the visual cortex, yet whether this feedback contributes to these state-dependent responses to visual stimuli is poorly understood. Here we show that in mice, silencing cortico-thalamic feedback abolishes state-dependent differences in the response of dLGN neurons to visual stimuli. This holds true for dLGN responses to both temporal and spatial features of the visual stimulus. These results reveal that the state-dependent shift of the response to visual stimuli in an early stage of visual processing depends on cortico-thalamic feedback.

                Prior studies investigating the effects of playing action video games on attentional control have demonstrated improvements on a variety of basic psychophysical tasks. However, as of yet, there is little evidence indicating that the cognitive benefits of playing action video games generalize to naturalistic multisensory scenes - a fundamental characteristic of our natural, everyday life environments. The present study addressed the generalization of attentional control enhancement due to AVGP experience to real-life like scenarios by comparing the performance of action video-game players (AVGPs) with non-players (NVGPs) on a visual search task using naturalistic, dynamic audio-visual scenes. To this end, a questionnaire collecting data on gaming habits and sociodemographic data as well as a visual search task was administered online to a gender-balanced sample of 60 participants of age 18 to 30 years. According to the standard hypothesis, AVGPs outperformed NVGPs in the search task overall, showing faster reaction times without sacrificing accuracy. In addition, in replication of previous findings, semantically congruent cross-modal cues benefited performance overall. However, according to our results, despite the overall advantage in search, and the multisensory congruence benefit, AVGPs did not exploit multisensory cues more efficiently than NVGPs. Exploratory analyses with gender as a variable indicated that the advantage of AVG experience to both genders should be done with caution.

                Somatic reprogramming of glia into neurons is a potentially promising approach for the replacement of neurons lost to injury or neurodegenerative disorders. Knockdown of the polypyrimidine tract-binding protein Ptbp1 has been recently reported to induce efficient conversion of retinal M{upsilon}ller glia and brain astrocytes into functional neurons. However, genetic analysis of Ptbp1 function in adult glia has not been conducted. Here, we use a combination of genetic lineage tracing, scRNA-Seq, and electrophysiological analysis to show that specific deletion of Ptbp1 in adult retinal M{upsilon}ller glia and brain astrocytes does not lead to any detectable level of glia-to-neuron conversion. Few changes in gene expression are observed in glia following Ptbp1 deletion, and glial identity is maintained. These findings highlight the importance of using genetic manipulation and lineage tracing methods in studying cell type conversion.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Inhibition of LRRK2 kinase activity promotes anterograde axonal transport and presynaptic targeting of α-synuclein</a></h4>

              
                Pathologic inclusions composed of alpha-synuclein called Lewy pathology are hallmarks of Parkinson Disease (PD). Dominant inherited mutations in leucine rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) are the most common genetic cause of PD. Lewy pathology is found in the majority of individuals with LRRK2-PD, particularly those with the G2019S-LRRK2 mutation. Lewy pathology in LRRK2-PD associates with increased non-motor symptoms such as cognitive deficits, anxiety, and orthostatic hypotension. Thus, understanding the relationship between LRRK2 and alpha-synuclein could be important for determining the mechanisms of non-motor symptoms. In PD models, expression of mutant LRRK2 reduces membrane localization of alpha-synuclein, and enhances formation of pathologic alpha-synuclein, particularly when synaptic activity is increased. alpha-Synuclein and LRRK2 both localize to the presynaptic terminal. LRRK2 plays a role in membrane traffic, including axonal transport, and therefore may influence alpha-synuclein synaptic localization. This study shows that LRRK2 kinase activity influences alpha-synuclein targeting to the presynaptic terminal. We used the selective LRRK2 kinase inhibitors, MLi-2 and PF-06685360 (PF-360) to determine the impact of reduced LRRK2 kinase activity on presynaptic localization of alpha-synuclein. Expansion microscopy (ExM) in primary hippocampal cultures and the mouse striatum, in vivo, was used to more precisely resolve the presynaptic localization of alpha-synuclein. Live imaging of axonal transport of alpha-synuclein-GFP was used to investigate the impact of LRRK2 kinase inhibition on alpha-synuclein axonal transport towards the presynaptic terminal. Reduced LRRK2 kinase activity increases alpha-synuclein overlap with presynaptic markers in primary neurons, and increases anterograde axonal transport of alpha-synuclein-GFP. In vivo, LRRK2 inhibition increases alpha-synuclein overlap with glutamatergic, cortico-striatal terminals, and dopaminergic nigral-striatal presynaptic terminals. The findings suggest that LRRK2 kinase activity plays a role in axonal transport, and presynaptic targeting of alpha-synuclein. These data provide potential mechanisms by which LRRK2-mediated perturbations of alpha-synuclein localization could cause pathology in both LRRK2-PD, and idiopathic PD.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Weight perturbation learning outperforms node perturbation on broad classes of temporally extended tasks</a></h4>

              
                Biological constraints often impose restrictions for plausible plasticity rules such as locality and reward-based rather than supervised learning. Two learning rules that comply with these restrictions are weight (WP) and node (NP) perturbation. NP is often used in learning studies, in particular as a benchmark; it is considered to be superior to WP and more likely neurobiologically realized, as the number of weights and therefore their perturbation dimension typically massively exceed the number of nodes. Here we show that this conclusion no longer holds when we take two biologically relevant properties into account: First, tasks extend in time. This increases the perturbation dimension of NP but not WP. Second, tasks are low dimensional, with many weight configurations providing solutions. We analytically delineate regimes where these properties let WP perform as well as or better than NP. Further we find qualitative features of the weight and error dynamics that allow to distinguish which of the rules underlie a learning process: in WP, but not NP, weights mediating zero input diffuse and gathering batches of subtasks in a trial decreases the number of trials required. The insights suggest new learning rules, which combine for specific task types the advantages of WP and NP. Using numerical simulations, we generalize the results to networks with various architectures solving biologically relevant and standard network learning tasks. Our findings suggest WP and NP as similarly plausible candidates for learning in the brain and as similarly important benchmarks.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">β-amyloid-driven synaptic depression requires PDZ protein interaction at AMPA-receptor subunit GluA3</a></h4>

              
                Soluble oligomeric amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}) is a prime suspect to cause cognitive deficits in Alzheimer's disease and weakens synapses by removing AMPA-type glutamate receptors (AMPARs). We show that synapses of CA1 pyramidal neurons become vulnerable to A{beta} when they express AMPAR subunit GluA3. We found that A{beta}-oligomers reduce the levels of GluA3 immobilized at spines, indicating they deplete GluA3-containing AMPARs from synapses. These A{beta}-driven effects critically depended on the PDZ-binding motif of GluA3. When GluA3 was expressed with a single amino acid mutation in its PDZ-binding motif that prevents GRIP binding, it did not end up at spines and A{beta} failed to trigger synaptic depression. GluA3 with a different point mutation in the PDZ-motif that leaves GRIP-binding intact but prevents its endocytosis, was present at spines in normal amounts but was fully resistant to effects of A{beta}. Our data indicate that A{beta}-mediated synaptic depression requires the removal of GluA3 from synapses. We propose that GRIP-detachment from GluA3 is a critical early step in the cascade of events through which A{beta} accumulation causes a loss of synapse.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Causal evidence for a domain-specific role of left superior frontal sulcus in human perceptual decision-making</a></h4>

              
                Humans and animals can flexibly choose their actions based on different information, ranging from objective states of the environment (e.g., apples are bigger than cherries) to subjective preferences (e.g., cherries are tastier than apples). Whether the brain instantiates these different choices by recruiting either specialized or shared neural circuitry remains debated. Specifically, domain-general theories of prefrontal cortex (PFC) function propose that prefrontal areas flexibly process either perceptual or value-based evidence depending on what is required for the present choice, whereas domain-specific theories posit that PFC sub- areas, such as the left superior frontal sulcus (SFS), selectively integrate evidence relevant for perceptual decisions. Here we comprehensively test the functional role of the left SFS for choices based on perceptual and value-based evidence, by combining fMRI with a behavioural paradigm, computational modelling, and transcranial magnetic stimulation. Confirming predictions by a sequential sampling model, we show that TMS-induced excitability reduction of the left SFS selectively changes the processing of decision-relevant perceptual information and associated neural processes. In contrast, value-based decision making and associated neural processes remain unaffected. This specificity of SFS function is evident at all levels of analysis (behavioural, computational, and neural, including functional connectivity), demonstrating that the left SFS causally contributes to evidence integration for  perceptual but not value-based decisions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Postsynaptic synucleins mediate vesicular exocytosis of endocannabinoids</a></h4>

              
                Two seemingly unrelated questions have long motivated studies in neuroscience: How are endocannabinoids, among the most powerful modulators of synaptic transmission, released from neurons? What are the physiological functions of synucleins, key contributors to Parkinson's Disease? Here, we report an unexpected convergence of these two questions: Endocannabinoids are released via vesicular exocytosis from postsynaptic neurons by a synuclein-dependent mechanism. Specifically, we find that deletion of all synucleins selectively blocks all endocannabinoid-dependent synaptic plasticity; this block is reversed by postsynaptic expression of wildtype but not of mutant -synuclein. Loading postsynaptic neurons with endocannabinoids via patch-pipette dialysis suppressed presynaptic neurotransmitter release in wildtype but not in synuclein-deficient neurons, suggesting that the synuclein deletion blocks endocannabinoid release. Direct optical monitoring of endocannabinoid release confirmed the requirement of synucleins. Given the role of synucleins in vesicular exocytosis, the requirement for synucleins in endocannabinoid release indicates that endocannabinoids are secreted via exocytosis. Consistent with this hypothesis, postsynaptic expression of tetanus-toxin light chain, which cleaves synaptobrevin SNAREs, also blocked endocannabinoid-dependent plasticity and release. The unexpected finding that endocannabinoids are released via synuclein-dependent exocytosis assigns a function to synucleins and resolves a longstanding puzzle of how neurons release endocannabinoids to induce synaptic plasticity.

	<p>Daytime napping contributes to retention of new word learning in children. Importantly, children transition out of regular napping between ages 3–5 years, and the impact of this transition on memory is unclear. Here, we examined the performance of both non-habitually napping children (nap 0–3 days per week, n = 28) and habitually napping children (nap 4–7 days per week, n = 30) on a word learning task after a delay including either sleep or wakefulness. Children ages 3.5–4.5 years old experienced a brief exposure to two novel labels and their referents during training, a scenario that replicates learning experiences children encounter every day. After a 4-h delay, children were tested on the object-label associations. Using mixed effects logistic regression, we compared retention performance. Non-habitual nappers and habitual nappers displayed a different pattern of retention such that non-habitually napping children did equally well on a test of retention regardless of whether they napped or stayed awake during the delay. In contrast, habitually napping children needed a nap after learning to retain the novel object-label associations 4 h later. As a group, habitual nappers who remained awake after learning performed no better than chance on the retention test. As children transition out of naps, they may be less susceptible to interference and are better able to retain newly learned words across a delay including wakefulness.</p>

	<p>Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate sex differences in the burden of migraine and tension-type headache (TTH). Background: Migraine and TTH are more common in women than in men, with differences in comorbidities, treatment responses, disease-modifying factors, and ictal and interictal burden of disease. Information about sex-related influences on ictal and interictal burden is limited, and an increased understanding is mandatory to provide tailored individual treatment for female and male patients. Methods: Participants answered an online survey based on the EUROLIGHT questionnaire. Inclusion criteria were the consent to participate, complete responses to the diagnostic questions, and information about their sex. Sex differences were investigated using the Mann–Whitney U test or Chi-square test. For detecting factors that influence the burden of disease, we built binary regression models. Results: We included 472 (74.6% female) migraineurs and 161 (59.6% female) participants with TTH. Women with migraine reported significantly more problems in their love lives, more self-concealment, less feelings of being understood by family and friends, more interictal anxiety, a higher pain severity, and more depression and anxiety symptoms than men. For TTH, we did not find significant sex-related differences. A higher headache frequency was the factor that increased the burden of disease in female but not in male migraneurs. Conclusion: The burden of disease was higher in women than men with migraine in many aspects, but not with TTH. Therefore, according to our results, there is a need for sex-specific precision medicine for migraine but not TTH. Controlling the headache frequency with a proper acute or prophylactic treatment and treating comorbid depression and anxiety symptoms is crucial to ease migraine&#039;s burden, especially in women.</p>

	<p>Adults with Down syndrome are at a high risk for disordered sleep. These sleep problems could have marked effects on aging and Alzheimer’s disease, potentially altering white matter integrity. This study examined the associations between disordered sleep assessed via an actigraph accelerometer worn on 7 consecutive nights, presence of diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea, and diffusion tensor imaging indices of white matter integrity in 29 non-demented adults with Down Syndrome (48% female, aged 33–54 years). Average total sleep time was associated with lower mean diffusivity in the left superior longitudinal fasciculus (r = −0.398, p = 0.040). Average sleep efficiency, length of awakenings, and movement index were related to fractional anisotropy in the right inferior longitudinal fasciculus (r = −0.614 to 0.387, p ≤ 0.050). Diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea was associated with fractional anisotropy in the right inferior longitudinal fasciculus (r = −0.373 p = 0.050). Findings suggest that more disrupted sleep is associated with lower white matter integrity in the major association tracts in middle-aged adults with Down syndrome. Longitudinal work is needed to confirm the directionally of associations. Sleep interventions could be an important component for promoting optimal brain aging in the Down syndrome population.</p>

	<p>A direct aspiration-first pass technique (ADAPT) has recently gained popularity for the treatment of large vessel ischemic stroke. Here, we sought to create a machine learning-based model that uses pre-treatment imaging metrics to predict successful outcomes for ADAPT in middle cerebral artery (MCA) stroke cases. In 119 MCA strokes treated by ADAPT, we calculated four imaging parameters—clot length, perviousness, distance from the internal carotid artery (ICA) and angle of interaction (AOI) between clot/catheter. We determined treatment success by first pass effect (FPE), and performed univariate analyses. We further built and validated multivariate machine learning models in a random train-test split (75%:25%) of our data. To test model stability, we repeated the machine learning procedure over 100 randomizations, and reported the average performances. Our results show that perviousness (p = 0.002) and AOI (p = 0.031) were significantly higher and clot length (p = 0.007) was significantly lower in ADAPT cases with FPE. A logistic regression model achieved the highest accuracy (74.2%) in the testing cohort, with an AUC = 0.769. The models had similar performance over the 100 train-test randomizations (average testing AUC = 0.768 ± 0.026).

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Although we use our visual and tactile sensory systems interchangeably for object recognition on a daily basis, little is known about the mechanism underlying this ability. This study examined how 3D shape features of objects form two congruent and interchangeable visual and tactile perceptual spaces in healthy male and female participants. Since active exploration plays an important role in shape processing, a virtual reality environment was used to visually explore 3D objects called digital embryos without using the tactile sense. In addition, during the tactile procedure, blindfolded participants actively palpated a 3D-printed version of the same objects with both hands. We first demonstrated that the visual and tactile perceptual spaces were highly similar. We then extracted a series of 3D shape features to investigate how visual and tactile exploration can lead to the correct identification of the relationships between objects. The results indicate that both modalities share the same shape features to form highly similar veridical spaces. This finding suggests that visual and tactile systems might apply similar cognitive processes to sensory inputs that enable humans to rely merely on one modality in the absence of another to recognize surrounding objects.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>The subthalamic nucleus (STN) is an essential component of the basal ganglia and has long been considered to be a part of the ventral thalamus. However, recent neurodevelopmental data indicated that this nucleus is of hypothalamic origin which is now commonly acknowledged. In this work, we aimed to verify whether the inclusion of the STN in the hypothalamus could influence the way we understand and conduct research on the organization of the whole ventral and posterior diencephalon. Developmental and neurochemical data indicate that the STN is part of a larger glutamatergic posterior hypothalamic region that includes the premammillary and mammillary nuclei. The main anatomic characteristic common to this region involves the convergent cortical and pallidal projections that it receives, which is based on the model of the hyperdirect and indirect pathways to the STN. This whole posterior hypothalamic region is then integrated into distinct functional networks that interact with the ventral mesencephalon to adjust behavior depending on external and internal contexts.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) is an essential component of the brain circuitry supporting long-term memory by serving as an interface between the hippocampus and neocortex. Dysfunction of the LEC affects sensory coding in the hippocampus, leading to a view that the LEC provides the hippocampus with highly processed sensory information. It remains unclear, however, how the LEC modulates neural processing in the neocortical regions. To address this point, we pharmacologically inactivated the LEC of male rats during a temporal associative learning task and examined its impact on local network activity in one of the LEC's efferent targets, the prelimbic region of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Rats were exposed to two neutral stimuli, one of which was paired with an aversive eyelid shock over a short temporal delay. The LEC inhibition reduced the expression of anticipatory blinking responses to the reinforced stimuli without increasing responses to nonreinforced stimuli. In control rats, both the reinforced and nonreinforced stimuli evoked a short-lived, wide-band increase in the prelimbic network activity. With learning, the initial increase of gamma-band activity started to extend into the interval between the reinforced neutral stimulus and the eyelid shock. LEC inhibition attenuated the learning-induced sustained activity, without affecting the initial transient activity. These results suggest that the integrity of LEC is necessary for the formation of temporal stimulus associations and its neural correlates in the mPFC. Given the minimal effects on the innate network responses to sensory stimuli, the LEC appears not to be the main source of sensory inputs to the mPFC; rather it may provide a framework that shapes the mPFC network response to behaviorally relevant cues.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">The importance of urgency in decision making based on dynamic information</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Lorenzo Ferrucci, Aldo Genovesio, Encarni Marcos</p>

A standard view in the literature is that decisions are the result of a process that accumulates evidence in favor of each alternative until such accumulation reaches a threshold and a decision is made. However, this view has been recently questioned by an alternative proposal that suggests that, instead of accumulated, evidence is combined with an urgency signal. Both theories have been mathematically formalized and supported by a variety of decision-making tasks with constant information. However, recently, tasks with changing information have shown to be more effective to study the dynamics of decision making. Recent research using one of such tasks, the tokens task, has shown that decisions are better described by an urgency mechanism than by an accumulation one. However, the results of that study could depend on a task where all fundamental information was noiseless and always present, favoring a mechanism of non-integration, such as the urgency one. Here, we wanted to address whether the same conclusions were also supported by an experimental paradigm in which sensory evidence was removed shortly after it was provided, making working memory necessary to properly perform the task. Here, we show that, under such condition, participants’ behavior could be explained by an urgency-gating mechanism that low-pass filters the mnemonic information and combines it with an urgency signal that grows with time but not by an accumulation process that integrates the same mnemonic information. Thus, our study supports the idea that, under certain situations with dynamic sensory information, decisions are better explained by an urgency-gating mechanism than by an accumulation one.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Choice history effects in mice and humans improve reward harvesting efficiency</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Samuel López-Yépez Junior, Juliane Martin, Oliver Hulme, Duda Kvitsiani</p>

Choice history effects describe how future choices depend on the history of past choices. In experimental tasks this is typically framed as a bias because it often diminishes the experienced reward rates. However, in natural habitats, choices made in the past constrain choices that can be made in the future. For foraging animals, the probability of earning a reward in a given patch depends on the degree to which the animals have exploited the patch in the past. One problem with many experimental tasks that show choice history effects is that such tasks artificially decouple choice history from its consequences on reward availability over time. To circumvent this, we use a variable interval (VI) reward schedule that reinstates a more natural contingency between past choices and future reward availability. By examining the behavior of optimal agents in the VI task we discover that choice history effects observed in animals serve to maximize reward harvesting efficiency. We further distil the function of choice history effects by manipulating first- and second-order statistics of the environment. We find that choice history effects primarily reflect the growth rate of the reward probability of the unchosen option, whereas reward history effects primarily reflect environmental volatility. Based on observed choice history effects in animals, we develop a reinforcement learning model that explicitly incorporates choice history over multiple time scales into the decision process, and we assess its predictive adequacy in accounting for the associated behavior. We show that this new variant, known as the double trace model, has a higher performance in predicting choice data, and shows near optimal reward harvesting efficiency in simulated environments. These results suggests that choice history effects may be adaptive for natural contingencies between consumption and reward availability. This concept lends credence to a normative account of choice history effects that extends beyond its description as a bias.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Regulation of transcription reactivation dynamics exiting mitosis</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Sergio Sarnataro, Andrea Riba, Nacho Molina</p>

Proliferating cells experience a global reduction of transcription during mitosis, yet their cell identity is maintained and regulatory information is propagated from mother to daughter cells. Mitotic bookmarking by transcription factors has been proposed as a potential mechanism to ensure the reactivation of transcription at the proper set of genes exiting mitosis. Recently, mitotic transcription and waves of transcription reactivation have been observed in synchronized populations of human hepatoma cells. However, the study did not consider that mitotic-arrested cell populations progressively desynchronize leading to measurements of gene expression on a mixture of cells at different internal cell-cycle times. Moreover, it is not well understood yet what is the precise role of mitotic bookmarking on mitotic transcription as well as on the transcription reactivation waves. Ultimately, the core gene regulatory network driving the precise transcription reactivation dynamics remains to be identified. To address these questions, we developed a mathematical model to correct for the progressive desynchronization of cells and estimate gene expression dynamics with respect to a cell-cycle pseudotime. Furthermore, we used a multiple linear regression model to infer transcription factor activity dynamics. Our analysis allows us to characterize waves of transcription factor activities exiting mitosis and predict a core gene regulatory network responsible of the transcription reactivation dynamics. Moreover, we identified more than 60 transcription factors that are highly active during mitosis and represent new candidates of mitotic bookmarking factors which could be relevant therapeutic targets to control cell proliferation.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">End‐truncated LAMB1 causes a hippocampal memory defect and a leukoencephalopathy</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The majority of patients with a familial cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) referred for molecular screening do not show pathogenic variants in known genes. In this study, we aimed to identify novel CSVD causal genes.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We performed a gene-based collapsing test of rare protein truncating variants identified in exome data of 258 unrelated CSVD patients of an ethnically matched control cohort and of two publicly available large-scale databases, gnomAD and TOPMed. Western blotting was used to investigate variants functional consequences. Clinical and MRI features of mutated patients were characterized.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We showed that <i>LAMB1</i> truncating variants escaping nonsense-mediated mRNA decay are strongly overrepresented in CSVD patients, reaching genome-wide significance (p &lt; 5 x10<sup>-8</sup>). Using two antibodies recognizing the N-and C-terminal parts of LAMB1, we showed that truncated forms of LAMB1 are expressed in patients’ endogenous fibroblasts and are trapped in the cytosol. These variants are associated with a novel phenotype characterized by the association of a hippocampal type episodic memory defect and a diffuse vascular leukoencephalopathy.</p>
<h2>I<b>nterpretation</b>
</h2>
<p>These findings are important for diagnosis and clinical care, to avoid unnecessary and sometimes invasive investigations, and also from a mechanistic point of view to understand the role of extracellular matrix proteins in neuronal homeostasis.</p>

                Background: The gene FOXO3a has been elucidated to govern the development of chronic granulocytic leukemia (CGL). Moreover, it has been suggested that the levels of FOXO3a in circulation are affected by the FOXO3a rs4946936 gene polymorphism. However, no study has assessed the correlation between the FOXO3a rs4946936 gene polymorphism and the levels of FOXO3a. The objective of this study was to assess the association between the FOXO3a rs4946936 gene polymorphism and the levels of FOXO3a in CGL patients treated with imatinib mesylate.  Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted from February 2019 to February 2020. The genotyping of FOXO3a rs4946936 gene polymorphism was conducted using PCR-RFLP, and the levels of FOXO3a were assessed using ELISA. The association between the FOXO3a rs4946936 gene polymorphism and the levels of FOXO3a were assessed using multiple logistic regression.  Results: A total of 60 CGL patients were assessed in our study. Among them, the CC, CT, and TT genotypes of the FOXO3a rs4946936 gene polymorphism were 35.0%, 48.3%, and 16.7% respectively. Our calculation revealed that elevated levels of FOXO3a were found in CGL patients with the CC genotype of the FOXO3a rs4946936 gene polymorphism. While we failed to clarify the association between either the CT or the TT genotype of FOXO3a rs4946936 gene polymorphism and the levels of FOXO3a.  Conclusion: Our study identifies that the CC genotype of the FOXO3a rs4946936 gene polymorphism affects the elevated levels of FOXO3a in CGL patients treated with imatinib mesylate.

                Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) provide  huge information on statistically significant single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with various human complex traits and diseases. By performing GWAS studies, scientists have successfully identified the association of hundreds of thousands to  millions of SNPs to a single phenotype. Moreover, the association of some SNPs with rare diseases has been intensively tested. However, classic GWAS studies have not yet provided solid, knowledgeable insight into functional and biological mechanisms underlying phenotypes or mechanisms of diseases. Therefore, several post-GWAS (pGWAS) methods have been recommended. Currently, there is no simple scientific document to provide a quick guide for performing pGWAS analysis. pGWAS is a crucial step for a better understanding of the biological machinery beyond the SNPs. Here, we provide an overview to performing pGWAS analysis and demonstrate the challenges behind each method. Furthermore, we direct readers to key articles for each pGWAS method and present the overall issues in pGWAS analysis.  Finally, we include a custom pGWAS pipeline to guide new users when performing their research.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Modelling sentiments based on objectivity and subjectivity with self-attention mechanisms [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The proliferation of digital commerce has allowed merchants to reach out to a wider customer base, prompting a study of customer reviews to gauge service and product quality through sentiment analysis. Sentiment analysis can be enhanced through subjectivity and objectivity classification with attention mechanisms. Methods: This research includes input corpora of contrasting levels of subjectivity and objectivity from different databases to perform sentiment analysis on user reviews, incorporating attention mechanisms at the aspect level. Three large corpora are chosen as the subjectivity and objectivity datasets, the Shopee user review dataset (ShopeeRD) for subjectivity, together with the Wikipedia English dataset (Wiki-en) and Internet Movie Database (IMDb) for objectivity. Word embeddings are created using Word2Vec with Skip-Gram. Then, a bidirectional LSTM with an attention layer (LSTM-ATT) imposed on word vectors. The performance of the model is evaluated and benchmarked against classification models of Logistics Regression (LR) and Linear SVC (L-SVC). Three models are trained with subjectivity (70% of ShopeeRD) and the objectivity (Wiki-en) embeddings, with ten-fold cross-validation. Next, the three models are evaluated against two datasets (IMDb and 20% of ShopeeRD). The experiments are based on benchmark comparisons, embedding comparison and model comparison with 70-10-20 train-validation-test splits. Data augmentation using AUG-BERT is performed and selected models incorporating AUG-BERT, are compared. Results: L-SVC scored the highest accuracy with 56.9% for objective embeddings (Wiki-en) while the LSTM-ATT scored 69.0% on subjective embeddings (ShopeeRD).  Improved performances were observed with data augmentation using AUG-BERT, where the LSTM-ATT+AUG-BERT model scored the highest accuracy at 60.0% for objective embeddings and 70.0% for subjective embeddings, compared to 57% (objective) and 69% (subjective) for L-SVC+AUG-BERT, and 56% (objective) and 68% (subjective) for L-SVC. Conclusions: Utilizing attention layers with subjectivity and objectivity notions has shown improvement to the accuracy of sentiment analysis models.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Myogenin controls via AKAP6 non-centrosomal microtubule organizing center formation at the nuclear envelope</a></h4>

              
                Non-centrosomal microtubule organizing centers (MTOC) are pivotal for the function of multiple cell types, but the processes initiating their formation are unknown. Here, we find that the transcription factor myogenin is required in murine myoblasts for the localization of MTOC proteins to the nuclear envelope. Moreover, myogenin is sufficient in fibroblasts for nuclear envelope MTOC (NE-MTOC) formation and centrosome attenuation. Bioinformatics combined with loss- and gain-of-function experiments identified induction of AKAP6 expression as one central mechanism for myogenin-mediated NE-MTOC formation. Promoter studies indicate that myogenin preferentially induces the transcription of muscle- and NE-MTOC-specific isoforms of <i>Akap6</i> and <i>Syne1</i>, which encodes nesprin-1α, the NE-MTOC anchor protein in muscle cells. Overexpression of AKAP6β and nesprin-1α was sufficient to recruit endogenous MTOC proteins to the nuclear envelope of myoblasts in the absence of myogenin. Taken together, our results illuminate how mammals transcriptionally control the switch from a centrosomal MTOC to an NE-MTOC and identify AKAP6 as a novel NE-MTOC component in muscle cells.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The transcription factor Xrp1 is required for PERK-mediated antioxidant gene induction in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                PERK is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) transmembrane sensor that phosphorylates eIF2a to initiate the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR). eIF2a phosphorylation promotes stress-responsive gene expression most notably through the transcription factor ATF4 that contains a regulatory 5' leader. Possible PERK effectors other than ATF4 remain poorly understood. Here, we report that the bZIP transcription factor Xrp1 is required for ATF4-independent PERK signaling. Cell type-specific gene expression profiling in <i>Drosophila</i> indicated that delta-family glutathione-S-transferases (<i>gstD</i>) are prominently induced by the UPR-activating transgene <i>Rh1<sup>G69D</sup></i>. <i>Perk </i>was necessary and sufficient for such <i>gstD</i> induction, but<i> ATF4 </i>was not required. Instead, <i>Perk </i>and other regulators of eIF2a phosphorylation regulated Xrp1 protein levels to induce <i>gstDs</i>. The <i>Xrp1 </i>5' leader has a conserved upstream Open Reading Frame (uORF) analogous to those that regulate <i>ATF4 </i>translation. The <i>gstD-GFP</i> reporter induction required putative Xrp1 binding sites. These results indicate that antioxidant genes are highly induced by a previously unrecognized UPR signaling axis consisting of PERK and Xrp1.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Parallel functional testing identifies enhancers active in early postnatal mouse brain</a></h4>

              
                Enhancers are cis-regulatory elements that play critical regulatory roles in modulating developmental transcription programs and driving cell-type specific and context-dependent gene expression in the brain. The development of massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs) has enabled high-throughput functional screening of candidate DNA sequences for enhancer activity. Tissue-specific screening of <i>in vivo</i> enhancer function at scale has the potential to greatly expand our understanding of the role of non-coding sequences in development, evolution, and disease. Here, we adapted a self-transcribing regulatory element MPRA strategy for delivery to early postnatal mouse brain via recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV). We identified and validated putative enhancers capable of driving reporter gene expression in mouse forebrain, including regulatory elements within an intronic <i>CACNA1C</i> linkage disequilibrium block associated with risk in neuropsychiatric disorder genetic studies. Paired screening and single enhancer <i>in vivo</i> functional testing, as we show here, represents a powerful approach towards characterizing regulatory activity of enhancers and understanding how enhancer sequences organize gene expression in the brain.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Single-cell growth inference of Corynebacterium glutamicum reveals asymptoticallylinear growth</a></h4>

              
                Regulation of growth and cell size is crucial for the optimization of bacterial cellular function. So far, single bacterial cells have been found to grow predominantly exponentially, which implies the need for tight regulation to maintain cell size homeostasis. Here, we characterize the growth behavior of the apically growing bacterium Corynebacterium glutamicum using a novel broadly applicable inference method for single-cell growth dynamics. Using this approach, we find that C. glutamicum exhibits asymptotically linear single-cell growth. To explain this growth mode, we model elongation as being rate-limited by the apical growth mechanism. Our model accurately reproduces the inferred cell growth dynamics and is validated with elongation measurements on a transglycosylase deficient ΔrodA mutant. Finally, with simulations we show that the distribution of cell lengths is narrower for linear than exponential growth, suggesting that this asymptotically linear growth mode can act as a substitute for tight division length and division symmetry regulation.

                The mammalian Y chromosome is critical for male sex determination and spermatogenesis. However, linking each Y gene to specific aspects of male reproduction has been challenging. As the Y chromosome is notoriously hard to sequence and target, functional studies have mostly relied on transgene-rescue approaches using mouse models with large multi-gene deletions. These experimental limitations have oriented the field toward the search for a minimum set of Y genes necessary for male reproduction. Here, considering Y-chromosome evolutionary history and decades of discoveries, we review the current state of research on its function in spermatogenesis and reassess the view that many Y genes are disposable for male reproduction.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Early life experience sets hard limits on motor learning as evidenced from artificial arm use</a></h4>

              
                The study of artificial arms provides a unique opportunity to address long-standing questions on sensorimotor plasticity and development. Learning to use an artificial arm arguably depends on fundamental building blocks of body representation and would therefore be impacted by early-life experience. We tested artificial arm motor-control in two adult populations with upper-limb deficiencies: a congenital group - individuals who were born with a partial arm, and an acquired group - who lost their arm following amputation in adulthood. Brain plasticity research teaches us that the earlier we train to acquire new skills (or use a new technology) the better we benefit from this practice as adults. Instead, we found that although the congenital group started using an artificial arm as toddlers, they produced increased error noise and directional errors when reaching to visual targets, relative to the acquired group who performed similarly to controls. However, the earlier an individual with a congenital limb difference was fitted with an artificial arm, the better their motor control was. Since we found no group differences when reaching without visual feedback, we suggest that the ability to perform efficient visual-based corrective movements is highly dependent on either biological or artificial arm experience at a very young age. Subsequently, opportunities for sensorimotor plasticity become more limited.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Targeting ON-bipolar cells by AAV gene therapy stably reverses LRIT3-congenital stationary night blindness</a></h4>

              
                AAV gene therapies aimed at curing inherited retinal diseases to date have typically focused on photoreceptors and retinal pigmented epithelia within the relatively accessible outer retina. However, therapeutic targeting in diseases such as congenital stationary night blindness (CSNB) that involve defects in ON-bipolar cells (ON-BCs) within the mid-retina has been challenged by the relative inaccessibility of the target cell in intact retinas, the limited transduction efficiency of these cells by existing AAV serotypes, poor availability of established ON-BC-specific promoters, and absence of appropriate patient-relevant large animal models. Here, we demonstrate safe and effective ON-BC targeting by AAV gene therapy in a recently characterized naturally-occurring canine model of CSNB, LRIT3-CSNB. To effectively target ON-BCs, new AAV capsid variants with ON-BC tropism and ON-BC specific modified GRM6 promoters were adopted to ensure cell-specific transgene expression. Notably, subretinal injection of one vector, AAVK9#4-shGRM6-cLRIT3-WPRE, significantly recovered rod-derived b-wave in all treated eyes (6/6) of adult dogs injected at 1-3 years of age. The robust therapeutic effect was evident 7 weeks post-injection and was sustained for at least 1 year in all treated eyes. Scotopic vision was significantly improved in treated eyes based on visually-guided obstacle course navigation. Restoration of LRIT3 signals was confirmed by immunohistochemistry. Thus, we report on the first ON-BC functional rescue in a large animal model using a novel AAV capsid variant and modified promoter construct optimized for ON-BC specificity, thereby establishing both proof-of-concept and a novel translational platform for treatment of CSNB in patients with defects in photoreceptor-to-bipolar signaling.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Functional interaction between Drosophila olfactory sensory neurons and their support cells</a></h4>

              
                Insects detect volatile chemicals using antennae, which house a vast variety of olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) that innervate hair-like structures called sensilla where odor detection takes place. In addition to OSNs, the antenna also hosts various support cell types. These include the triad of trichogen, tormogen and thecogen support cells that lie adjacent to their respective OSNs. The arrangement of OSN supporting cells occurs stereotypically for all sensilla and is widely conserved in evolution. While insect chemosensory neurons have received considerable attention, little is known about the functional significance of the cells that support them. For instance, it remains unknown whether support cells play an active role in odor detection, or only passively contribute to homeostasis, e.g. by maintaining sensillum lymph composition. To investigate the functional interaction between OSNs and support cells, we used optical and electrophysiological approaches in Drosophila. First, we characterized the distribution of various supporting cells using genetic markers. By means of an ex vivo antennal preparation and genetically-encoded Ca2+ and K+ indicators, we then studied the activation of these auxiliary cells during odor presentation in adult flies. We observed acute responses and distinct differences in Ca2+ and K+ fluxes between support cell types. Finally, we observed alterations in OSN responses upon thecogen cell ablation in mature adults. Upon inducible ablation of thecogen cells, we notice a gain in mechanical responsiveness to mechanical stimulations during single-sensillum recording, but a lack of change to neuronal resting activity. Taken together, these results demonstrate that support cells play a more active and responsive role during odor processing than previously thought. Our observations thus reveal that support cells functionally interact with OSNs and may be important for the extraordinary ability of insect olfactory systems to dynamically and sensitively discriminate between odors in the turbulent sensory landscape of insect flight.

                The p.H157Y variant of TREM2 (Triggering Receptor Expressed on Myeloid Cells 2) has been reported to increase Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk. This mutation in the extracellular domain of TREM2 localizes at the cleavage site, leading to enhanced shedding. Here, we generated a novel Trem2 H157Y knock-in mouse model to investigate how this H157Y mutation impacts TREM2 proteolytic processing, synaptic function, and AD-related amyloid pathology. Consistent with previous in vitro findings, TREM2-H157Y increases the amount of soluble TREM2 (sTREM2) in the cortex and serum of mutant mice compared to the wild type controls. Interestingly, the Trem2 H157Y variant enhances synaptic plasticity without affecting microglial density and morphology. In the presence of amyloid pathology, TREM2-H157Y surprisingly accelerates A{beta} clearance and reduces amyloid burden and microgliosis. Taken together, our findings support a beneficial effect of the Trem2 H157Y mutation in synaptic function and in mitigating amyloid pathology. Considering the genetic association of TREM2 p.H157Y with AD, we speculate TREM2-H157Y might increase AD risk through an amyloid-independent pathway, as such its effects on tauopathy and neurodegeneration merit further investigation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Olfactory-driven beta band entrainment of limbic circuitry during neonatal development</a></h4>

              
                Cognitive processing relies on the functional refinement of the limbic circuitry during the first two weeks of life. During this developmental period, when most sensory systems are still immature, the sense of olfaction acts as 'door to the world', providing the main source of environmental inputs. However, it is unknown whether early olfactory processing shapes the development of the limbic circuitry. Here, we address this question by combining simultaneous in vivo recordings from the olfactory bulb (OB), lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC), hippocampus (HP), and prefrontal cortex (PFC) with opto- and chemogenetic manipulations of mitral/tufted cells (M/TCs) in the OB of non-anesthetized neonatal mice. We show that the neonatal OB synchronizes the limbic circuity in beta frequency range. Moreover, it drives neuronal and network activity in LEC, as well as subsequently, HP and PFC via long-range projections from mitral cells (MCs) to HP-projecting LEC neurons. Thus, OB activity controls the communications within limbic circuits during neonatal development.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Slow oscillations provide the spatio-temporal framework for long-range neural communication during sleep</a></h4>

              
                Slow oscillations (SOs, <1Hz) during non-rapid eye movement sleep are thought to reflect sleep homeostasis and support memory consolidation. Yet, the fundamental properties of SOs and their impact on neural network communication are not understood. We used effective connectivity to estimate causal information flow across the electrode manifold during SOs and found two peak of information flow in specific phases of the SO. We show causal communication during non-rapid eye movement sleep peaks during specific phases of the SO, but only across long distances. We confirmed this prediction by cluster analysis demonstrating greater flow in global, compared with local, SOs. Finally, we tested the functional significance of these results by examining which SO properties supported overnight episodic memory improvement, with the underlying assumption that memory consolidation would engage global, long-range communication. Indeed, episodic memory improvement was predicted only by the SO properties with greatest causal information flow, i.e., longest distances between sinks and sources and global, but not local, SOs. These findings explain how NREM sleep (characterized as a state of low brain connectivity) leverages SO-induced selective information flow to coordinate a wide network of brain regions during memory formation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Le Petit Prince: A multilingual fMRI corpus using ecological stimuli</a></h4>

              
                Neuroimaging using more ecologically valid stimuli such as audiobooks has advanced our understanding of natural language comprehension in the brain. However, prior naturalistic stimuli have typically been restricted to a single language, which limited generalizability beyond small typological domains. Here we present the "Le Petit Prince fMRI Corpus" (LPPC-fMRI), a multilingual resource for research in the cognitive neuroscience of speech and language during naturalistic listening (Open-Neuro: ds003643). 49 English speakers, 35 Chinese speakers and 28 French speakers listened to the same audiobook "The Little Prince" in their native language while multi-echo functional magnetic resonance imaging was acquired. We also provide time-aligned speech annotation and word-by-word predictors obtained using natural language processing tools. The resulting timeseries data are shown to be of high quality with good temporal signal-to-noise ratio and high inter-subject correlation. Data-driven functional analyses provide further evidence of data quality. This annotated, multilingual fMRI dataset facilitates future re-analysis that addresses cross-linguistic commonalities and differences in the neural substrate of language processing on multiple perceptual and linguistic levels.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neural basis for adaptive motor behavior during car driving</a></h4>

              
                Car driving is supported by motor skills trained through continuous daily practice. One of the skills unique to expert drivers is the ability to detect abrupt changes in the driving environment and then quickly adapt their operation mode to the changes. Previous functional neuroimaging studies on motor control investigated the mechanisms underlying behaviors adaptive to changes in control properties of simple experimental devices such as a computer mouse or a joystick. The switching of multiple internal models mainly engages adaptive behaviors and underlies the interplay between the cerebellum and frontoparietal network (FPN) regions as the neural process. However, it remains unclear whether the neural mechanisms identified through an experimental paradigm using such simple devices also underlie practical driving behaviors. In the current study, we measure functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) activities while participants control a realistic driving simulator inside the MRI scanner. Here, the accelerator sensitivity of a virtual car is abruptly changed, requiring participants to respond to this change as quickly as possible. We first compare brain activities before and after the sensitivity change. As a result, sensorimotor areas, including the left cerebellum, increase their activities after the sensitivity change. Moreover, after the change, activity significantly increases in the inferior parietal lobe and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, parts of the FPN regions. By contrast, the posterior cingulate cortex, a part of the default mode network, deactivates after the sensitivity change. Our results suggest that the neural bases found in previous experiments using the simpler devices can serve as the foundation of adaptive car driving. At the same time, this study also highlights the unique contribution of non-motor-related regions to addressing the high cognitive demands of driving.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Microglia mediate synaptic plasticity induced by 10 Hz repetitive magnetic stimulation</a></h4>

              
                Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation technique that is widely used in clinical practice for therapeutic purposes. Nevertheless, the mechanisms that mediate its therapeutic effects remain poorly understood. Recent work implicates that microglia, the resident immune cells of the central nervous system, have a defined role in the regulation of physiological brain function, e.g. the expression of synaptic plasticity. Despite this observation, no evidence exists for a role of microglia in excitatory synaptic plasticity induced by rTMS. Here, we used repetitive magnetic stimulation of organotypic entorhino-hippocampal tissue cultures to test for the role of microglia in synaptic plasticity induced by 10 Hz repetitive magnetic stimulation (rMS). For this purpose, we performed PLX3397 (Pexidartinib) treatment to deplete microglia from tissue culture preparations. Using whole-cell patch-clamp recordings, live-cell microscopy, immunohistochemistry and transcriptome analysis, we assessed structural and functional properties of both CA1 pyramidal neurons and microglia to correlate the microglia phenotype to synaptic plasticity. PLX3397 treatment over 18 days reliably depletes microglia in tissue cultures, without affecting structural and functional properties of CA1 pyramidal neurons. Microglia-depleted cultures display defects in the ability of CA1 pyramidal neurons to express plasticity of excitatory synapses upon rMS. Notably, rMS induces a moderate release of proinflammatory and plasticity-promoting factors, while microglial morphology stays unaltered. We conclude that microglia play a crucial role in rMS-induced excitatory synaptic plasticity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neural language processing across time, space, frequency and age: MEG-MVPA classification of intertrial phase coherence</a></h4>

              
                Language is a key part of human cognition. Whereas many neurocognitive abilities decline with age, for language the picture is much less clear and how exactly language processing changes with aging is still unknown. To investigate this, we employed magnetoencephalography (MEG) and recorded neuromagnetic brain responses to auditory linguistic stimuli in healthy participants of younger and older age using a passive task-free paradigm and a range of different linguistic stimulus contrasts, which enabled us to assess neural language processes at multiple levels (lexical, semantic, morphosyntactic). By using machine learning-based classification algorithms to scrutinise intertrial phase coherence of MEG responses in source space, we found significant differences between younger and older participants across several frequency bands and for all tested processing types, which shows multiple changes in the brain's neurolinguistic circuits which may be due to both healthy aging in general and compensatory processes in particular.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Severe distortion in the representation of foveal visual image locations in short term memory</a></h4>

              
                The foveal visual image region provides the human visual system with the highest acuity. However, it is unclear whether such a high fidelity representational advantage is maintained when foveal image locations are committed to short term memory. Here we describe a paradoxically large distortion in foveal target location recall by humans. We briefly presented small, but high contrast, points of light at eccentricities ranging from 0.1 to 12 deg, while subjects maintained their line of sight on a stable target. After a brief memory period, the subjects indicated the remembered target locations via computer controlled cursors. The biggest localization errors, in terms of both directional deviations and amplitude percentage overshoots or undershoots, occurred for the most foveal targets, and such distortions were still present, albeit with qualitatively different patterns, when subjects shifted their gaze to indicate the remembered target locations. Foveal visual images are severely distorted in short term memory.
