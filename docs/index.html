              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Efficient neural codes naturally emerge through gradient descent learning</a></h4>

              
                Animal sensory systems are more sensitive to common features in the environment than uncommon features. For example, small deviations from the more frequently encountered horizontal orientations can be more easily detected than small deviations from the less frequent diagonal ones. Here we find that artificial neural networks trained to recognize objects also have patterns of sensitivity that match the statistics of features in images. To interpret these findings, we show mathematically that learning with gradient descent in deep neural networks preferentially creates representations that are more sensitive to common features, a hallmark of efficient coding. This result suggests that efficient coding naturally emerges from gradient-like learning on natural stimuli.

	<p>Most children use their fingers when learning to count and calculate. These sensorimotor experiences were argued to underlie reported behavioral associations of finger gnosis and counting with mathematical skills. On the neural level, associations were assumed to originate from overlapping neural representations of fingers and numbers. This study explored whether finger-based training in children would lead to specific neural activation in the sensorimotor cortex, associated with finger movements, as well as the parietal cortex, associated with number processing, during mental arithmetic. Following finger-based training during the first year of school, trained children showed finger-related arithmetic effects accompanied by activation in the sensorimotor cortex potentially associated with implicit finger movements. This indicates embodied finger-based numerical representations after training. Results for differences in neural activation between trained children and a control group in the IPS were less conclusive. This study provides the first evidence for training-induced sensorimotor plasticity in brain development potentially driven by the explicit use of fingers for initial arithmetic, supporting an embodied perspective on the representation of numbers.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">A Ca2+-Dependent Mechanism Boosting Glycolysis and OXPHOS by Activating Aralar-Malate-Aspartate Shuttle, upon Neuronal Stimulation</a></h4>

              
                <p>Calcium is an important second messenger regulating a bioenergetic response to the workloads triggered by neuronal activation. In embryonic mouse cortical neurons using glucose as only fuel, activation by NMDA elicits a strong workload (ATP demand)-dependent on Na<sup>+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry, and stimulates glucose uptake, glycolysis, pyruvate and lactate production, and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent way. We find that Ca<sup>2+</sup> upregulation of glycolysis, pyruvate levels, and respiration, but not glucose uptake, all depend on Aralar/AGC1/Slc25a12, the mitochondrial aspartate-glutamate carrier, component of the malate-aspartate shuttle (MAS). MAS activation increases glycolysis, pyruvate production, and respiration, a process inhibited in the presence of BAPTA-AM, suggesting that the Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding motifs in Aralar may be involved in the activation. Mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) silencing had no effect, indicating that none of these processes required MCU-dependent mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake. The neuronal respiratory response to carbachol was also dependent on Aralar, but not on MCU. We find that mouse cortical neurons are endowed with a constitutive ER-to-mitochondria Ca<sup>2+</sup> flow maintaining basal cell bioenergetics in which ryanodine receptors, RyR2, rather than InsP<SUB>3</SUB>R, are responsible for Ca<sup>2+</sup> release, and in which MCU does not participate. The results reveal that, in neurons using glucose, MCU does not participate in OXPHOS regulation under basal or stimulated conditions, while Aralar-MAS appears as the major Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent pathway tuning simultaneously glycolysis and OXPHOS to neuronal activation.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Neuronal activation increases cell workload to restore ion gradients altered by activation. Ca<sup>2+</sup> is involved in matching increased workload with ATP production, but the mechanisms are still unknown. We find that glycolysis, pyruvate production, and neuronal respiration are stimulated on neuronal activation in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent way, independently of effects of Ca<sup>2+</sup> as workload inducer. Mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) does not play a relevant role in Ca<sup>2+</sup> stimulated pyruvate production and oxygen consumption as both are unchanged in MCU silenced neurons. However, Ca<sup>2+</sup> stimulation is blunt in the absence of Aralar, a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding mitochondrial carrier component of Malate-Aspartate Shuttle (MAS). The results suggest that Ca<sup>2+</sup>-regulated Aralar-MAS activation upregulates glycolysis and pyruvate production, which fuels mitochondrial respiration, through regulation of cytosolic NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADH ratio.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Microglia Drive Pockets of Neuroinflammation in Middle Age</a></h4>

              
                <p>During aging, microglia produce inflammatory factors, show reduced tissue surveillance, altered interactions with synapses, and prolonged responses to CNS insults, positioning these cells to have profound impact on the function of nearby neurons. We and others recently showed that microglial attributes differ significantly across brain regions in young adult mice. However, the degree to which microglial properties vary during aging is largely unexplored. Here, we analyze and manipulate microglial aging within the basal ganglia, brain circuits that exhibit prominent regional microglial heterogeneity and where neurons are vulnerable to functional decline and neurodegenerative disease. In male and female mice, we demonstrate that VTA and SNc microglia exhibit unique and premature responses to aging, compared with cortex and NAc microglia. This is associated with localized VTA/SNc neuroinflammation that may compromise synaptic function as early as middle age. Surprisingly, systemic inflammation, local neuron death, and astrocyte aging do not appear to underlie these early aging responses of VTA and SNc microglia. Instead, we found that microglial lysosome status was tightly linked to early aging of VTA microglia. Microglial ablation/repopulation normalized VTA microglial lysosome swelling and suppressed increases in VTA microglial density during aging. In contrast, CX3CR1 receptor KO exacerbated VTA microglial lysosome rearrangements and VTA microglial proliferation during aging. Our findings reveal a previously unappreciated regional variation in onset and magnitude of microglial proliferation and inflammatory factor production during aging and highlight critical links between microglial lysosome status and local microglial responses to aging.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Microglia are CNS cells that are equipped to regulate neuronal health and function throughout the lifespan. We reveal that microglia in select brain regions begin to proliferate and produce inflammatory factors in late middle age, months before microglia in other brain regions. These findings demonstrate that CNS neuroinflammation during aging is not uniform. Moreover, they raise the possibility that local microglial responses to aging play a critical role in determining which populations of neurons are most vulnerable to functional decline and neurodegenerative disease.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Synaptotagmins 1 and 7 Play Complementary Roles in Somatodendritic Dopamine Release</a></h4>

              
                <p>The molecular mechanisms underlying somatodendritic dopamine (DA) release remain unresolved, despite the passing of decades since its discovery. Our previous work showed robust release of somatodendritic DA in submillimolar extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<SUB>o</SUB>). Here we tested the hypothesis that the high-affinity Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor synaptotagmin 7 (Syt7), is a key determinant of somatodendritic DA release and its Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependence. Somatodendritic DA release from SNc DA neurons was assessed using whole-cell recording in midbrain slices from male and female mice to monitor evoked DA-dependent D2 receptor-mediated inhibitory currents (D2ICs). Single-cell application of an antibody to Syt7 (Syt7 Ab) decreased pulse train-evoked D2ICs, revealing a functional role for Syt7. The assessment of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependence of pulse train-evoked D2ICs confirmed robust DA release in submillimolar [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<SUB>o</SUB> in wild-type (WT) neurons, but loss of this sensitivity with intracellular Syt7 Ab or in Syt7 knock-out (KO) mice. In millimolar [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<SUB>o</SUB>, pulse train-evoked D2ICs in Syt7 KOs showed a greater reduction in decreased [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<SUB>o</SUB> than seen in WT mice; the effect on single pulse-evoked DA release, however, did not differ between genotypes. Single-cell application of a Syt1 Ab had no effect on train-evoked D2ICs in WT SNc DA neurons, but did cause a decrease in D2IC amplitude in Syt7 KOs, indicating a functional substitution of Syt1 for Syt7. In addition, Syt1 Ab decreased single pulse-evoked D2ICs in WT cells, indicating the involvement of Syt1 in tonic DA release. Thus, Syt7 and Syt1 play complementary roles in somatodendritic DA release from SNc DA neurons.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The respective Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependence of somatodendritic and axonal dopamine (DA) release differs, resulting in the persistence of somatodendritic DA release in submillimolar Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations too low to support axonal release. We demonstrate that synaptotagmin7 (Syt7), a high-affinity Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor, underlies phasic somatodendritic DA release and its Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity in the substantia nigra pars compacta. In contrast, we found that synaptotagmin 1 (Syt1), the Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor underlying axonal DA release, plays a role in tonic, but not phasic, somatodendritic DA release in wild-type mice. However, Syt1 can facilitate phasic DA release after Syt7 deletion. Thus, we show that both Syt1 and Syt7 act as Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensors subserving different aspects of somatodendritic DA release processes.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Mllt11 Regulates Migration and Neurite Outgrowth of Cortical Projection Neurons during Development</a></h4>

              
                <p>The formation of connections within the mammalian neocortex is highly regulated by both extracellular guidance mechanisms and intrinsic gene expression programs. There are two types of cortical projection neurons (CPNs): those that project locally and interhemispherically and those that project to subcerebral structures such as the thalamus, hindbrain, and spinal cord. The regulation of cortical projection morphologies is not yet fully understood at the molecular level. Here, we report a role for Mllt11 (Myeloid/lymphoid or mixed-lineage leukemia; translocated to chromosome 11/All1 Fused Gene From Chromosome 1q) in the migration and neurite outgrowth of callosal projection neurons during mouse brain formation. We show that <I>Mllt11</I> expression is exclusive to developing neurons and is enriched in the developing cortical plate (CP) during the formation of the superficial cortical layers. In cultured primary cortical neurons, Mllt11 is detected in varicosities and growth cones as well as the soma. Using conditional loss-of-function and gain-of-function analysis we show that Mllt11 is required for neuritogenesis and proper migration of upper layer CPNs. Loss of <I>Mllt11</I> in the superficial cortex of male and female neonates leads to a severe reduction in fibers crossing the corpus callosum (CC), a progressive loss in the maintenance of upper layer projection neuron gene expression, and reduced complexity of dendritic arborization. Proteomic analysis revealed that Mllt11 associates with stabilized microtubules, and <I>Mllt11</I> loss affected microtubule staining in callosal axons. Taken together, our findings support a role for Mllt11 in promoting the formation of mature upper-layer neuron morphologies and connectivity in the cerebral cortex.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The regulation of cortical projection neuron (CPN) morphologies is an area of active investigation since the time of Cajal. Yet the molecular mechanisms of how the complex dendritic and axonal morphologies of projection neurons are formed remains incompletely understood. Although conditional mutagenesis analysis in the mouse, coupled with overexpression assays in the developing fetal brain, we show that a novel protein called Mllt11 is sufficient and necessary to regulate the dendritic and axonal characteristics of callosal projection neurons in the developing mammalian neocortex. Furthermore, we show that Mllt11 interacts with microtubules, likely accounting for its role in neuritogenesis.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Oxytocin Receptor-Expressing Neurons in the Paraventricular Thalamus Regulate Feeding Motivation through Excitatory Projections to the Nucleus Accumbens Core</a></h4>

              
                <p>Oxytocin receptors (OTR) have been found in the paraventricular thalamus (PVT) for the regulation of feeding and maternal behaviors. However, the functional projections of OTR-expressing PVT neurons remain largely unknown. Here, we used chemogenetic and optogenetic tools to test the role of OTR-expressing PVT neurons and their projections in the regulation of food intake in both male and female OTR-Cre mice. We found chemogenetic activation of OTR-expressing PVT neurons promoted food seeking under trials with a progressive ratio schedule of reinforcement. Using Feeding Experimentation Devices for real-time meal measurements, we found chemogenetic activation of OTR-expressing PVT neurons increased meal frequency but not cumulative food intake because of a compensatory decrease in meal sizes. In combination with anterograde neural tracing and slice patch-clamp recordings, we found optogenetic stimulation of PVT OTR terminals excited neurons in the posterior basolateral amygdala (pBLA) and nucleus accumbens core (NAcC) as well as local PVT neurons through monosynaptic glutamatergic transmissions. Photostimulation of OTR-expressing PVT-NAcC projections promoted food-seeking, whereas selective activation of PVT-pBLA projections produced little effect on feeding. In contrast to selective activation of OTR terminals, photostimulation of a broader population of glutamatergic PVT terminals exerted direct excitation followed by indirect lateral inhibition on neurons in both NAcC and anterior basolateral amygdala. Together, these results suggest that OTR-expressing PVT neurons are a distinct population of PVT glutamate neurons that regulate feeding motivation through projections to NAcC.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The paraventricular thalamus plays an important role in the regulation of feeding motivation. However, because of the diversity of paraventricular thalamic neurons, the specific neuron types promoting food motivation remain elusive. In this study, we provide evidence that oxytocin receptor-expressing neurons are a specific group of glutamate neurons that primarily project to the nucleus accumbens core and posterior amygdala. We found that activation of these neurons promotes the motivation for food reward and increases meal frequency through projections to the nucleus accumbens core but not the posterior amygdala. As a result, we postulate that oxytocin receptor-expressing neurons in the paraventricular thalamus and their projections to the nucleus accumbens core mainly regulate feeding motivation but not food consumption.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Local Interactions between Steady-State Visually Evoked Potentials at Nearby Flickering Frequencies</a></h4>

              
                <p>Steady-state visually evoked potentials (SSVEPs) are widely used to index top-down cognitive processing in human electroencephalogram (EEG) studies. Typically, two stimuli flickering at different temporal frequencies (TFs) are presented, each producing a distinct response in the EEG at its flicker frequency. However, how SSVEP responses in EEGs are modulated in the presence of a competing flickering stimulus just because of sensory interactions is not well understood. We have previously shown in local field potentials (LFPs) recorded from awake monkeys that when two overlapping full-screen gratings are counterphased at different TFs, there is an asymmetric SSVEP response suppression, with greater suppression from lower TFs, which further depends on the relative orientations of the gratings (stronger suppression and asymmetry for parallel compared with orthogonal gratings). Here, we first confirmed these effects in both male and female human EEG recordings. Then, we mapped the response suppression of one stimulus (target) by a competing stimulus (mask) over a much wider range than the previous study. Surprisingly, we found that the suppression was not stronger at low frequencies in general, but systematically varied depending on the target TF, indicating local interactions between the two competing stimuli. These results were confirmed in both human EEG and monkey LFP and electrocorticogram (ECoG) data. Our results show that sensory interactions between multiple SSVEPs are more complex than shown previously and are influenced by both local and global factors, underscoring the need to cautiously interpret the results of studies involving SSVEP paradigms.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Steady-state visually evoked potentials (SSVEPs) are extensively used in human cognitive studies and brain&ndash;computer interfacing applications where multiple stimuli flickering at distinct frequencies are concurrently presented in the visual field. We recently characterized interactions between competing flickering stimuli in animal recordings and found that stimuli flickering slowly produce larger suppression. Here, we confirmed these in human EEGs, and further characterized the interactions by using a much wider range of target and competing (mask) frequencies in both human EEGs and invasive animal recordings. These revealed a new "local" component, whereby the suppression increased when competing stimuli flickered at nearby frequencies. Our results highlight the complexity of sensory interactions among multiple SSVEPs and underscore the need to cautiously interpret studies involving SSVEP paradigms.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Spatial Learning Drives Rapid Goal Representation in Hippocampal Ripples without Place Field Accumulation or Goal-Oriented Theta Sequences</a></h4>

              
                <p>The hippocampus is critical for rapid acquisition of many forms of memory, although the circuit-level mechanisms through which the hippocampus rapidly consolidates novel information are unknown. Here, the activity of large ensembles of hippocampal neurons in adult male Long-Evans rats was monitored across a period of rapid spatial learning to assess how the network changes during the initial phases of memory formation and retrieval. In contrast to several reports, the hippocampal network did not display enhanced representation of the goal location via accumulation of place fields or elevated firing rates at the goal. Rather, population activity rates increased globally as a function of experience. These alterations in activity were mirrored in the power of the theta oscillation and in the quality of theta sequences, without preferential encoding of paths to the learned goal location. In contrast, during brief "offline" pauses in movement, representation of a novel goal location emerged rapidly in ripples, preceding other changes in network activity. These data demonstrate that the hippocampal network can facilitate active navigation without enhanced goal representation during periods of active movement, and further indicate that goal representation in hippocampal ripples before movement onset supports subsequent navigation, possibly through activation of downstream cortical networks.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Understanding the mechanisms through which the networks of the brain rapidly assimilate information and use previously learned knowledge are fundamental areas of focus in neuroscience. In particular, the hippocampal circuit is a critical region for rapid formation and use of spatial memory. In this study, several circuit-level features of hippocampal function were quantified while rats performed a spatial navigation task requiring rapid memory formation and use. During periods of active navigation, a general increase in overall network activity is observed during memory acquisition, which plateaus during memory retrieval periods, without specific enhanced representation of the goal location. During pauses in navigation, rapid representation of the distant goal well emerges before either behavioral improvement or changes in online activity.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Reduced Primacy Bias in Autism during Early Sensory Processing</a></h4>

              
                <p>Recent theories of autism propose that a core deficit in autism would be a less context-sensitive weighting of prediction errors. There is also first support for this hypothesis on an early sensory level. However, an open question is whether this decreased context sensitivity is caused by faster updating of one's model of the world (i.e., higher weighting of new information), proposed by predictive coding theories, or slower model updating. Here, we differentiated between these two hypotheses by investigating how first impressions shape the mismatch negativity (MMN), reflecting early sensory prediction error processing. An autism and matched control group of human adults (both <I>n</I> = 27, 8 female) were compared on the multi-timescale MMN paradigm, in which tones were presented that were either standard (frequently occurring) or deviant (rare), and these roles reversed every block. A well-replicated observation is that the initial model (i.e., the standard and deviant sound in the first block) influences MMN amplitudes in later blocks. If autism is characterized by faster model updating, and thus a smaller primacy bias, we hypothesized (and demonstrate using a simple reinforcement learning model) that their MMN amplitudes should be less influenced by the initial context. In line with this hypothesis, we found that MMN responses in the autism group did not differ between the initial deviant and initial standard sounds as they did in the control group. These findings are consistent with the idea that autism is characterized by faster model updating during early sensory processing, as proposed by predictive coding accounts of autism.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Recent theories of autism propose that a core deficit in autism is that they are faster to update their models of the world based on new sensory information. Here, we tested this hypothesis by investigating how first impressions shape brain responses during early sensory processing, and hypothesized that individuals with autism would be less influenced by these first impressions. In line with earlier studies, our results show that early sensory processing was influenced by first impressions in a control group. However, this was not the case in an autism group. This suggests that individuals with autism are faster to abandon their initial model, and is consistent with the proposal that they are faster to update their models of the world.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Foundational Number Sense Training Gains Are Predicted by Hippocampal-Parietal Circuits</a></h4>

              
                <p>The development of mathematical skills in early childhood relies on number sense, the foundational ability to discriminate among quantities. Number sense in early childhood is predictive of academic and professional success, and deficits in number sense are thought to underlie lifelong impairments in mathematical abilities. Despite its importance, the brain circuit mechanisms that support number sense learning remain poorly understood. Here, we designed a theoretically motivated training program to determine brain circuit mechanisms underlying foundational number sense learning in female and male elementary school-age children (7&ndash;10 years). Our 4 week integrative number sense training program gradually strengthened the understanding of the relations between symbolic (Arabic numerals) and nonsymbolic (sets of items) representations of quantity. We found that our number sense training program improved symbolic quantity discrimination ability in children across a wide range of math abilities including children with learning difficulties. Crucially, the strength of pretraining functional connectivity between the hippocampus and intraparietal sulcus, brain regions implicated in associative learning and quantity discrimination, respectively, predicted individual differences in number sense learning across typically developing children and children with learning difficulties. Reverse meta-analysis of interregional coactivations across 14,371 fMRI studies and 89 cognitive functions confirmed a reliable role for hippocampal&ndash;intraparietal sulcus circuits in learning. Our study identifies a canonical hippocampal&ndash;parietal circuit for learning that plays a foundational role in children's cognitive skill acquisition. Findings provide important insights into neurobiological circuit markers of individual differences in children's learning and delineate a robust target for effective cognitive interventions.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Mathematical skill development relies on number sense, the ability to discriminate among quantities. Here, we develop a theoretically motivated training program and investigate brain circuits that predict number sense learning in children during a period important for acquisition of foundational cognitive skills. Our integrated number sense training program was effective in children across a wide a range of math abilities, including children with learning difficulties. We identify hippocampal&ndash;parietal circuits that predict individual differences in learning gains. Our study identifies a brain circuit critical for the acquisition of foundational cognitive skills, which will be useful for developing effective interventions to remediate learning disabilities.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">KL1 Domain of Longevity Factor Klotho Mimics the Metabolome of Cognitive Stimulation and Enhances Cognition in Young and Aging Mice</a></h4>

              
                <p>Cognitive deficits are a major biomedical challenge&mdash;and engagement of the brain in stimulating tasks improves cognition in aged individuals (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B44">Wilson et al., 2002</cross-ref>; <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B19">Gates et al., 2011</cross-ref>) and rodents (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B2">Aidil-Carvalho et al., 2017</cross-ref>), through unknown mechanisms. Whether cognitive stimulation alters specific metabolic pathways in the brain is unknown. Understanding which metabolic processes are involved in cognitive stimulation is important because it could lead to pharmacologic intervention that promotes biological effects of a beneficial behavior, toward the goal of effective medical treatments for cognitive deficits. Here we show using male mice that cognitive stimulation induced metabolic remodeling of the mouse hippocampus, and that pharmacologic treatment with the longevity hormone &alpha;-klotho (KL), mediated by its KL1 domain, partially mimicked this alteration. The shared, metabolic signature shared between cognitive stimulation and treatment with KL or KL1 closely correlated with individual mouse cognitive performance, indicating a link between metabolite levels and learning and memory. Importantly, the treatment of mice with KL1, an endogenous circulating factor that more closely mimicked cognitive stimulation than KL, acutely increased synaptic plasticity, a substrate of cognition. KL1 also improved cognition, itself, in young mice and countered deficits in old mice. Our data show that treatments or interventions mimicking the hippocampal metabolome of cognitive stimulation can enhance brain functions. Further, we identify the specific domain by which klotho promotes brain functions, through KL1, a metabolic mimic of cognitive stimulation.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Cognitive deficits are a major biomedical challenge without truly effective pharmacologic treatments. Engaging the brain through cognitive tasks benefits cognition. Mimicking the effects of such beneficial behaviors through pharmacological treatment represents a highly valuable medical approach to treating cognitive deficits. We demonstrate that brain engagement through cognitive stimulation induces metabolic remodeling of the hippocampus that was acutely recapitulated by the longevity factor klotho, mediated by its KL1 domain. Treatment with KL1, a close mimic of cognitive stimulation, enhanced cognition and countered cognitive aging. Our findings shed light on how cognition metabolically alters the brain and provide a plausible therapeutic intervention for mimicking these alterations that, in turn, improves cognition in the young and aging brain.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Spectral Distribution Dynamics across Different Attentional Priority States</a></h4>

              
                <p>Anticipatory covert spatial attention improves performance on tests of visual detection and discrimination, and shifts are accompanied by decreases and increases of &alpha; band power at electroencephalography (EEG) electrodes corresponding to the attended and unattended location, respectively. Although the increase at the unattended location is often interpreted as an active mechanism (e.g., inhibiting processing at the unattended location), most experiments cannot rule out the alternative possibility that it is a secondary consequence of selection elsewhere. To adjudicate between these accounts, we designed a Posner-style visual cueing task in which male and female human participants made orientation judgments of targets appearing at one of four locations: up, down, right, or left. Critically, trials were blocked such that within a block the locations along one meridian alternated in status between attended and unattended, and targets never appeared at the other two, making them irrelevant. Analyses of the concurrently measured EEG signal were conducted on "traditional" narrowband &alpha; (8&ndash;14 Hz), as well as on two components resulting from the decomposition of this signal: "periodic" &alpha;; and the slope of the aperiodic 1/f-like component. Although data from right-left blocks replicated the familiar pattern of lateralized asymmetry in narrowband &alpha; power, with neither &alpha; signal could we find evidence for any difference in the time course at unattended versus irrelevant locations, an outcome consistent with the secondary-consequence interpretation of attention-related dynamics in the &alpha; band. Additionally, 1/f slope was shallower at attended and unattended locations, relative to irrelevant, suggesting a tonic adjustment of physiological state.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Visual spatial attention, the prioritization of one location in the visual field, is critical for guiding behavior in cluttered environments. Although influential theories posit an important role for &alpha; band oscillations in the inhibition of processing at unattended locations, we used a novel procedure to find evidence for an alternative interpretation: selection of one location may simply result in a return to physiological baseline at all others. In addition to determining one way that attention does not work (important for future progress in this field), we also discovered novel evidence for one way that it does work: by modifying the tonic physiological state (indexed by an aperiodic component of the electroencephalography (EEG)] at locations where spatial selection is likely to occur.</p>

                <p>Retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) die after optic nerve trauma or in degenerative disease. However, acute changes in protein expression that may regulate RGC response to injury are not fully understood, and detailed methods to quantify new protein synthesis have not been tested. Here, we develop and apply a new <I>in vivo</I> quantitative measure of newly synthesized proteins to examine changes occurring in the retina after optic nerve injury. Azidohomoalanine, a noncanonical amino acid, was injected intravitreally into the eyes of rodents of either sex with or without optic nerve injury. Isotope variants of biotin-alkyne were used for quantitative BONCAT (QBONCAT) mass spectrometry, allowing identification of protein synthesis and transport rate changes in more than 1000 proteins at 1 or 5 d after optic nerve injury. <I>In vitro</I> screening showed several newly synthesized proteins regulate axon outgrowth in primary neurons <I>in vitro</I>. This novel approach to targeted quantification of newly synthesized proteins after injury uncovers a dynamic translational response within broader proteostasis regulation and enhances our understanding of the cellular response to injury.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Optic nerve injury results in death and degeneration of retinal ganglion cells and their axons. The specific cellular response to injury, including changes in new protein synthesis, is obscured by existing proteins and protein degradation. In this study, we introduce QBONCAT to isolate and quantify acute protein synthesis and subsequent transport between cellular compartments. We identify novel candidate protein effectors of the regenerative response and uncover their regulation of axon growth <I>in vitro</I>, validating the utility of QBONCAT for the discovery of novel regulatory and therapeutic candidates after optic nerve injury.</p>

                Background: Postoperative depressive symptoms are associated with pain, readmissions, death, and other undesirable outcomes. Ketamine produces rapid but transient antidepressant effects in the perioperative setting. Longer infusions confer lasting antidepressant activity in patients with treatment-resistant depression, but it is unknown whether a similar approach may produce a lasting antidepressant effect after surgery. This protocol describes a pilot study that will assess the feasibility of conducting a larger scale randomized clinical trial addressing this knowledge gap. Methods: This single-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot trial involves the enrollment of 32 patients aged 18 years or older with a history of depression scheduled for surgery with planned intensive care unit admission. On the first day following surgery and extubation, participants will be randomized to an intravenous eight-hour infusion of either ketamine (0.5 mg kg-1 over 10 minutes followed by a continuous rate of 0.3 mg kg-1 h-1) or an equal volume of normal saline. Depressive symptoms will be quantified using the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale preoperatively and serially up to 14 days after the infusion. To detect ketamine-induced changes on overnight sleep architecture, a wireless headband will be used to record electroencephalograms preoperatively, during the study infusion, and after infusion. The primary feasibility endpoints will include the fraction of patients approached who enroll, the fraction of randomized patients who complete the study infusion, and the fraction of randomized patients who complete outcome data collection. Conclusions: This pilot study will evaluate the feasibility of a future large comparative effectiveness trial of ketamine to reduce depressive symptoms in postsurgical patients. Registration: K-PASS is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT05233566; registered February 10, 2022.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Datasets on the variations of  minerals in biofortified cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz)  as a function of storage root portion,  maturity and environment [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The accurate measurements of the mineral content of cassava roots are vital from a nutritional perspective. The research datasets were from the study assessing the influence of storage root portion, maturity, and environment on the variations of minerals in biofortified cassava roots. Methods: Twenty-five biofortified clones with three varieties as checks were harvested 12 months after planting from five different environments. Also,  a different thirty-nine (39) biofortified cassava clones from the unlimited yield trials (UYTs) that included five (5) white-fleshed varieties (as control) were harvested at the age of 9 and 12 months after planting. In addition, two different methods of sample preparations were employed, using a cork borer and without a cork borer. The samples’ elemental (minerals) analysis was determined using a standard laboratory method. Results and conclusion: The breeders could use the data in their biofortification cassava programs to know the distribution of minerals in the roots and identify the best promising pipelines. Also, the data could be used by food scientists and nutritionists to understand the parts of the roots with optimum minerals to design their processing protocols and to know those genotypes specific to different environments that could be used for various nutrition intervention programs.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">High-level biocontainment laboratories: risks and necessity for society [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Advancements in the biological sciences have made it possible to manipulate life forms in unprecedented ways. Recognizing the possible dangers connected with this activity, as well as with work involving natural pathogens, countries have promoted the building of High Safety and High Containment Laboratories, classified as Biological Safety Levels 3 and 4. In this article I briefly summarize the major features of these laboratories, exemplify some of the research that they host, highlight the possible dangers, and argue for the opportunity of a reduction of possibly dangerous research, and for more transparency and openness about activities that imply risks not only for those involved, but for human and environmental health as well.

                The enteric nervous system regulates various physiological and pathological processes. Zhu et al. investigated the cross talk between enteric serotonergic neurons and colorectal tumorigenesis in mice and revealed the critical role of neurotransmitter 5-HT in colorectal tumor initiation. These observations provide an additional layer for tumor regulation by the enteric nervous system.

                How heat signals are processed in the spinal cord remains unclear. Wang et al. found that ErbB4+ excitatory interneurons are activated by noxious heat, and they participate in heat sensation in mice. In addition, the neuregulin-ErbB4 signaling regulates heat sensation and contributes to heat hypersensitivity under pathological conditions.

                Hauser et al. use the genetic tagging of a single alternative exon, targeted proteomics, and loss-of-function models to analyze the synaptic localization and function of splice isoforms of synaptic adhesion molecules. They demonstrate that post-transcriptional control generates specific splice isoforms for dendrite-targeting GABAergic synapses.

Theory has predicted the existence of a ‘fireball’ phase following directly on from the runaway fusion, which should be observable as a short, bright and soft X-ray flash before the nova becomes visible in the optical3–5. Here we report observations of a bright and soft X-ray flash associated with the classical Galactic nova YZ Reticuli 11 h before its 9 mag optical brightening. No X-ray source was detected 4 h before and after the event, constraining the duration of the flash to shorter than 8 h. In agreement with theoretical predictions4,6–8, the source’s spectral shape is consistent with a black-body of 3.27+0.11−0.33 × 105 K (28.2+0.9−2.8 eV), or a white dwarf atmosphere, radiating at the Eddington luminosity, with a photosphere that is only slightly larger than a typical white dwarf.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">C/EBPδ-induced epigenetic changes control the dynamic gene transcription of S100a8 and S100a9</a></h4>

              
                The proinflammatory alarmins S100A8 and S100A9 are among the most abundant proteins in neutrophils and monocytes but are completely silenced after differentiation to macrophages. The molecular mechanisms of the extraordinarily dynamic transcriptional regulation of <i>S100a8</i> and <i>S100a9</i> genes, however, are only barely understood. Using an unbiased genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 knockout based screening approach in immortalized murine monocytes we identified the transcription factor C/EBPδ as a central regulator of <i>S100a8</i> and <i>S100a9</i> expression. We showed that S100A8/A9 expression and thereby neutrophil recruitment and cytokine release were decreased in C/EBPδ KO mice in a mouse model of acute lung inflammation. <i>S100a8</i> and <i>S100a9</i> expression was further controlled by the C/EBPδ-antagonists ATF3 and FBXW7. We confirmed the clinical relevance of this regulatory network in subpopulations of human monocytes in a clinical cohort of cardiovascular patients. Moreover, we identified specific C/EBPδ-binding sites within <i>S100a8</i> and <i>S100a9</i> promoter regions, and demonstrated that C/EBPδ-dependent JMJD3-mediated demethylation of H3K27me<sub>3</sub> is indispensable for their expression. Overall, our work uncovered C/EBPδ as a novel regulator of <i>S100a8</i> and <i>S100a9</i> expression. Therefore, C/EBPδ represents a promising target for modulation of inflammatory conditions that are characterised by <i>S100a8</i> and <i>S100a9</i> overexpression.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Paracrine signalling between intestinal epithelial and tumour cells induces a regenerative programme</a></h4>

              
                Tumours are complex ecosystems composed of different types of cells that communicate and influence each other. While the critical role of stromal cells in affecting tumour growth is well established, the impact of mutant cancer cells on healthy surrounding tissues remains poorly defined. Here, using mouse intestinal organoids, we uncover a paracrine mechanism by which intestinal cancer cells reactivate foetal and regenerative YAP-associated transcriptional programmes in neighbouring wildtype epithelial cells, rendering them adapted to thrive in the tumour context. We identify the glycoprotein thrombospondin-1 (THBS1) as the essential factor that mediates non-cell-autonomous morphological and transcriptional responses. Importantly, Thbs1 is associated with bad prognosis in several human cancers. This study reveals the THBS1-YAP axis as the mechanistic link mediating paracrine interactions between epithelial cells in intestinal tumours.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Conservation and divergence of myelin proteome and oligodendrocyte transcriptome profiles between humans and mice</a></h4>

              
                Human myelin disorders are commonly studied in mouse models. Since both clades evolutionarily diverged approximately 85 million years ago, it is critical to know to what extent the myelin protein composition has remained similar. Here, we use quantitative proteomics to analyze myelin purified from human white matter and find that the relative abundance of the structural myelin proteins PLP, MBP, CNP, and SEPTIN8 correlates well with that in C57Bl/6N mice. Conversely, multiple other proteins were identified exclusively or predominantly in human or mouse myelin. This is exemplified by peripheral myelin protein 2 (PMP2), which was specific to human central nervous system myelin, while tetraspanin-2 (TSPAN2) and connexin-29 (CX29/GJC3) were confined to mouse myelin. Assessing published scRNA-seq-datasets, human and mouse oligodendrocytes display well-correlating transcriptome profiles but divergent expression of distinct genes, including <i>Pmp2, Tspan2,</i> and <i>Gjc3</i>. A searchable web interface is accessible via <a href="https://www.mpinat.mpg.de/myelin">www.mpinat.mpg.de/myelin</a>. Species-dependent diversity of oligodendroglial mRNA expression and myelin protein composition can be informative when translating from mouse models to humans.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Radiocarbon and genomic evidence for the survival of Equus Sussemionus until the late Holocene</a></h4>

              
                The exceptionally-rich fossil record available for the equid family has provided textbook examples of macroevolutionary changes. Horses, asses and zebras represent three extant subgenera of <i>Equus</i> lineage, while the <i>Sussemionus</i> subgenus is another remarkable <i>Equus</i> lineage ranging from North America to Ethiopia in the Pleistocene. We sequenced 26 archaeological specimens from northern China in the Holocene that could be assigned morphologically and genetically to <i>Equus ovodovi</i>, a species representative of <i>Sussemionus</i>. We present the first high-quality complete genome of the <i>Sussemionus</i> lineage, which was sequenced to 13.4× depth-of-coverage. Radiocarbon dating demonstrates that this lineage survived until ~3,500 years ago, despite continued demographic collapse during the Last Glacial Maximum and the great human expansion in East Asia. We also confirmed the <i>Equus</i> phylogenetic tree, and found that <i>Sussemionus</i> diverged from the ancestor of non-caballine equids ~2.3-2.7 Million years ago and possibly remained affected by secondary gene flow post-divergence. We found that the small genetic diversity, rather than enhanced inbreeding, limited the species' chances of survival. Our work adds to the growing literature illustrating how ancient DNA can inform on extinction dynamics and the long-term resilience of species surviving in cryptic population pockets.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Proteomic Analysis of Huntington's Disease Medium Spiny Neurons Identifies Alterations in Lipid Droplets</a></h4>

              
                Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disease caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the Huntingtin (HTT) gene. The resulting polyglutamine (polyQ) tract alters the function of the HTT protein. Although HTT is expressed in different tissues, the medium spiny projection neurons (MSNs) in the striatum are particularly vulnerable in HD. Thus, we sought to define the proteome of human HD patient-derived MSNs. We differentiated HD72 induced pluripotent stem cells and isogenic controls into MSNs and carried out quantitative proteomic analysis by two approaches. First, using data-dependent acquisitions with FAIMS (FAIMS-DDA) for label-free quantification on the Orbitrap Lumos mass spectrometer, we identified 6,323 proteins with at least two unique peptides (FDR equal or less than 0.01). Of these, 901 proteins were significantly altered in the HD72-MSNs, compared to isogenic controls. Second, we quantitatively validated protein candidates by comprehensive data-independent acquisitions on a TripleTOF 6600 mass spectrometer quantifying 3,106 proteins with at least two unique peptides. Functional enrichment analysis identified pathways related to the extracellular matrix, TGF-beta regulation of extracellular matrix, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, DNA replication, senescence, cardiovascular system, organism development, regulation of cell migration and locomotion, aminoglycan glycosaminoglycan proteoglycan, growth factor stimulus and fatty acid processes. Conversely, processes associated with the downregulated proteins included neurogenesis-axogenesis, the brain-derived neurotrophic factor-signaling pathway, Ephrin-A: EphA pathway, regulation of synaptic plasticity, triglyceride homeostasis cholesterol, plasmid lipoprotein particle immune response, interferon-gamma; signaling, immune system major histocompatibility complex, lipid metabolism and cellular response to stimulus. Moreover, proteins involved in the formation and maintenance of axons, dendrites, and synapses (e.g., Septin protein members) are dysregulated in HD72-MSNs. Importantly, lipid metabolism pathways were altered, and we found that lipid droplets accumulated in the HD72-MSNs, suggesting a deficit in lipophagy. Our proteomics analysis of HD72-MSNs identified relevant pathways that are altered in MSNs and confirm current and new therapeutic targets for HD.

                Microglial activation plays central roles in neuro-inflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases. Positron emission tomography (PET) targeting 18kDa Translocator Protein (TSPO) is widely used for localising inflammation in vivo, but its quantitative interpretation remains uncertain. We show that TSPO expression increases in activated microglia in mouse brain disease models but does not change in a non-human primate disease model or in common neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory human diseases. We describe genetic divergence in the TSPO gene promoter, consistent with the hypothesis that the increase in TSPO expression in activated myeloid cells is unique to a subset of species within the Muroidea superfamily of rodents. We show that TSPO is mechanistically linked to classical pro-inflammatory myeloid cell function in rodents but not humans. These data emphasise that TSPO expression in human myeloid cells is related to different phenomena than in mice, and that TSPO PET reflects density of inflammatory cells rather than activation state.

                Activation of neurotrophic factor signaling is a promising therapy for neurodegeneration. However, limited availability of both ligands and receptors permits only transient activation. In this study, we conquered this problem by inventing a new system that forces membrane localization of the intracellular domain of neurotrophin receptor TrkB, which results in constitutive activation without ligands. Our new system overcomes the small size limitation of the genome packaging in adeno-associated virus and allows high expression of the transgene. Single gene therapy using the modified form of TrkB enhances neuroprotection in mose models of glaucoma, and stimulates robust axon regeneration after optic nerve injury. Our system may be also applicable to other trophic factor signaling and lead to a significant advance in the field of gene therapy for neurodegenerative disorders.

                To study molecular and cellular processes of the brain in vitro, the cultivation of postnatal organotypic hippocampal slices should be established. The methodological approach had to be optimized several times because the result of the cultivation was not optimal. Initially, cultivation was performed by roller tube culture, which is the first developed cultivation method for these cultures. As the cultures detached or even dissolved, further cultivation was carried out using inserts, which represent a modification of the roller tube cultures. In the further course it came also to the use of different preparation methods and to the exchange of the medium and the incubator, in order to obtain a result of the organ cultivation corresponding to the expectations. The results show that cultivation on semi-permeable membranes has an advantage over roller tube cultures. On the one hand, there is no detachment and dissolution of hippocampal slices due to the mechanical influence and on the other hand, the tissue shows an improvement in general condition compared to roller tube cultures. Furthermore, it was found that an acceleration of the preparation time has positive effects on the neurons. In addition, it could be shown by the recorded time series that a cultivation over a longer period of time stabilizes the tissue. If the hippocampi remain connected to the entorhinal cortex, wallerian degeneration does not occur, resulting in longer survival of the cells in the postnatal cultures and thus strengthening the tissue.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Baseline control of optimal performance in recurrent neural networks</a></h4>

              
                Changes in behavioral state, such as arousal and movements, strongly affect neural activity in sensory areas. Recent evidence suggests that they may be mediated by top-down projections regulating the statistics of baseline input currents to sensory areas, inducing qualitatively different effects across sensory modalities. What are the computational benefits of these baseline modulations? We investigate this question within a brain-inspired framework for reservoir computing, where we vary the quenched baseline inputs to a random neural network. We found that baseline modulations control the dynamical phase of the reservoir network, unlocking a vast repertoire of network phases. We uncover a new zoo of bistable phases exhibiting the simultaneous coexistence of fixed points and chaos, of two fixed points, and of weak and strong chaos. Crucially, we discovered a host of novel phenomena, including noise-driven enhancement of chaos and ergodicity breaking; neural hysteresis, whereby transitions across phase boundary retain the memory of the initial phase. Strikingly, we found that baseline control can achieve optimal performance without any fine tuning of recurrent couplings. In summary, baseline control of network dynamics opens new directions for brain-inspired artificial intelligence and provides a new interpretation for the ubiquitously observed behavioral modulations of cortical activity.

                Since generations, singing and speech have been mainly transmitted orally. How does oral transmission shape the evolution of music? Here, we developed a method for conducting online transmission experiments, in which sung melodies are passed from one singer to the next. We show that cognitive and motor constraints play a profound role in the emergence of melodic structure. Specifically, initially random tones develop into more structured systems that increasingly reuse and combine fewer elements, making melodies easier to learn and transmit over time. We discuss how our findings are compatible with melodic universals found in most human cultures and culturally specific characteristics of participants' previous musical exposure. Overall, our method efficiently automates online singing experiments while enabling large-scale data collection using standard computers available to everyone. We see great potential in further extending this work to increase the efficiency, scalability, and diversity of research on cultural evolution and cognitive science.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The arrow-of-time in neuroimaging time series identifies causal triggers of brain function</a></h4>

              
                Moving from association to causal analysis of neuroimaging data is crucial to advance our understanding of brain function. The arrow-of-time (AoT), i.e., the known asymmetric nature of the passage of time, is the bedrock of causal structures shaping physical phenomena. However, almost all current time series metrics do not exploit this asymmetry, probably due to the difficulty to account for it in modelling frameworks. Here, we introduce an AoT-sensitive metric that captures the intensity of causal effects in multivariate time series, and apply it to high-resolution functional neuroimaging data. We find that that causal effects underlying brain function are more clearly localized in space and time than functional activity or connectivity, thereby allowing us to trace neural pathways recruited in different conditions. Overall, we provide a mapping of the causal brain that challenges the association paradigm of brain function.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A lysine residue from an extracellular turret switches the ion preference in a Cav3 T-Type channel</a></h4>

              
                A dominant sodium influx is mediated by a lysine residue in a novel extracellular loop of T-type Cav3 channels. Here we expressed calcium- and sodium-permeable splice variants which have exons 12b and 12a, respectively, as well as mutated channels containing exons Lys-12a-Ala and Ala-12b-Lys. We demonstrate that the mutant channels render high sodium permeability and calcium selectivity, respectively. Modelling illustrate that the pore lysine is salt-bridged to an aspartate residue immediately C-terminal to the second-domain glutamate of the selectivity-filter. We propose that a calcium ion chelated between the aspartate and the selectivity-filter glutamate is knocked-out by the incoming calcium ion in the process of calcium permeation, but sodium ions are repelled. The aspartate is neutralized by the lysine residue in the sodium-permeant variant, allowing for sodium permeation through the selectivity filter ring of four acidic residues akin to the prokaryotic sodium channels with four glutamates in the selectivity filter.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Impaired dendritic spike generation in the Fragile X prefrontal cortex is due to loss of dendritic sodium channels</a></h4>

              
                Patients with Fragile X syndrome, the leading monogenetic cause of autism, suffer from impairments related to the prefrontal cortex including working memory and attention. Synaptic inputs to the distal dendrites of layer 5 pyramidal neurons in the prefrontal cortex have a weak influence on the somatic membrane potential. To overcome this filtering, distal inputs are transformed into local dendritic Na+ spikes, which propagate to the soma and trigger action potential output. Layer 5 extratelencephalic (ET) PFC neurons project to the brainstem and various thalamic nuclei and are therefore well positioned to integrate task-relevant sensory signals and guide motor actions. We used current clamp and outside-out patch clamp recording to investigate dendritic spike generation in ET neurons from male wild type and Fmr1 knockout (FX) mice. The threshold for dendritic spikes was more depolarized in FX neurons compared to wild type. Analysis of voltage responses to simulated in vivo "noisy" current injections showed that a larger dendritic input stimulus was required to elicit dendritic spikes in FX ET dendrites compared wild type. Patch clamp recordings revealed that the dendritic Na+ conductance was significantly smaller in FX ET dendrites. Taken together, our results suggest that input-output transformation is impaired in ET neurons of the PFC in FX mice. Considering our prior findings that somatic D-type K+ and dendritic HCN-channel function is reduced in ET neurons, we suggest that the integration of information by PFC circuits is fundamentally altered in Fragile X syndrome.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Novel mechanism of hypoxic neuronal injury mediated by non-excitatory amino acids and astroglial swelling</a></h4>

              
                Bleeding into cerebral parenchyma during hemorrhagic stroke or head trauma leads to ischemia and release of plasmatic content, including amino acids (AA). Although excitotoxic AA have been extensively studied, little is known about non excitatory AA during hypoxic injury. Hypoxia-induced synaptic depression becomes irreversible after adding non-excitatory AA to hippocampal slices, alongside their intracellular accumulation and increased tissue electrical resistance. A combination of four non-excitatory AA (L-alanine, glycine, L glutamine, L-serine: AGQS) at plasmatic concentrations was applied to brain slices from transgenic mice expressing EGFP in pyramidal neurons or astrocytes during normoxia or hypoxia. Two-photon imaging, changes in light transmittance (LT), and electrophysiological field recordings followed by electron microscopy in hippocampal CA1 st. radiatum were used to monitor synaptic function concurrently with cellular swelling and injury. During normoxia, AGQS-induced increase in LT was due to astroglial but not neuronal swelling. Fast LT raise during hypoxia and AGQS manifested neuronal and astroglial swelling accompanied by a permanent loss of synaptic transmission and irreversible dendritic beading, signifying acute tissue damage. Neuronal injury was not triggered by spreading depolarization which did not occur in our experiments. Hypoxia without AGQS did not cause cell swelling, leaving dendrites intact. Inhibition of NMDA receptors prevented neuronal damage and irreversible loss of synaptic function. Deleterious effects of AGQS during hypoxia were prevented by alanine-serine-cysteine transporters (ASCT2) and volume-regulated anion channels (VRAC) blockers. Our findings suggest that swelling induced by intracellular accumulation of non-excitatory AA and release of excitotoxins through antiporters and VRAC may exacerbate the hypoxia-induced neuronal injury.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The hunger hormone ghrelin is associated with neural activation during touch, but not its affective experience</a></h4>

              
                The gut hormone ghrelin drives food motivation and increases food intake, but it is also involved in the anticipation of and response to rewards other than food. This pre-registered study investigated how naturally varying ghrelin levels affect the processing of touch as a social reward in humans. Sixty-eight volunteers received social-affective touch as a social reward and control touch on their shins during 3T functional imaging on two test days. On one occasion participants were fasted and on another they received a meal. On each occasion plasma ghrelin was measured at three time points. All touch was rated as more pleasant after the meal, but there was no association between ghrelin levels and pleasantness ratings. Social-affective touch was rated as most pleasant and activated somatosensory and reward networks (whole-brain). A region-of-interest in the right medial orbitofrontal cortex (mOFC) showed decreased activation during all touch when ghrelin levels were high. During social-affective touch, a larger ghrelin suppression following the meal was associated with higher mOFC activation, which in turn was associated with higher experienced pleasantness. Overall, high ghrelin levels were associated with a reduction in reward-related brain activation. This suggests that ghrelin carries a negative valence signal that, however, does not alter subjective experience. Demonstrating that ghrelin is implicated in the processing of social-affective touch speaks for its versatile role in reward processes beyond motivating food search and consumption.

                Mice adeptly use their whiskers to touch, recognize, and learn about objects in their environment. This ability is enabled by computations performed by populations of neurons in the somatosensory cortex. To understand these computations, we trained mice to use their whiskers to recognize different shapes while we recorded activity in the barrel cortex, which processes whisker input. Here, we present a large dataset of high-speed video of the whiskers, along with rigorous tracking of the entire extent of multiple whiskers and every contact they made on the shape. We used spike sorting to identify individual neurons, which responded with precise timing to whisker contacts and motion. These data will be useful for understanding the behavioral strategies mice use to identify objects by touch, as well as the neuronal responses that mediate those strategies. More generally, our carefully curated labeled data could be used to develop new computer vision algorithms for tracking body posture, or for extracting responses of individual neurons from large-scale neural recordings.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Saccade-related modulation of oscillatory activity in primary auditory cortex</a></h4>

              
                The auditory and visual sensory systems are both used by the brain to obtain and organize information from our external environment, yet there are fundamental differences between these two systems. Visual information is acquired using systematic patterns of fixations and saccades, which are controlled by internal motor commands. Sensory input occurs in volleys that are tied to the timing of saccades. In contrast, the auditory system does not use such an overt motor sampling routine so the relationship between sensory input timing and motor activity is less clear. Previous studies of primary visual cortex (V1) in nonhuman primates (NHP) have shown that there is a cyclical modulation of excitability tied to the eye movement cycle and suggests that this excitability modulation stems from the phase reset of neuronal oscillations. We hypothesized that if saccades provide a supramodal temporal context for environmental information then we should also see saccade-related modulation of oscillatory activity in primary auditory cortex (A1) as NHPs shift their gaze around their surroundings. We used linear array multielectrodes to record cortical laminar neuroelectric activity profiles while subjects sat in a dark or dimly lit and silent chamber. Analysis of oscillatory activity in A1 suggests that saccades lead to a phase reset of neuronal oscillations in A1. Saccade-related phase reset of delta oscillations were observed across all layers while theta effects occurred primarily in extragranular layers. Although less frequent, alpha oscillations also showed saccade-related phase reset within the extragranular layers. Our results confirm that saccades provide a supramodal temporal context for the influx of sensory information into A1 and highlight the importance of considering the effects of eye position on auditory processing.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Velocity-based optoretinography for clinical applications</a></h4>

              
                Optoretinography (ORG) is an emerging tool for testing neural function in the retina. Unlike existing methods, it is noninvasive, objective, and provides information about retinal structure and function at once. As such, it has great potential to transform ophthalmic care and clinical trials of novel therapeutics designed to restore or preserve visual function. Recent efforts have demonstrated the feasibility of the ORG using state-of-the-art optical coherence tomography systems. These methods measure the stimulus-evoked movement of subcellular features in the retina, using the phase of the reflected light to monitor their position. Here we present an alternative approach that monitors the velocity of these features instead. This conceptual shift has significant implications for the nascent field of optoretinography. By avoiding the need to track specific cells over time, it obviates costly and laborious aspects of the position-based approaches, such as adaptive optics, digital aberration correction, real-time tracking, and three-dimensional segmentation and registration. We used this novel velocity-based approach to measure the photoreceptor ORG responses in three healthy subjects. The resulting responses were reproducible and exhibited dependence on dose and retinal eccentricity. The position of the relevant structures was reconstructed through numerical integration of velocity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The structure of anticorrelated networks in the human brain</a></h4>

              
                During the performance of a specific task or at rest, the activity of different brain regions shares statistical dependencies that reflect functional connections. While these relationships have been studied intensely for positively correlated networks, considerably less attention has been paid to negatively correlated networks, a.k.a. anticorrelated networks (ACNs). Here, we have addressed this issue by making use of two neuroimaging datasets: one of N=192 young healthy adults; and another of N=40 subjects that was divided into two groups of young and old participants. We first provided a full description of the anatomical composition of the different ACNs, each of which participated in distinct resting-state networks (RSNs). In terms of their frequency of participation, from highest to the lowest, the major anticorrelated brain areas are the precuneus, the superior frontal gyrus and the posterior cingulate gyrus. Subsequently, by evaluating the more detailed structure of ACNs, we show it is possible to find significant differences in these in association with specific conditions, in particular by comparing groups of young and old participants. Our main finding is that of increased anticorrelation for cerebellar interactions in older subjects. Overall, our results give special relevance to ACNs and they suggest they may serve to disentangle unknown alterations in certain conditions, as might occur in neurodegenerative diseases at early onset or in some psychiatric conditions.

                White matter tracts form the structural basis of large-scale functional networks in the human brain. We applied brain-wide tractography to diffusion images from 30,810 adult participants (UK Biobank), and found significant heritability for 90 regional connectivity measures and 851 tract-wise connectivity measures. Multivariate genome-wide association analyses identified 355 independently associated lead SNPs across the genome, of which 77% had not been previously associated with human brain metrics. Enrichment analyses implicated neurodevelopmental processes including neurogenesis, neural differentiation, neural migration, neural projection guidance, and axon development, as well as prenatal brain expression especially in stem cells, astrocytes, microglia and neurons. We used the multivariate association profiles of lead SNPs to identify 26 genomic loci implicated in structural connectivity between core regions of the left-hemisphere language network, and also identified 6 loci associated with hemispheric left-right asymmetry of structural connectivity. Polygenic scores for schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, autism spectrum disorder, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, left-handedness, Alzheimer's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and epilepsy showed significant multivariate associations with structural connectivity, each implicating distinct sets of brain regions with trait-relevant functional profiles. This large-scale mapping study revealed common genetic contributions to the structural connectome of the human brain in the general adult population, highlighting links with polygenic disposition to brain disorders and behavioural traits.

                Time and space are primary dimensions of human experience. Whereas separate lines of study have identified neural correlates of time and space, little is known about how these representations converge during self-guided experience. Here we asked how neurons in the human brain represent time and space concurrently. Subjects fitted with intracranial microelectrodes played a timed navigation game where they alternated between searching for and retrieving objects in a virtual environment. Significant proportions of both time- and place-selective neurons were present during navigation, and distinct time-selective neurons appeared during task-free delays absent movement. We find that temporal and spatial codes are dissociable, with time cells remapping between search and retrieval tasks while place cells maintained stable firing fields. Other neurons tracked the context unique to each task phase, independent of time or space. Together these neuronal classes comprise a biological basis for the cognitive map of spatiotemporal context.

	<p>Approximately 30% of epileptic patients develop Drug-Resistant Epilepsy. Based on evidence that shows a loss of efficacy in some sodium channel blocker antiseizure drugs in epilepsy, we focus our study on assessing the anticonvulsant efficacy of different sodium channel blockers on carbamazepine (CBZ)-resistant seizures generated using the window-pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) kindling model to verify whether one of these drugs presents some anticonvulsant effect that could have potential therapeutic use. Wistar rats were treated with a subthreshold dose of PTZ (35 mg/kg) three times/week. Fully kindled rats were then treated with a single dose of CBZ (40 mg/kg i.p.) at 2, 9 and 16 days after their last kindling stimulation to obtain CBZ-resistant rats. Right after, sodium channel blockers were tested for anticonvulsant action (lamotrigine, 30 mg/kg i.p.; eslicarbazepine, 150 or 300 mg/kg i.p.; ranolazine, 10, 20 or 40 mg/kg i.p.). Behavioral parameters included severity, latency or duration of convulsions. Our data showed for the first time directly that eslicarbazepine does have an anticonvulsant effect over CBZ-resistant seizures, while lamotrigine shows drug resistance and ranolazine demonstrates severe seizure worsening. It is of potential therapeutic relevance that eslicarbazepine could be useful to control seizures resistant to common sodium channel blockers such as CBZ.</p>

	<p>Interpersonal brain synchrony (IBS) during cooperation has not been systematically investigated. To address this research gap, this study assessed neural synchrony during a cooperative jigsaw puzzle solving task using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS)-based hyperscanning. IBS was measured for successful and failed tasks in 31 dyads in which the partners were familiar or unknown to each other. No significant difference in IBS was observed between the different types of cooperative partnership; however, stronger IBS within regions of the pars triangularis Broca&amp;amp;rsquo;s area, right frontopolar cortex, and right temporoparietal junction was observed during task success. These results highlight the effect of better task performance on cooperative IBS for the first time and further extend understanding of the neural basis of cooperation.</p>

	<p>This study investigated the role of working memory capacity (WMC) in metaphoric and metonymic processing in Mandarin&amp;amp;ndash;English bilinguals&amp;amp;rsquo; minds. It also explored the neural correlations between metaphor and metonymy computations. We adopted event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) design, which consisted of 21 English dialogic sets of stimuli and created five conditions: systematic literal, circumstantial literal, metaphor, systematic metonymy, and circumstantial metonymy, contextualizing in daily conversations. A similar fronto-temporal network for the figurative language processing pattern was found: superior temporal gyrus (STG) for metaphorical comprehension and inferior parietal junction (IPJ) for metonymic processing. Consistent brain regions were identified in previous studies, in the homologue Right Hemisphere, in better WMC bilinguals. The degree to which bilateral strategies that bilinguals with better WMC or larger vocabulary size resort to is differently modulated by subtypes of metonymies. In particular, when processing circumstantial metonymy, cuneus (where putamen is contained) was activated as higher span bilinguals filtered out irrelevant information, resorting to inhibitory control use. Cingulate gyrus activation was also revealed in better WMC bilinguals, reflecting their mental flexibility to adopt the subjective perspective of critical figurative items by self-control. It is hoped that this research provides a better understanding of Mandarin&amp;amp;ndash;English bilinguals&amp;amp;rsquo; English metaphoric and metonymic processing in Taiwan.</p>

	<p>Traumatic intracranial pseudoaneurysms (tIPAs) are a very rare pathology caused by blunt or penetrating head trauma. Diagnostic and therapeutic challenges of tIPAs are due to their unpredictable onset during the initial injury, or in a delayed manner, their unclear traumatic mechanism. Moreover, the presence of subarachnoid, subdural, or intraventricular hematoma may often cause them to be overlooked, which can potentially be followed by lethal rebleeding. Treatment of these lesions is controversial and on a case-by-case basis with regard to endovascular therapy or open surgery. We report two cases of three tIPAs of the distal anterior cerebral artery (dACA) with immediate and delayed onset after the trauma. Endovascular therapy resulted in complete obliteration of lesions with flow preservation in the parent artery using the flow diverter-assisted coiling strategy. The aim of this manuscript is to discuss the mechanism, angioanatomical characteristics, and current treatment options for these exceptional lesions.</p>

	<p>Introduction. Elderly glioblastoma (GBM) patients often show limited response to treatment and poor outcome. Here, we provide a case series of elderly GBM patients from our Institution, in whom we assessed the clinical characteristics, feasibility of surgical resection, response to adjuvant treatments, and outcome, along with the impact of comorbidities and clinical status on survival. Patients and Methods. We included patients &amp;amp;ge; 65-year-old. We collected information about clinical and molecular features, extent of resection, adjuvant treatments, treatment-related complications, and outcome. Results. We included 135 patients. Median age was 71 years. In total, 127 patients (94.0%) had a Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) &amp;amp;ge;70 and 61/135 (45.2%) a Charlson Comorbidity Score (CCI) &amp;amp;gt; 3. MGMTp methylation was found in 70/135 (51.9%). Subtotal resections (STRs), gross-total resections (GTRs), and biopsies were 102 (75.6%), 10 (7.4%) and 23 (17.0%), respectively. Median progression-free survival and overall survival (mOS) were 8.0 and 10.5 months for the whole cohort. Notably, GTR and radio-chemotherapy with temozolomide in patients with MGMTp methylation were associated with significantly longer mOS (32.8 and 44.8 months, respectively). In a multivariable analysis, risk of death was affected by STR vs. GTR (HR 2.8, p = 0.002), MGMTp methylation (HR 0.55, p = 0.007), and KPS at baseline &amp;amp;ge;70 (HR 0.43, p = 0.031). Conversely, CCI and post-surgical complications were not significant. Conclusions. Elderly GBM patients often have a dismal prognosis. However, it is possible to identify a subgroup with favourable clinical and molecular features, who benefit from GTR and radio-chemotherapy with temozolomide. A comprehensive prognostic score is needed to guide treatment modality and predict the outcome</p>

	<p>Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have great application prospects in the treatment of ischemic injury. However, their long-time cultivation before transplantation and poor survival after transplantation greatly limit the therapeutic effect and applications. This study aimed to investigate whether MSCs under the ischemic microenvironment could improve their survival and better alleviate cerebral ischemic injury. Firstly, we used ischemic brain tissue to culture MSCs and evaluated the functional changes of MSCs. Then a middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model was induced in rats, and the pretreated MSCs were injected via the tail vein. The adhesive removal test, rotarod test, modified neurological severity score, and pathological analyses were applied to assess the rats&amp;amp;rsquo; neurological function. Then the expression of neuron and apoptosis related markers was detected. The results indicated that ischemic brain tissue pretreated MSCs promoted the proliferation and the release of the growth factors of MSCs. Meanwhile, in MCAO model rats, transplantation of pretreated MSCs enhanced the neurogenesis, attenuated behavioral changes, reduced infarct size, and inhibited apoptosis. The expression of B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), NF-L, and NeuN were increased, while BCL2-Associated X (Bax) and Caspase-3 decreased. Our results suggest that MSCs pretreatment with stroke brain tissue could be an effective strategy in treating cerebral ischemic injury.</p>

	<p>Depression has gradually become the most common mental disorder in the world. The accuracy of its diagnosis may be affected by many factors, while the primary diagnosis seems to be difficult to define. Finding a way to identify depression by satisfying both objective and effective conditions is an urgent issue. In this paper, a strategy for predicting depression based on spatiotemporal features is proposed, and is expected to be used in the auxiliary diagnosis of depression. Firstly, electroencephalogram (EEG) signals were denoised through the filter to obtain the power spectra of the three corresponding frequency ranges, Theta, Alpha and Beta. Using orthogonal projection, the spatial positions of the electrodes were mapped to the brainpower spectrum, thereby obtaining three brain maps with spatial information. Then, the three brain maps were superimposed on a new brain map with frequency domain and spatial characteristics. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) were applied to extract the sequential feature. The proposed strategy was validated with a public EEG dataset, achieving an accuracy of 89.63% and an accuracy of 88.56% with the private dataset. The network had less complexity with only six layers. The results show that our strategy is credible, less complex and useful in predicting depression using EEG signals.</p>

                EMBL-EBI, Europe's biomolecular data hub, is a world leader in managing and analysing big data in biology and making it freely available to scientists worldwide. Research infrastructures (RI) like EMBL-EBI rely extensively on information technology (IT) services to conduct research and support the delivery of scientific services. These IT services are complex and diverse and IT service management (ITSM) has been shown in other domains to help to improve efficiency and productivity. ITSM is a collection of standards that help organisations develop a process-based approach for managing the full lifecycle of IT services, while keeping their users' needs at the forefront and promoting continuous improvement. However, many organisations struggle with the design and implementation of an ITSM system as it involves the need for organisational change, and because the process approach can seem rigid and bureaucratic on the surface. This article aims to share the experience of the EMBL-EBI IT department in designing and implementing an ITSM system. ITSM implementation steps, benefits, challenges, opportunities, and practices are highlighted, critically analysed, and discussed.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Pattern changes of cutaneous dermatoses among Iraqi women preceding and during the COVID-19 pandemic [version 2; peer review: 1 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: We compared the pattern of cutaneous dermatoses among Iraqi females of all ages between 4 months preceding the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, and the same months 1 year later within the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study, that targeted all female patients attending an outpatient clinic for dermatology and venereology in Al-Kindy teaching hospital, Baghdad between October 2019 to the end of January 2020, and the same 4-month duration 1 year later (October 2020 to the end of January 2021) after the COVID-19 peak period had passed and there was no or partial curfew to exclude seasonal impact. Results: A total of 2657 female-patients of all ages were enrolled in this study with 1314 females during the 4 months pre COVID-19, and 1343 females during the pandemic. The mean age of patients presented before the pandemic was 27.2±16.6 years, while the mean age of patients during the pandemic was 28.1±15.6 years with no statistically significant difference in mean ages (P >0.05). Hair loss in general with telogen effluvium specifically increased significantly. Cutaneous contagious viral infections were reduced significantly and specifically of these molluscum contagiosum and condylomata accuminata. Other forms of infections including bacterial and parasitic were also reduced while dermatophytosis was increased but not to a significant level. Acne vulgaris, rosacea, lichen planus, urticaria, pityriasis rosea, seborrheic dermatitis, and vitiligo were increased, but psoriasis, alopecia areata, other types of dermatitis, and melasma were reduced but none to a significant level. Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in changes in the pattern of diseases presented to an out-patient clinic for dermatology and venereology. This could be either related to COVID-19 infection or stress associated with the pandemic, because of curfew, or wearing facemasks which may cause a decrease or increase in certain diseases.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Superinfection exclusion: A viral strategy with short-term benefits and long-term drawbacks</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Michael Hunter, Diana Fusco</p>

Viral superinfection occurs when multiple viral particles subsequently infect the same host. In nature, several viral species are found to have evolved diverse mechanisms to prevent superinfection (superinfection exclusion) but how this strategic choice impacts the fate of mutations in the viral population remains unclear. Using stochastic simulations, we find that genetic drift is suppressed when superinfection occurs, thus facilitating the fixation of beneficial mutations and the removal of deleterious ones. Interestingly, we also find that the competitive (dis)advantage associated with variations in life history parameters is not necessarily captured by the viral growth rate for either infection strategy. Putting these together, we then show that a mutant with superinfection exclusion will easily overtake a superinfecting population even if the latter has a much higher growth rate. Our findings suggest that while superinfection exclusion can negatively impact the long-term adaptation of a viral population, in the short-term it is ultimately a winning strategy.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Reestablishment of spermatogenesis after more than 20 years of cryopreservation of rat spermatogonial stem cells reveals an important impact in differentiation capacity</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Eoin C. Whelan, Fan Yang, Mary R. Avarbock, Megan C. Sullivan, Daniel P. Beiting, Ralph L. Brinster</p>

Treatment of cancer in children is increasingly successful but leaves many prepubertal boys suffering from infertility or subfertility later in life. A current strategy to preserve fertility in these boys is to cryopreserve a testicular biopsy prior to treatment with the expectation of future technologies allowing for the reintroduction of stem cells and restoration of spermatogenesis. Spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) form the basis of male reproduction, differentiating into all germ cell types, including mature spermatozoa and can regenerate spermatogenesis following transplantation into an infertile testis. Here, we demonstrate that rat SSCs frozen for more than 20 years can be transplanted into recipient mice and produce all differentiating germ cell types. However, compared with freshly isolated cells or those frozen for a short period of time, long-frozen cells do not colonize efficiently and showed reduced production of spermatids. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed similar profiles of gene expression changes between short- and long-frozen cells as compared with fresh immediately after thawing. Conversely, following transplantation, long-frozen samples showed enhanced stem cell signaling in the undifferentiated spermatogonia compartment, consistent with self-renewal and a lack of differentiation. In addition, long-frozen samples showed fewer round spermatids with detectable protamine expression, suggesting a partial block of spermatogenesis after meiosis resulting in a lack of elongating spermatids. These findings strongly suggest that prolonged cryopreservation can impact the success of transplantation to produce spermatogenesis, which may not be revealed by analysis of the cells immediately after thawing. Our analysis uncovered persistent effects of long-term freezing not found in other cryopreservation studies that lacked functional regeneration of the tissue and this phenomenon must be accounted for any future therapeutic application.

     alt="An atlas of the developing Tribolium castaneum brain reveals conservation in anatomy and divergence in timing to Drosophila melanogaster"/>
<p>We examined the developing brain of the beetle <i>Tribolium castaneum</i>. We determined tracts, fascicles, and compartments (a) by combining tubulin and synapsin stainings (b) in three developing stages (b’). The result is a comprehensive anatomical atlas (c) that was compared with the fruitfly and is provided for user-friendly interaction (d).

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Insect brains are formed by conserved sets of neural lineages whose fibers form cohesive bundles with characteristic projection patterns. Within the brain neuropil, these bundles establish a system of fascicles constituting the macrocircuitry of the brain. The overall architecture of the neuropils and the macrocircuitry appear to be conserved. However, variation is observed, for example, in size, shape, and timing of development. Unfortunately, the developmental and genetic basis of this variation is poorly understood, although the rise of new genetically tractable model organisms such as the red flour beetle <i>Tribolium castaneum</i> allows the possibility to gain mechanistic insights. To facilitate such work, we present an atlas of the developing brain of <i>T. castaneum</i>, covering the first larval instar, the prepupal stage, and the adult, by combining wholemount immunohistochemical labeling of fiber bundles (acetylated tubulin) and neuropils (synapsin) with digital 3D reconstruction using the TrakEM2 software package. Upon comparing this anatomical dataset with the published work in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>, we confirm an overall high degree of conservation. Fiber tracts and neuropil fascicles, which can be visualized by global neuronal antibodies like antiacetylated tubulin in all invertebrate brains, create a rich anatomical framework to which individual neurons or other regions of interest can be referred to. The framework of a largely conserved pattern allowed us to describe differences between the two species with respect to parameters such as timing of neuron proliferation and maturation. These features likely reflect adaptive changes in developmental timing that govern the change from larval to adult brain.</p>

                <p>We sought to determine whether racial and socioeconomic disparities in the utilization of deep brain stimulation (DBS) for Parkinson's disease (PD) have improved over time. We examined DBS utilization and analyzed factors associated with placement of DBS. The odds of DBS placement increased across the study period, whereas White patients with PD were 5 times more likely than Black patients to undergo DBS. Individuals, regardless of racial background, with 2 or more comorbidities were 14 times less likely to undergo DBS. Privately insured patients were 1.6 times more likely to undergo DBS.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">A Role for Insulin‐like Growth Factor 1 in the Generation of Epileptic Spasms</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Infantile spasms are associated with a wide variety of clinical conditions, including perinatal brain injuries. We have created a model in which prolonged infusion of tetrodotoxin (TTX) into the neocortex, beginning in infancy, produces a localized lesion and reproduces the behavioral spasms, electroencephalogram (EEG) abnormalities, and drug responsiveness seen clinically. Here, we undertook experiments to explore the possibility that the growth factor IGF-1 plays a role in generating epileptic spasms.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We combined long-term video EEG recordings with quantitative immunohistochemical and biochemical analyses to unravel IGF-1's role in spasm generation. Immunohistochemistry was undertaken in surgically resected tissue from infantile spasms patients. We used viral injections in neonatal conditional IGF-1R knock-out mice to show that an IGF-1-derived tripeptide (1-3)IGF-1, acts through the IGF-1 receptor to abolish spasms.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Immunohistochemical methods revealed widespread loss of IGF-1 from cortical neurons, but an increase in IGF-1 in the reactive astrocytes in the TTX-induced lesion. Very similar changes were observed in the neocortex from patients with spasms. In animals, we observed reduced signaling through the IGF-1 growth pathways in areas remote from the lesion. To show the reduction in IGF-1 expression plays a role in spasm generation, epileptic rats were treated with (1-3)IGF-1. We provide 3 lines of evidence that (1-3)IGF-1 activates the IGF-1 signaling pathway by acting through the receptor for IGF-1. Treatment with (1-3)IGF-1 abolished spasms and hypsarrhythmia-like activity in the majority of animals.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Results implicate IGF-1 in the pathogenesis of infantile spasms and IGF-1 analogues as potential novel therapies for this neurodevelopmental disorder. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

                This dataset is an accumulation of data collected to test Rwandan physics students’ conceptual understanding of light phenomena and to assess instructional tools for active learning of optics. We collected and analysed data from 251 grade 11 (senior 5) students using our Light Phenomena Conceptual Assessment (LPCA) tool and from 136 grade 10 (senior 4) students using Geometric Optics Conceptual Understanding Test (GOCUT) in 2019. Before collecting data, we designed and validated LPCA and GOCUT, and tested their reliability. Data were collected before and after students learnt about the unit of light. Both day and boarding schools in rural and urban areas were included in our sampling. Data collected were test scores from students after performing a 30-item LPCA test or 25-item GOCUT test in 40 minutes. The data may be reused to extend  students' understanding of optics concepts through item analysis, analysis of school characteristics such as location and school type, or by analysing students' characteristics such as subject combinations.

                Linares et al. describe a molecular mechanism for cancer-associated fibroblast activation. Tumor-secreted lactate downregulates p62 in the stroma by reducing NAD+, which impairs PARP-1 activity, blocking AP-1-mediated p62 transcription. PARP-1 inhibitors mimic lactate to induce stroma activation, suggesting that anti-stromal therapies might enhance their efficacy.

                Stem cell differentiation is linked to their exit from the cell cycle. Here, Sainz de la Maza et al. identify the E2f/Dp transcription factor as an essential link between cell-cycle progression and stem cell identity. They show that E2f/Dp downregulates mitochondrial activity to inhibit differentiation in cycling cells.

                Currie et al. show that movement-type-specific information is routed through relatively small, distributed subpopulations of motor cortical layer 5B projection neurons. Using 2-photon population calcium imaging, they demonstrate that movement-invariant signaling dominates layer 5B population dynamics, whereas movement-specific signaling is differentially distributed across projection neuron classes.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">A cerebellar origin of feedforward inhibition to the motor cortex in non-human primates</a></h4>

              
                Nashef et al. use pharmacological manipulation to identify parvalbumin (PV) and pyramidal cells driven directly by cerebellar-thalamocortical input. Movement-related activity of PV cells starts earlier but is correlated with the activity of simultaneously recorded pyramidal cells. Feedforward inhibition may thus amplify cerebellar signals and suppress competing inputs.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Serotonin receptors contribute to dopamine depression of lateral inhibition in the nucleus accumbens</a></h4>

              
                Burke and Alvarez find that, in the nucleus accumbens, dopamine depresses or potentiates lateral inhibition between projection neurons, depending on the specific synapses isolated. Dopamine depression of D2-MSN GABA transmission involves activation of 5-HT1B receptors, suggesting that cross-talk between monoamines and receptors plays a role in accumbens circuit function.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Experimental microevolution of Trypanosoma cruzi reveals hybridization and clonal mechanisms driving rapid diversification of genome sequence and structure</a></h4>

              
                Protozoa and fungi are known to have extraordinarily diverse mechanisms of genetic exchange. However, the presence and epidemiological relevance of genetic exchange in <i>Trypanosoma cruzi</i>, the agent of Chagas disease, has been controversial and debated for many years. Field studies have identified both predominantly clonal and sexually recombining natural populations. Two of six natural <i>T. cruzi</i> lineages (TcV and TcVI) show hybrid mosaicism, using analysis of single-gene locus markers. The formation of hybrid strains <i>in vitro </i>has been achieved and this provides a framework to study the mechanisms and adaptive significance of genetic exchange. Using whole genome sequencing of a set of experimental hybrids strains, we have confirmed that hybrid formation initially results in tetraploid parasites. The hybrid progeny showed novel mutations that were not attributable to either (diploid) parent showing an increase in amino acid changes. In long-term culture, up to 800 generations, there was a variable but gradual erosion of progeny genomes towards triploidy, yet retention of elevated copy number was observed at several core housekeeping loci. Our findings indicate hybrid formation by fusion of diploid <i>T. cruzi</i>, followed by sporadic genome erosion, but with substantial potential for adaptive evolution, as has been described as a genetic feature of other organisms, such as some fungi.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Thermosynechococcus switches the direction of phototaxis by a c-di-GMP-dependent process with high spatial resolution</a></h4>

              
                Many cyanobacteria, which use light as an energy source via photosynthesis, show directional movement towards or away from a light source. However, the molecular and cell biological mechanisms for switching the direction of movement remain unclear. Here, we visualized type IV pilus-dependent cell movement in the rod-shaped thermophilic cyanobacterium <i>Thermosynechococcus vulcanus</i> using optical microscopy at physiological temperature and light conditions. Positive and negative phototaxis were controlled on a short time scale of 1 min. The cells smoothly moved over solid surfaces towards green light, but the direction was switched to backward movement when we applied additional blue light illumination. The switching was mediated by three photoreceptors, SesA, SesB, and SesC, which have cyanobacteriochrome photosensory domains and synthesis/degradation activity of the bacterial second messenger cyclic dimeric GMP (c-di-GMP). Our results suggest that the decision-making process for directional switching in phototaxis involves light-dependent changes in the cellular concentration of c-di-GMP. Direct visualization of type IV pilus filaments revealed that rod-shaped cells can move perpendicular to the light vector, indicating that the polarity can be controlled not only by pole-to-pole regulation but also within-a-pole regulation. This study provides insights into previously undescribed rapid bacterial polarity regulation via second messenger signalling with high spatial resolution.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">SDR enzymes oxidize specific lipidic alkynylcarbinols into cytotoxic protein-reactive species</a></h4>

              
                Hundreds of cytotoxic natural or synthetic lipidic compounds contain chiral alkynylcarbinol motifs, but the mechanism of action of those potential therapeutic agents remains unknown. Using a genetic screen in haploid human cells, we discovered that the enantiospecific cytotoxicity of numerous terminal alkynylcarbinols, including the highly cytotoxic dialkynylcarbinols, involves a bioactivation by HSD17B11, a short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) known to oxidize the C-17 carbinol center of androstan-3-alpha,17-beta-diol to the corresponding ketone. A similar oxidation of dialkynylcarbinols generates dialkynylketones, that we characterize as highly protein-reactive electrophiles. We established that, once bioactivated in cells, the dialkynylcarbinols covalently modify several proteins involved in protein-quality control mechanisms, resulting in their lipoxidation on cysteines and lysines through <i>Michael</i> addition. For some proteins, this triggers their association to cellular membranes and results in endoplasmic reticulum stress, unfolded protein response activation, ubiquitin-proteasome system inhibition and cell death by apoptosis. Finally, as a proof-of-concept, we show that generic lipidic alkynylcarbinols can be devised to be bioactivated by other SDRs, including human RDH11 and HPGD/15-PGDH. Given that the SDR superfamily is one of the largest and most ubiquitous, this unique cytotoxic mechanism-of-action could be widely exploited to treat diseases, in particular cancer, through the design of tailored prodrugs.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">History-dependent physiological adaptation to lethal genetic modification under antibiotic exposure</a></h4>

              
                Genetic modifications, such as gene deletion and mutations, could lead to significant changes in physiological states or even cell death. Bacterial cells can adapt to diverse external stresses, such as antibiotic exposure, but can they also adapt to detrimental genetic modification? To address this issue, we visualized the response of individual <i>Escherichia coli</i> cells to deletion of the antibiotic resistance gene under chloramphenicol (Cp) exposure, combining the light-inducible genetic recombination and microfluidic long-term single-cell tracking. We found that a significant fraction (∼40%) of resistance-gene-deleted cells demonstrated a gradual restoration of growth and stably proliferated under continuous Cp exposure without the resistance gene. Such physiological adaptation to genetic modification was not observed when the deletion was introduced in 10 hr or more advance before Cp exposure. Resistance gene deletion under Cp exposure disrupted the stoichiometric balance of ribosomal large and small subunit proteins (RplS and RpsB). However, the balance was gradually recovered in the cell lineages with restored growth. These results demonstrate that bacterial cells can adapt even to lethal genetic modifications by plastically gaining physiological resistance. However, the access to the resistance states is limited by the environmental histories and the timings of genetic modification.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Inflammatory response in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells                    triggered by activating SHP2 mutations evokes blood defects</a></h4>

              
                Gain-of-function mutations in the protein-tyrosine phosphatase SHP2 are the most                    frequently occurring mutations in sporadic juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia                    (JMML) and JMML-like myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) associated with Noonan                    syndrome (NS). Hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) are the disease                    propagating cells of JMML. Here, we explored transcriptomes of HSPCs with Shp2                    mutations derived from JMML patients and a novel NS zebrafish model. In addition                    to major NS traits, CRISPR/Cas9 knock-in Shp2<i><sup>D61G</sup></i>                    mutant zebrafish recapitulated a JMML-like MPN phenotype, including myeloid                    lineage hyperproliferation, <i>ex vivo</i> growth of myeloid colonies                    and <i>in vivo</i> transplantability of HSPCs. Single cell mRNA                    sequencing of HSPCs from Shp2<i><sup>D61G</sup></i> zebrafish embryos                    and bulk sequencing of HSPCs from JMML patients revealed an overlapping                    inflammatory gene expression pattern. Strikingly, an anti-inflammatory agent                    rescued JMML-like MPN in Shp2<i><sup>D61G</sup></i> zebrafish embryos.                    Our results indicate that a common inflammatory response was triggered in the                    HSPCs from sporadic JMML patients and syndromic NS zebrafish, which potentiated                    MPN and may represent a future target for JMML therapies.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Conformist social learning leads to self-organised prevention against adverse bias in risky decision making</a></h4>

              
                Given the ubiquity of potentially adverse behavioural bias owing to myopic trial-and-error learning, it seems paradoxical that improvements in decision-making performance through conformist social learning, a process widely considered to be bias amplification, still prevail in animal collective behaviour. Here we show, through model analyses and large-scale interactive behavioural experiments with 585 human subjects, that conformist influence can indeed promote favourable risk taking in repeated experience-based decision making, even though many individuals are systematically biased towards adverse risk aversion. Although strong positive feedback conferred by copying the majority’s behaviour could result in unfavourable informational cascades, our differential equation model of collective behavioural dynamics identified a key role for increasing exploration by negative feedback arising when a weak minority influence undermines the inherent behavioural bias. This ‘collective behavioural rescue’, emerging through coordination of positive and negative feedback, highlights a benefit of collective learning in a broader range of environmental conditions than previously assumed and resolves the ostensible paradox of adaptive collective behavioural flexibility under conformist influences.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Structural, mechanistic and physiological insights into phospholipase A-mediated membrane phospholipid degradation in Pseudomonas aeruginosa</a></h4>

              
                Cells steadily adapt their membrane glycerophospholipid (GPL) composition to changing environmental and developmental conditions. While the regulation of membrane homeostasis <i>via</i> GPL synthesis in bacteria has been studied in detail, the mechanisms underlying the controlled degradation of endogenous GPLs remain unknown. Thus far, the function of intracellular phospholipases A (PLAs) in GPL remodeling (Lands cycle) in bacteria is not clearly established. Here, we identified the first cytoplasmic membrane-bound phospholipase A<sub>1</sub> (PlaF) from <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>, which might be involved in the Lands cycle. PlaF is an important virulence factor, as the <i>P. aeruginosa</i> Δ<i>plaF</i> mutant showed strongly attenuated virulence in <i>Galleria mellonella</i> and macrophages. We present a 2.0-Å-resolution crystal structure of PlaF, the first structure that reveals homodimerization of a single-pass transmembrane (TM) full-length protein. PlaF dimerization, mediated solely through the intermolecular interactions of TM and juxtamembrane regions, inhibits its activity. The dimerization site and the catalytic sites are linked by an intricate ligand-mediated interaction network, which might explain the product (fatty acid) feedback inhibition observed with the purified PlaF protein. We used molecular dynamics simulations and configurational free energy computations to suggest a model of PlaF activation through a coupled monomerization and tilting of the monomer in the membrane, which constrains the active site cavity into contact with the GPL substrates. Thus, these data show the importance of the PlaF mediated GPL remodeling pathway for virulence and could pave the way for the development of novel therapeutics targeting PlaF.
