Abstract
<p>GABAergic cells constitute 20–40% of the cells that project from the inferior colliculus [(IC) a midbrain auditory hub] to the medial geniculate body [(MG) the main auditory nucleus of the thalamus]. Four subtypes of GABAergic IC cells have been identified based on their association with perineuronal nets (PNs) and dense rings of axosomatic terminals expressing vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (VGLUT2 rings). These subtypes differ in their soma size and distribution within the IC. Based on previous work emphasizing large GABAergic cells as the origin of GABAergic IC–MG projections, we hypothesized that GABAergic IC cells surrounded by PNs and VGLUT2 rings, which tend to have larger somas, were more likely to project to the MG than smaller cells lacking these extracellular markers. Here, we injected retrograde tract tracers into the MG of guinea pigs of either sex and analyzed retrogradely labeled GABAergic cells in the ipsilateral IC for soma size and association with PNs and/or VGLUT2 rings. We found a range of GABAergic soma sizes present within the IC–MG pathway, which were reflective of the full range of GABAergic soma sizes present within the IC. Further, we found that all four subtypes of GABAergic IC cells participate in the IC–MG pathway, and that GABAergic cells lacking PNs and VGLUT2 rings were more prevalent within the pathway than would be expected based on their overall prevalence in the IC. These results may provide an anatomical substrate for the multiple roles of inhibition in the IC–MG pathway, which have emerged in electrophysiological studies.</p>

<p>Following a stimulus, the neural response typically strongly varies in time
and across neurons before settling to a steady-state. While classical
population coding theory disregards the temporal dimension, recent works have
argued that trajectories of transient activity can be particularly informative
about stimulus identity and may form the basis of computations through
dynamics. Yet an understanding of the dynamical mechanisms needed to generate a
population code based on transient trajectories is still missing. Here we show
that a broad class of high-dimensional linear networks of recurrently connected
units exhibits the properties needed for transient coding. We first identify a
general criterion that distinguishes two classes of networks depending on
properties of the connectivity matrix: networks in which all inputs lead to
weak, decaying transients, and networks in which specific inputs elicit
strongly amplified transient responses and are mapped onto orthogonal output
states during the dynamics. For the second class of networks, we provide a
procedure to identify transiently amplified inputs and the corresponding
readouts for arbitrary connectivity matrices. We then exploit our approach to
build the minimal connectivity which robustly implements trajectories that map
a specific input onto a specific output state, and we demonstrate that the
capacity of the obtained networks increases proportionally with their size.

<p>Eigenmodes of a broad class of "sparse" random matrices, with interactions
concentrated near the diagonal, exponentially localize in space, as initially
discovered in 1957 by Anderson for quantum systems. Anderson localization plays
ubiquitous roles in varieties of problems from electrons in solids to
mechanical and optical systems. However, its implications in neuroscience
(where the connections can be strongly asymmetric) have been largely
unexplored, mainly because synaptic connectivity matrices of neural systems are
often "dense", which makes the eigenmodes spatially extended. Here, we explore
roles that Anderson localization could be playing in neural networks by
focusing on "spatially structured" disorder in synaptic connectivity matrices.
Recently, neuroscientists have experimentally confirmed that the local
excitation and global inhibition (LEGI) ring attractor model can functionally
represent head direction cells in Drosophila melanogaster central brain. We
first study a non-Hermitian (i.e. asymmetric) tight-binding model with disorder
and then establish a connection to the LEGI ring attractor model. We discover
that (i) Principal eigenvectors of the LEGI ring attractor networks with
structured nearest neighbor disorder are "quasi-localized", even with fully
dense inhibitory connections. (ii) The quasi-localized eigenvectors play
dominant roles in the early time neural dynamics, and the location of the
principal quasi-localized eigenvectors predict an initial location of the "bump
of activity" representing, say, a head direction of an insect. Our
investigations open up a new venue for explorations at the intersection between
the theory of Anderson localization and neural networks with spatially
structured disorder.

<p>In the study of the human connectome, the vertices and the edges of the
network of the human brain is analyzed: the vertices of the graphs are the
anatomically identified gray matter areas of the subjects; this set is exactly
the same for all the subjects. The edges of the graphs correspond to the axonal
fibers, connecting these areas. In the biological applications of graph theory,
it happens very rarely that scientists examine numerous large graphs on the
very same, labeled vertex set. Exactly this is the case in the study of the
connectomes. Because of the particularity of these sets of graphs, novel,
robust methods need to be developed for their analysis. Here we introduce the
new method of the Frequent Network Neighborhood Mapping for the connectome,
which serves as a robust identification of the neighborhoods of given vertices
of special interest in the graph. We apply the novel method for mapping the
neighborhoods of the human hippocampus and discover strong statistical
asymmetries between the connectomes of the sexes, computed from the Human
Connectome Project. We analyze 413 braingraphs, each with 463 nodes. We show
that the hippocampi of men have much more significantly frequent neighbor sets
than women; therefore, in a sense, the connections of the hippocampi are more
regularly distributed in men and more varied in women. Our results are in
contrast to the volumetric studies of the human hippocampus, where it was shown
that the relative volume of the hippocampus is the same in men and women.

<p>Although Darwinian models are rampant in the social sciences, social
scientists do not face the problem that motivated Darwin's theory of natural
selection: the problem of explaining how lineages evolve despite that any
traits they acquire are regularly discarded at the end of the lifetime of the
individuals that acquired them. While the rationale for framing culture as an
evolutionary process is correct, it does not follow that culture is a Darwinian
or selectionist process, or that population genetics and phylogenetics provide
viable starting points for modeling cultural change. This paper lays out
step-by-step arguments as to why this approach is ill-conceived, focusing on
the lack of randomness and lack of a self-assembly code in cultural evolution,
and summarizes an alternative approach.

<p>We examine whether a single biophysical cortical circuit model can explain
both spiking and perceptual variability. We consider perceptual rivalry, which
provides a window into intrinsic neural processing since neural activity in
some brain areas is correlated to the alternating perception rather than the
constant ambiguous stimulus. The prevalent theory for spiking variability is a
chaotic attractor called the balanced state; whereas, the source of perceptual
variability is an open question. We present a dynamical model with a chaotic
attractor that explains both spiking and perceptual variability and adheres to
a broad set of strict experimental constraints. The model makes quantitative
predictions for how both spiking and perceptual variability will change as the
stimulus changes.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/41215">CryoEM structures of open dimers of Gyrase A in complex with DNA illuminate mechanism of strand passage</a></h4>

Gyrase is a unique type IIA topoisomerase that uses ATP hydrolysis to maintain the negatively supercoiled state of bacterial DNA. In order to perform its function, gyrase undergoes a sequence of conformational changes that consist of concerted gate openings, DNA cleavage, and DNA strand passage events. Structures where the transported DNA molecule (T-segment) is trapped by the A subunit have not been observed. Here we present the cryoEM structures of two oligomeric complexes of open gyrase A dimers and DNA. The protein subunits in these complexes were solved to 4 Å and 5.16 Å resolution. One of the complexes traps a linear DNA molecule, a putative T-segment, which interacts with the open gyrase A dimers in two states, representing steps either prior to or after passage through the DNA-gate. The structures locate the T-segment in important intermediate conformations of the catalytic cycle and provide insights into gyrase-DNA interactions and mechanism.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/40854">Genome-wide Estrogen Receptor-α activation is sustained, not cyclical</a></h4>

Estrogen Receptor-alpha (ER) drives 75% of breast cancers. Stimulation of the ER by estra-2-diol forms a transcriptionally-active chromatin-bound complex. Previous studies reported that ER binding follows a cyclical pattern. However, most studies have been limited to individual ER target genes and without replicates. Thus, the robustness and generality of ER cycling are not well understood. We present a comprehensive genome-wide analysis of the ER after activation, based on 6 replicates at 10 time-points, using our method for precise quantification of binding, Parallel-Factor ChIP-seq. In contrast to previous studies, we identified a sustained increase in affinity, alongside a class of estra-2-diol independent binding sites. Our results are corroborated by quantitative re-analysis of multiple independent studies. Our new model reconciles the conflicting studies into the ER at the TFF1 promoter and provides a detailed understanding in the context of the ER's role as both the driver and therapeutic target of breast cancer.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/40350">Bright multicolor labeling of neuronal circuits with fluorescent proteins and chemical tags</a></h4>

The stochastic multicolor labeling method ‘Brainbow’ is a powerful strategy to label multiple neurons differentially with fluorescent proteins; however, the fluorescence levels provided by the original attempts to use this strategy were inadequate. In the present study, we developed a stochastic multicolor labeling method with enhanced expression levels that uses a tetracycline-operator system (Tetbow). We optimized Tetbow for either plasmid or virus vector-mediated multicolor labeling. When combined with tissue clearing, Tetbow was powerful enough to visualize the three-dimensional architecture of individual neurons. Using Tetbow, we were able to visualize the axonal projection patterns of individual mitral/tufted cells along several millimeters in the mouse olfactory system. We also developed a Tetbow system with chemical tags, in which genetically encoded chemical tags were labeled with synthetic fluorophores. This was useful in expanding the repertoire of the fluorescence labels and the applications of the Tetbow system. Together, these new tools facilitate light-microscopy-based neuronal tracing at both a large scale and a high resolution.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/39209">Reconstructing the functions of endosymbiotic Mollicutes in fungus-growing ants</a></h4>

Mollicutes, a widespread class of bacteria associated with animals and plants, were recently identified as abundant abdominal endosymbionts in healthy workers of attine fungus-farming leaf-cutting ants. We obtained draft genomes of the two most common strains harbored by Panamanian fungus-growing ants. Reconstructions of their functional significance showed that they are independently acquired symbionts, most likely to decompose excess arginine consistent with the farmed fungal cultivars providing this nitrogen-rich amino-acid in variable quantities. Across the attine lineages, the relative abundances of the two Mollicutes strains are associated with the substrate types that foraging workers offer to fungus gardens. One of the symbionts is specific to the leaf-cutting ants and has special genomic machinery to catabolize citrate/glucose into acetate, which appears to deliver direct metabolic energy to the ant workers. Unlike other Mollicutes associated with insect hosts, both attine ant strains have complete phage-defense systems, underlining that they are actively maintained as mutualistic symbionts.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/38278">The lost world of Cuatro Ciénegas Basin, a relictual bacterial niche in a desert oasis</a></h4>

Barriers to microbial migrations can lead adaptive radiations and increased endemism. We propose that extreme unbalanced nutrient stoichiometry of essential nutrients can be a barrier to microbial immigration over geological timescales. At the oasis in the Cuatro Ciénegas Basin in Mexico, nutrient stoichiometric proportions are skewed given the low phosphorus availability in the ecosystem. We show that this endangered oasis can be a model for a <i>lost world</i>. The ancient niche of extreme unbalanced nutrient stoichiometry favoured survival of ancestral microorganisms. This extreme nutrient imbalance persisted due to environmental stability and low extinction rates, generating a diverse and unique bacterial community. Several endemic clades of <i>Bacillus</i> invaded the Cuatro Cienegas region in two geological times, the late Precambrian and the Jurassic. Other lineages of <i>Bacillus</i>, <i>Clostridium</i> and <i>Bacteroidetes</i> migrated into the basin in isolated events. Cuatro Ciénegas Basin conservation is vital to the understanding of early evolutionary and ecological processes.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/36398">Host genetic selection for cold tolerance shapes microbiome composition and modulates its response to temperature</a></h4>

The hologenome concept proposes that microbes together with their hosting organism are an independent unit of selection. Motivated by this concept, we hypothesized that thermal acclimation in poikilothermic organisms is connected to their microbiome composition due to their inability to maintain their body temperature. To test this hypothesis, we used a unique experimental setup with a transgenerational selective breeding scheme for cold tolerance in tropical tilapias. We tested the effects of the selection on the gut microbiome and host transcriptomic response. Interestingly, we found that host genetic selection for thermal tolerance shapes microbiome composition and its response to cold. The microbiomes of cold-resistant fish showed higher resilience to temperature changes, indicating that the microbiome is shaped by its host's selection. These findings are consistent with the hologenome concept and highlight the connection between the host and its microbiome's response to the environment.

Stress granules (SG) form during cellular stress and have been linked to neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia (ALS/FTD). Strategies to modulate SGs have the potential to yield insights into their role in pathophysiology. We performed a high-content screen to identify small molecules that alter SG properties in proliferative cells and iPSC-derived motor neurons (iPS-MNs). One major class of hit compounds are nucleic acid intercalating molecules that disrupt recruitment of ALS-associated RNA binding proteins (RBPs), such as TDP-43 and FUS/TLS, into SGs and reduce accumulation of cytoplasmic TDP-43 in iPS-MNs from ALS patients. These findings corroborate our biochemical results indicating that SGs accumulate ALS-associated RBPs in their shells in an RNA-dependent manner. Thus, SGs contribute to persistent accumulation of TDP-43, and nucleic acid intercalating compounds represent a promising new therapeutic approach for treating ALS/FTD.

Behavior arises from neuronal activity, but it is not known how the active neurons are distributed across brain regions and how their activity unfolds in time. Here, we used high-density Neuropixels probes to record from ~30,000 neurons in mice performing a visual contrast discrimination task. The task activated 60% of the neurons, involving nearly all 42 recorded brain regions, well beyond the regions activated by passive visual stimulation. However, neurons selective for choice (left vs. right) were rare, and found mostly in midbrain, striatum, and frontal cortex. Those in midbrain were typically activated prior to contralateral choices and suppressed prior to ipsilateral choices, consistent with a competitive midbrain circuit for adjudicating the subject's choice. A brain-wide state shift distinguished trials in which visual stimuli led to movement. These results reveal concurrent representations of movement and choice in neurons widely distributed across the brain.

The low success rates of computational design protocols and the extensive in vitro optimization often required, highlight the challenge of designing proteins that perform essential biochemical functions, such as binding or catalysis. One of the most simplistic approaches for the design of function is to adopt functional motifs in naturally occurring proteins and transplant them to computationally designed proteins. The structural complexity of the functional motif largely determines how readily one can find host protein structures that are “designable”, meaning that are likely to present the functional motif in the desired conformation. One promising route to enhance the “designability” of protein structures is to allow backbone flexibility. Here, we present a computational approach that couples conformational folding with sequence design to embed functional motifs into heterologous proteins—Rosetta Functional Folding and Design (FunFolDes). We performed extensive computational benchmarks, where we observed that the enforcement of functional requirements resulted in designs distant from the global energetic minimum of the protein. An observation consistent with several experimental studies that have revealed function-stability tradeoffs. To test the design capabilities of FunFolDes we transplanted two viral epitopes into distant structural templates including one <i>de novo</i> “functionless” fold, which represent two typical challenges where the designability problem arises. The designed proteins were experimentally characterized showing high binding affinities to monoclonal antibodies, making them valuable candidates for vaccine design endeavors. Overall, we present an accessible strategy to repurpose old protein folds for new functions. This may lead to important improvements on the computational design of proteins, with structurally complex functional sites, that can perform elaborate biochemical functions related to binding and catalysis.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/7gRf2xrFcak" width="1" />

Recent advances in modeling oxygen supply to cortical brain tissue have begun to elucidate the functional mechanisms of neurovascular coupling. While the principal mechanisms of blood flow regulation after neuronal firing are generally known, mechanistic hemodynamic simulations cannot yet pinpoint the exact spatial and temporal coordination between the network of arteries, arterioles, capillaries and veins for the entire brain. Because of the potential significance of blood flow and oxygen supply simulations for illuminating spatiotemporal regulation inside the cortical microanatomy, there is a need to create mathematical models of the entire cerebral circulation with realistic anatomical detail. Our hypothesis is that an anatomically accurate reconstruction of the cerebrocirculatory architecture will inform about possible regulatory mechanisms of the neurovascular interface. In this article, we introduce large-scale networks of the murine cerebral circulation spanning the Circle of Willis, main cerebral arteries connected to the pial network down to the microcirculation in the capillary bed. Several multiscale models were generated from state-of-the-art neuroimaging data. Using a vascular network construction algorithm, the entire circulation of the middle cerebral artery was synthesized. Blood flow simulations indicate a consistent trend of higher hematocrit in deeper cortical layers, while surface layers with shorter vascular path lengths seem to carry comparatively lower red blood cell (RBC) concentrations. Moreover, the variability of RBC flux decreases with cortical depth. These results support the notion that plasma skimming serves a self-regulating function for maintaining uniform oxygen perfusion to neurons irrespective of their location in the blood supply hierarchy. Our computations also demonstrate the practicality of simulating blood flow for large portions of the mouse brain with existing computer resources. The efficient simulation of blood flow throughout the entire middle cerebral artery (MCA) territory is a promising milestone towards the final aim of predicting blood flow patterns for the entire brain.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/9OY-184gvy8" width="1" />

Abstract<p>Microglia are dynamic immune cells of the central nervous system, and their morphology is commonly used as a readout of cellular function. However, current morphological analysis techniques rely on either tracing of cells or 2D projection analysis, which are time-consuming, subject to bias, and may ignore important three-dimensional (3D) information. Therefore, we have created 3DMorph, a Matlab-based script that analyzes microglial morphology from 3D data. The program initially requires input of threshold levels, cell size expectations, and preferred methods of skeletonization. This makes 3DMorph easily scalable and adaptable to different imaging parameters or cell types. After these settings are defined, the program is completely automatic and can batch process files without user input. Output data includes cell volume, territorial volume, branch length, number of endpoints and branch points, and average distance between cells. We show that 3DMorph is accurate when compared to manual tracing, with significantly decreased user input time. Importantly, 3DMorph is capable of processing <i>in vivo</i> microglial morphology, as well as other 3D branching cell types, from mouse cranial windows or acute hippocampal slices. Therefore, we present a novel, user-friendly, scalable, and semi-automatic method of analyzing cell morphology in 3 dimensions. This method should improve the accuracy of cell measurements, remove user bias between conditions, increase reproducibility between experimenters and labs, and reduce user input time. We provide this open source code on GitHub so that it is free and accessible to all investigators.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Microglial morphology is often considered to be an indicator of cellular activity, however current techniques to analyze morphology either lose valuable z-dimension information or are time intensive to perform. Therefore, we introduce 3DMorph, a MATLAB-based program that semi-automatically processes individual microglial morphology from overlapping 3D clusters, improving accuracy and processing time compared to current tools. 3DMorph is straightforward to use and adaptable to many imaging or experimental parameters. Once user settings are selected, 3DMorph can run in batch mode to automatically process multiple files. We validate 3DMorph against current techniques, and demonstrate the ability to detect differences in microglial morphologies from different <i>ex vivo</i> experimental conditions, as well as from <i>in vivo</i> data, and images of other branching cell types.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0137-18.2018v1?rss=1">Development of GABAergic inputs is not altered in early maturation of adult born dentate granule neurons in Fragile X mice</a></h4>

Abstract<p>Fragile X syndrome is the most common form of inherited mental retardation and the most common known cause of autism. Loss of Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) in mice (<i>Fmr1</i> KO) leads to altered synaptic and circuit maturation in the hippocampus that are correlated with alterations in hippocampal-dependent behaviors. Previous studies have demonstrated that loss of FMRP increased the rate of proliferation of progenitor cells and altered their fate specification in adult <i>Fmr1</i> KO mice. While these studies clearly demonstrate a role for FMRP in adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus, it is not known whether the functional synaptic maturation and integration of adult born dentate granule cells (abDGCs) into hippocampal circuits is affected in <i>Fmr1</i> KO mice. Here we used retroviral labeling to birthdate abDGCs in <i>Fmr1</i> KO mice which allowed us to perform targeted patch clamp recording to measure the development of synaptic inputs to these neurons at precise time points after differentiation. The frequency and amplitude of spontaneous GABAergic events increased over the first three weeks after differentiation, however this normal development of GABAergic synapses was not altered in <i>Fmr1</i> KO mice. Furthermore, the relatively depolarized GABA reversal potential (<i>E<sub>GABA</sub></i>) in immature abDGCs was unaffected by loss of FMRP as was the development of dendritic arbor of the adult generated neurons. These studies systematically characterized the functional development of abDGCs during the first four weeks after differentiation and demonstrate that the maturation of GABAergic synaptic inputs to these neurons is not grossly affected by the loss of FMRP.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Loss of FMRP causes Fragile X Syndrome, a devastating neurodevelopmental disorder that causes multiple alterations in the development of synapses and neurons. Previous studies have described a role for FMRP in neurogenesis and hippocampal-dependent conditioning tasks linked to neurogenesis. This study systematically assessed the functional development of GABAergic inputs to adult born dentate granule cells during the first four weeks after differentiation of adult neural stem cells in <i>Fmr1</i> KO mice.</p>

<p>The majority of inherited retinal degenerations are due to photoreceptor cell
death. In many cases ganglion cells are spared making it possible to stimulate
them to restore visual function. Several studies (Bi et al., 2006; Lin et al.,
2008; Sengupta et al., 2016; Caporale et al., 2011; Berry et al., 2017) have
shown that it is possible to express an optogenetic protein in ganglion cells
and make them light sensitive. This is a promising strategy to restore vision
since optical targeting may be more precise than electrical stimulation with a
retinal prothesis. However the spatial resolution of
optogenetically-reactivated retinas has not been measured with fine-grained
stimulation patterns. Since the optogenetic protein is also expressed in axons,
it is unclear if these neurons will only be sensitive to the stimulation of a
small region covering their somas and dendrites, or if they will also respond
to any stimulation overlapping with their axon, dramatically impairing spatial
resolution. Here we recorded responses of mouse and macaque retinas to random
checkerboard patterns following an in vivo optogenetic therapy. We show that
optogenetically activated ganglion cells are each sensitive to a small region
of visual space. A simple model based on this small receptive field predicted
accurately their responses to complex stimuli. From this model, we simulated
how the entire population of light sensitive ganglion cells would respond to
letters of different sizes. We then estimated the maximal acuity expected by a
patient, assuming it could make an optimal use of the information delivered by
this reactivated retina. The obtained acuity is above the limit of legal
blindness. This high spatial resolution is a promising result for future
clinical studies.

<p>The ancient mind/body problem continues to be one of deepest mysteries of
science and of the human spirit. Despite major advances in many fields, there
is still no plausible link between subjective experience (qualia) and its
realization in the body. This paper outlines some of the elements of a rigorous

The ubiquitin-like protein Atg8, in its lipidated form, plays central roles in autophagy. Yet, remarkably, Atg8 also carries out lipidation-independent functions in non-autophagic processes. How Atg8 performs its moonlighting roles is unclear. Here we report that in the fission yeast <i>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</i> and the budding yeast <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, the lipidation-independent roles of Atg8 in maintaining normal morphology and functions of the vacuole require its interaction with a vacuole membrane protein Hfl1 (homolog of human TMEM184 proteins). Crystal structures revealed that the Atg8-Hfl1 interaction is not mediated by the typical Atg8-family-interacting motif (AIM) that forms an intermolecular β-sheet with Atg8. Instead, the Atg8-binding regions in Hfl1 proteins adopt a helical conformation, thus representing a new type of AIMs (termed helical AIMs here). These results deepen our understanding of both the functional versatility of Atg8 and the mechanistic diversity of Atg8 binding.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/41152">Sucrose intensity coding and decision-making in rat gustatory cortices</a></h4>

Sucrose's sweet intensity is one attribute contributing to the overconsumption of high-energy palatable foods. However, it is not known how sucrose intensity is encoded and used to make perceptual decisions by neurons in taste-sensitive cortices. We trained rats in a sucrose intensity discrimination task and found that sucrose evoked a widespread response in neurons recorded in posterior-Insula (pIC), anterior-Insula (aIC), and Orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). Remarkably, only a few Intensity-selective neurons conveyed the most information about sucrose's intensity, indicating that for sweetness the gustatory system used a compact and distributed code. Sucrose intensity was encoded in both firing-rates and spike-timing. The pIC, aIC, and OFC neurons tracked movement direction, with OFC neurons yielding the most robust response. aIC and OFC neurons encoded the subject's choices, whereas all three regions tracked reward omission. Overall, these multimodal areas provide a neural representation of perceived sucrose intensity, and of task-related information underlying perceptual decision-making.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/40179">Unique morphogenetic signatures define mammalian neck muscles and associated connective tissues</a></h4>

In vertebrates, head and trunk muscles develop from different mesodermal populations and are regulated by distinct genetic networks. Neck muscles at the head-trunk interface remain poorly defined due to their complex morphogenesis and dual mesodermal origins. Here, we use genetically modified mice to establish a 3D model that integrates regulatory genes, cell populations and morphogenetic events that define this transition zone. We show that the evolutionary conserved cucullaris-derived muscles originate from posterior cardiopharyngeal mesoderm, not lateral plate mesoderm, and we define new boundaries for neural crest and mesodermal contributions to neck connective tissue. Furthermore, lineage studies and functional analysis of <i>Tbx1</i>- and <i>Pax3-</i>null mice reveal a unique developmental program for somitic neck muscles that is distinct from that of somitic trunk muscles. Our findings unveil the embryological and developmental requirements underlying tetrapod neck myogenesis and provide a blueprint to investigate how muscle subsets are selectively affected in some human myopathies.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/39939">The Toll pathway inhibits tissue growth and regulates cell fitness in an infection-dependent manner</a></h4>

The Toll pathway regulates the cellular response to infection via the transcriptional upregulation of antimicrobial peptides. In <i>Drosophila</i>, apart from its role in innate immunity, this pathway has also been reported to be important for the elimination of loser cells in a process referred to as cell competition, which can be locally triggered by secreted factors released from winner cells. In this work we provide evidence that the inhibition of Toll signaling not only increases the fitness of loser cells, but also bestows a clonal growth advantage on wild-type cells. We further demonstrate that this growth advantage depends on basal infection levels since it is no longer present under axenic conditions but exacerbated upon intense pathogen exposure. Thus, the Toll pathway functions as a fine-tuned pro-apoptotic and anti-proliferative regulator, underlining the existence of a trade-off between innate immunity and growth during development.

A presynaptic adhesion G-protein-coupled receptor, latrophilin-1, and a postsynaptic transmembrane protein, Lasso/teneurin-2, are implicated in trans-synaptic interaction that contributes to synapse formation. Surprisingly, during neuronal development, a substantial proportion of Lasso is released into the intercellular space by regulated proteolysis, potentially precluding its function in synaptogenesis. We found that released Lasso binds to cell-surface latrophilin-1 on axonal growth cones. Using microfluidic devices to create stable gradients of soluble Lasso, we show that it induces axonal attraction, without increasing neurite outgrowth. Using latrophilin-1 knockout in mice, we demonstrate that latrophilin-1 is required for this effect. After binding latrophilin-1, Lasso causes downstream signaling, which leads to an increase in cytosolic calcium and enhanced exocytosis, processes that are known to mediate growth cone steering. These findings reveal a novel mechanism of axonal pathfinding, whereby latrophilin-1 and Lasso mediate both short-range interaction that supports synaptogenesis, and long-range signaling that induces axonal attraction.

Given the heterogeneity of depression the Research Domain Criteria Framework suggests a dimensional approach to understanding the nature of mental health and illness. Neural reward function has been suggested as underpinning the symptom of anhedonia in depression but less is known about how anhedonia is related to aversion processing. We examined how anhedonia relates to neural activity during reward and aversion processing in adolescents and emerging adults (N=84) in the age range 13-21yrs. Using a dimensional approach we examined how anhedonia and depression severity correlated with an fMRI task measuring anticipation, effort and consummation of reward and aversion. We show for the first time that the dimensional experience of anhedonia correlated with neural responses during effort to avoid aversion in the precuneus with a trend in the insula and during aversive consummation in the caudate. Using a categorical approach we also examined how the neural responses during each phase of the task differed in those with depression symptoms compared to healthy controls. We found participants with depression symptoms invested less physical effort to gain reward than controls and had blunted neural anticipation of reward and aversion in the precuneus, insula, and prefrontal cortex and blunted neural effort for reward in the putamen. This work highlights blunted neural responses to reward and aversion in depression and how anticipatory and consummatory anhedonia may be enhanced via dysfunctional neural processing of aversion. Future work will assess if these neural mechanisms can be used to predict blunted behavioural approach to reward and avoidance of negative experiences in adolescents at risk of depression.

Schizophrenia (SZ) and bipolar disorder (BD) are often conceptualized as 'disconnection syndromes', with substantial evidence of abnormalities in deep white matter tracts, forming the substrates of long-range connectivity, seen in both disorders. However, the study of superficial white matter (SWM) U-shaped short-range tracts remained challenging until recently, although findings from post-mortem studies suggest they are likely integral components of SZ and BD neuropathology. This diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) study aimed to investigate SWM microstructure in vivo in both SZ and BD for the first time. We performed whole brain tractography in 31 people with SZ, 32 people with BD and 54 controls using BrainVISA and Connectomist 2.0. Segmentation and labelling of SWM tracts were performed using a novel, comprehensive U-fiber atlas. Analysis of covariances yielded significant generalized fractional anisotropy (gFA) differences for 17 SWM bundles in frontal, parietal and temporal cortices. Post hoc analyses showed gFA reductions in both patient groups as compared with controls in bundles connecting regions involved in language processing, mood regulation, working memory and motor function (pars opercularis, insula, anterior cingulate, precentral gyrus). We also found increased gFA in SZ patients in areas overlapping the default mode network (inferior parietal, middle temporal, precuneus), supporting functional hyperconnectivity of this network evidenced in SZ. We thus illustrate that short U-fibers are vulnerable to the pathological processes in major psychiatric illnesses, encouraging improved understanding of their anatomy and function.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/473660v1?rss=1">Cognitive and white-matter compartment models revealed the contribution of microstructural variability along sensorimotor tracts to simple reaction time</a></h4>

The speed of voluntary reaction to an external stimulus varies substantially between individuals and is impaired in ageing. However, the neuroanatomical origins of inter-individual variability in reaction time (RT) remain largely unknown. Here, we combined a cognitive model of RT and a biophysical compartmental model of diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) to characterize the relationship between RT and microstructure of the corticospinal tract (CST) and the optic radiation (OR), the primary motor output and visual input pathways associated with visual-motor responses. We fitted an accumulator model of RT to 46 female participants' behavioral performance in a simple reaction time task. The non-decision time parameter (Ter) derived from the model was used to account for the latencies of stimulus encoding and action initiation. From multi-shell DWI data, we quantified tissue microstructure of the CST and OR with the neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) model as well as the conventional diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) model. Using novel skeletonization and segmentation approaches, we showed that DWI-based microstructure metrics varied substantially along CST and OR. The Ter of individual participants was negatively correlated with the NODDI measure of the neurite density in the bilateral superior CST. At an uncorrected threshold, the Ter positively correlated with the DTI measure of fractional anisotropy in an anterior segment of left OR. Further, we found no significant correlation between the microstructural measures and mean RT. Thus, our findings suggest a link between the inter-individual variability of sensorimotor speed and selective microstructural properties in white matter tracts.

There is significant interest in the development and application of deep neural networks (DNNs) to neuroimaging data. A growing literature suggests that DNNs outperform their classical counterparts in a variety of neuroimaging applications, yet there are few direct comparisons of relative utility. Here, we compared the performance of three DNN architectures and a classical machine learning algorithm (kernel regression) in predicting individual phenotypes from whole-brain resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) patterns. One of the DNNs was a generic fully-connected feedforward neural network, while the other two DNNs were recently published approaches specifically designed to exploit the structure of connectome data. By using a combined sample of almost 10,000 participants from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) and UK Biobank, we showed that the three DNNs do not outperform kernel regression across a wide range of behavioral and demographic measures. Furthermore, the generic feedforward neural network exhibited similar performance to the two state-of-the-art connectome-specific DNNs. We conclude with suggestions on future neuroimaging DNN research, including comparisons with stronger baseline algorithms, minimum sample sizes, transparency of hyperparameter tuning and code availability. Critically, we believe that deep learning remains a promising tool for analyzing neuroimaging data. However, researchers should carefully consider whether and how their applications might benefit from DNNs' advantages over classical alternatives, rather than treat deep learning as a panacea.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/473520v1?rss=1">A spatial code in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus.</a></h4>

Since their discovery in the early '70s, hippocampal place cells have been studied in numerous animal and human spatial memory paradigms. These pyramidal cells, along with other spatially tuned types of neurons (e.g. grid cells, head direction cells), are thought to provide the mammalian brain a unique spatial signature characterizing a specific environment, and thereby a memory trace of the subject's place. While grid and head direction cells are found in various brain regions, only few hippocampal-related structures showing 'place cell'-like neurons have been identified, thus reinforcing the central role of the hippocampus in spatial memory. Concurrently, it is increasingly suggested that visual areas play an important role in spatial cognition as recent studies showed a clear spatial selectivity of visual cortical (V1) neurons in freely moving rodents. We therefore thought to investigate, in the rat, such spatial correlates in a thalamic structure located one synapse upstream of V1, the dorsal Lateral Geniculate Nucleus (dLGN), and discovered that a substantial proportion (ca. 30%) of neurons exhibits spatio-selective activity. We found that dLGN place cells maintain their spatial selectivity in the absence of visual inputs, presumably relying on odor and locomotor inputs. We also found that dLGN place cells maintain their place selectivity across sessions in a familiar environment and that contextual modifications yield separated representations. Our results show that dLGN place cells are likely to participate in spatial cognition processes, creating as early as the thalamic stage a comprehensive representation of one given environment.

Population recordings of calcium activity are a major source of insight into neural function. Large dataset sizes often require automated methods, but automation can introduce errors that are difficult to detect. Here we show that automatic time course estimation can sometimes lead to significant misattribution errors, in which fluorescence is ascribed to the wrong cell. Misattribution arises when the shapes of overlapping cells are imperfectly defined, or when entire cells or processes are not identified, and misattribution can even be produced by methods specifically designed to handle overlap. To diagnose this problem, we develop a transient-by-transient metric and a visualization tool that allow users to quickly assess the degree of misattribution in large populations. To filter out misattribution, we also design a robust estimator that explicitly accounts for contaminating signals in a generative model. Our methods can be combined with essentially any cell finding technique, empowering users to diagnose and correct at large scale a problem that has the potential to significantly alter scientific conclusions.

Predictive coding accounts of psychosis state that an overweighing of high-level priors relative to sensory information may lead to the misperception of meaningful signals underlying the experience of auditory hallucinations and delusions. However, it is currently unclear whether the hypothesized overweighing of priors (1) represents a pervasive alteration that also affects the visual modality, and, (2) takes already effect at early automatic processing stages. Here, we addressed these questions by studying visual perception of socially meaningful stimuli in healthy individuals with varying degrees of psychosis proneness (n=39). In a first task, we quantified participants' prior for detecting faces in visual noise. In a second task, we measured participants' prior for detecting direct gaze stimuli that were rendered invisible by continuous flash suppression. We found that the prior for detecting faces in noise correlated with hallucination proneness (rho=0.50, p=0.001) as well as delusion proneness (rho=0.44, p=0.005). Similarly, the prior for detecting invisible direct gaze was significantly associated with hallucination proneness (rho = 0.42, p = 0.010) and trend-wise with delusion proneness (rho = 0.29, p = 0.087). Our results provide evidence for the idea that overly strong high-level priors for automatically detecting socially meaningful stimuli might constitute a generic processing alteration in psychosis.

Whether the motor cortex activation accompanying concrete verbs comprehension is necessary for verbs conceptual processing is still a hotly debated topic in the literature. Answering this question, we examined to what extent the more difficult access to verb semantics requires an additional engagement of cortical motor system in verb generation task. Using power suppression of MEG beta oscillations (15-30 Hz) as an index of sensorimotor activation, we presented to our participants the noun cues which either were strongly associated with a single verb and prompted the fast and effortless verb retrieval, or were weakly associated with multiple verbs and were more difficult to respond to. A whole-brain analysis of beta suppression revealed that the only cortical regions sensitive to the difficulty of semantic access were the higher order motor areas on the medial and lateral surfaces of the frontal lobe. This differential activation of cortical motor system accompanied effortful verb retrieval and preceded the preparation of vocal response for more than 500 milliseconds. Since the mid-frontal frontal brain areas are involved in maintaining abstract representations of actions during their initiating and planning, we argue that our finding supports the view that motor associations contribute to retrieval of verb semantics.

Which neural circuits undergo synaptic changes when an animal learns? Although it is widely accepted that changes in synaptic strength underlie many forms of learning and memory, it remains challenging to connect changes in synaptic strength at specific neural pathways to specific behaviors and memories. Here we introduce SYNPLA (SYNaptic Proximity Ligation Assay), a synapse-specific, high-throughput and potentially brain-wide method capable of detecting circuit-specific learning-induced synaptic plasticity.

The functional state of denervated muscle is a critical factor in the ability to restore movement after injury- or disease-related paralysis. Here we used peripheral optogenetic stimulation and transcriptome profiling in the mouse whisker system to investigate the time course of changes in neuromuscular function following complete unilateral facial nerve transection. While most skeletal muscles rapidly lose functionality after lower motor neuron denervation, optogenetic muscle stimulation of the paralyzed whisker pad revealed sustained increases in the sensitivity, velocity, and amplitude of whisker movements, and reduced fatigability, starting 48 h after denervation. RNA-seq analysis showed distinct regulation of multiple gene families in denervated whisker pad muscles compared to the atrophy-prone soleus, including prominent changes in ion channels and contractile fibers. Together, our results define the unique functional and transcriptomic landscape of denervated facial muscles, and have general implications for restoring movement after neuromuscular injury or disease.

Here we present and evaluate DeepFLaSH, a unique deep learning pipeline to automatize the segmentation of fluorescent labels in microscopy images. The pipeline allows training and validation of label-specific convolutional neural network (CNN) models that can be uploaded to an open-source CNN-model library. As there is no ground truth for fluorescent signal segmentation tasks, we evaluated the CNN with respect to inter-coding reliability. Similarity analysis showed that CNN-predictions highly correlated with segmentations by human experts. DeepFLaSH also allows adaptation of pretrained, label-specific CNN-models from our CNN-model library to new datasets by means of transfer learning. We show consistent model-performance on datasets from three independent laboratories after transfer learning, thus ensuring its objectivity and reproducibility. DeepFLaSH runs as a guided, hassle-free open-source tool on a cloud-based virtual notebook with free access to high computing power and requires no machine learning expertise.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/473090v1?rss=1">A novel somatosensory spatial navigation system outside the hippocampal formation</a></h4>

The hippocampal-parahippocampal formation has long been regarded as the only site for the brain's navigational system. Nevertheless, studies from patients with medial temporal lobe (MTL) lesions suggest that the hippocampal formation is not essential for space memory, indicating that spatial navigation might be computed with another unknown representation system outside the MTL. Such an extra-hippocampal navigational system has never been identified, however. Here we report the existence, in the rat somatosensory cortex only, of a novel navigational system, which contains the full spectrum of all distinct spatial cell types including place, head-direction, border/boundary, conjunctive, speed and grid cells. All somatosensory spatial cells show similar firing characteristics to those detected previously in the hippocampal-parahippocampal structures. The somatosensory navigational system extends the classical theory of a cognitive map from two discrete hippocampal-entorhinal regions to only one neocortical domain, providing possible alternative and more sophisticated computational algorithms for spatial memory and cognitive mapping.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/472985v1?rss=1">Pin1 Regulatory miRNAs as Novel Candidates for Alzheimer\'s Disease Treatment</a></h4>

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the sixth leading cause of death in elderly people whose pathological hallmarks include senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). The tangles are composed of hyperphosphorylated tau, which is a microtubule-associated protein and its hyperphosphorylation would result in its aggregation and neural cell death. Recently, it has been shown that phosphorylated tau at Thr231 exists in two distinct cis &amp; trans conformations, whose conversion is being mediated by Pin1 isomerase and that the cis, but not the trans, is extremely neurotoxic and drives tau hyperphosphorylation. It has been demonstrated that Pin1 inhibition reflects cis pT231-tau accumulation in neurons but its overactivation is observed in cancer stem cells. Hence, a precise Pin1 regulation is required to keep cells in healthy conditions. As miRNAs play a crucial role in fine-tuning of the gene-expression level, we hypothesized that they might regulate the Pin1 dosage. Nonetheless, the possible regulatory roles of miRNAs in progression of AD by regulating PIN1 is not well studied. We aimed to identify potential miRNAs that down-regulate PIN1 in AD. This can uncover new regulatory mechanisms that result in AD. Thus, we performed a comprehensive study of miRNAs, capable in regulating Pin1, through whole-genome meta-analysis by integrating miRNA expression profiles of 846 different biological samples, along with a systematic literature review and data mining of multiple experimental and predicted miRNA-target databases. We created a list of 56 candidates, which was then short-listed to 10 miRNAs with vigorous experimental evidence. We examined the expression patterns of these miRNAs in the AD and healthy controls and integrated mRNA and miRNA expression profiles to study possible interactions between miRNAs and Pin1. Moreover, we performed an in-silico functional analysis by integrating data of knock-in and knock-down experiments of the candidate miRNAs, and highlighted miR296-5p, miR200b, miR200c, miR140-5p, and miR874 as strong candidate Pin1 regulators. These findings would have profound implications in developing novel therapeutic strategies for AD by blocking expression of highlighted miRNAs using antagomirs.

Objective: To determine if resting state functional MRI biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD) differ between older African Americans and Caucasians. Methods: We analyzed MRI profiles from 78 individuals (31 African Americans, 47 Caucasians) with normal cognition (n=36) or mild cognitive impairment/mild AD dementia (MCI/AD, n=42). We compared AD-associated intra-network functional connectivity of the default mode network (DMN) according to race, and correlated domain-specific cognitive functions with functional connectivity which differed between the racial groups. Results: We identified key differences in DMN functional connectivity associated with AD between the races. Whereas MCI/AD was associated with decreased functional connectivity within the midline core DMN subsystem in older Caucasians, MCI/AD was instead associated with increased functional connectivity within the same subsystem of older African Americans. This is despite decreased functional connectivity in the medial temporal lobe DMN subsystem in both races. Memory function was also positively associated with connectivity between the precuneus and the posterior cingulate/inferior parietal lobule within the midline core subsystem, in keeping with a less amnestic-profile in older African Americans with MCI/AD. Conclusions: These findings provide structural support that race modifies the AD phenotypes downstream from cerebral amyloid deposition, and suggests a rsf-MRI correlate of African Americans less amnestic neuropsychological profile in MCI/AD.

Gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) is a putative itch-specific neurotransmitter, but definite evidence in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) and spinal cord is lacking. We generated and validated a Grp-Cre knock-in (GrpCre-KI) mouse line whereby Grp neurons are genetically labeled. Cre-dependent marking analysis revealed exclusive innervation of the upper epidermis of the skin by GRP fibers. Importantly, optical stimulation of Grp fibers expressing channel rhodopsin (ChR2) in the skin evoked itch but not pain-related scratching behaviors, while conditional deletion of Grp in sensory neurons attenuated non-histaminergic itch. In contrast, intersectional genetic ablation of spinal Grp neurons did not affect itch nor pain transmission. Our study demonstrates a role of GRP in sensory neurons in itch and suggests that GRP sensory neurons are dedicated to itch transmission. GrpCre-KI mice provide a long-sought avenue for investigating peripheral coding mechanism of itch and further interrogation of itch-nerve fibers in the skin under chronic pruritus.

In addition to memory impairments, patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) exhibit a number of behavioural and psychological symptoms that can affect social interactions over the course of the disease. While altered social interactions have been demonstrated in a number of mouse models of AD, many models only recapitulate the initial stages of the disease, and these behavioural changes have yet to be examined over the course of disease progression. By performing a longitudinal study using the 5xFAD mouse model, we have demonstrated that transgenic females exhibit progressive alterations in social investigation compared to wild-type controls. Transgenic females exhibited an age-related reduction in interest for social odours, as well as reduced investigative behaviours towards novel conspecifics in a novel environment. However, transgenic mice exhibited no obvious olfactory deficits, nor any changes in scent-marking behaviour compared to wild-type controls, indicating that changes in investigative behaviour were due to motivation to engage with a social stimulus. This evidence suggests that transgenic 5xFAD females exhibit increased social anxiety in novel environments compared to wild-type controls. Overall, transgenic 5xFAD female mice mimic some features of social withdrawal observed in human AD patients suggesting this strain may be suitable for modelling aspects of the social dysfunction observed in human patients.

Predictive coding theories of perception suggest the importance of constantly updated internal models of the world in predicting future sensory inputs. One implication of such models is that cortical regions whose function is to resolve particular stimulus attributes should also signal prediction violations with respect to those same stimulus attributes. Previously, through carefully designed experiments, we have demonstrated early-mid latency EEG/MEG prediction-error signals in the dorsal visual stream to violated expectations about stimulus orientation/trajectory, with localisations consistent with cortical areas processing motion and orientation. Here we extend those methods to simultaneously investigate the predictive processes in both dorsal and ventral visual streams. In this MEG study we employed a contextual trajectory paradigm that builds expectations using a series of image presentations. We created expectations about both face orientation and identity, either of which can subsequently be violated. Crucially this paradigm allows us to parametrically test double dissociations between these different types of violations. The study identified double dissociations across the type of violation in the dorsal and ventral visual streams, such that the right fusiform gyrus showed greater evidence of prediction-error signals to Identity violations than to Orientation violations, whereas the left angular gyrus and postcentral gyrus showed the opposite pattern of results. Our results suggest comparable processes for error checking and context updating in high-level expectations instantiated across both perceptual streams. Perceptual prediction-error signalling is initiated in regions associated with the processing of different stimulus properties.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/466748v1?rss=1">Emotional prosody in congenital amusia: impaired and spared processes</a></h4>

Congenital amusia is a lifelong deficit of music processing, in particular of pitch processing. Most research investigating this neurodevelopmental disorder has focused on music perception, but pitch also has a critical role for intentional and emotional prosody in speech. Two previous studies investigating amusics emotional prosody recognition have shown either some deficit or no deficit (compared to controls). However, these previous studies have used only long sentence stimuli, which allow for limited control over acoustic content. Here, we tested amusic individuals for emotional prosody perception in sentences and vowels. For each type of material, participants performed an emotion categorization task, followed by intensity ratings of the recognized emotion. Compared to controls, amusic individuals had similar recognition of emotion in sentences, but poorer performance in vowels, especially when distinguishing sad and neutral stimuli. These lower performances in amusics were linked with difficulties in processing pitch and spectro-temporal parameters of the vowel stimuli. For emotion intensity, neither sentence nor vowel ratings differed between participant groups, suggesting preserved implicit processing of emotional prosody in amusia. These findings can be integrated into previous data showing preserved implicit processing of pitch and emotion in amusia alongside deficits in explicit recognition tasks. They are thus further supporting the hypothesis of impaired conscious analysis of pitch and timbre in this neurodevelopmental disorder.

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Agonism of the protease activated receptor (PAR) 1 by activated protein C (APC) provides neuroprotection and vasculoprotection in experimental neuro‐injury models. The pleiotropic PAR1 agonist, 3K3A‐APC, reduces neurologic injury and promotes vascular integrity; 3K3A‐APC proved safe in human volunteers. We performed a randomized, controlled, blinded, trial to determine the maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of 3K3A‐APC in ischemic stroke patients.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>The NeuroNEXT trial RHAPSODY used a novel continual reassessment method to determine the MTD using tiers of 120, 240, 360 and 540μg/kg 3K3A‐APC. After intravenous tissue plasminogen activator, intraarterial mechanical thrombectomy, or both, patients were randomized to one of the four doses or placebo. Vasculoprotection was assessed as microbleed and intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) rates.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Between January 2015 and July 2017 we treated 110 patients. Demographics resembled a typical stroke population. The MTD was the highest dose 3K3A‐APC tested, 540μg/kg, with an estimated toxicity rate of 7%. There was no difference in prespecified ICH rates. In exploratory analyses, 3K3A‐APC reduced ICH rates compared to placebo from 86.5% to 67.4% in the combined treatment arms (p=0.046), and total hemorrhage volume from an average of 2.1±5.8 mL in placebo to 0.8±2.1 mL in the combined treatment arms (p=0.066).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>RHAPSODY is the first trial of a neuroprotectant for acute ischemic stroke in a trial design allowing thrombectomy, thrombolysis, or both. The MTD was 540μg/kg for the PAR1 active cytoprotectant 3K3A‐APC. A trend toward lower hemorrhage rate in an exploratory analysis requires confirmation.</p>

<p>by Andrej Berg, Oleksandra Kukharenko, Martin Scheffner, Christine Peter</p>

Covalent modification of proteins by ubiquitin or ubiquitin chains is one of the most prevalent post-translational modifications in eukaryotes. Different types of ubiquitin chains are assumed to selectively signal respectively modified proteins for different fates. In support of this hypothesis, structural studies have shown that the eight possible ubiquitin dimers adopt different conformations. However, at least in some cases, these structures cannot sufficiently explain the molecular basis of the selective signaling mechanisms. This indicates that the available structures represent only a few distinct conformations within the entire conformational space adopted by a ubiquitin dimer. Here, molecular simulations on different levels of resolution can complement the structural information. We have combined exhaustive coarse grained and atomistic simulations of all eight possible ubiquitin dimers with a suitable dimensionality reduction technique and a new method to characterize protein-protein interfaces and the conformational landscape of protein conjugates. We found that ubiquitin dimers exhibit characteristic linkage type-dependent properties in solution, such as interface stability and the character of contacts between the subunits, which can be directly correlated with experimentally observed linkage-specific properties.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/6aIN2Kla9rU" width="1" />

<p>by Joana C. Xavier, Kiran Raosaheb Patil, Isabel Rocha</p>

Essential metabolic reactions are shaping constituents of metabolic networks, enabling viable and distinct phenotypes across diverse life forms. Here we analyse and compare modelling predictions of essential metabolic functions with experimental data and thereby identify core metabolic pathways in prokaryotes. Simulations of 15 manually curated genome-scale metabolic models were integrated with 36 large-scale gene essentiality datasets encompassing a wide variety of species of bacteria and archaea. Conservation of metabolic genes was estimated by analysing 79 representative genomes from all the branches of the prokaryotic tree of life. We find that essentiality patterns reflect phylogenetic relations both for modelling and experimental data, which correlate highly at the pathway level. Genes that are essential for several species tend to be highly conserved as opposed to non-essential genes which may be conserved or not. The tRNA-charging module is highlighted as ancestral and with high centrality in the networks, followed closely by cofactor metabolism, pointing to an early information processing system supplied by organic cofactors. The results, which point to model improvements and also indicate faults in the experimental data, should be relevant to the study of centrality in metabolic networks and ancient metabolism but also to metabolic engineering with prokaryotes.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/YfypktDVdWM" width="1" />

Abstract<p>Microglia, the resident immune cells in the central nervous system, play multiple roles during development. In the embryonic cerebral wall, microglia modulate the functions of neural stem/progenitor cells through their distribution in regions undergoing cell proliferation and/or differentiation. Previous studies using CX3CR1-GFP transgenic mice demonstrated that microglia extensively survey these regions. To simultaneously visualize microglia and neural-lineage cells that interact with each other, we applied the <i>in utero</i> electroporation (IUE) technique, which has been widely used for gene-transfer in neurodevelopmental studies, to CX3CR1-GFP mice (males and females). However, we unexpectedly faced a technical problem: although microglia are normally distributed homogeneously throughout the mid-embryonic cortical wall with only limited luminal entry, the intraventricular presence of exogenously derived plasmid DNAs induced microglia to accumulate along the apical surface of the cortex and aggregate in the choroid plexus. This effect was independent of capillary needle puncture of the brain wall or application of electrical pulses. The microglial response occurred at plasmid DNA concentrations lower than those routinely used for IUE, and was mediated by activation of Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9), an innate immune sensor that recognizes unmethylated cytosine-phosphate guanosine (CpG) motifs abundant in microbial DNA. Administration of plasmid DNA together with oligonucleotide (ODN) 2088, the antagonist of TLR9, restored the normal (dispersed) intramural localization of microglia and decreased luminal accumulation of these cells. Thus, via TLR9, intraventricular plasmid DNA administration causes aberrant distribution of embryonic microglia, suggesting that the behavior of microglia in brain primordia subjected to IUE should be carefully interpreted.</p><p><b>Significance statement</b> Microglia have been recently shown to play multiple roles in the embryonic brain. In the trials for labeling neural-lineage cells using IUE technique in CX3CR1-GFP mice, in which microglia express GFP, to achieve dual live-imaging of these cell types, we unexpectedly found that intra-ventricular administration of plasmid DNA caused microglial aberrant accumulation along the luminal surface of the cerebral wall and in the choroid plexus. Notably, Co-administration of TLR9 antagonist into the ventricle together with plasmid DNA restored the normal dispersed localization of microglia in the mid-embryonic (E14) cortex, suggesting that massive microglial accumulation induced by plasmid DNA is primarily mediated by TLR9 activation. Our findings have implications for the application of IUE to investigate embryonic microglia.</p>

Abstract<p>Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) is a neuromuscular disease characterized by degeneration of spinal motor neurons resulting in variable degrees of muscular wasting and weakness. It is caused by a loss-of-function mutation in the <i>Survival Motor Neuron</i> (<i>SMN1</i>) gene. <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> (<i>C. elegans</i>) mutants lacking <i>SMN</i> recapitulate several aspects of the disease including impaired movement and shorted life span. We examined whether genes previously implicated in life span extension conferred benefits to <i>C. elegans</i> lacking SMN. We find that reducing DAF-2/insulin receptor signaling activity promotes survival and improves locomotor behavior in this <i>C. elegans</i> model of SMA. The locomotor dysfunction in <i>C. elegans</i> lacking <i>SMN</i> correlated with structural and functional abnormalities in GABAergic neuromuscular junctions. Moreover, we demonstrated that reduction in DAF-2 signaling reversed these abnormalities. Remarkably, enhancing GABAergic neurotransmission alone was able to correct the locomotor dysfunction. Our work indicated that an imbalance of excitatory/inhibitory activity within motor circuits and underlies motor system dysfunction in this SMA model. Interventions aimed at restoring the balance of excitatory/inhibitory activity in motor circuits could be of benefit to individuals with SMA.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> SMA is a pediatric motor neuron disease resulting from the loss of the SMN protein. While great effort has been expended on interventions aimed at increasing levels of compensatory SMN1, identification of genes that modify the SMA phenotype has lagged. Here we undertook a targeted genetic screen to identify SMA disease suppressors. We demonstrated that reduced insulin/insulin-like signaling is beneficial for not only longevity but also locomotor activity in SMA worm models. Our results from anatomical, functional, and genetic studies show that the impairment of GABAergic neurotransmission contributes to locomotor dysfunction in <i>smn-1</i> null worms. Enhancing GABAergic neurotransmission alone can correct the locomotor dysfunction. This work leads to new understanding of disease pathogenesis and opens up new opportunities for therapy.</p>

Abstract<p>Treatments to stop gray matter degeneration are needed to prevent progressive disability in multiple sclerosis (MS). We tested whether inhibiting mixed-lineage kinases (MLKs), which can drive inflammatory microglial activation and neuronal degeneration, could protect hippocampal synapses in C57BL/6 mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, a disease model that recapitulates the excitatory synaptic injury that occurs widely within the gray matter in MS. URMC-099, a broad spectrum MLK inhibitor with additional activity against LRRK2 and other kinases, prevented loss of PSD95-positive postsynaptic structures, shifted activated microglia toward a less inflammatory phenotype, and reversed deficits in hippocampal-dependent contextual fear conditioning in EAE mice when administered after the onset of motor symptoms. A narrow spectrum inhibitor designed to be highly selective for MLK3 failed to protect synapses in EAE hippocampi, and could not rescue cultured neurons from trophic deprivation in an <i>in vitro</i> model of MLK-driven neuronal degeneration. These results suggest that URMC-099 may have potential as a neuroprotective treatment in MS, and demonstrate that a broad spectrum of inhibition against a combination of MLK and other kinases is more effective in neuroinflammatory disease than selectively targeting a single kinase.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Multiple sclerosis (MS) causes progressive neurologic decline that correlates with damage to gray matter in the brain, and is not stopped by current treatments. We used a mouse model of MS, in which gray matter injury is associated with inflammatory molecules produced by activated microglia, to test novel neuroprotective treatments. URMC-099, a mixed-lineage kinase (MLK) inhibitor that has anti-inflammatory and direct neuroprotective properties, prevented loss of hippocampal synapses and reversed deficits in learning and memory in a mouse model of MS. An MLK inhibitor with a narrower range of specificity was not effective, suggesting that combination kinase inhibition with URMC-099 may have potential as a neuroprotective treatment in MS.</p>

Abstract
<p>Memory formation is a protracted process that initially involves the hippocampus and becomes increasingly dependent on the cortex over time, but the mechanisms of this transfer are unclear. We recently showed that hippocampal depletion of the histone variant H2A.Z enhances both recent and remote memories, but the use of virally mediated depletion reduced H2A.Z levels throughout testing, making its temporally specific function unclear. Given the lack of drugs that target histone variants, we tested existing drugs for efficacy against H2A.Z based on their targeting of known H2A.Z regulators. The Tip60 (part of H2A.Z deposition complex) inhibitor Nu9056 reduced H2A.Z binding, whereas the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor Trichostatin-A increased H2A.Z acetylation without influencing total H2A.Z in cultured hippocampal neurons. Tip60 (but not HDAC) inhibition 23 h after learning enhanced remote (tested at 7 d) and not recent (tested at 24 h) contextual fear memory in mice. In contrast, Tip60 inhibition 30 d after learning impaired recall of remote memory after 1 h, but protected the memory from further decline 24 h later. These data provide the first evidence of a delayed postlearning role for histone variants in supporting memory transfer during systems consolidation.</p>

<p>A recent study showed that p11 expressed in cholinergic interneurons (CINs) of the nucleus accumbens (NAc) is a key regulator of depression-like behaviors. Dopaminergic neurons projecting to the NAc are responsible for reward-related behaviors, and their function is impaired in depression. The present study investigated the role of p11 in NAc CINs in dopamine responses to rewarding stimuli. The extracellular dopamine and acetylcholine (ACh) levels in the NAc were determined in freely moving male mice using <i>in vivo</i> microdialysis. Rewarding stimuli (cocaine, palatable food, and female mouse encounter) induced an increase in dopamine efflux in the NAc of wild-type (WT) mice. The dopamine responses were attenuated (cocaine) or abolished (food and female mouse encounter) in constitutive p11 knock-out (KO) mice. The dopamine response to cocaine was accompanied by an increase in ACh NAc efflux, whereas the attenuated dopamine response to cocaine in p11 KO mice was restored by activation of nicotinic or muscarinic ACh receptors in the NAc. Dopamine responses to rewarding stimuli and ACh release in the NAc were attenuated in mice with deletion of p11 from cholinergic neurons (ChAT-p11 cKO mice), whereas gene delivery of p11 to CINs restored the dopamine responses. Furthermore, chemogenetic studies revealed that p11 is required for activation of CINs in response to rewarding stimuli. Thus, p11 in NAc CINs plays a critical role in activating these neurons to mediate dopamine responses to rewarding stimuli. The dysregulation of mesolimbic dopamine system by dysfunction of p11 in NAc CINs may be involved in pathogenesis of depressive states.</p>

<p>Excitatory synapses are often formed at small protrusions of dendrite, called dendritic spines, in most projection neurons, and the spine-head volumes show strong correlations with synaptic connectivity. We examined the dynamics of spine volume in the adult mouse visual cortex using time-lapse <i>in vivo</i> two-photon imaging with a resonant Galvano scanner. Contrary to expectations, we found that the spines in the adult neocortex showed fluctuations to a similar degree as that observed in young hippocampal preparations, but there were systematic differences in how the dynamics were dependent on spine volumes, thus allowing for fewer fluctuations in small spines, which could account for the relatively low turnover rates of neocortical spines <i>in vivo</i>. We found that spine volumes fluctuated to a greater extent in a mouse model (<i>Fmr1</i> knockout) of fragile X mental retardation than in wild-type mice, and the spine turnover rates were also higher in <i>Fmr1</i> knock-out mice. Such features of spine dynamics in <i>Fmr1</i> knock-out mice could be represented by a single slope factor in our model. Our data and model indicate a small but significant change in the average spine volume and more eminent differences in the statistical distribution in <i>Fmr1</i> knock-out mice even in adulthood, which reflects the abnormal <i>in vivo</i> dynamics of spine volumes.</p>

Abstract
<p>The role of orexin during development, and especially in terms of spinal cord function, is not well understood. It is for this reason that we focused on the network actions of orexin during the first week of development. We found that orexinergic fibers were present in the lumbar spinal cord of postnatal day 0 (P0) to P3 mice. The fibers were expressed mainly in the dorsal horn, but occasional fibers were observed in the ventral horn. Both orexin (OX) A and OXB increased the motoneurons (MNs) tonic neurogram discharge. However, only OXA was found to significantly increase spontaneous bursting activity and the frequency of fictive locomotor bursts. We show that OXA is able to act directly on MNs. To test the contribution of the recurrent MN collaterals, we blocked the nicotinic cholinergic drive and observed that OXA retained its ability to increase fictive locomotor activity. Additionally, we recorded neurograms from ventral lateral funiculi, where OXA had no effect on population discharge. These effects were also confirmed by recording from descending commissural interneurons via patch recordings. The loci of the effects of OXA were further investigated in a dorsal horn-removed preparation where OXA also shows an increase in the discharge from ventral root neurograms but no increase in the frequency of spontaneous or fictive locomotion burst activity. In summary, multiple lines of evidence from our work demonstrate the robust effects of orexins on spinal cord networks and MNs at the time of birth.</p>

Abstract
<p>CD137L (4-1BBL) is a costimulatory molecule whose signaling can promote monocyte/macrophage functions; however, CD137L-mediated microglial response and its role in neuropathic pain remain unknown. We investigated CD137L following peripheral nerve injury-induced neuropathic pain using a spinal nerve L5 transection (L5Tx) murine model in both sexes. First, C57BL/6_CD137L knock-out (KO) mice displayed decreased mechanical and diminished heat hypersensitivity compared to wild-type (WT) controls, beginning on day 3 to up to day 35 post-L5Tx. Purified anti-mouse CD137L neutralizing monoclonal antibody (0.1 or 0.5 µg) was also used to identify CD137L’s window of action in BALB/c mice. Anti-CD137L antibody was intrathecally administered either from day 0 (before surgery) to day 7 (early treatment), or from day 6 to 13 post-L5Tx (late treatment), and nociceptive thresholds were assessed before surgery to up to day 35 post-surgery. Early treatment with anti-CD137L reduced L5Tx-induced mechanical but not heat hypersensitivity, while later treatment did not alter either sensitivity. Pro- versus anti-inflammatory responses within the lumbar spinal cord following L5Tx were further evaluated via quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) in time-course studies. Following L5Tx, female CD137L KO mice did not show increased iNOS mRNA and had reduced numbers of IL-1β<sup>+</sup> cells compared to WT. At 21 d post-surgery, CD137L KO mice had higher total numbers of arginase (Arg)-1<sup>+</sup> cells and Arg-1<sup>+</sup> microglia. Altogether, results indicate that spinal cord CD137L contributes to the development of peripheral nerve injury-induced neuropathic pain, which may be in part mediated through CD137L’s modulation of the pro- and anti-inflammatory balance within the spinal cord.</p>

Abstract
<p>Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons form the final common central output pathway controlling fertility and are regulated by steroid feedback. In females, estradiol feedback action varies between negative and positive; negative feedback typically regulates episodic GnRH release whereas positive feedback initiates a surge of GnRH, and subsequently luteinizing hormone (LH) release ultimately triggering ovulation. During the estrous cycle, changes between estradiol negative and positive feedback occur with cycle stage and time of day, with positive feedback in the late afternoon of proestrus in nocturnal species. To test the hypotheses that synaptic and intrinsic properties of GnRH neurons are regulated by cycle stage and time of day, we performed whole-cell patch-clamp studies of GnRH neurons in brain slices from mice at two times considered negative feedback (diestrous PM and proestrous AM) and during positive feedback (proestrous PM). GABAergic transmission can excite GnRH neurons and was higher in cells from proestrous PM mice than cells from proestrous AM mice and approached traditional significance levels relative to cells from diestrous PM mice. Action potential response to current injection was also greater in cells from proestrous PM mice than the other two groups. Interestingly, the hormonal milieu of proestrous AM provided stronger negative feedback on both GnRH neuron excitability and GABAergic postsynaptic current (PSC) amplitude than diestrous PM. These observations demonstrate elements of both synaptic and intrinsic properties of GnRH neurons are regulated in a cycle-dependent manner and provide insight into the neurobiological mechanisms underlying cyclic changes in neuroendocrine function among states of estradiol negative and positive feedback.</p>

Abstract
<p>Reading literature (e.g., an entire book) is an enriching experience that qualitatively differs from reading a single sentence; however, the brain dynamics of such context-dependent memory remains unclear. This study aimed to elucidate mnemonic neural dynamics during natural reading of literature by performing electroencephalogram (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Brain activities of human participants recruited on campus were correlated with their subsequent memory, which was quantified by semantic correlation between the read text and reports subsequently written by them based on state of the art natural language processing procedures. The results of the EEG data analysis showed a significant positive relationship between subsequent memory and fixation-related EEG. Sentence-length and paragraph-length mnemonic processes were associated with N1-P2 and P3 fixation-related potential (FRP) components and fixation-related -band (4–8 Hz) EEG power, respectively. In contrast, the results of fMRI analysis showed a significant negative relationship between subsequent memory and blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) activation. Sentence-length and paragraph-length mnemonic processes were associated with networks of regions forming part of the salience network and the default mode network (DMN), respectively. Taken together with the EEG results, these memory-related deactivations in the salience network and the DMN were thought to reflect the reading of sentences characterized by low mnemonic load and the suppression of task-irreverent thoughts, respectively. It was suggested that the context-dependent mnemonic process during literature reading requires large-scale network deactivation, which might reflect coordination of a range of voluntary processes during reading.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/39169"><i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> induces decelerated bioenergetic metabolism in human macrophages</a></h4>

How <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> (<i>Mtb</i>) rewires macrophage energy metabolism to facilitate survival is poorly characterized. Here, we used extracellular flux analysis to simultaneously measure the rates of glycolysis and respiration in real-time. <i>Mtb</i> infection induced a quiescent energy phenotype in human monocyte-derived macrophages and decelerated flux through glycolysis and the TCA cycle. In contrast, infection with the vaccine strain, <i>M</i>. <i>bovis</i> BCG, or dead <i>Mtb</i> induced glycolytic phenotypes with greater flux. Furthermore, <i>Mtb </i>reduced the mitochondrial dependency on glucose and increased the mitochondrial dependency on fatty acids, shifting this dependency from endogenous fatty acids in uninfected cells to exogenous fatty acids in infected macrophages. We demonstrate how quantifiable bioenergetic parameters of the host can be used to accurately measure and track disease, which will enable rapid quantifiable assessment of drug and vaccine efficacy. Our findings uncovered new paradigms for understanding the bioenergetic basis of host metabolic reprogramming by <i>Mtb</i>.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/37776">Angiopoietin-4-dependent venous maturation and fluid drainage in the peripheral retina</a></h4>

The maintenance of fluid homeostasis is necessary for function of the neural retina; however, little is known about the significance of potential ﬂuid management mechanisms. Here, we investigated angiopoietin-4 (Angpt4, also known as Ang3), a poorly characterized ligand for endothelial receptor tyrosine kinase Tie2, in mouse retina model. By using genetic reporter, fate mapping, and in situ hybridization, we found <i>Angpt4</i> expression in a specific sub-population of astrocytes at the site where venous morphogenesis occurs and that lower oxygen tension, which distinguishes peripheral and venous locations, enhances Angpt4 expression. Correlating with its spatiotemporal expression, deletion of <i>Angpt4</i> resulted in defective venous development causing impaired venous drainage and defects in neuronal cells. In vitro characterization of angiopoietin-4 proteins revealed both ligand-specific and redundant functions among the angiopoietins. Our study identifies Angpt4 as the first growth factor for venous-specific development and its importance in venous remodeling, retinal fluid clearance and neuronal function.

Adaptation to the ever-changing world is critical for survival, and our brains are particularly tuned to remember events that differ from previous experiences. Novel experiences induce dopamine release in the hippocampus, a process which promotes memory persistence. While axons from the ventral tegmental area (VTA) were generally thought to be the exclusive source of hippocampal dopamine, recent studies have demonstrated that noradrenergic neurons in the locus coeruleus (LC) corelease noradrenaline and dopamine in the hippocampus and that their dopamine release boosts memory retention as well.

Cytoplasmic flows are an ubiquitous feature of biological systems, in particular in large cells, such as oocytes and eggs in early animal development. Here we show that cytoplasmic flows in starfish oocytes, which can be imaged well with transmission light microscopy, are fully determined by the cortical dynamics during surface contraction waves. We first show that the dynamics of the oocyte surface is highly symmetric around the animal-vegetal axis. We then mathematically solve the Stokes equation for flows inside a deforming sphere using the measured surface displacements as boundary conditions. Our theoretical predictions agree very well with the intracellular flows quantified by particle image velocimetry, proving that during this stage the starfish cytoplasm behaves as a simple Newtonian fluid on the micrometer scale. We calculate the pressure field inside the oocyte and find that its gradient is too small as to explain polar body extrusion, in contrast to earlier suggestions. Myosin II inhibition by blebbistatin confirms this conclusion, because it diminishes cell shape changes and hydrodynamic flow, but does not abolish polar body formation.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/TABMnyJYzl0" width="1" />

<p>by Haleh Ebadi, Michael Perry, Keith Short, Konstantin Klemm, Claude Desplan, Peter F. Stadler, Anita Mehta</p>

While most processes in biology are highly deterministic, stochastic mechanisms are sometimes used to increase cellular diversity. In human and Drosophila eyes, photoreceptors sensitive to different wavelengths of light are distributed in stochastic patterns, and one such patterning system has been analyzed in detail in the Drosophila retina. Interestingly, some species in the dipteran family Dolichopodidae (the “long legged” flies, or “Doli”) instead exhibit highly orderly deterministic eye patterns. In these species, alternating columns of ommatidia (unit eyes) produce corneal lenses of different colors. Occasional perturbations in some individuals disrupt the regular columns in a way that suggests that patterning occurs via a posterior-to-anterior signaling relay during development, and that specification follows a local, cellular-automaton-like rule. We hypothesize that the regulatory mechanisms that pattern the eye are largely conserved among flies and that the difference between unordered Drosophila and ordered dolichopodid eyes can be explained in terms of relative strengths of signaling interactions rather than a rewiring of the regulatory network itself. We present a simple stochastic model that is capable of explaining both the stochastic Drosophila eye and the striped pattern of Dolichopodidae eyes and thereby characterize the least number of underlying developmental rules necessary to produce both stochastic and deterministic patterns. We show that only small changes to model parameters are needed to also reproduce intermediate, semi-random patterns observed in another Doli species, and quantification of ommatidial distributions in these eyes suggests that their patterning follows similar rules.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/WfAj38t5J5A" width="1" />

ABSTRACT<p>Interacting with our immediate surroundings requires constant manipulation of objects. Dexterous manipulation depends on comparison between actual and predicted sensory input, with these predictions calculated by means of lower- and higher-order corollary discharge signals. However, there is still scarce knowledge about the hierarchy in the neural architecture supporting haptic monitoring during manipulation. The present study aimed to assess this issue focusing on the cross-talk between lower-order sensory and higher-order associative regions. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging in humans during a haptic discrimination task in which participants had to judge whether a touched shape or texture corresponded to an expected stimulus whose name was previously presented. Specialized haptic regions identified with an independent localizer task did not differ between expected and unexpected conditions, suggesting their lack of involvement in tactile monitoring. When presented stimuli did not match previous expectations, the left supramarginal gyrus, middle temporal, and medial prefrontal cortices were activated regardless of the nature of the haptic mismatch (shape/texture). The left SI responded differently to unexpected shapes and textures in line with a specialized detection of haptic mismatch. Importantly, connectivity analyses revealed that the left supramarginal gyrus and SI were more functionally coupled during unexpected trials, emphasizing their interaction. The results point for the first time to a hierarchical organization in the neural substrates underlying haptic monitoring during manipulation with the supramarginal gyrus as a higher-order hub comparing actual and predicted somatosensory input, and SI as a lower-order site involved in the detection of more specialized haptic mismatch.</p><p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The findings in the present study have important implications for the understanding of the neural architecture that supports haptic monitoring during manipulation.

Abstract
<p>Maternal immune activation (MIA) has been identified as a causal factor in psychiatric disorders by epidemiological studies in humans and mechanistic studies in rodent models. Addressing this gap in species between mice and human will accelerate the understanding of the role of MIA in the etiology of psychiatric disorders. Here, we provide the first study of MIA in the ferret (<i>Mustela putorius furo</i>), an animal model with a rich history of developmental investigations due to the similarities in developmental programs and cortical organization with primates. We found that after MIA by injection of PolyIC in the pregnant mother animal, the adult offspring exhibited reduced social behavior, less eye contact with humans, decreased recognition memory, a sex-specific increase in amphetamine-induced hyperlocomotion, and altered gut microbiome. We also studied the neurophysiological properties of the MIA ferrets in development by <i>in-vivo</i> recordings of the local field potential (LFP) from visual cortex in five- to six-week-old animals, and found that the spontaneous and sensory-evoked LFP had decreased power, especially in the gamma frequency band. Overall, our results provide the first evidence for the detrimental effect of MIA in ferrets and support the use of the ferret as an intermediate model species for the study of disorders with neurodevelopmental origin.</p>

<p>Microglia are highly motile immunoreactive cells that play integral roles in the response to brain infection and damage, and in the progression of various neurological diseases. During development, microglia also help sculpt neural circuits, via both promoting synapse formation and by targeting specific synapses for elimination and phagocytosis. Microglia are also active surveyors of neural circuits in the mature, healthy brain, although the functional consequences of such microglia-neuron contacts under these conditions is unclear. Using <i>in vivo</i> imaging of neurons and microglia in awake mice, we report here the functional consequences of microglia-synapse contacts. Direct contact between a microglial process and a single synapse results in a specific increase in the activity of that contacted synapse, and a corresponding increase in back-propagating action potentials along the parent dendrite. This increase in activity is not seen for microglia-synapse contacts when microglia are activated by chronic lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment. To probe how this microglia-synapse contact affects neural circuits, we imaged across larger populations of motor cortical neurons. When microglia were again activated by LPS (or partially ablated), there was a decrease in the extent to which neuronal activity was synchronized. Together, our results demonstrate that interactions between physiological or resting microglia and synapses in the mature, healthy brain leads to an increase in neuronal activity and thereby helps to synchronize local populations of neurons. Our novel findings provide a plausible physical basis for understanding how alterations in immune status may impact on neural circuit plasticity and on cognitive behaviors such as learning.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/41305">Targeted degradation of BRD9 reverses oncogenic gene expression in synovial sarcoma</a></h4>

Synovial sarcoma tumours contain a characteristic fusion protein, SS18-SSX, which drives disease development. Targeting oncogenic fusion proteins presents an attractive therapeutic opportunity. However, SS18-SSX has proven intractable for therapeutic intervention. Using a domain-focused CRISPR screen we identified the bromodomain of BRD9 as a critical functional dependency in synovial sarcoma. BRD9 is a component of SS18-SSX containing BAF complexes in synovial sarcoma cells; and integration of BRD9 into these complexes is critical for cell growth. Moreover BRD9 and SS18-SSX co-localize extensively on the synovial sarcoma genome. Remarkably, synovial sarcoma cells are highly sensitive to a novel small molecule degrader of BRD9, while other sarcoma subtypes are unaffected. Degradation of BRD9 induces downregulation of oncogenic transcriptional programs and inhibits tumour progression <i>in vivo</i>. We demonstrate that BRD9 supports oncogenic mechanisms underlying the SS18-SSX fusion in synovial sarcoma and highlight targeted degradation of BRD9 as a potential therapeutic opportunity in this disease.

Ponce-Alvarez et al. show that zebrafish larvae generate spontaneous neuronal avalanches across the entire brain. These collective cascading events exhibit scale invariance, typical of critical phenomena (e.g., earthquakes, paper crumpling). The brain’s critical dynamics are modulated during interactions with the environment.

Tripathy et al. show that mutations in MAST1, a microtubule-associated protein, cause a syndrome characterized by an enlarged corpus callosum. They attribute this thickening to an increase in the number of contralateral projections despite extensive cortical apoptosis.

<p>Since their discovery, slow oscillations have been observed to group spindles during non-REM sleep. Previous studies assert that the slow-oscillation downstate (DS) is preceded by slow spindles (10–12 Hz) and followed by fast spindles (12–16 Hz). Here, using both direct transcortical recordings in patients with intractable epilepsy (<i>n</i> = 10, 8 female), as well as scalp EEG recordings from a healthy cohort (<i>n</i> = 3, 1 female), we find in multiple cortical areas that both slow and fast spindles follow the DS. Although discrete oscillations do precede DSs, they are theta bursts (TBs) centered at 5–8 Hz. TBs were more pronounced for DSs in NREM stage 2 (N2) sleep compared with N3. TB with similar properties occur in the thalamus, but unlike spindles they have no clear temporal relationship with cortical TB. These differences in corticothalamic dynamics, as well as differences between spindles and theta in coupling high-frequency content, are consistent with NREM theta having separate generative mechanisms from spindles. The final inhibitory cycle of the TB coincides with the DS peak, suggesting that in N2, TB may help trigger the DS. Since the transition to N1 is marked by the appearance of theta, and the transition to N2 by the appearance of DS and thus spindles, a role of TB in triggering DS could help explain the sequence of electrophysiological events characterizing sleep. Finally, the coordinated appearance of spindles and DSs are implicated in memory consolidation processes, and the current findings redefine their temporal coupling with theta during NREM sleep.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Sleep is characterized by large slow waves which modulate brain activity. Prominent among these are downstates (DSs), periods of a few tenths of a second when most cells stop firing, and spindles, oscillations at ~12 times a second lasting for ~a second. In this study, we provide the first detailed description of another kind of sleep wave: theta bursts (TBs), a brief oscillation at ~six cycles per second. We show, recording during natural sleep directly from the human cortex and thalamus, as well as on the scalp, that TBs precede, and spindles follow DSs. TBs may help trigger DSs in some circumstances, and could organize cortical and thalamic activity so that memories can be consolidated during sleep.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/46/9977?rss=1">Ipsilesional Motor Cortex Plasticity Participates in Spontaneous Hindlimb Recovery after Lateral Hemisection of the Thoracic Spinal Cord in the Rat</a></h4>

<p>After an incomplete spinal cord injury (SCI) spontaneous motor recovery can occur in mammals, but the underlying neural substrates remain poorly understood. The motor cortex is crucial for skilled motor learning and the voluntary control of movement and is known to reorganize after cortical injury to promote recovery. Motor cortex plasticity has also been shown to parallel the recovery of forelimb function after cervical SCI, but whether cortical plasticity participates in hindlimb recovery after SCI remains unresolved. Using intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) mapping, behavioral and cortical inactivation techniques in the female Long–Evans rat, we evaluated the spontaneous cortical mechanisms of hindlimb motor recovery 1–5 weeks after lateral hemisection of the thoracic (T8) spinal cord that ablated the crossed corticospinal tract (CST) from the contralesional motor cortex while sparing the majority of the CST from the ipsilesional motor cortex. Hemisection initially impaired hindlimb motor function bilaterally but significant recovery occurred during the first 3 weeks. ICMS revealed time-dependent changes in motor cortex organization, characterized by a chronic abolishment of hindlimb motor representation in the contralesional motor cortex and the development of transient bilateral hindlimb representation in the ipsilesional motor cortex 3 weeks after hemisection, when significant behavioral recovery occurred. Consistently, reversible inactivation of the ipsilesional, but not the contralesional motor cortex, during skilled ladder walking 3 weeks after hemisection reinstated deficits in both hindlimbs. These findings indicate that the ipsilesional motor cortex transiently reorganizes after lateral hemisection of the thoracic spinal cord to support recovery of hindlimb motor function.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Partial motor recovery can occur after an incomplete spinal cord injury and is hypothesized to result from the reorganization of spared descending motor pathways. The motor cortex is crucial for the control of voluntary movement and contains topographical movement representations (motor maps) that are highly plastic. We examined the organization of hindlimb motor maps bilaterally after a lateral hemisection of the spinal cord to show that while motor maps are abolished in the deefferented cortex, the spared ipsilesional cortex transiently reorganizes to gain a representation of the affected hindlimb after injury that relates to recovery. This finding demonstrates that plasticity in the ipsilesional motor cortex at early time points after spinal cord hemisection is initially important to support motor recovery.</p>

<p>Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) measures the two most common inhibitory and excitatory neurotransmitters, GABA and glutamate, in the human brain. However, the role of MRS-derived GABA and glutamate signals in relation to system-level neural signaling and behavior is not fully understood. In this study, we investigated levels of GABA and glutamate in the visual cortex of healthy human participants (both genders) in three functional states with increasing visual input. Compared with a baseline state of eyes closed, GABA levels decreased after opening the eyes in darkness and Glx levels remained stable during eyes open but increased with visual stimulation. In relevant states, GABA and Glx correlated with amplitude of fMRI signal fluctuations. Furthermore, visual discriminatory performance correlated with the level of GABA, but not Glx. Our study suggests that differences in brain states can be detected through the contrasting dynamics of GABA and Glx, which has implications in interpreting MRS measurements.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> GABA and glutamate are the two most abundant neurotransmitters in human brain. Their interaction, known as inhibitory-excitatory balance, plays a crucial role in establishing spontaneous and stimulus-driven brain activity. Yet, the relationship between magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS)-derived levels of both metabolites and fMRI is still a matter of dispute. In this work, we study GABA and glutamate in three states of visual processing and in relation to fMRI and visual discriminatory performance in healthy people. We found that states of visual processing can be detected through the contrasting dynamics of GABA and glutamate and their correlation with fMRI signals. We also demonstrated that GABA, but not glutamate, in the visual system predicts visual performance. Our results provide insights into MRS-derived GABA and glutamate measurements.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/46/9955?rss=1">Implicit Memory for Complex Sounds in Higher Auditory Cortex of the Ferret</a></h4>

<p>Responses of auditory cortical neurons encode sound features of incoming acoustic stimuli and also are shaped by stimulus context and history. Previous studies of mammalian auditory cortex have reported a variable time course for such contextual effects ranging from milliseconds to minutes. However, in secondary auditory forebrain areas of songbirds, long-term stimulus-specific neuronal habituation to acoustic stimuli can persist for much longer periods of time, ranging from hours to days. Such long-term habituation in the songbird is a form of long-term auditory memory that requires gene expression. Although such long-term habituation has been demonstrated in avian auditory forebrain, this phenomenon has not previously been described in the mammalian auditory system. Utilizing a similar version of the avian habituation paradigm, we explored whether such long-term effects of stimulus history also occur in auditory cortex of a mammalian auditory generalist, the ferret. Following repetitive presentation of novel complex sounds, we observed significant response habituation in secondary auditory cortex, but not in primary auditory cortex. This long-term habituation appeared to be independent for each novel stimulus and often lasted for at least 20 min. These effects could not be explained by simple neuronal fatigue in the auditory pathway, because time-reversed sounds induced undiminished responses similar to those elicited by completely novel sounds. A parallel set of pupillometric response measurements in the ferret revealed long-term habituation effects similar to observed long-term neural habituation, supporting the hypothesis that habituation to passively presented stimuli is correlated with implicit learning and long-term recognition of familiar sounds.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Long-term habituation in higher areas of songbird auditory forebrain is associated with gene expression and is correlated with recognition memory. Similar long-term auditory habituation in mammals has not been previously described. We studied such habituation in single neurons in the auditory cortex of awake ferrets that were passively listening to repeated presentations of various complex sounds. Responses exhibited long-lasting habituation (at least 20 min) in the secondary, but not primary auditory cortex. Habituation ceased when stimuli were played backward, despite having identical spectral content to the original sound. This long-term neural habituation correlated with similar habituation of ferret pupillary responses to repeated presentations of the same stimuli, suggesting that stimulus habituation is retained as a long-term behavioral memory.</p>

<p>In addition to treating depression, antidepressant drugs are also a first-line treatment for neuropathic pain, which is pain secondary to lesion or pathology of the nervous system. Despite the widespread use of these drugs, the mechanism underlying their therapeutic action in this pain context remains partly elusive. The present study combined data collected in male and female mice from a model of neuropathic pain and data from the clinical setting to understand how antidepressant drugs act. We show two distinct mechanisms by which the selective inhibitor of serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake duloxetine and the tricyclic antidepressant amitriptyline relieve neuropathic allodynia. One of these mechanisms is acute, central, and requires descending noradrenergic inhibitory controls and α<sub>2A</sub> adrenoceptors, as well as the mu and delta opioid receptors. The second mechanism is delayed, peripheral, and requires noradrenaline from peripheral sympathetic endings and β<sub>2</sub> adrenoceptors, as well as the delta opioid receptors. We then conducted a transcriptomic analysis in dorsal root ganglia, which suggested that the peripheral component of duloxetine action involves the inhibition of neuroimmune mechanisms accompanying nerve injury, including the downregulation of the TNF-α–NF-B signaling pathway. Accordingly, immunotherapies against either TNF-α or Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) provided allodynia relief. We also compared duloxetine plasma levels in the animal model and in patients and we observed that patients' drug concentrations were compatible with those measured in animals under chronic treatment involving the peripheral mechanism. Our study highlights a peripheral neuroimmune component of antidepressant drugs that is relevant to their delayed therapeutic action against neuropathic pain.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> In addition to treating depression, antidepressant drugs are also a first-line treatment for neuropathic pain, which is pain secondary to lesion or pathology of the nervous system. However, the mechanism by which antidepressant drugs can relieve neuropathic pain remained in part elusive. Indeed, preclinical studies led to contradictions concerning the anatomical and molecular substrates of this action. In the present work, we overcame these apparent contradictions by highlighting the existence of two independent mechanisms. One is rapid and centrally mediated by descending controls from the brain to the spinal cord and the other is delayed, peripheral, and relies on the anti-neuroimmune action of chronic antidepressant treatment.</p>

<p>The nucleus reuniens (RE) is a ventral midline thalamic nucleus that interconnects the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and hippocampus (HPC). Considerable data indicate that HPC–mPFC circuits are involved in contextual and spatial memory; however, it is not clear whether the RE mediates the acquisition or retrieval of these memories. To examine this question, we inactivated the RE with muscimol before either the acquisition or retrieval of pavlovian fear conditioning in rats; freezing served as the index of fear. We found that RE inactivation before conditioning impaired the acquisition of contextual freezing, whereas inactivation of the RE before retrieval testing increased the generalization of freezing to a novel context; inactivation of the RE did not affect either the acquisition or expression of auditory fear conditioning. Interestingly, contextual conditioning impairments were absent when retrieval testing was also conducted after RE inactivation. Contextual memories acquired under RE inactivation were hippocampal independent, insofar as contextual freezing in rats conditioned under RE inactivation was insensitive to intrahippocampal infusions of the NMDA receptor antagonist aminophosphonovalerate. Together, these data reveal that the RE supports hippocampal-dependent encoding of precise contextual memories that allow discrimination of dangerous contexts from safe contexts. When the RE is inactive, however, alternate neural systems acquire an impoverished contextual memory that is expressed only when the RE is off-line.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The midline thalamic nucleus reuniens (RE) coordinates communication between the hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex, brain areas that are critical for contextual and spatial memory. Here we show that temporary pharmacological inactivation of RE impairs the acquisition and precision of contextual fear memories after pavlovian fear conditioning in rats. However, inactivating the RE before retrieval testing restored contextual memory in rats conditioned after RE inactivation. Critically, we show that imprecise contextual memories acquired under RE inactivation are learned independently of the hippocampus. These data reveal that the RE is required for hippocampal-dependent encoding of precise contextual memories to support the discrimination of safe and dangerous contexts.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/46/9900?rss=1">Neural Classifiers with Limited Connectivity and Recurrent Readouts</a></h4>

<p>For many neural network models in which neurons are trained to classify inputs like perceptrons, the number of inputs that can be classified is limited by the connectivity of each neuron, even when the total number of neurons is very large. This poses the problem of how the biological brain can take advantage of its huge number of neurons given that the connectivity is sparse. One solution is to combine multiple perceptrons together, as in committee machines. The number of classifiable random patterns would then grow linearly with the number of perceptrons, even when each perceptron has limited connectivity. However, the problem is moved to the downstream readout neurons, which would need a number of connections as large as the number of perceptrons. Here we propose a different approach in which the readout is implemented by connecting multiple perceptrons in a recurrent attractor neural network. We prove analytically that the number of classifiable random patterns can grow unboundedly with the number of perceptrons, even when the connectivity of each perceptron remains finite. Most importantly, both the recurrent connectivity and the connectivity of downstream readouts also remain finite. Our study shows that feedforward neural classifiers with numerous long-range afferent connections can be replaced by recurrent networks with sparse long-range connectivity without sacrificing the classification performance. Our strategy could be used to design more general scalable network architectures with limited connectivity, which resemble more closely the brain neural circuits that are dominated by recurrent connectivity.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The mammalian brain has a huge number of neurons, but the connectivity is rather sparse. This observation seems to contrast with the theoretical studies showing that for many neural network models the performance scales with the number of connections per neuron and not with the total number of neurons. To solve this dilemma, we propose a model in which a recurrent network reads out multiple neural classifiers. Its performance scales with the total number of neurons even when each neuron of the network has limited connectivity. Our study reveals an important role of recurrent connections in neural systems like the hippocampus, in which the computational limitations due to sparse long-range feedforward connectivity might be compensated by local recurrent connections.</p>

<p>The transmission of normal sensory and/or acute noxious information requires intact expression of pain-associated genes within the pain pathways of nervous system. Expressional changes of these genes after peripheral nerve injury are also critical for neuropathic pain induction and maintenance. Methyl-CpG-binding domain protein 1 (MBD1), an epigenetic repressor, regulates gene transcriptional activity. We report here that MBD1 in the primary sensory neurons of DRG is critical for the genesis of acute pain and neuropathic pain as DRG MBD1-deficient mice exhibit the reduced responses to acute mechanical, heat, cold, and capsaicin stimuli and the blunted nerve injury-induced pain hypersensitivities. Furthermore, DRG overexpression of MBD1 leads to spontaneous pain and evoked pain hypersensitivities in the WT mice and restores acute pain sensitivities in the MBD1-deficient mice. Mechanistically, MDB1 represses <i>Oprm1</i> and <i>Kcna2</i> gene expression by recruiting DNA methyltransferase DNMT3a into these two gene promoters in the DRG neurons. DRG MBD1 is likely a key player under the conditions of acute pain and neuropathic pain.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> In the present study, we revealed that the mice with deficiency of methyl-CpG-binding domain protein 1 (MBD1), an epigenetic repressor, in the DRG displayed the reduced responses to acute noxious stimuli and the blunted neuropathic pain. We also showed that DRG overexpression of MBD1 produced the hypersensitivities to noxious stimuli in the WT mice and rescued acute pain sensitivities in the MBD1-deficient mice. We have also provided the evidence that MDB1 represses <i>Oprm1</i> and <i>Kcna2</i> gene expression by recruiting DNA methyltransferase DNMT3a into these two gene promoters in the DRG neurons. DRG MBD1 may participate in the genesis of acute pain and neuropathic pain likely through regulating DNMT3a-controlled <i>Oprm1</i> and <i>Kcna2</i> gene expression in the DRG neurons.</p>

<p>Calretinin (CR)-expressing periglomerular (PG) cells are the most abundant interneurons in the glomerular layer of the olfactory bulb. They are predominately generated postnatally from the septal and dorsal subventricular zones that continue producing them well into adulthood. Yet, little is known about their properties and functions. Using transgenic approaches and patch-clamp recording in mice of both sexes we show that CR(+) PG cells of both septal and dorsal origin have homogeneous morphological and electrophysiological properties. However, unlike other PG cells, these axonless neurons express a surprisingly small repertoire of voltage-activated channels and do not fire or fire at most a single and often small action potential. Moreover, they are not innervated by olfactory sensory neurons and receive little synaptic inputs from mitral or tufted cells at excitatory synapses where NMDA receptors predominate. These membrane and synaptic properties, that resemble those of newborn immature neurons not yet integrated in the network, persist over time and limit the recruitment of CR(+) PG cells by afferent inputs that strongly drive local network activity. Together, our results show that postnatally generated CR(+) PG cells continuously supply a large pool of neurons with unconventional properties. These data also question the contribution of CR(+) PG cells in olfactory bulb computation.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Calretinin-expressing PG cells are by far the most abundant interneurons in the glomerular layer of the olfactory bulb. They are continuously produced during postnatal life, including adulthood, from neural stem cells located in the subventricular zones. Surprisingly, unlike other postnatally generated newborn neurons that quickly integrate into preexisting olfactory bulb networks, calretinin-expressing PG cells retain immature properties that limit their recruitment in local network activity for weeks, if not months, as if they would never fully mature. The function of this so far unsuspected pool of latent neurons is still unknown.</p>

<p>Itchiness triggers a strong urge to engage in scratching behavior, which could lead to severe skin or tissue damage in patients with chronic itch. This process is dynamically modulated. However, the neural mechanisms underlying itch modulation remain largely unknown. Here, we report that dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) play a critical role in modulating itch-induced scratching behavior. We found that the activity of VTA DA neurons was increased during pruritogen-induced scratching behavior in freely moving male mice. Consistently, individual VTA DA neurons mainly exhibited elevated neural activity during itch-induced scratching behavior as demonstrated by <i>in vivo</i> extracellular recording. In behavioral experiments, the transient suppression of VTA DA neurons with the optogenetic approach shortened the pruritogen-induced scratching train. Furthermore, the DA projection from the VTA to the lateral shell of the nucleus accumbens exhibited strong activation as measured with fiber photometry during itch-elicited scratching behavior. These results revealed the dynamic activity of VTA DA neurons during itch processing and demonstrated the modulatory role of the DA system in itch-induced scratching behavior.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Itchiness is an unpleasant sensation that evokes a scratching response for relief. However, the neural mechanism underlying the modulation of itch-evoked scratching in the brain remains elusive. Here, by combining fiber photometry, extracellular recording, and optogenetic manipulation, we show that the dopaminergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area play a modulatory role in itch-evoked scratching behavior. These results reveal a potential target for suppressing excessive scratching responses in patients with chronic itch.</p>

<p>A recently reported rapid potentiation of NMDA receptors by Group I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRIs) via a Homer protein link is distinct from the classical, relatively slow inhibitory G-protein-associated signaling triggered by mGluRI activation. The relationship between these two mechanisms remains unknown. Here, we focused on the mGluRI-dependent modulation of NMDAR response in hippocampal dentate gyrus granule cells and cerebellar granule cells of C57BL6-J mice and found that these two contrasting mechanisms overlap competitively on the time scale from hundreds of milliseconds to seconds, with the net effect depending on the cell type. At a shorter time interval (units of millisecond), the Homer-mediated signal from mGluRIs prevails, causing upregulation of NMDAR function, in both dentate gyrus granule cells and cerebellar granule cells. Our results shed light on the possible mechanisms of anti-schizophrenia drugs that disrupt Homer-containing protein link.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Here we study modulation of NMDA receptors triggered by activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors Group I via two distinct pathways: classical G-protein signaling system and newly discovered high-speed modulatory mechanism associated with Homer-protein-containing direct molecular link. We found that these two contrasting mechanisms overlap competitively on the time scale from hundreds of milliseconds to seconds, with the net effect depending on the cell type. We have also found that both crosstalk mechanisms cause significant changes in synaptic strength and plasticity. Our results resolve an apparent discrepancy between earlier studies that demonstrated contradictive effects of Homer-containing protein link disruption on NMDA receptor signaling. On top of that, our data provide a plausible explanation for unclear action mechanisms of anti-schizophrenia drugs.</p>

<p>Myelin sheath formed by oligodendrocytes (OLs) is essential for the rapid propagation of action potentials in the vertebrate CNS. Myelin regulatory factor (MYRF) is one of the critical factors that control OL differentiation and myelin maintenance. Previous studies showed that MYRF is a membrane-bound transcription factor associated with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). After self-cleavage, the N-fragment of MYRF is released from the ER and translocated into the nucleus where it functions as a transcription factor to activate myelin gene expression. At present, it remains unknown whether MYRF self-cleavage and functional activation can be regulated during OL differentiation. Here, we report that TMEM98, an ER-associated transmembrane protein, is capable of binding to the C-terminal of MYRF and inhibiting its self-cleavage and N-fragment nuclear translocation. In the developing CNS, TMEM98 is selectively expressed in early maturing OLs in mouse pups of either sex. Forced expression of TMEM98 in embryonic chicken spinal cord of either sex suppresses endogenous OL differentiation and MYRF-induced ectopic expression of myelin genes. These results suggest that TMEM98, through inhibiting the self-cleavage of MYRF, functions as a negative feedback regulator of MYRF in oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> MYRF protein is initially synthesized as an ER-associated membrane protein that undergoes autoproteolytic cleavage to release the N-fragment, which is then transported into the nucleus and activates the transcription of myelin genes. To date, the molecular mechanisms that regulate the self-cleavage and function of MYRF in regulating oligodendrocyte differentiation have remained unknown. In this study, we present the molecular and functional evidence that TMEM98 membrane protein physically interacts with MYRF in the ER and subsequently blocks its self-cleavage, N-terminal nuclear translocation, and functional activation of myelin gene expression. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the regulation of MYRF self-proteolytic activity and function by an interacting protein, providing new insights into the molecular regulation of OL differentiation and myelinogenesis.</p>

<p>Neurotransmitter release is triggered by Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through voltage-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (VDCCs). Distinct expression patterns of VDCC subtypes localized on the synaptic terminal affect intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics induced by action potential-triggered Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx. However, it has been unknown whether the expression pattern of VDCC subtypes depends on each axon terminal or neuronal subtype. Furthermore, little information is available on how these VDCC subtypes regulate the release probability of neurotransmitters. To address these questions, we performed multiple whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from GABAergic neurons in the insular cortex of either the male or the female rat. The paired-pulse ratio (PPR; 50 ms interstimulus interval) varied widely among inhibitory connections between GABAergic neurons. The PPR of unitary IPSCs was enhanced by -conotoxin GVIA (CgTx; 3 μm), an N-type VDCC blocker, whereas blockade of P/Q-type VDCCs by -agatoxin IVA (AgTx, 200 nm) decreased the PPR. In the presence of CgTx, application of 4 mm [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> or of roscovitine, a P/Q-type activator, increased the PPR. These results suggest that the recruitment of P/Q-type VDCCs increases the PPR, whereas N-type VDCCs suppress the PPR. Furthermore, we found that charybdotoxin or apamin, blockers of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent K<sup>+</sup> channels, with AgTx increased the PPR, suggesting that Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent K<sup>+</sup> channels are coupled to N-type VDCCs and suppress the PPR in GABAergic neuronal terminals. Variance–mean analysis with changing [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> showed a negative correlation between the PPR and release probability in GABAergic synapses. These results suggest that GABAergic neurons differentially express N-type and/or P/Q-type VDCCs and that these VDCCs regulate the GABA release probability in distinct manners.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> GABAergic neuronal axons target multiple neurons and release GABA triggered by Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx via voltage-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (VDCCs), including N-type and P/Q-type channels. Little is known about VDCC expression patterns in GABAergic synaptic terminals and their role in short-term plasticity. We focused on inhibitory synaptic connections between GABAergic neurons in the cerebral cortex using multiple whole-cell patch-clamp recordings and found different expression patterns of VDCCs in the synaptic terminals branched from a single presynaptic neuron. Furthermore, we observed facilitative and depressive short-term plasticity of IPSCs mediated by P/Q-type and N-type VDCCs, respectively. These results suggest that VDCC expression patterns regulate distinctive types of synaptic transmission in each GABAergic axon terminal even though they are branched from a common presynaptic neuron.</p>

<p>Speech is a critical form of human communication and is central to our daily lives. Yet, despite decades of study, an understanding of the fundamental neural control of speech production remains incomplete. Current theories model speech production as a hierarchy from sentences and phrases down to words, syllables, speech sounds (phonemes), and the actions of vocal tract articulators used to produce speech sounds (articulatory gestures). Here, we investigate the cortical representation of articulatory gestures and phonemes in ventral precentral and inferior frontal gyri in men and women. Our results indicate that ventral precentral cortex represents gestures to a greater extent than phonemes, while inferior frontal cortex represents both gestures and phonemes. These findings suggest that speech production shares a common cortical representation with that of other types of movement, such as arm and hand movements. This has important implications both for our understanding of speech production and for the design of brain–machine interfaces to restore communication to people who cannot speak.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Despite being studied for decades, the production of speech by the brain is not fully understood. In particular, the most elemental parts of speech, speech sounds (phonemes) and the movements of vocal tract articulators used to produce these sounds (articulatory gestures), have both been hypothesized to be encoded in motor cortex. Using direct cortical recordings, we found evidence that primary motor and premotor cortices represent gestures to a greater extent than phonemes. Inferior frontal cortex (part of Broca's area) appears to represent both gestures and phonemes. These findings suggest that speech production shares a similar cortical organizational structure with the movement of other body parts.</p>

<p>The neuromodulatory effects of GABA on pyramidal neurons are mediated by GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors (GABA<sub>B</sub>Rs) that signal via a conserved G-protein-coupled pathway. Two prominent effectors regulated by GABA<sub>B</sub>Rs include G-protein inwardly rectifying K<sup>+</sup> (GIRK) and P/Q/N type voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> (Ca<sub>V</sub>2) ion channels that control excitability and synaptic output of these neurons, respectively. Regulator of G-protein signaling 7 (RGS7) has been shown to control GABA<sub>B</sub> effects, yet the specificity of its impacts on effector channels and underlying molecular mechanisms is poorly understood. In this study, we show that hippocampal RGS7 forms two distinct complexes with alternative subunit configuration bound to either membrane protein R7BP (RGS7 binding protein) or orphan receptor GPR158. Quantitative biochemical experiments show that both complexes account for targeting nearly the entire pool of RGS7 to the plasma membrane. We analyzed the effect of genetic elimination in mice of both sexes and overexpression of various components of RGS7 complex by patch-clamp electrophysiology in cultured neurons and brain slices. We report that RGS7 prominently regulates GABA<sub>B</sub>R signaling to Ca<sub>V</sub>2, in addition to its known involvement in modulating GIRK. Strikingly, only complexes containing R7BP, but not GPR158, accelerated the kinetics of both GIRK and Ca<sub>V</sub>2 modulation by GABA<sub>B</sub>Rs. In contrast, GPR158 overexpression exerted the opposite effect and inhibited RGS7-assisted temporal modulation of GIRK and Ca<sub>V</sub>2 by GABA. Collectively, our data reveal mechanisms by which distinctly composed macromolecular complexes modulate the activity of key ion channels that mediate the inhibitory effects of GABA on hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> This study identifies the contributions of distinct macromolecular complexes containing a major G-protein regulator to controlling key ion channel function in hippocampal neurons with implications for understanding molecular mechanisms underlying synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory.</p>

Abstract<p>Light-sheet microscopy (LSM) has proven a useful tool in neuroscience to image whole brains with high frame rates at cellular resolution, and, in combination with tissue clearing methods, is often employed to reconstruct the cyto-architecture over the intact mouse brain. Inherently to LSM, however, residual opaque objects, always present to some extent even in extremely well optically cleared samples, cause stripe artifacts, which, in the best case, severely affect image homogeneity and, in the worst case, completely obscure features of interest. Here, demonstrating two example applications in intact optically cleared mouse brains, we report how Bessel beams reduce streaking artifacts and produce high-fidelity structural data for the brain-wide morphology of neuronal and vascular networks. We found that a third of the imaged volume of the brain was affected by strong striated image intensity inhomogeneity and, furthermore, a significant amount of information content lost with Gaussian illumination was accessible when interrogated with Bessel beams. In conclusion, Bessel beams produce high-fidelity structural data of improved image homogeneity and might significantly relax demands placed on the automated tools to count, trace or segment fluorescent features of interest.</p><p><b>Significance statement</b> The standard way to measure neuronal structure in light-sheet microscopy applies Gaussian beams, a method prone to artifacts introduced by residual opaque objects present even in extremely well optically cleared samples. These objects cause streaky shadows, which severely affect image homogeneity and, furthermore, obscure features of interest. In measurements using Bessel beam illumination, however, high-fidelity imaging of micro-anatomical detail is restored. Since whole mouse brain data sets now routinely comprise several terabytes, automated tools to count, trace or segment features of interest are needed to extract meaningful insights. This is why high-fidelity structural imaging has the potential to relax computational demands on the algorithms used to turn data into knowledge.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25370?af=R">Homozygous splicing mutation in NUP133 causes Galloway–Mowat syndrome</a></h4>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Galloway–Mowat syndrome (GAMOS) is a neural and renal disorder, characterized by microcephaly, brain anomalies, and early‐onset nephrotic syndrome. Biallelic mutations in <i>WDR73</i> and the four subunit genes of the KEOPS complex are reported to cause GAMOS. Furthermore, an identical homozygous <i>NUP107</i> (nucleoporin 107 kDa) mutation was identified in four GAMOS‐like families, although biallelic <i>NUP107</i> mutations were originally identified in steroid‐resistant nephrotic syndrome. NUP107 and NUP133 (nucleoporin 133 kDa) are interacting subunits of the nuclear pore complex in the nuclear envelope during interphase, and these proteins are also involved in centrosome positioning and spindle assembly during mitosis.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Linkage analysis and whole exome sequencing were performed in a previously reported GAMOS family with brain atrophy and steroid‐resistant nephrotic syndrome.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We identified a homozygous <i>NUP133</i> mutation, c.3335‐11T&gt;A, which results in the insertion of 9 bp of intronic sequence between exons 25 and 26 in the mutant transcript. NUP133 and NUP107 interaction was impaired by the <i>NUP133</i> mutation based on an immunoprecipitation assay. Importantly, focal cortical dysplasia type IIa was recognized in the brain of an autopsied patient and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis was confirmed in the kidneys of the three examined patients. A <i>nup133</i>‐knockdown zebrafish model exhibited microcephaly, fewer neuronal cells, underdeveloped glomeruli, and fusion of the foot processes of the podocytes, which mimicked human GAMOS features. <i>nup133</i> morphants could be rescued by human wildtype <i>NUP133</i> mRNA but not by mutant mRNA.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>These data indicate that the biallelic <i>NUP133</i> loss‐of‐function mutation causes GAMOS.</p>

<p>A class of spiking neuronal models with threshold 2 is considered. It is
defined by a set of conditions typical for basic threshold-type models, such as
the leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) or the binding neuron model and also for
some artificial neurons. A neuron is stimulated with a Poisson stream of
excitatory impulses. Each output impulse is conveyed through the feedback line
to the neuron input after finite delay $\Delta$. This impulse is identical to
those delivered from the input stream. We have obtained a general relation
allowing calculating exactly the probability density function (pdf) $p(t)$ of
output interspike intervals (ISI) values for a neuron with feedback based on
known pdf $p^0(t)$ for the same neuron without feedback, intensity of the input
stream $\lambda$ and the properties of the feedback line. Also, we derive the
exact relation for calculating the moments of $p(t)$ based on known moments of
$p^0(t)$.
</p>
<p>The obtained general expression for $p(t)$ is checked numerically using Monte
Carlo simulation for the case of LIF model. The course of $p(t)$ has a
$\delta$-function type peculiarity. This fact contributes to the discussion
about the possibility to model neuronal activity with Poisson process,
supporting the 'no' answer.

<p>In neural networks with identical neurons, the matrix of connection weights
completely describes the network structure and thereby determines how it is
processing information. However, due to the non-linearity of these systems, it
is not clear if similar microscopic connection structures also imply similar
functional properties, or if a network is impacted more by macroscopic
structural quantities, such as the ratio of excitatory and inhibitory
connections (balance), or the ratio of non-zero connections (density). To
clarify these questions, we focus on motifs of three binary neurons with
discrete ternary connection strengths, an important class of network building
blocks that can be analyzed exhaustively. We develop new, permutation-invariant
metrics to quantify the structural and functional distance between two given
network motifs. We then use multidimensional scaling to identify and visualize
clusters of motifs with similar structural and functional properties. Our
comprehensive analysis reveals that the function of a neural network is only
weakly correlated with its microscopic structure, but depends strongly on the
balance of the connections.

<p>Automated methods for Alzheimer's disease (AD) classification have the
potential for great clinical benefits and may provide insight for combating the
disease. Machine learning, and more specifically deep neural networks, have
been shown to have great efficacy in this domain. These algorithms often use
neurological imaging data such as MRI and PET, but a comprehensive and balanced
comparison of these modalities has not been performed. In order to accurately
determine the relative strength of each imaging variant, this work performs a
comparison study in the context of Alzheimer's dementia classification using
the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset. Furthermore,
this work analyzes the benefits of using both modalities in a fusion setting
and discusses how these data types may be leveraged in future AD studies using
deep learning.

<p>Background: While there has been abundant research concerning neurological
responses to gesture generation, the time course of gesture processing is not
well understood. Specifically, it is not clear if or how particular
characteristics within the kinematic execution of gestures capture attention
and aid in the classification of gestures with communicative intent. If indeed
key features of gestures with perceptual saliency exist, such features could
help form the basis of a compact representation of the gestures in memory.
Methods: This study used a set of available gesture videos as stimuli. The
timing for salient features of performed gestures was determined by isolating
inflection points in the hands' motion trajectories. Participants passively
viewed the gesture videos while continuous EEG data was collected. We focused
on mu oscillations (10 Hz) and used linear regression to test for associations
between the timing of mu oscillations and inflection points in motion
trajectories. Results: Peaks in the EEG signals at central and occipital
electrodes were used to isolate the salient events within each gesture. EEG
power oscillations were detected 343 and 400ms on average after inflection
points at occipital and central electrodes, respectively. A regression model
showed that inflection points in the motion trajectories strongly predicted
subsequent mu oscillations (R^2=0.961, p&lt;.01). Conclusion: The results suggest
that coordinated activity in the visual and motor cortices are highly
correlated with key motion components within gesture trajectories. These points
may be associated with neural signatures used to encode gestures in memory for
later identification and even recognition.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/41115">High resolution mapping of fluoroquinolones in TB rabbit lesions reveals specific distribution in immune cell types</a></h4>

Understanding the distribution patterns of antibiotics at the site of infection is paramount to selecting adequate drug regimens and developing new antibiotics. Tuberculosis (TB) lung lesions are made of various immune cell types, some of which harbor persistent forms of the pathogen, <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i>. By combining high resolution MALDI MSI with histology staining and quantitative image analysis in rabbits with active TB, we have mapped the distribution of a fluoroquinolone at high resolution, and identified the immune-pathological factors driving its heterogeneous penetration within TB lesions, in relation to where bacteria reside. We find that macrophage content, distance from lesion border and extent of necrosis drive the uneven fluoroquinolone penetration. Preferential uptake in macrophages and foamy macrophages, where persistent bacilli reside, compared to other immune cells present in TB granulomas, was recapitulated in vitro using primary human cells. A nonlinear modeling approach was developed to help predict the observed drug behavior in TB lesions. This work constitutes a methodological advance for the co-localization of drugs and infectious agents at high spatial resolution in diseased tissues, which can be applied to other diseases with complex immunopathology.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/40675">A whole lifespan mouse multi-tissue DNA methylation clock</a></h4>

Age predictors based on DNA methylation levels at a small set of CpG sites, DNAm clocks, have been developed for humans and extended to several other species. Three currently available versions of mouse DNAm clocks were either created for individual tissues or tuned towards young ages. Here, we constructed a robust multi-tissue age predictor based on 435 CpG sites, which covers the entire mouse lifespan and remains unbiased with respect to any particular age group. It can successfully detect the effects of certain lifespan-modulating interventions on DNAm age as well as the rejuvenation effect related to the transition from fibroblasts to iPSCs. We have carried out comparative analyses of available mouse DNAm clocks, which revealed their broad applicability, but also certain limitations to the use of tissue-specific and multi-tissue age predictors. Together, these tools should help address diverse questions in aging research.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/39640">Shear-induced damped oscillations in an epithelium depend on actomyosin contraction and E-cadherin cell adhesion</a></h4>

Shear forces between cells occur during global changes in multicellular organization during morphogenesis and tissue growth, yet how cells sense shear forces and propagate a response across a tissue is unknown. We found that applying exogenous shear at the midline of an epithelium induced a local, short-term deformation near the shear plane, and a long-term collective oscillatory movement across the epithelium that spread from the shear-plane and gradually dampened. Inhibiting actomyosin contraction or E-cadherin <i>trans</i>-cell adhesion blocked oscillations, whereas stabilizing actin filaments prolonged oscillations. Combining these data with a model of epithelium mechanics supports a mechanism involving the generation of a shear-induced mechanical event at the shear plane which is then relayed across the epithelium by actomyosin contraction linked through E-cadherin. This causes an imbalance of forces in the epithelium, which is gradually dissipated through oscillatory cell movements and actin filament turnover to restore the force balance across the epithelium.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/38550">Decoding hierarchical control of sequential behavior in oscillatory EEG activity</a></h4>

Despite strong theoretical reasons for assuming that abstract representations organize complex action sequences in terms of subplans (chunks) and sequential positions, we lack methods to directly track such content-independent, hierarchical representations in humans. We applied time-resolved, multivariate decoding analysis to the pattern of rhythmic EEG activity that was registered while participants planned and executed individual elements from pre-learned, structured sequences. Across three experiments, the theta and alpha-band activity coded basic elements <i>and</i> abstract control representations, in particular the ordinal position of basic elements, but also the identity and position of chunks. Further, a robust representation of higher-level, chunk identity information was only found in individuals with above-median working memory capacity, potentially providing a neural-level explanation for working-memory differences in sequential performance. Our results suggest that by decoding oscillatory activity we can track how the cognitive system traverses through the states of a hierarchical control structure.

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Clarifying learning-induced synaptic plasticity in hippocampal circuits is critical for understanding hippocampal mechanisms of memory acquisition and storage. Many in vitro studies have demonstrated learning-associated plasticity at hippocampal synapses. However, as a neural basis of memory encoding, the nature of synaptic plasticity underlying hippocampal neuronal responses to memorized stimulation remains elusive. Using in vivo whole-cell recording in anaesthetized adult rats and mice, we investigated synaptic activity of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells (PCs) in response to a flash of visual stimulation as the conditioned stimulus (CS) in associative fear conditioning. We found that shortly (&lt;3 days) after conditioning, excitatory synaptic responses and spiking responses to the flash CS emerged in a large number (~70%) of CA1 PCs, a neuronal population previously unresponsive to the flash before conditioning. The learning-induced CA1 excitatory responsiveness was further indicated to result from postsynaptic unsilencing at flash-associated silent synapses, with NMDA receptor-gated responses we recently reported in naive animals. Our findings suggest that associative fear learning can induce excitatory responsiveness to the memorized CS in a large population of CA1 neurons, via a process of postsynaptic unsilencing at CA1 silent synapses, which may be critical for hippocampal acquisition and storage of associative memory.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The characterization of the functional significance of interindividual variation in brain morphometry is a core aim of cognitive neuroscience. Prior research has focused on interindividual variation at the level of regional brain measures thus overlooking the fact that each individual brain is a person-specific ensemble of interdependent regions. To expand this line of inquiry we introduce the person-based similarity index (PBSI) for brain morphometry. The conceptual unit of the PBSI is the individual person’s brain structural profile which considers all relevant morphometric measures as features of a single vector. In 2 independent cohorts (total of 1756 healthy participants), we demonstrate the foundational validity of this approach by affirming that the PBSI scores for subcortical volume and cortical thickness in healthy individuals differ between men and women, are heritable, and robust to variation in neuroimaging parameters, sample composition, and regional brain morphometry. Moreover, the PBSI scores correlate with age, body mass index, and fluid intelligence. Collectively, these results suggest that the person-based measures of brain morphometry are biologically and functionally meaningful and have the potential to advance the study of human variation in multivariate brain imaging phenotypes in healthy and clinical populations.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Adolescence is marked by increased vulnerability to mental disorders and maladaptive behaviors, including anorexia nervosa. Food-restriction (FR) stress evokes foraging, which translates to increased wheel running exercise (EX) for caged rodents, a maladaptive behavior, since it does not improve food access and exacerbates weight loss. While almost all adolescent rodents increase EX following FR, some then become resilient by suppressing EX by the second–fourth FR day, which minimizes weight loss. We asked whether GABAergic plasticity in the hippocampus may underlie this gain in resilience. In vitro slice physiology revealed doubling of pyramidal neurons’ GABA response in the dorsal hippocampus of food-restricted animals with wheel access (FR + EX for 4 days), but without increase of mIPSC amplitudes. mIPSC frequency increased by 46%, but electron microscopy revealed no increase in axosomatic GABAergic synapse number onto pyramidal cells and only a modest increase (26%) of GABAergic synapse lengths. These changes suggest increase of vesicular release probability and extrasynaptic GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors and unsilencing of GABAergic synapses. GABAergic synapse lengths correlated with individual’s suppression of wheel running and weight loss. These analyses indicate that EX can have dual roles—exacerbate weight loss but also promote resilience to some by dampening hippocampal excitability.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The human brain undergoes dramatic structural changes during childhood that co-occur with behavioral development.

<p>by Marie Levakova, Lubomir Kostal, Christelle Monsempès, Vincent Jacob, Philippe Lucas</p>

The efficient coding hypothesis predicts that sensory neurons adjust their coding resources to optimally represent the stimulus statistics of their environment. To test this prediction in the moth olfactory system, we have developed a stimulation protocol that mimics the natural temporal structure within a turbulent pheromone plume. We report that responses of antennal olfactory receptor neurons to pheromone encounters follow the temporal fluctuations in such a way that the most frequent stimulus timescales are encoded with maximum accuracy. We also observe that the average coding precision of the neurons adjusted to the stimulus-timescale statistics at a given distance from the pheromone source is higher than if the same encoding model is applied at a shorter, non-matching, distance. Finally, the coding accuracy profile and the stimulus-timescale distribution are related in the manner predicted by the information theory for the many-to-one convergence scenario of the moth peripheral sensory system.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/T3ETnhHC120" width="1" />

<p>by William T. Adler, Wei Ji Ma</p>

Humans can meaningfully report their confidence in a perceptual or cognitive decision. It is widely believed that these reports reflect the Bayesian probability that the decision is correct, but this hypothesis has not been rigorously tested against non-Bayesian alternatives. We use two perceptual categorization tasks in which Bayesian confidence reporting requires subjects to take sensory uncertainty into account in a specific way. We find that subjects do take sensory uncertainty into account when reporting confidence, suggesting that brain areas involved in reporting confidence can access low-level representations of sensory uncertainty, a prerequisite of Bayesian inference. However, behavior is not fully consistent with the Bayesian hypothesis and is better described by simple heuristic models that use uncertainty in a non-Bayesian way. Both conclusions are robust to changes in the uncertainty manipulation, task, response modality, model comparison metric, and additional flexibility in the Bayesian model. Our results suggest that adhering to a rational account of confidence behavior may require incorporating implementational constraints.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/k1ezyXe_qUo" width="1" />

<p>by Erik M. Volz, Igor Siveroni</p>

Population genetic modeling can enhance Bayesian phylogenetic inference by providing a realistic prior on the distribution of branch lengths and times of common ancestry. The parameters of a population genetic model may also have intrinsic importance, and simultaneous estimation of a phylogeny and model parameters has enabled phylodynamic inference of population growth rates, reproduction numbers, and effective population size through time. Phylodynamic inference based on pathogen genetic sequence data has emerged as useful supplement to epidemic surveillance, however commonly-used mechanistic models that are typically fitted to non-genetic surveillance data are rarely fitted to pathogen genetic data due to a dearth of software tools, and the theory required to conduct such inference has been developed only recently. We present a framework for coalescent-based phylogenetic and phylodynamic inference which enables highly-flexible modeling of demographic and epidemiological processes. This approach builds upon previous structured coalescent approaches and includes enhancements for computational speed, accuracy, and stability. A flexible markup language is described for translating parametric demographic or epidemiological models into a structured coalescent model enabling simultaneous estimation of demographic or epidemiological parameters and time-scaled phylogenies. We demonstrate the utility of these approaches by fitting compartmental epidemiological models to Ebola virus and Influenza A virus sequence data, demonstrating how important features of these epidemics, such as the reproduction number and epidemic curves, can be gleaned from genetic data. These approaches are provided as an open-source package <i>PhyDyn</i> for the BEAST2 phylogenetics platform.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/KBwoD24QGeY" width="1" />

<p>by Anne-Florence Bitbol</p>

Functional protein-protein interactions are crucial in most cellular processes. They enable multi-protein complexes to assemble and to remain stable, and they allow signal transduction in various pathways. Functional interactions between proteins result in coevolution between the interacting partners, and thus in correlations between their sequences. Pairwise maximum-entropy based models have enabled successful inference of pairs of amino-acid residues that are in contact in the three-dimensional structure of multi-protein complexes, starting from the correlations in the sequence data of known interaction partners. Recently, algorithms inspired by these methods have been developed to identify which proteins are functional interaction partners among the paralogous proteins of two families, starting from sequence data alone. Here, we demonstrate that a slightly higher performance for partner identification can be reached by an approximate maximization of the mutual information between the sequence alignments of the two protein families. Our mutual information-based method also provides signatures of the existence of interactions between protein families. These results stand in contrast with structure prediction of proteins and of multi-protein complexes from sequence data, where pairwise maximum-entropy based global statistical models substantially improve performance compared to mutual information. Our findings entail that the statistical dependences allowing interaction partner prediction from sequence data are not restricted to the residue pairs that are in direct contact at the interface between the partner proteins.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/sTP41XDQ1ZA" width="1" />

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.04698">Topology of the mesoscale connectome of the mouse brain. (arXiv:1811.04698v1 [q-bio.NC])</a></h4>

<p>The wiring diagram of the mouse brain has recently been mapped at a
mesoscopic scale in the Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity Atlas. Axonal
projections from brain regions were traced using green fluoresent proteins. The
resulting data were registered to a common three-dimensional reference space.
They yielded a matrix of connection strengths between 213 brain regions. Global
features such as closed loops formed by connections of similar intensity can be
inferred using tools from persistent homology. We map the wiring diagram of the
mouse brain to a simplicial complex (filtered by connection strengths). We work
out generators of the first homology group. Some regions, including nucleus
accumbens, are connected to the entire brain by loops, whereas no region has
non-zero connection strength to all brain regions. Thousands of loops go
through the isocortex, the striatum and the thalamus. On the other hand,
medulla is the only major brain compartment that contains more than 100 loops.

<p>Evidence suggests Rapid-Eye-Movement (REM) Sleep Behaviour Disorder (RBD) is
an early predictor of Parkinson's disease. This study proposes a
fully-automated framework for RBD detection consisting of automated sleep
staging followed by RBD identification. Analysis was assessed using a limited
polysomnography montage from 53 participants with RBD and 53 age-matched
healthy controls. Sleep stage classification was achieved using a Random Forest
(RF) classifier and 156 features extracted from electroencephalogram (EEG),
electrooculogram (EOG) and electromyogram (EMG) channels. For RBD detection, a
RF classifier was trained combining established techniques to quantify muscle
atonia with additional features that incorporate sleep architecture and the EMG
fractal exponent. Automated multi-state sleep staging achieved a 0.62 Cohen's
Kappa score. RBD detection accuracy improved by 10% to 96% (compared to
individual established metrics) when using manually annotated sleep staging.
Accuracy remained high (92%) when using automated sleep staging. This study
outperforms established metrics and demonstrates that incorporating sleep
architecture and sleep stage transitions can benefit RBD detection. This study
also achieved automated sleep staging with a level of accuracy comparable to
manual annotation. This study validates a tractable, fully-automated, and
sensitive pipeline for RBD identification that could be translated to wearable
take-home technology.

<p>The ubiquity of topographic maps in the brain has long been known, and
molecular mechanisms for the formation of topographic organization of neural
systems have been revealed. Less attention has been given to the question of
why are the maps topographical and why so ubiquitous. In this study, I explore
the implications of the topographic maps for brain function, by employing the
mathematical framework of the Zeeman topology. I propose the notion about the
meaning of topographic order as generic mechanisms for the representation and
analysis of causal structure, implemented by the neural systems. This leads to
a much improved understanding of the division of labour between chemical
systems and neural systems in the formation of maps to deal with causality.

<p>Identifying community structure of a complex network provides insight to the
interdependence between the network topology and emergent collective behaviors
of networks, while detecting such invariant communities in a time-varying
network is more challenging. In this paper, we define the temporal stable
community and newly propose the concept of dynamic modularity to evaluate the
stable community structures in time-varying networks, which is robust against
small changes as verified by several empirical time-varying network datasets.
Besides, using the volatility features of temporal stable communities in
functional brain networks, we successfully differentiate the ADHD (Attention
Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder) patients and healthy controls efficiently.

<p>Convergent thought is defined and measured in terms of the ability to perform
on tasks where there is a single correct solution, and divergent thought is
defined and measured in terms of the ability to generate multiple different
solutions. However, this characterization of them presents inconsistencies, and
despite that they are promoted as key constructs of creativity, they do not
capture the capacity to reiteratively modify an idea in light of new
perspectives arising out of an overarching conceptual framework. Research on
formal models of concepts and their interactions suggests that different
creative outputs may be projections of the same underlying idea at different
phases of this kind of 'honing' process. This leads us to redefine convergent
thought as thought in which the relevant concepts are considered from
conventional contexts, and divergent thought as thought in which they are
considered from unconventional contexts. Implications for the assessment of
creativity are discussed.

<p>Biomarkers of Major Depressive Disorder(MDD), its phases and forms have long
been sought. Research indicates that the complexity measures of the cortical
electrical activity (EEG) might be candidates for this role. To examine whether
the complexity of EEG activity, measured by Higuchi fractal dimension (HFD) and
sample entropy (SampEn), differs between healthy subjects, patients in
remission and episode phase of the recurrent depression and whether the changes
are differentially distributed between hemispheres and cortical regions.
Resting state EEG with eyes closed was recorded from 26 patients suffering from
recurrent depression and 20 age and sex-matched healthy control subjects.
Artefact-free EEG epochs were analyzed by in-house developed programs running
HFD and SampEn algorithms. Depressed patients had higher HFD and SampEn
complexity compared to healthy subjects. Surprisingly, the complexity was even
higher in patients who were in remission than in those in the episode. Altered
complexity was present in the frontal and centro-parietal regions when compared
to the control group. The complexity in frontal and parietal regions differed
between the two phases of depressive disorder. SampEn manifested higher
sensitivity than HFD in some cortical areas. Complexity measures of EEG
distinguish between the three groups. Further studies are needed to establish
whether these measures carry the potential to aid clinically relevant decisions
about depression.

<p>A novel non-stationarity visualization tool known as StationPlot is developed
for deciphering the chaotic behavior of a dynamical time series. A family of
analytic measures enumerating geometrical aspects of the non-stationarity &amp;
degree of variability is formulated by convex hull geometry (CHG) on

difference-stationary (DS) perturbations are comprehended by the asymmetric
structure of StationPlot's region of interest (ROI). The proposed method is
experimentally validated using EEG signals, where it comprehend the relative
temporal evolution of neural dynamics &amp; its non-stationary morphology, thereby
exemplifying its diagnostic competence for seizure activity (SA) detection.
Experimental results &amp; analysis-of-Variance (ANOVA) on the extracted CHG

<p>by Laura Anton-Sanchez, Felix Effenberger, Concha Bielza, Pedro Larrañaga, Hermann Cuntz</p>

Neurons collect their inputs from other neurons by sending out arborized dendritic structures. However, the relationship between the shape of dendrites and the precise organization of synaptic inputs in the neural tissue remains unclear. Inputs could be distributed in tight clusters, entirely randomly or else in a regular grid-like manner. Here, we analyze dendritic branching structures using a regularity index <i>R</i>, based on average nearest neighbor distances between branch and termination points, characterizing their spatial distribution. We find that the distributions of these points depend strongly on cell types, indicating possible fundamental differences in synaptic input organization. Moreover, <i>R</i> is independent of cell size and we find that it is only weakly correlated with other branching statistics, suggesting that it might reflect features of dendritic morphology that are not captured by commonly studied branching statistics. We then use morphological models based on optimal wiring principles to study the relation between input distributions and dendritic branching structures. Using our models, we find that branch point distributions correlate more closely with the input distributions while termination points in dendrites are generally spread out more randomly with a close to uniform distribution. We validate these model predictions with connectome data. Finally, we find that in spatial input distributions with increasing regularity, characteristic scaling relationships between branching features are altered significantly. In summary, we conclude that local statistics of input distributions and dendrite morphology depend on each other leading to potentially cell type specific branching features.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ori6Lo6m244" width="1" />

<p>by James A. Henderson, Pulin Gong</p>

Diverse plasticity mechanisms are orchestrated to shape the spatiotemporal dynamics underlying brain functions. However, why these plasticity rules emerge and how their dynamics interact with neural activity to give rise to complex neural circuit dynamics remains largely unknown. Here we show that both Hebbian and homeostatic plasticity rules emerge from a functional perspective of neuronal dynamics whereby each neuron learns to encode its own activity in the population activity, so that the activity of the presynaptic neuron can be decoded from the activity of its postsynaptic neurons. We explain how a range of experimentally observed plasticity phenomena with widely separated time scales emerge from learning this encoding function, including STDP and its frequency dependence, and metaplasticity. We show that when implemented in neural circuits, these plasticity rules naturally give rise to essential neural response properties, including variable neural dynamics with balanced excitation and inhibition, and approximately log-normal distributions of synaptic strengths, while simultaneously encoding a complex real-world visual stimulus. These findings establish a novel function-based account of diverse plasticity mechanisms, providing a unifying framework relating plasticity, dynamics and neural computation.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/4hnBgLInEwc" width="1" />

<p>by Stefano Giaimo, Jordi Arranz, Arne Traulsen</p>

Population structure can strongly affect evolutionary dynamics. The most general way to describe population structures are graphs. An important observable on evolutionary graphs is the probability that a novel mutation spreads through the entire population. But what drives this spread of a mutation towards fixation? Here, we propose a novel way to understand the forces driving fixation by borrowing techniques from evolutionary demography to quantify the invasion fitness and the effective population size for different graphs. Our method is very general and even applies to weighted graphs with node dependent fitness. However, we focus on analytical results for undirected graphs with node independent fitness. The method will allow to conceptually integrate evolutionary graph theory with theoretical genetics of structured populations.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/uezjpMD9TOY" width="1" />

Despite advances in experimental techniques and accumulation of large datasets concerning the composition and properties of the cortex, quantitative modeling of cortical circuits under in-vivo-like conditions remains challenging. Here we report and publicly release a biophysically detailed circuit model of layer 4 in the mouse primary visual cortex, receiving thalamo-cortical visual inputs. The 45,000-neuron model was subjected to a battery of visual stimuli, and results were compared to published work and new in vivo experiments. Simulations reproduced a variety of observations, including effects of optogenetic perturbations. Critical to the agreement between responses in silico and in vivo were the rules of functional synaptic connectivity between neurons. Interestingly, after extreme simplification the model still performed satisfactorily on many measurements, although quantitative agreement with experiments suffered. These results emphasize the importance of functional rules of cortical wiring and enable a next generation of data-driven models of in vivo neural activity and computations.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/hU_7d7E5u8Y" width="1" />

<p>by Jason E. Pina, Mark Bodner, Bard Ermentrout</p>

Neural oscillations have been recorded and implicated in many different basic brain and cognitive processes. For example, oscillatory neural activity has been suggested to play a role in binding and in the maintenance of information in working memory. With respect to the latter, the majority of work has focused primarily on oscillations in terms of providing a “code” in working memory. However, oscillations may additionally play a fundamental role by enabling or facilitating essential properties and behaviors that neuronal networks must exhibit in order to produce functional working memory and the processes it supports, such as combining items in memory into bound objects or separating bound objects into distinct items. In the present work, we present a biologically plausible working memory model and demonstrate that specific types of stable oscillatory dynamics that arise may play critical roles in providing mechanisms for working memory and the cognitive functions that it supports. Specifically, these roles include (1) enabling a range of different types of binding, (2) both enabling and limiting capacities of bound and distinct items held active in working memory, and (3) facilitating transitions between active working memory states as required in cognitive function. Several key results arise within the examinations, such as the occurrence of different network capacities for working memory and binding, differences in processing times for transitions in working memory states, and the emergence of a combinatorially rich and complex range of oscillatory states that are sufficient to map onto a wide range of cognitive operations supported by working memory, such as variable binding, reasoning, and language. In particular, we show that these oscillatory states and their transitions can provide a specific instantiation of current established connectionist models in representing these functions. Finally, we further characterize the dependence of the relevant oscillatory solutions on certain critical parameters, including mutual inhibition and synaptic timescales.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/n2vXpNJbJkw" width="1" />

Abstract<p>Neural stem cells hold great promise for neural repair in cases of CNS injury and neurodegeneration, however, conventional cell-based transplant methods face the challenges of poor survival and inadequate neuronal differentiation. Here, we report an alternative, tissue-based transplantation strategy whereby cerebral organoids derived from human pluripotent stem cells were grafted into lesioned mouse cortex. Cerebral organoid transplants exhibited enhanced survival and robust vascularization from host brain as compared to transplants of dissociated neural progenitor cells. Engrafted cerebral organoids harbored a large neural stem cell pool and displayed multilineage neurodifferentiation at two and four week post-grafting. Cerebral organoids therefore represent a promising alternative source to neural stem cells or fetal tissues for transplantation, as they contain a large set of neuroprogenitors and differentiated neurons in a structured organization. Engrafted cerebral organoids may also offer a unique experimental paradigm for modeling human neurodevelopment and CNS diseases in the context of vascularized cortical tissue.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Neural stem cells hold great promise for neural repair, but conventional cell-based transplant methods face the hurdles of poor graft survival and inadequate neural differentiation.

                <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25379?af=R">Clinical outcomes depending on acute blood pressure after cerebral hemorrhage</a></h4>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To determine the association between clinical outcomes and acute systolic blood pressure (SBP) levels achieved after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH).</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Eligible patients who were randomized to the Antihypertensive Treatment in Intracerebral Hemorrhage 2 (ATACH‐2) trial (<a href="http://clinicaltrials.gov" target="_blank" title="Link to external resource">ClinicalTrials.gov</a> NCT01176565) were divided into 5 groups by 10‐mmHg strata of average hourly minimum SBP (&lt;120 mmHg, 120‐130, 130‐140, 140‐150 and ≥150) during 2 to 24 hours after randomization. Outcomes included: 90‐day modified Rankin Scale (mRS) 4‐6; hematoma expansion, defined as an increase ≥6 mL from baseline to 24‐hour computed tomography; and cardio‐renal adverse events within 7 days.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Of the 1,000 subjects in ATACH‐2, 995 with available SBP data were included in the analyses. The proportion of mRS 4‐6 was 37.5%, 36.0%, 42.8%, 38.6%, and 38.0%, respectively. For the ‘140‐150’ group relative to the ‘120‐130’, the odds ratio, adjusting for sex, race, age, onset‐to‐randomization time, baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score, hematoma volume, and hematoma location, was 1.62 (95% confidence interval 1.02‐2.58). Hematoma expansion was identified in 16.9%, 13.7%, 21.4%, 18.5%, and 26.4%, respectively. The ‘140‐150’ (odds ratio 1.80, 95% confidence interval 1.05‐3.09) and ‘≥150’ (1.98, 1.12‐3.51) showed a higher frequency of expansion than ‘120‐130’ group. Cardio‐renal events occurred in 13.6%, 16.6%, 11.5%, 8.1%, and 8.2%, respectively. The ‘140‐150’ (0.43, 0.19‐0.88) and ‘≥150’ (0.44, 0.18‐0.96) showed a lower frequency of the events than the ‘120‐130’.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Beneficial effects of lowering and maintaining SBP at 120‐130 mmHg during the first 24 hours on clinical outcomes by suppressing hematoma expansion was somewhat offset by cardio‐renal complications.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The degree to which Alzheimer's versus other neuropathologies contribute to the risk of Alzheimer's dementia is unknown. We examined the risk of Alzheimer's dementia attributable to pathologic AD and eight other neuropathologies.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Participants (n=1,161) came from two clinical‐pathologic studies of aging. Multivariable logistic regression models examined associations of eight neuropathologic indices with Alzheimer's dementia and quantified the percentage of cases attributable to each. Further, because some dementia cases are not driven by common neuropathologies, we re‐estimated the attributable risks after empirically adjusting for such cases.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Of 1,161 persons, 512 (44.1%) had Alzheimer's dementia at the time of death. With the exception of microinfarcts, all neuropathologic indices were independently associated with greater odds of Alzheimer's dementia. 210 (41.0%) Alzheimer's dementia cases were attributable to pathologic AD. Separately, 8.9% were attributable to macroscopic infarcts, 10.8% to Lewy bodies, 5.2% to hippocampal sclerosis, 11.7% to TDP‐43, 8.1% to CAA, 6.0% to atherosclerosis and 5.2% to arteriolosclerosis. A total of 83.3% of cases were attributable to all eight indices combined. However, after further adjustment for cases driven by other factors, a total of 67.5% of cases were attributable to all eight neuropathologic indices combined.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Pathologic AD accounts for a considerable percentage of Alzheimer's dementia cases, but multiple other neuropathologies also contribute. In total, just over two thirds of Alzheimer's dementia cases are attributable to common age‐related neuropathologies, suggesting that other disease and resilience factors are important.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>In this study we evaluate the role of the thalamus in the neural circuitry of arousal. Level of consciousness within the first 12 hours of a thalamic stroke is assessed with lesion symptom mapping. Impaired arousal correlates with lesions in the paramedian posterior thalamus near the centromedian and parafascicular nuclei, posterior hypothalamus, and midbrain tegmentum. All patients with severely impaired arousal (coma, stupor) had lesion extension into the midbrain and/or pontine tegmentum, whereas purely thalamic lesions did not severely impair arousal. These results are consistent with growing evidence that pathways most critical for human arousal lay outside the thalamus.</p>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Studies of sensory loss are a model for understanding the functional flexibility of human cortex. In congenital blindness, subsets of visual cortex are recruited during higher-cognitive tasks, such as language and math tasks. Is such dramatic functional repurposing possible throughout the lifespan or restricted to sensitive periods in development? We compared visual cortex function in individuals who lost their vision as adults (after age 17) to congenitally blind and sighted blindfolded adults. Participants took part in resting-state and task-based fMRI scans during which they solved math equations of varying difficulty and judged the meanings of sentences. Blindness at any age caused “visual” cortices to synchronize with specific frontoparietal networks at rest. However, in task-based data, visual cortices showed regional specialization for math and language and load-dependent activity only in congenital blindness. Thus, despite the presence of long-range functional connectivity, cognitive repurposing of human cortex is limited by sensitive periods.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Akinesia, a cardinal symptom of Parkinson’s disease, has been linked to abnormal activation in putamen and posterior medial frontal cortex (pMFC). However, little is known whether clinical severity of akinesia is linked to dysfunctional connectivity of these regions. Using a seed-based approach, we here investigated resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) of putamen, pMFC and primary motor cortex (M1) in 60 patients with Parkinson’s disease on regular medication and 72 healthy controls. We found that in patients putamen featured decreases of connectivity for a number of cortical and subcortical areas engaged in sensorimotor and cognitive processing. In contrast, the pMFC showed reduced connectivity with a more focal cortical network involved in higher-level motor-cognition. Finally, M1 featured a selective disruption of connectivity in a network specifically connected with M1. Correlating clinical impairment with connectivity changes revealed a relationship between akinesia and reduced RSFC between pMFC and left intraparietal lobule (IPL). Together, the present study demonstrated RSFC decreases in networks for motor initiation and execution in Parkinson’s disease. Moreover, results suggest a relationship between pMFC-IPL decoupling and the manifestation of akinetic symptoms.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The first voxel-level resting-state functional connectivity (FC) neuroimaging analysis of depression of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) showed in 282 patients with major depressive disorder compared with 254 controls, some higher, and some lower FCs. However, in 125 unmedicated patients, primarily increases of FC were found: of the subcallosal anterior cingulate with the lateral orbitofrontal cortex, of the pregenual/supracallosal anterior cingulate with the medial orbitofrontal cortex, and of parts of the anterior cingulate with the inferior frontal gyrus, superior parietal lobule, and with early cortical visual areas. In the 157 medicated patients, these and other FCs were lower than in the unmedicated group. Parcellation was performed based on the FC of individual ACC voxels in healthy controls. A pregenual subdivision had high FC with medial orbitofrontal cortex areas, and a supracallosal subdivision had high FC with lateral orbitofrontal cortex and inferior frontal gyrus. The high FC in depression between the lateral orbitofrontal cortex and the subcallosal parts of the ACC provides a mechanism for more non-reward information transmission to the ACC, contributing to depression. The high FC between the medial orbitofrontal cortex and supracallosal ACC in depression may also contribute to depressive symptoms.</span>

<p>by Hongyang Li, Xin-Qiu Yao, Barry J. Grant</p>

GTPases regulate a multitude of essential cellular processes ranging from movement and division to differentiation and neuronal activity. These ubiquitous enzymes operate by hydrolyzing GTP to GDP with associated conformational changes that modulate affinity for family-specific binding partners. There are three major GTPase superfamilies: Ras-like GTPases, heterotrimeric G proteins and protein-synthesizing GTPases. Although they contain similar nucleotide-binding sites, the detailed mechanisms by which these structurally and functionally diverse superfamilies operate remain unclear. Here we compare and contrast the structural dynamic mechanisms of each superfamily using extensive molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and subsequent network analysis approaches. In particular, dissection of the cross-correlations of atomic displacements in both the GTP and GDP-bound states of Ras, transducin and elongation factor EF-Tu reveals analogous dynamic features. This includes similar dynamic communities and subdomain structures (termed lobes). For all three proteins the GTP-bound state has stronger couplings between equivalent lobes. Network analysis further identifies common and family-specific residues mediating the state-specific coupling of distal functional sites. Mutational simulations demonstrate how disrupting these couplings leads to distal dynamic effects at the nucleotide-binding site of each family. Collectively our studies extend current understanding of GTPase allosteric mechanisms and highlight previously unappreciated similarities across functionally diverse families.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/L2Q7vnwDhzE" width="1" />

Abstract<p>Oscillations in the brain facilitate neural processing and cognitive functions. This study investigated the dependence of long-term potentiation (LTP), a neural correlate of memory, on the phase of the hippocampal theta rhythm, a prominent brain oscillation. Multichannel field potentials and current source-sinks were analyzed in hippocampal CA1 of adult male rats under urethane anesthesia. A single burst (5 pulses at 200 Hz) stimulation of stratum oriens induced LTP of the basal dendritic excitatory sink, which was maximal when the burst was delivered at ~340<sup>°</sup> and ~160<sup>°</sup> of the distal dendritic theta rhythm. Apical dendritic sink evoked by stratum radiatum stimulation also showed biphasic maxima at ~30<sup>°</sup> and ~210<sup>°</sup> of the distal dendritic theta rhythm, about 50<sup>°</sup> phase delay to basal dendritic LTP. By contrast, maximal population spike excitability, following single-pulse excitation of the basal or mid-apical dendrites, occurred at a theta phase of ~140<sup>°</sup>, and maximal basal dendritic excitatory sink occurred at ~20<sup>°</sup>. Gamma (30-57 Hz) activity recorded in CA1 stratum radiatum had maximal power at ~300<sup>°</sup> of the distal dendritic theta rhythm, different from the phases of maximal LTP. LTP induced during the rising theta phase was N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor sensitive. It is suggested that the theta-phase modulation of CA1 population spike excitability is mainly provided by theta-rhythmic proximal inhibition, while dendritic LTP is also modulated by dendritic inhibition and excitation, specific to basal and apical dendrites. In summary, basal and apical dendritic synaptic plasticity and spike excitability are facilitated at different theta phases in a compartmental fashion.</p><p><b>Significance statement</b> How the hippocampal theta rhythm modulates synaptic plasticity and transmission is not completely known. Here, we showed, for the first time, phase modulation of synaptic plasticity and spike excitability across a complete theta cycle. Using a single burst stimulation to probe long-term potentiation (LTP) in hippocampal CA1, we observed two LTP peaks and a single spike excitability peak in a single theta cycle (360<sup>°</sup>). Basal dendritic LTP led apical dendritic LTP by ~50<sup>°</sup>, and LTP peaks occurred during both low and high spike excitability. This suggests a brain oscillation can optimally process output (spikes) and synaptic plasticity of different dendritic compartments at different phases, possibly resulting from rhythmic somatic and dendritic inhibition and excitation in the network.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Approximately 5% of cerebral small vessel diseases are hereditary, which include <i>COL4A1/COL4A2</i>‐related disorders. <i>COL4A1/COL4A2</i> encode type IV collagen α1/2 chains in the basement membranes of cerebral vessels. <i>COL4A1/COL4A2</i> mutations impair the secretion of collagen to the extracellular matrix, thereby resulting in vessel fragility. The diagnostic yield for <i>COL4A1/COL4A2</i> variants is around 20%–30%, suggesting other mutated genes might be associated with this disease. This study aimed to identify novel genes that cause <i>COL4A1/COL4A2</i>‐related disorders.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Whole exome sequencing was performed in two families with suspected <i>COL4A1/COL4A2</i>‐related disorders. We validated the role of <i>COLGALT1</i> variants by constructing a 3D structural model, evaluating ColGalT1 protein expression and ColGalT activity by western blotting and collagen galactosyltransferase assays, and performing <i>in vitro</i> RNA interference and rescue experiments.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Exome sequencing demonstrated biallelic variants in <i>COLGALT1</i> encoding collagen β (1‐O) galactosyltransferase 1, which was involved in the post‐translational modification of type IV collagen in two unrelated patients: c.452T&gt;G (p.Leu151Arg) and c.1096delG (p.Glu366Argfs*15) in Patient 1, and c.460G&gt;C (p.Ala154Pro) and c.1129G&gt;C (p.Gly377Arg) in Patient 2. 3D model analysis suggested that p.Leu151Arg and p.Ala154Pro destabilized protein folding, which impaired enzymatic activity. ColGalT1 protein expression and ColGalT activity in Patient 1 were undetectable. RNA interference studies demonstrated that reduced ColGalT1 altered COL4A1 secretion, and rescue experiments showed that mutant <i>COLGALT1</i> insufficiently restored COL4A1 production in cells compared with wild‐type.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Biallelic <i>COLGALT1</i> variants cause cerebral small vessel abnormalities through a common molecular pathogenesis with <i>COL4A1/COL4A2</i>‐related disorders.</p>

<p>Many plants, such as Mimosa pudica (the sensitive plant), employ
electrochemical signals known as action potentials (APs) for rapid
intercellular communication. In this paper, we consider a reaction diffusion
model of individual AP signals to analyze APs from a communication and
information theoretic perspective. We use concepts from molecular communication
to explain the underlying process of information transfer in a plant for a
single AP pulse that is shared with one or more receiver cells. We also use the
chemical Langevin equation to accommodate the deterministic as well as
stochastic component of the system. Finally we present an information theoretic
analysis of single action potentials, obtaining achievable information rates
for these signals. We show that, in general, the presence of an AP signal can
increase the mutual information and information propagation speed among
neighboring cells with receivers in different settings.

<p>We propose a biologically-inspired research agenda with parallel tracks aimed
at AI and AI safety. The bottom-up component consists of building a sequence of
biophysically realistic simulations of simple organisms such as the nematode
Caenorhabditis elegans, the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, and the
zebrafish Danio rerio to serve as platforms for research into AI algorithms and
system architectures. The top-down component consists of an approach to value
alignment that grounds AI goal structures in neuropsychology. Our belief is
that parallel pursuit of these tracks will inform the development of
value-aligned AI systems that have been inspired by embodied organisms with
sensorimotor integration. An important set of side benefits is that the
research trajectories we describe here are grounded in long-standing
intellectual traditions within existing research communities and funding
structures. In addition, these research programs overlap with significant
contemporary themes in the biological and psychological sciences such as
data/model integration and reproducibility.

<p>by Michael Muthukrishna, Michael Doebeli, Maciej Chudek, Joseph Henrich</p>

In the last few million years, the hominin brain more than tripled in size. Comparisons across evolutionary lineages suggest that this expansion may be part of a broader trend toward larger, more complex brains in many taxa. Efforts to understand the evolutionary forces driving brain expansion have focused on climatic, ecological, and social factors. Here, building on existing research on learning, we analytically and computationally model the predictions of two closely related hypotheses: The Cultural Brain Hypothesis and the Cumulative Cultural Brain Hypothesis. The Cultural Brain Hypothesis posits that brains have been selected for their ability to store and manage information, acquired through asocial or social learning. The model of the Cultural Brain Hypothesis reveals relationships between brain size, group size, innovation, social learning, mating structures, and the length of the juvenile period that are supported by the existing empirical literature. From this model, we derive a set of predictions—the Cumulative Cultural Brain Hypothesis—for the conditions that favor an autocatalytic take-off characteristic of human evolution. This narrow evolutionary pathway, created by cumulative cultural evolution, may help explain the rapid expansion of human brains and other aspects of our species’ life history and psychology.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/D8JG9Z49BUk" width="1" />

<p>Etiologic diagnosis is uncertain in 35% to 50% of patients with encephalitis, despite its substantial global prevalence and disease burden. We report on 2 adult female patients with fatal leukoencephalitis associated with human pegivirus‐1 (HPgV‐1) brain infection. Neuroimaging showed inflammatory changes in cerebral white matter. Brain‐derived HPgV‐1 RNA sequences clustered phylogenetically with other pegiviruses despite an 87‐nucleotide deletion in the viral nonstructural (NS)2 gene. Neuropathology disclosed lymphocyte infiltration and gliosis predominantly in brain white matter. HPgV‐1 NS5A antigen was detected in lymphocytes as well as in astrocytes and oligodendrocytes.

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Several small case series identified <i>KCTD7</i> mutations in patients with a rare autosomal recessive disorder designated progressive myoclonic epilepsy (EPM3) and neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (CLN14). Despite the name KCTD (potassium channel tetramerization domain), KCTD protein family members lack predicted channel domains. We sought to translate insight gained from yeast studies to uncover disease mechanisms associated with deficiencies in KCTD7 of unknown function.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Novel <i>KCTD7</i> variants in new and published patients were assessed for disease causality using genetic analyses, cell‐based functional assays of patient fibroblasts and knockout yeast, and electron microscopy of patient samples.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Patients with <i>KCTD7</i> mutations can exhibit movement disorders or developmental regression before seizure onset, and are distinguished from similar disorders by an earlier age of onset. Although most published <i>KCTD7</i> patient variants were excluded from a genome sequence database of normal human variations, most newly identified patient variants are present in this database, potentially challenging disease causality. However, genetic analysis and impaired biochemical interactions with cullin 3 support a causal role for patient <i>KCTD7</i> variants, suggesting deleterious alleles of <i>KCTD7</i> and other rare disease variants may be underestimated. Both patient‐derived fibroblasts and yeast lacking Whi2 with sequence similarity to KCTD7 have impaired autophagy consistent with brain pathology.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Biallelic <i>KCTD7</i> mutations define a neurodegenerative disorder with lipofuscin and lipid droplet accumulation but without defining features of neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis or lysosomal storage disorders. <i>KCTD7</i> deficiency appears to cause an underlying autophagy‐lysosome defect conserved in yeast, thereby assigning a biological role for KCTD7.

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Newer MRI techniques have shown promise in capturing early Parkinson's disease (PD)‐related changes in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc), the key pathological loci. Their translational value, however, is hindered by technical complexity and inconsistent results.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>A novel yet simple MRI contrast, the T1w/T2w ratio, was used to study 76 PD patients and 70 controls. The T1w/T2w ratio maps were analyzed using both voxel‐based and region‐of‐interest approaches in normalized space. The sensitivity and specificity of the SN T1w/T2w ratio in discriminating between PD and controls also were assessed. In addition, its diagnostic performance was tested in a subgroup of PD patients with disease duration ≤2 years (PDE). A second independent cohort of 73 PD and 49 controls was used for validation.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Compared to controls, PD patients showed a higher T1w/T2w ratio in both the right (cluster size=164 mm<sup>3</sup>, p&lt;0.0001) and left (cluster size=213 mm<sup>3</sup>, p&lt;0.0001) midbrain that was located ventrolateral to the red nucleus and corresponded to the SNc. The region‐of‐interest approach confirmed the group difference in the SNc T1w/T2w ratio between PD and controls (p&lt;0.0001). The SNc T1w/T2w ratio had high sensitivity (0.908) and specificity (0.80) to separate PD and controls (AUC=0.926), even for PDE patients (AUC=0.901, sensitivity=0.857, specificity=0.857). These results were validated in the second cohort.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The T1w/T2w ratio can detect PD‐related changes in the SN and may be used as a novel, parsimonious <i>in vivo</i> biomarker for the disease, particularly early stage patients, with high translational value for clinical practice and research.</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Despite bioequivalence, the exchangeability of antiepileptic drugs in clinical settings is disputed. Therefore, we investigated the risk for recurrent seizures after switching the manufacturer of the same drug in a large German cohort.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Anonymous patient data from practice neurologists throughout Germany between 2011 and 2016 were collected using the IMS Disease Analyzer database (QuintilesIMS, Frankfurt, Germany). People with epilepsy were included if at least 2 prescriptions within 360 days and 1 within 180 days prior to the index date were available. The cohort was separated into a seizure group and seizure‐free controls. Both groups were matched 1:1 according to age, gender, insurance status, and treating physician. The risk for breakthrough seizures after a manufacturer switch of the same antiepileptic drug was analyzed using multivariate regression models.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 3,530 people with epilepsy were included (each group, n = 1,765; age = 53.7 ± 19.8 years). Patients with seizures had switched the drug manufacturer more often than controls (26.8% vs 14.2%; odds ratio [OR] = 1.35, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.08–1.69, <i>p</i> = 0.009), both from branded to generic (5.5% vs 2.4%; OR = 1.85, 95% CI = 1.30–2.64, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and between generic drugs (14.7% vs 7.1%; OR = 1.45, 95% CI = 1.13–1.87, <i>p</i> = 0.004).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>In previously seizure‐free patients, switching the manufacturer of antiepileptic medications was associated with a higher risk for seizure recurrence. Our retrospective approach does not allow us to determine whether other changes in medical care at the same time could contribute to the recurrence. However, it would be prudent to avoid switching the manufacturer of anticonvulsants in seizure‐free patients. Ann Neurol 2018</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>We investigated the therapeutic potential of the interleukin‐6 receptor inhibitor tocilizumab in 7 patients with new‐onset refractory status epilepticus (NORSE) who remained refractory to conventional immunotherapy with rituximab (n=5) or without rituximab (n=2). Status epilepticus (SE) was terminated after 1‐2 doses of tocilizumab in six patients with a median interval of three days from the initiation. They had no recurrence of SE during the observation. However, two patients experienced severe adverse events related to infection during the tocilizumab therapy. Further prospective controlled studies are warranted to validate the efficacy and safety of tocilizumab in patients with NORSE.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Adjuvant protocols devised to enhance motor recovery in subacute stroke patients have failed to show benefits with respect to classic therapeutic interventions. Here we evaluate the efficacy of a novel brain‐state dependent intervention based on known mechanisms of memory and learning, that is integrated as part of the weekly rehabilitation program in subacute stroke patients.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Twenty‐four hospitalized subacute stroke patients were randomly assigned to two intervention groups; 1. The associative group received thirty pairings of a peripheral electrical nerve stimulus (ES) such that the generated afferent volley arrived precisely during the most active phase of the motor cortex as patients attempted to perform a movement; 2. In the control group the ES intensity was too low to generate a stimulation of the nerve. Functional (including the lower extremity Fugl‐Meyer assessment (LE‐FM; primary outcome measure)) and neurophysiological (changes in motor evoked potentials (MEPs)) assessments were performed prior to and following the intervention period.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The associative group significantly improved functional recovery with respect to the control group (median (interquartile range) LE‐FM improvement: 6.5 (3.5‐8.25) and 3 (0.75‐3), respectively; <i>p</i>=0.029). Significant increases in MEP amplitude were seen following all sessions in the associative group only (<i>p</i>’s≤0.006).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This is the first evidence of a clinical effect of a neuromodulatory intervention in the subacute phase of stroke. This was evident with relatively few repetitions in comparison to available techniques, making it a clinically‐viable approach. The results indicate the potential of the proposed neuromodulation system in daily clinical routine for stroke rehabilitation.</p>

Hoffman et al. reveal the molecular machinery underlying neurotransmission at a gentle-touch receptor. Employing Eccles’s classical criteria for a chemical synapse, they show that epithelial Merkel cells communicate with sensory neurons through β2-adrenergic receptors at excitatory synapses.

Ogasawara et al. find that dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra are activated when animals are required to inhibit inappropriate actions. Disruption of nigrostriatal dopamine signaling impaired this inhibition behavior, as seen in neurological/psychiatric disorders with dopaminergic dysfunctions.

Kim, Znamenskiy et al. reveal that V1 neurons projecting to two higher visual areas form segregated neuronal populations that rarely make connections with each other. Activity-dependent wiring rules fall short of explaining their low rate of connectivity.

The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is important for control of social behavior and is commonly studied in disorders of social dysfunction. Here, Liang et al. perform calcium imaging in the mPFC of freely behaving mice, elucidating the complex dynamics of mPFC neurons during social behavior and changes in activity after pharmacological disruption.

Increasing evidence supports a role for inflammation in the development of mood disorders. In this issue of Neuron, Leng et al. (2018) show that reduction of menin expression in astrocytes of stress-related brain regions exacerbates neuroinflammation, promoting the establishment of depression-like behaviors in mice.

Eliav et al., (2018) recently reported hippocampal-entorhinal spiking in bats occurring preferentially at specific phases of nonrhythmic extracellular voltage fluctuations. This disentanglement of phase coding from continuous oscillations raises new questions about the importance of rhythms for neuronal coordination.

Prolonged wakefulness stimulates the homeostatic need to sleep, but transition to sleep also depends on the circadian time of day. However, links between circadian and homeostatic influences are not well understood. Guo et al. (2018) identify a Drosophila circuit connecting circadian clock neurons to sleep-promoting ring neurons in the ellipsoid body.

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>How does attention route information from sensory to high-order areas as a function of task, within the relatively fixed topology of the brain? In this study, participants were simultaneously presented with 2 unrelated stories—one spoken and one written—and asked to attend one while ignoring the other. We used fMRI and a novel intersubject correlation analysis to track the spread of information along the processing hierarchy as a function of task. Processing the unattended spoken (written) information was confined to auditory (visual) cortices. In contrast, attending to the spoken (written) story enhanced the stimulus-selective responses in sensory regions and allowed it to spread into higher-order areas. Surprisingly, we found that the story-specific spoken (written) responses for the attended story also reached secondary visual (auditory) regions of the unattended sensory modality. These results demonstrate how attention enhances the processing of attended input and allows it to propagate across brain areas.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Epidemiological and experimental studies suggest that maternal immune activation (MIA) leads to developmental brain disorders, but whether the pathogenic mechanism impacts neurons already at birth is not known. We now report that MIA abolishes in mice the oxytocin-mediated delivery γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) shift from depolarizing to hyperpolarizing in CA3 pyramidal neurons, and this is restored by the NKCC1 chloride importer antagonist bumetanide. Furthermore, MIA hippocampal pyramidal neurons at birth have a more exuberant apical arbor organization and increased apical dendritic length than age-matched controls. The frequency of spontaneous glutamatergic postsynaptic currents is also increased in MIA offspring, as well as the pairwise correlation of the synchronized firing of active cells in CA3. These alterations produced by MIA persist, since at P14–15 GABA action remains depolarizing, produces excitatory action, and network activity remains elevated with a higher frequency of spontaneous glutamatergic postsynaptic currents. Therefore, the pathogenic actions of MIA lead to important morphophysiological and network alterations in the hippocampus already at birth.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Fronto-striatal circuitry involving the orbitofrontal cortex has been identified as mediating successful reversal of stimulus-outcome contingencies. The region of the striatum that most contributes to reversal learning remains unclear, with studies in primates implicating both caudate nucleus and putamen. We trained four marmosets on a touchscreen-based serial reversal task and implanted each with cannulae targeting both putamen and caudate bilaterally. This allowed reversible inactivation of the two areas within the same monkeys, but across separate sessions, to directly investigate their respective contributions to reversal performance. Behavioral sensitivity to the GABA<sub>A</sub> agonist muscimol varied across subjects and between brain regions, so each marmoset received a range of doses. Intermediate doses of intra-putamen muscimol selectively impaired reversal performance, leaving the baseline discrimination phase unchanged. There was no effect of low doses and high doses were generally disruptive. By contrast, low doses of intra-caudate muscimol improved reversal performance, while high doses impaired both reversal and baseline discrimination performance. These data provide evidence for a specific role of the putamen in serial reversal learning, which may reflect the more habitual nature of repeated reversals using the same stimulus pair.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Hypercholesterolemia is a risk factor for neurodegenerative diseases, but how high blood cholesterol levels are linked to neurodegeneration is still unknown. Here, we show that an excess of the blood–brain barrier permeable cholesterol metabolite 27-hydroxycholesterol (27-OH) impairs neuronal morphology and reduces hippocampal spine density and the levels of the postsynaptic protein PSD95. Dendritic spines are the main postsynaptic elements of excitatory synapses and are crucial structures for memory and cognition. Furthermore, PSD95 has an essential function for synaptic maintenance and plasticity. PSD95 synthesis is controlled by the REST–miR124a–PTBP1 axis. Here, we report that high levels of 27-OH induce REST–miR124a–PTBP1 axis dysregulation in a possible RxRγ-dependent manner, suggesting that 27-OH reduces PSD95 levels through this mechanism. Our results reveal a possible molecular link between hypercholesterolemia and neurodegeneration. We discuss the possibility that reduction of 27-OH levels could be a useful strategy for preventing memory and cognitive decline in neurodegenerative disorders.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Understanding homologies and differences in auditory cortical processing in human and nonhuman primates is an essential step in elucidating the neurobiology of speech and language. Using fMRI responses to natural sounds, we investigated the representation of multiple acoustic features in auditory cortex of awake macaques and humans. Comparative analyses revealed homologous large-scale topographies not only for frequency but also for temporal and spectral modulations. In both species, posterior regions preferably encoded relatively fast temporal and coarse spectral information, whereas anterior regions encoded slow temporal and fine spectral modulations. Conversely, we observed a striking interspecies difference in cortical sensitivity to temporal modulations: While decoding from macaque auditory cortex was most accurate at fast rates (&gt; 30 Hz), humans had highest sensitivity to ~3 Hz, a relevant rate for speech analysis. These findings suggest that characteristic tuning of human auditory cortex to slow temporal modulations is unique and may have emerged as a critical step in the evolution of speech and language.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>A major limitation of conventional human brain research has been its basis in highly artificial laboratory experiments. Due to technical constraints, little is known about the nature of cortical activations during ecological real life. We have previously proposed the “spontaneous trait reactivation (STR)” hypothesis arguing that resting-state patterns, which emerge spontaneously in the absence of external stimulus, reflect the statistics of habitual cortical activations during real life. Therefore, these patterns can serve as a window into daily life cortical activity. A straightforward prediction of this hypothesis is that spontaneous patterns should preferentially correlate to patterns generated by naturalistic stimuli compared with artificial ones. Here we targeted high-level category-selective visual areas and tested this prediction by comparing BOLD functional connectivity patterns formed during rest to patterns formed in response to naturalistic stimuli, as well as to more artificial category-selective, dynamic stimuli. Our results revealed a significant correlation between the resting-state patterns and functional connectivity patterns generated by naturalistic stimuli. Furthermore, the correlations to naturalistic stimuli were significantly higher than those found between resting-state patterns and those generated by artificial control stimuli. These findings provide evidence of a stringent link between spontaneous patterns and the activation patterns during natural vision.</span>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The present study was undertaken to determine the efficacy of coadministration of fingolimod with alteplase in acute ischemic stroke patients in a delayed time window.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This was a prospective, randomized, open‐label, blinded endpoint clinical trial, enrolling patients with internal carotid artery or middle cerebral artery proximal occlusion within 4.5 to 6 hours from symptom onset. Patients were randomly assigned to receive alteplase alone or alteplase with fingolimod. All patients underwent pretreatment and 24‐hour noncontrast computed tomography (CT)/perfusion CT/CT angiography. The coprimary endpoints were the decrease of National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale scores over 24 hours and the favorable shift of modified Rankin Scale score (mRS) distribution at day 90. Exploratory outcomes included vessel recanalization, anterograde reperfusion, and retrograde reperfusion of collateral flow.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Each treatment group included 23 patients. Compared with alteplase alone, patients receiving fingolimod plus alteplase exhibited better early clinical improvement at 24 hours and a favorable shift of mRS distribution at day 90. In addition, patients who received fingolimod and alteplase exhibited a greater reduction in the perfusion lesion accompanied by suppressed infarct growth by 24 hours. Fingolimod in conjunction with alteplase significantly improved anterograde reperfusion of downstream territory and prevented the failure of retrograde reperfusion from collateral circulation.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Fingolimod may enhance the efficacy of alteplase administration in the 4.5‐ to 6‐hour time window in patients with a proximal cerebral arterial occlusion and salvageable penumbral tissue by promoting both anterograde reperfusion and retrograde collateral flow. These findings are instructive for the design of future trials of recanalization therapies in extended time windows. Ann Neurol 2018;1–12</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To determine whether brain amyloid burden in elderly patients with narcolepsy type 1 (NT1) is lower than in controls, and to assess in patients with NT1 the relationships between amyloid burden, cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) markers of Alzheimer's disease (AD), CSF orexin‐A, and cognitive profile.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Cognitive and <sup>18</sup>F‐florbetapir‐positron emission tomography (PET) data were compared in patients with NT1 aged ≥65 years (n=23) and in age‐ and sex‐matched controls free of clinical dementia selected from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI, n=69) and the Multi‐domain Intervention Alzheimer's Prevention Trial (MAPT‐AV45; n=23) cohorts. The standardized uptake values (SUV) of the cortical retention index for six regions of interest were computed and averaged to create a mean SUV ratio normalized to three subcortical reference regions (cerebellum, pons and a composite region). A cortical/cerebellum SUV ratio ≥1.17 defined positive PET amyloid.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Lower cortical amyloid burden was observed in the NT1 than in the ADNI and MAPT‐AV45 groups (mean cortical/cerebellum SUV ratios: 0.95±0.15, 1.11±0.18 (p&lt;0.0001), and 1.14 ±0.17 (p=0.0005), respectively). Similar results were obtained with all subcortical reference regions and for all cortical regions of interest, except cingulum. Only one patient with NT1 (4.4%) had positive PET‐amyloid compared with 27.5% in the ADNI and 30.4% in the MAPT group. In the NT1 group, cortical or regional amyloid load was not associated with CSF orexin‐A, CSF AD biomarkers or neuropsychological profile.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Lower brain amyloid burden, assessed by <sup>18</sup>F‐florbetapir‐PET, in patients with NT1 suggests delayed appearance of amyloid plaques.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Phantom limb pain (PLP) is notoriously difficult to treat, partly due to an incomplete understanding of PLP‐related disease mechanisms. Non‐invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) is used to modulate plasticity in various neuropathological diseases, including chronic pain. While NIBS can alleviate neuropathic pain (including PLP), both disease and treatment mechanisms remain tenuous. Insight into the mechanisms underlying both PLP and NIBS‐induced PLP relief is needed for future implementation of such treatment and generalisation to related conditions.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We used a within‐participants, double‐blind, and sham‐controlled design to alleviate PLP via task‐concurrent NIBS over the primary sensorimotor missing hand cortex (S1/M1). To specifically influence missing hand signal processing, amputees performed phantom hand movements during anodal transcranial direct current stimulation. Brain activity was monitored using neuroimaging during and after NIBS. PLP ratings were obtained throughout the week after stimulation.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A single session of intervention NIBS significantly relieved PLP, with effects lasting at least one week. PLP relief associated with reduced activity in the S1/M1 missing hand cortex after stimulation. Critically, PLP relief and reduced S1/M1 activity correlated with preceding activity changes during stimulation in the mid‐ and posterior insula and secondary somatosensory cortex (S2).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The observed correlation between PLP relief and decreased S1/M1 activity confirms our previous findings linking PLP with increased S1/M1 activity. Our results further highlight the driving role of the mid‐ and posterior insula, as well as S2, in modulating PLP. Lastly, our novel PLP intervention using task‐concurrent NIBS opens new avenues for developing treatment for PLP and related pain conditions.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>A professional violinist reported increasing difficulties playing the violin. He executed the initial half of the musical piece well, but produced an increasing number of mistakes during the second half. Neurological examination was remarkable for bradykinesia and tremor. Formal acoustic analysis of finger taps and pronation‐supination showed a decrement in sound intensity and number of taps over time. Oscillations in performance correlated with a parkinsonian tremor. We interpret these findings as the audible equivalent of bradykinesia and tremor. Listening to bradykinesia and quantifying its decrement using acoustic analysis may offer a simple, objective and reliable supplement to the neurological examination.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Patients with visual snow syndrome (VS) suffer from a debilitating continuous visual disturbance of unknown mechanism. The present study tested the hypothesis of dysfunctional visual processing using visual evoked potentials. Eighteen patients were compared to age‐matched migraineurs (M) and healthy controls (C) using two‐way ANOVA with group (VS, M, C) and gender as factors. Visual evoked potentials from patients with VS demonstrated increased N145 latency (in ms; VS: 152.7±7.9 vs. M: 145.3±9.8 vs. C: 145.5±9.4; F=3.28; p=0.046) and reduced N75‐P100 amplitudes (in μV; VS: 7.4±3.5 vs. M: 12.5±4.7 vs. C: 10.8±3.4; F=3.16; p=0.051). Dunnett post‐hoc analysis was significant for all comparisons between VS and controls. These findings are in agreement with the idea that the primary disturbance in VS is a dysfunction of the visual association cortex.</p>

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>We conducted a European‐only and trans‐ancestral genome‐wide association meta‐analysis in 72,147 stroke patients and 823,869 controls using data from UK Biobank (UKB) and the MEGASTROKE consortium. We identified an exonic polymorphism in <i>NOS3</i> (rs1799983, p.Glu298Asp; p=2.2E‐8; OR=1.05[1.04‐1.07]) and variants in an intron of <i>COL4A1</i> (rs9521634, p‐value=3.8E‐8, OR=1.04[1.03‐1.06]) and near <i>DYRK1A</i> (rs720470, p=6.1E‐9; OR=1.05[1.03‐1.07]) at genome‐wide significance for stroke. Effect sizes of known stroke loci were highly correlated between UKB and MEGASTROKE. Using Mendelian Randomization we further show that genetic variation in the nitric oxide synthase (NOS) – nitric oxide (NO) pathway in part affects stroke risk via variation in blood pressure.</p>

In 2006, Ma et al. presented an elegant theory for how populations of neurons might represent uncertainty to perform Bayesian inference. Critically, according to this theory, neural variability is no longer a nuisance, but rather a vital part of how the brain encodes probability distributions and performs computations with them.

Large-scale efforts are underway to map the neuronal connectomes of various animal species. In 1986 White et al. reported the first complete reconstruction of the nervous system connectome of an animal. Largely through manual reconstruction of serial electron micrographs, the authors characterized the morphology of each of the 302 neurons of the adult nematode C. elegans, and mapped the chemical and electrical synapses that connect them. This wiring diagram has profoundly influenced behavioral neurobiology and network science, and it continues to offer a guide for the impact of connectomics on neurobiology.

In a 2016 paper, Huth and colleagues probed, in a general way, how word meanings map onto cortical locations. By comparing the fit between alternative maps, this methodology offered a means to evaluate what sorts of meaning representations the brain handles under ecologically realistic conditions.

Over the past half-century, we have gained significant insights into the molecular biology of long-term memory storage at the level of the synapse. In recent years, our understanding of the cellular architecture supporting long-term memory traces has also substantially improved. However, the molecular biology of consolidation at the level of neuronal systems has been relatively neglected. In this opinion article, we first examine our current understanding of the cellular mechanisms of synaptic consolidation.
