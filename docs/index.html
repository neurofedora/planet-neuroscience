              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-927/v2?src=rss">StaggR: an interactive R/Shiny application for planning and visualizing staggered experimental protocols [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Biological experiments often require a series of precisely timed operations, and small variations in treatment can result in inconsistent or biased results. To handle multiple samples in parallel with precise temporal resolution, experimentalists may stagger treatments by initiating the workflow of one sample during the wait or incubation time of another. However, as the number of samples processed in parallel and the number of operations increase, it becomes increasingly difficult to identify and execute valid treatment regimens that permit the handling of each sample. To address this, I developed StaggR, an interactive web application that calculates and visualizes compatible staggering intervals for parallelized execution of identical processing workflows. This tool provides a user-friendly interface for defining protocol operations, durations, and wait times. It can automatically calculate the shortest possible conflict-free interval for initiating sample treatments, or allow users to simulate specific intervals to explore potential treatment regimens or bottlenecks. Using StaggR, users of any experience level can rapidly generate complete, color-coded experimental schedules, visualize these workflows in an easy-to-read chart, and execute them using a built-in timer displaying a treatment schedule with live updates. The experimental designs can be saved, shared, and re-imported, ensuring full reproducibility and user control. The application of StaggR is expected to expedite the design and throughput of complex experimental workflows while maximizing reproducibility.

                Background This study investigated circulating levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), and their association with objective sleep parameters in adults with chronic insomnia compared to normal sleepers. Methods A total of 46 participants were enrolled, including 26 individuals with chronic insomnia and 20 normal sleepers. Serum concentrations of BDNF and GDNF were measured, and sleep architecture was analyzed using overnight polysomnography. Group comparisons were conducted using Mann-Whitney U tests, while Spearman’s correlation and multiple regression analyses examined relationships between neurotrophic factors, sleep metrics, and demographic characteristics. Results Participants with insomnia showed significantly impaired objective sleep quality, with lower sleep efficiency (Median: 52.84% vs. 74.65%, p<0.001) and reduced total sleep time (Median: 3.99 h vs. 5.74 h, p<0.001) compared to controls. However, there were no significant differences in circulating BDNF (p=0.610) or GDNF (p=0.249) levels between groups. Correlation analyses across the entire sample revealed no significant associations between either BDNF or GDNF and sleep efficiency (BDNF: ρ = 0.141, p = 0.215; GDNF: ρ = 0.086, p = 0.449) or total sleep time. Multiple regression analysis indicated that sleep efficiency independently predicted BDNF levels (p=0.034), though the overall regression model was not significant (F(4,41)=1.309, p=0.283; R2=0.113). The GDNF regression model was also non-significant (F(4,41)=1.315, p=0.281; R2=0.114). A strong positive correlation was detected between BDNF and GDNF (ρ=0.835, p<0.001). Conclusions The study verified significant objective sleep impairments in individuals with chronic insomnia but found no differences in BDNF or GDNF levels between groups. While bivariate associations with sleep quality were absent, regression results suggest a complex link between sleep efficiency and BDNF. The limited sample size constrains interpretation, implying that larger studies are needed to validate these preliminary findings and to explore the strong interrelationship between BDNF and GDNF.

                Background Extrusion-spheronization is the most commonly used technology to produce pellets using microcrystalline cellulose as a pelletizing agent. However, it has the major drawbacks of lack of disintegration and prolonged drug release. This study aimed to develop rapidly disintegrating microcrystalline cellulose-based pellets. Methods Several pellet formulations were prepared via extrusion spheronization using a combination of microcrystalline cellulose, mannitol, polyethylene glycol 400(PEG 400), polyplasdone (PPXL), and croscarmellose sodium (CCS). Subsequently, they were evaluated for their physical characteristics. Results Process optimization indicated that 500 RPM is the ideal extrusion speed. Furthermore, the best spheronization speed was to start with a speed of 3000 RPM speed to cut off the extrudate at a shorter length and then lower the speed to 1000 RPM to reduce fine production and allow for spherical pellet formation. Increasing the polyethylene glycol content to 20% and maintaining the percentages of croscarmellose sodium (15%), 15%), and polyplasdone xl (5%), respectively, demonstrated a significant improvement in disintegration time (DT). Conclusions MCC-based pellets with fast-disintegrating characteristics were obtained by extrusion and spheronization. Incorporating the soluble filler mannitol, hydrophilic polymer PEG 400 with super-disintegrant CCS, and PPXL 400 resulted in a more porous matrix that facilitated water entry and rapid swelling of the pellets to explode and disintegrate quickly (2 min).

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-881/v2?src=rss">Factors Associated with Breastfeeding Duration in Tunisia: A Cross-Sectional Analysis Highlighting the Role of Early Initiation [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background Breastfeeding is vital for maternal and child health, yet breastfeeding practices and duration vary globally. In Tunisia, data on factors influencing breastfeeding, especially initiation timing, are limited. This study assessed breastfeeding practices, initiation timing, and associated maternal and delivery factors among Tunisian women, focusing on breastfeeding duration up to 12 months postpartum. Methods Analytical cross-sectional study was conducted over a four-month period, from November 1, 2023, to February 29, 2024, in the Gynecology and Obstetrics Department B of Charles Nicolle Hospital in Tunis- Tunisia. Women who delivered during the study period were included. Data on sociodemographic characteristics, medical and obstetric history, breastfeeding knowledge and preparation, delivery, postpartum and breastfeeding practices were collected through a questionnaire. Breastfeeding duration was grouped into 1–3, 3–6, and >6 months. Associations with breastfeeding duration were analyzed. Results In total, 400 women were included. Most women were Tunisian (99%), urban residents (91.5%), and of higher socioeconomic status (84.3%). Obesity was present in 20.5%, and cesarean delivery rate was 52.8%. Early breastfeeding initiation (within 1 hour) occurred in only 19.3%, with 80.8% delayed initiation. Breastfeeding continuation at 12 months was 44% and was significantly associated with early initiation (p < 0.001); 77.9% of women who initiated breastfeeding within the first hour continued at 12 months, compared to markedly lower rates among those with delayed initiation. Maternal obesity predicted shorter breastfeeding duration (p = 0.026). Cesarean delivery showed no significant impact. Skin-to-skin contact was low (38.3%), and less than half received breastfeeding education (46%). Family support was not linked to breastfeeding duration. Conclusions Breastfeeding continuation at 12 months was associated with early initiation and negatively influenced by maternal obesity. Despite high breastfeeding intention, delays in initiation, obesity and limited breastfeeding education hinder optimal breastfeeding outcomes. Interventions promoting early initiation, skin-to-skin contact, and tailored postnatal support are needed to improve breastfeeding continuation.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10525">Parallel Neuron Groups in the Drosophila Brain</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2512.10525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The full connectome of an adult Drosophila enables a search for novel neural structures in the insect brain. I describe a new neural structure, called a Parallel Neuron Group (PNG). Two neurons are called parallel if they share a significant number of input neurons and output neurons. Most pairs of neurons in the Drosophila brain have very small parallel match. There are about twenty larger groups of neurons for which any pair of neurons in the group has a high match. These are the parallel groups. Parallel groups contain only about 1000 out of the 65,000 neurons in the brain, and have distinctive properties. There are groups in the right mushroom bodies, the antennal lobes, the lobula, and in two central neuropils (GNG and EB). Most parallel groups do not have lateral symmetry. A group usually has one major input neuron, which inputs to all the neurons in the group, and a small number of major output neurons. The major input and output neurons are laterally asymmetric. Parallel neuron groups present puzzles, such as: what does a group do, that could not be done by one larger neuron? Do all neurons in a group fire in synchrony, or do they perform different functions? Why are they laterally asymmetric? These may merit further investigation.

                arXiv:2512.10834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Allometric scaling laws, such as Kleiber's law for metabolic rate, highlight how efficiency emerges with size across living systems. The brain, with its characteristic sublinear scaling of activity, has long posed a puzzle: why do larger brains operate with disproportionately lower firing rates? Here we show that this economy of scale is a universal outcome of avalanche dynamics. We derive analytical scaling laws directly from avalanche statistics, establishing that any system governed by critical avalanches must exhibit sublinear activity-size relations. This theoretical prediction is then verified in integrate-and-fire neuronal networks at criticality and in classical self-organized criticality models, demonstrating that the effect is not model-specific but generic. The predicted exponents align with experimental observations across mammal species, bridging dynamical criticality with the allometry of brain metabolism. Our results reveal avalanche criticality as a fundamental mechanism underlying Kleiber-like scaling in the brain.

                arXiv:2512.10844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop here a stochastic framework for modeling and segmenting transient spindle- like oscillatory bursts in electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. At the modeling level, individ- ual spindles are represented as path realizations of a two-dimensional Ornstein{Uhlenbeck (OU) process with a stable focus, providing a low-dimensional stochastic dynamical sys- tem whose trajectories reproduce key morphological features of spindles, including their characteristic rise{decay amplitude envelopes. On the signal processing side, we propose a segmentation procedure based on Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) combined with the detection of a central extremum, which isolates single spindle events and yields a collection of oscillatory atoms. This construction enables a systematic statistical analysis of spindle features: we derive empirical laws for the distributions of amplitudes, inter-spindle intervals, and rise/decay durations, and show that these exhibit exponential tails consistent with the underlying OU dynamics. We further extend the model to a pair of weakly coupled OU processes with distinct natural frequencies, generating a stochastic mixture of slow, fast, and mixed spindles in random temporal order. The resulting framework provides a data- driven framework for the analysis of transient oscillations in EEG and, more generally, in nonstationary time series.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15440">State-space kinetic Ising model reveals task-dependent entropy flow in sparsely active nonequilibrium neuronal dynamics</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2502.15440v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neuronal ensemble activity, including coordinated and oscillatory patterns, exhibits hallmarks of nonequilibrium systems with time-asymmetric trajectories to maintain their organization. However, assessing time asymmetry from neuronal spiking activity remains challenging. The kinetic Ising model provides a framework for studying the causal, nonequilibrium dynamics in spiking recurrent neural networks. Recent theoretical advances in this model have enabled time-asymmetry estimation from large-scale steady-state data. Yet, neuronal activity often exhibits time-varying firing rates and coupling strengths, violating the steady-state assumption. To overcome this limitation, we developed a state-space kinetic Ising model that accounts for nonstationary and nonequilibrium properties of neural systems. This approach incorporates a mean-field method for estimating time-varying entropy flow, a key measure for maintaining the system's organization through dissipation. Applying this method to mouse visual cortex data revealed greater variability in causal couplings during task engagement despite reduced neuronal activity with increased sparsity. Moreover, higher-performing mice exhibited increased coupling-related entropy flow per spike during task engagement, suggesting more efficient computation in the higher-performing mice. These findings underscore the model's utility in uncovering intricate asymmetric causal dynamics in neuronal ensembles and linking them to behavior through the thermodynamic underpinnings of neural computation.

I found how mu-opioids and anesthetics by activating medial habenula (MHb) and/or interpeduncular nucleus (IPN) induce unawareness and slowdown respiration. MHb projects to IPN and both increase their glucose intake during anesthesia (Herkenham, 1981). The question is: What is the MHb-IPN circuit doing? I found that it promotes SWS, memory replay, sharp-wave ripples, spindles, hippocampo-cortical replay, synaptogenesis, rest and recovery, by activating median raphe (MRN) serotonin, and by inhibiting the theta state circuit, new memories encoding, awareness, arousal, alert wakefulness, and REM sleep. It causes also natural slowdown of respiration and heart rate, while it inhibits locomotion and arousal. This extended model adds role of the dentate gyrus>posterior septum>MHb>IPN>MRN>hippocampus + BF + claustrum>cortical slow-waves in memory replay, ripples, loss of awareness, SWS, and anesthesia. It proposes new neural mechanism for anesthetic ketamine, nitrous oxide, and phencyclidine effects: activation of the IPN>MRN>claustrum>cortical SWA circuit by the 5-HT2a receptors in the IPN and claustrum. My model shows why are ketamine and psychedelics anxiolytic and antidepressant. How they by activating the 5-HT2a receptors in vACC/infralimbic cortex increase safety, well-being signal, socializing, and cognitive flexibility, and attenuate fear, worries, anger, impulsivity, self-defence, and wanting. This model claims that mu-opioids, acetylcholine, nicotine, endocannabinoids, adenosine, GLP-1RA, and substance P activate the MHb-IPN-MRN circuit which promotes rest, recovery, repair, serotonin-BDNF-protein production, spines growth, and anti-inflammatory state.

Abstract: Biological neural networks learn complex behaviors from sparse, delayed feedback using local synaptic plasticity, yet the mechanisms enabling structured credit assignment remain elusive. In contrast, artificial recurrent networks solving similar tasks typically rely on biologically implausible global learning rules or hand-crafted local updates. The space of local plasticity rules capable of supporting learning from delayed reinforcement remains largely unexplored. Here, we present a meta-learning framework that discovers local learning rules for structured credit assignment in recurrent networks trained with sparse feedback. Our approach interleaves local neo-Hebbian-like updates during task execution with an outer loop that optimizes plasticity parameters via \textbf{tangent-propagation through learning}. The resulting three-factor learning rules enable long-timescale credit assignment using only local information and delayed rewards, offering new insights into biologically grounded mechanisms for learning in recurrent circuits.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) enables adaptive behavior across species via reward prediction errors (RPEs), but the neural origins of species-specific adaptability remain unknown. Integrating RL modeling, transcriptomics, and neuroimaging during reversal learning, we discovered convergent RPE signatures - shared monoaminergic/synaptic gene upregulation and neuroanatomical representations, yet humans outperformed macaques behaviorally. Single-trial decoding showed RPEs guided choices similarly in both species, but humans disproportionately recruited dorsal anterior cingulate (dACC) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC). Cross-species alignment uncovered that macaque prefrontal circuits encode human-like optimal RPEs yet fail to translate them into action. Adaptability scaled not with RPE encoding fidelity, but with the areal extent of dACC/dlPFC recruitment governing RPE-to-action transformation. These findings resolve an evolutionary puzzle: behavioral performance gaps arise from executive cortical readout efficiency, not encoding capacity.

                arXiv:2507.01098v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this note, we elaborate on and explain in detail the proof given by Ziyin et al. (2025) of the ``perfect" Platonic Representation Hypothesis (PRH) for the embedded deep linear network model (EDLN). We show that if trained with the stochastic gradient descent (SGD), two EDLNs with different widths and depths and trained on different data will become Perfectly Platonic, meaning that every possible pair of layers will learn the same representation up to a rotation. Because most of the global minima of the loss function are not Platonic, that SGD only finds the perfectly Platonic solution is rather extraordinary. The proof also suggests at least six ways the PRH can be broken. We also show that in the EDLN model, the emergence of the Platonic representations is due to the same reason as the emergence of progressive sharpening. This implies that these two seemingly unrelated phenomena in deep learning can, surprisingly, have a common cause. Overall, the theory and proof highlight the importance of understanding emergent "entropic forces" due to the irreversibility of SGD training and their role in representation learning. The goal of this note is to be instructive while avoiding jargon and lengthy technical details.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10011">Spatial Spiking Neural Networks Enable Efficient and Robust Temporal Computation</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2512.10011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The efficiency of modern machine intelligence depends on high accuracy with minimal computational cost. In spiking neural networks (SNNs), synaptic delays are crucial for encoding temporal structure, yet existing models treat them as fully trainable, unconstrained parameters, leading to large memory footprints, higher computational demand, and a departure from biological plausibility. In the brain, however, delays arise from physical distances between neurons embedded in space. Building on this principle, we introduce Spatial Spiking Neural Networks (SpSNNs), a framework in which neurons learn coordinates in a finite-dimensional Euclidean space and delays emerge from inter-neuron distances. This replaces per-synapse delay learning with position learning, substantially reducing parameter count while retaining temporal expressiveness. Across the Yin-Yang and Spiking Heidelberg Digits benchmarks, SpSNNs outperform SNNs with unconstrained delays despite using far fewer parameters. Performance consistently peaks in 2D and 3D networks rather than infinite-dimensional delay spaces, revealing a geometric regularization effect. Moreover, dynamically sparsified SpSNNs maintain full accuracy even at 90% sparsity, matching standard delay-trained SNNs while using up to 18x fewer parameters. Because learned spatial layouts map naturally onto hardware geometries, SpSNNs lend themselves to efficient neuromorphic implementation. Methodologically, SpSNNs compute exact delay gradients via automatic differentiation with custom-derived rules, supporting arbitrary neuron models and architectures. Altogether, SpSNNs provide a principled platform for exploring spatial structure in temporal computation and offer a hardware-friendly substrate for scalable, energy-efficient neuromorphic intelligence.

                arXiv:2512.10638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bayesian inference offers a principled account of information processing in natural agents. However, it remains an open question how neural mechanisms perform their abstract operations. We investigate a hypothesis where a distributed form of Bayesian inference, namely message passing on factor graphs, is performed by a simulated network of leaky-integrate-and-fire neurons. Specifically, we perform Gaussian belief propagation by encoding messages that come into factor nodes as spike-based signals, propagating these signals through a spiking neural network (SNN) and decoding the spike-based signal back to an outgoing message. Three core linear operations, equality (branching), addition, and multiplication, are realized in networks of leaky integrate-and-fire models. Validation against the standard sum-product algorithm shows accurate message updates, while applications to Kalman filtering and Bayesian linear regression demonstrate the framework's potential for both static and dynamic inference tasks. Our results provide a step toward biologically grounded, neuromorphic implementations of probabilistic reasoning.

                arXiv:2512.09969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Eye tracking for wearable systems demands low latency and milliwatt-level power, but conventional frame-based pipelines struggle with motion blur, high compute cost, and limited temporal resolution. Such capabilities are vital for enabling seamless and responsive interaction in emerging technologies like augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR), where understanding user gaze is key to immersion and interface design. Neuromorphic sensors and spiking neural networks (SNNs) offer a promising alternative, yet existing SNN approaches are either too specialized or fall short of the performance of modern ANN architectures. This paper presents a neuromorphic version of top-performing event-based eye-tracking models, replacing their recurrent and attention modules with lightweight LIF layers and exploiting depth-wise separable convolutions to reduce model complexity. Our models obtain 3.7-4.1px mean error, approaching the accuracy of the application-specific neuromorphic system, Retina (3.24px), while reducing model size by 20x and theoretical compute by 850x, compared to the closest ANN variant of the proposed model. These efficient variants are projected to operate at an estimated 3.9-4.9 mW with 3 ms latency at 1 kHz. The present results indicate that high-performing event-based eye-tracking architectures can be redesigned as SNNs with substantial efficiency gains, while retaining accuracy suitable for real-time wearable deployment.

                arXiv:2512.09972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Constructing a Pareto set is pivotal for navigating the capability-efficiency trade-offs in Large Language Models (LLMs); however, existing merging techniques remain inadequate for this task. Coarse-grained, model-level methods yield only a sparse set of suboptimal solutions, while fine-grained, layer-wise approaches suffer from the "curse of dimensionality," rendering the search space computationally intractable. To resolve this dichotomy, we propose BAMBO (Bayesian Adaptive Multi-objective Block-wise Optimization), a novel framework that automatically constructs the LLM Pareto set. BAMBO renders the search tractable by introducing a Hybrid Optimal Block Partitioning strategy. Formulated as a 1D clustering problem, this strategy leverages a dynamic programming approach to optimally balance intra-block homogeneity and inter-block information distribution, thereby dramatically reducing dimensionality without sacrificing critical granularity. The entire process is automated within an evolutionary loop driven by the q-Expected Hypervolume Improvement (qEHVI) acquisition function. Experiments demonstrate that BAMBO discovers a superior and more comprehensive Pareto frontier than baselines, enabling agile model selection tailored to diverse operational constraints. Code is available at: https://github.com/xin8coder/BAMBO.

Abstract: Efficiency in optimisation and search processes persists to be one of the challenges, which affects the performance and use of optimisation algorithms. Utilising a pool of operators instead of a single operator to handle move operations within a neighbourhood remains promising, but an optimum or near optimum sequence of operators necessitates further investigation. One of the promising ideas is to generalise experiences and seek how to utilise it. Although numerous works are done around this issue for single objective optimisation, multi-objective cases have not much been touched in this regard. A generalised approach based on multi-objective reinforcement learning approach seems to create remedy for this issue and offer good solutions. This paper overviews a generalisation approach proposed with certain stages completed and phases outstanding that is aimed to help demonstrate the efficiency of using multi-objective reinforcement learning.

                arXiv:2512.10477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In our work we not explicitly hint that it is a misconception to think that humans learn fast. Learning process takes time. Babies start learning to move in the restricted liquid area called placenta. Children often are limited by underdeveloped body. Even adults are not allowed to participate in complex competitions right away. However, with robots, when learning from scratch, we often don't have the privilege of waiting for dozen millions of steps. "Swaddling" regularization is responsible for restraining an agent in rapid but unstable development penalizing action strength in a specific way not affecting actions directly. The Symphony, Transitional-policy Deterministic Actor and Critic algorithm, is a concise combination of different ideas for possibility of training humanoid robots from scratch with Sample Efficiency, Sample Proximity and Safety of Actions in mind. It is no secret that continuous increase in Gaussian noise without appropriate smoothing is harmful for motors and gearboxes. Compared to Stochastic algorithms, we set a limited parametric noise and promote a reduced strength of actions, safely increasing entropy, since the actions are kind of immersed in weaker noise. When actions require more extreme values, actions rise above the weak noise. Training becomes empirically much safer for both the environment around and the robot's mechanisms. We use Fading Replay Buffer: using a fixed formula containing the hyperbolic tangent, we adjust the batch sampling probability: the memory contains a recent memory and a long-term memory trail. Fading Replay Buffer allows us to use Temporal Advantage when we improve the current Critic Network prediction compared to the exponential moving average. Temporal Advantage allows us to update Actor and Critic in one pass, as well as combine Actor and Critic in one Object and implement their Losses in one line.

                arXiv:2512.10611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data center (DC) infrastructure serves as the backbone to support the escalating demand for computing capacity. Traditional design methodologies that blend human expertise with specialized simulation tools scale poorly with the increasing system complexity. Recent studies adopt generative artificial intelligence to design plausible human-centric indoor layouts. However, they do not consider the underlying physics, making them unsuitable for the DC design that sets quantifiable operational objectives and strict physical constraints. To bridge the gap, we propose Phythesis, a novel framework that synergizes large language models (LLMs) and physics-guided evolutionary optimization to automate simulation-ready (SimReady) scene synthesis for energy-efficient DC design. Phythesis employs an iterative bi-level optimization architecture, where (i) the LLM-driven optimization level generates physically plausible three-dimensional layouts and self-criticizes them to refine the scene topology, and (ii) the physics-informed optimization level identifies the optimal asset parameters and selects the best asset combination. Experiments on three generation scales show that Phythesis achieves 57.3% generation success rate increase and 11.5% power usage effectiveness (PUE) improvement, compared with the vanilla LLM-based solution.

Abstract: Graph Transformers (GTs), which integrate message passing and self-attention mechanisms simultaneously, have achieved promising empirical results in graph prediction tasks. However, the design of scalable and topology-aware node tokenization has lagged behind other modalities. This gap becomes critical as the quadratic complexity of full attention renders them impractical on large-scale graphs. Recently, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), as brain-inspired models, provided an energy-saving scheme to convert input intensity into discrete spike-based representations through event-driven spiking neurons. Inspired by these characteristics, we propose a linear-time Graph Transformer with Spiking Node Tokenization (GT-SNT) for node classification. By integrating multi-step feature propagation with SNNs, spiking node tokenization generates compact, locality-aware spike count embeddings as node tokens to avoid predefined codebooks and their utilization issues. The codebook guided self-attention leverages these tokens to perform node-to-token attention for linear-time global context aggregation. In experiments, we compare GT-SNT with other state-of-the-art baselines on node classification datasets ranging from small to large. Experimental results show that GT-SNT achieves comparable performances on most datasets and reaches up to 130x faster inference speed compared to other GTs.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01730">PASCAL: Precise and Efficient ANN- SNN Conversion using Spike Accumulation and Adaptive Layerwise Activation</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2505.01730v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have been put forward as an energy-efficient alternative to Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) since they perform sparse Accumulate operations instead of the power-hungry Multiply-and-Accumulate operations. ANN-SNN conversion is a widely used method to realize deep SNNs with accuracy comparable to that of ANNs.~\citeauthor{bu2023optimal} recently proposed the Quantization-Clip-Floor-Shift (QCFS) activation as an alternative to ReLU to minimize the accuracy loss during ANN-SNN conversion. Nevertheless, SNN inferencing requires a large number of timesteps to match the accuracy of the source ANN for real-world datasets. In this work, we propose PASCAL, which performs ANN-SNN conversion in such a way that the resulting SNN is mathematically equivalent to an ANN with QCFS-activation, thereby yielding similar accuracy as the source ANN with minimal inference timesteps. In addition, we propose a systematic method to configure the quantization step of QCFS activation in a layerwise manner, which effectively determines the optimal number of timesteps per layer for the converted SNN. Our results show that the ResNet-34 SNN obtained using PASCAL achieves an accuracy of $\approx$74\% on ImageNet with a 64$\times$ reduction in the number of inference timesteps compared to existing approaches.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07602">Algorithm-hardware co-design of neuromorphic networks with dual memory pathways</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2512.07602v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spiking neural networks excel at event-driven sensing. Yet, maintaining task-relevant context over long timescales both algorithmically and in hardware, while respecting both tight energy and memory budgets, remains a core challenge in the field. We address this challenge through novel algorithm-hardware co-design effort. At the algorithm level, inspired by the cortical fast-slow organization in the brain, we introduce a neural network with an explicit slow memory pathway that, combined with fast spiking activity, enables a dual memory pathway (DMP) architecture in which each layer maintains a compact low-dimensional state that summarizes recent activity and modulates spiking dynamics. This explicit memory stabilizes learning while preserving event-driven sparsity, achieving competitive accuracy on long-sequence benchmarks with 40-60% fewer parameters than equivalent state-of-the-art spiking neural networks. At the hardware level, we introduce a near-memory-compute architecture that fully leverages the advantages of the DMP architecture by retaining its compact shared state while optimizing dataflow, across heterogeneous sparse-spike and dense-memory pathways. We show experimental results that demonstrate more than a 4x increase in throughput and over a 5x improvement in energy efficiency compared with state-of-the-art implementations. Together, these contributions demonstrate that biological principles can guide functional abstractions that are both algorithmically effective and hardware-efficient, establishing a scalable co-design paradigm for real-time neuromorphic computation and learning.

                arXiv:2403.04162v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As a general method for exploration in deep reinforcement learning (RL), NoisyNet can produce problem-specific exploration strategies. Spiking neural networks (SNNs), due to their binary firing mechanism, have strong robustness to noise, making it difficult to realize efficient exploration with local disturbances. To solve this exploration problem, we propose a noisy spiking actor network (NoisySAN) that introduces time-correlated noise during charging and transmission. Moreover, a noise reduction method is proposed to find a stable policy for the agent. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of continuous control tasks from OpenAI gym.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17438">Object-centric proto-symbolic behavioural reasoning from pixels</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2411.17438v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Autonomous intelligent agents must bridge computational challenges at disparate levels of abstraction, from the low-level spaces of sensory input and motor commands to the high-level domain of abstract reasoning and planning. A key question in designing such agents is how best to instantiate the representational space that will interface between these two levels -- ideally without requiring supervision in the form of expensive data annotations. These objectives can be efficiently achieved by representing the world in terms of objects (grounded in perception and action). In this work, we present a novel, brain-inspired, deep-learning architecture that learns from pixels to interpret, control, and reason about its environment, using object-centric representations. We show the utility of our approach through tasks in synthetic environments that require a combination of (high-level) logical reasoning and (low-level) continuous control. Results show that the agent can learn emergent conditional behavioural reasoning, such as $(A \to B) \land (\neg A \to C)$, as well as logical composition $(A \to B) \land (A \to C) \vdash A \to (B \land C)$ and XOR operations, and successfully controls its environment to satisfy objectives deduced from these logical rules. The agent can adapt online to unexpected changes in its environment and is robust to mild violations of its world model, thanks to dynamic internal desired goal generation. While the present results are limited to synthetic settings (2D and 3D activated versions of dSprites), which fall short of real-world levels of complexity, the proposed architecture shows how to manipulate grounded object representations, as a key inductive bias for unsupervised learning, to enable behavioral reasoning.

                Background Sleep disturbances frequently occur in concomitance with chronic pain, exacerbating its detrimental effects and diminishing patients’ quality of life. Although various studies have explored the relationship between chronic pain and sleep disturbances, comprehensive evidence on detailed assessment methods and their bidirectional interactions remains limited. This scoping review aimed to examine the characteristics and prevalence of assessment methods for sleep and pain-related outcomes in individuals with chronic pain. Methods A comprehensive search of nine databases identified observational and interventional studies examining the relationship between sleep disturbances/disorders and chronic pain in adults. A literature search was conducted in MEDLINE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Embase, PsycINFO, Web of Science, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) as well as gray literature sources, Open Grey. In addition, the following trial registries were searched for ongoing or unpublished trials: the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov. Results This review included 81 of 3,513 studies. Approximately 90.1% of studies relied on self-report sleep assessments, whereas only 9.9% incorporated objective measures. Additionally, 7.4% of studies used a combination of self-report and objective sleep assessments. The visual analog and numeric rating scales were the most frequently used methods for assessing pain-related outcomes (59.3%). Despite extensive research on sleep and chronic pain, critical gaps persist, particularly in the integration of multidimensional assessment tools. Conclusions This scoping review discovered imbalances in the content of both sleep and pain assessments. Future studies should integrate both objective and self-report assessment tools to provide a more comprehensive understanding of this interaction.

                Background University dropout among indigenous students is a multifactorial phenomenon that significantly impacts education and equity. This systematic review aimed to consolidate global evidence on risk and protective factors associated with university dropout among indigenous populations. Methods A systematic review was conducted following PRISMA 2020 criteria, encompassing ten databases (Web of Science, Scopus, LILACS, Dialnet, PubMed/MEDLINE, Redalyc, Scielo, DOAJ, Latindex, and CLASE) from October 29, 2024, to November 30, 2024. Out of 23,403 initial records, 21 studies met the inclusion criteria, analyzing indigenous university students and their educational trajectories. Two independent reviewers conducted the study selection and data extraction, ensuring minimized bias. Variables included demographic characteristics, geographic context, academic field, dropout rates, and related factors. Results were synthesized through descriptive analysis, focusing on quantitative data. Results Among the 226,049 participants across 21 studies, only 2,340 (1.03%) were indigenous university students, predominantly from South America (9/21 studies). The average dropout rate was 33.59%, ranging from 20% to 66%, with the highest rates reported among female students in six studies (28.57%). However, three studies highlighted higher dropout rates among male students (14.29%). Economic barriers were the primary risk factor (85.7%), followed by linguistic challenges (47.6%) and geographic limitations (33.3%). Protective factors included financial support (76.2%), academic mentorship (47.6%), and social support (42.8%). Public universities accounted for most participants (17/21 studies), with limited representation from private institutions. Despite significant dropout rates, only seven studies provided detailed prevalence data. Conclusion This review highlights systemic inequities contributing to indigenous university dropout, emphasizing economic, linguistic, and geographic barriers. While financial support and mentorship are effective interventions, their implementation remains inconsistent. Addressing these disparities through targeted policies, culturally inclusive curricula, and equitable resource distribution is essential to reducing dropout rates and fostering academic retention among indigenous students.

                Background In the present paper, assuming every module H is unitary and every ring S is commutative with identity, we address the concepts of bounded modules and Endo-R.B.modules. We provide some examples, corollaries, remarks, and properties our new concept. An Endo-R.B S-module is considered to be more powerful than bounded module and Endo-R.B module that will present both of them in some details in the introduction. Motivated by these notions, we introduce and discuss a new class of modules called the Endo-Greatly Bounded module (abbreviated as Endo-G.B. module), a concept which has not been previously reported in the literature. Methods We formally define the Endo-G.B. module and provide examples, corollaries, and properties to illustrate this new concept. The study employs scalar modules and fully invariant submodules as crucial tools to establish connections. It must be emphasized that scalar modules and prime played a major role in achieving new results in this paper. We specifically investigate the important relationships between an Endo-G.B module and prime module as well as their generalizations. Results We get and prove that every Endo-G.B. module is Bounded, where as the converse is not generally true. Furthermore, we establish new results connecting our new class of S-modules to cyclic bounded modules, projective modules, multiplication modules, and finitely annihilated modules. We also derive necessary and sufficient conditions for an Endo-G.B. module to exhibit specific flexible properties. Conclusions In this paper, we presented a new class of S- modules called Endo-greatly bounded modules, these findings highlight the depth and flexibility of Endo-G.B. modules with in modern algebraic frameworks. This study opens new directions for further research in module theory, particularly in exploring the interaction between bounded ness and endomorphism structures, and may motivate future algebraic investigations in commutative algebra.

                Background Credit card fraud detection remains a major challenge because of the highly imbalanced nature of transaction data. Conventional supervised models often suffer from low recall or high false positive rates, whereas unsupervised methods lack precision. Methods In this study, we propose a hybrid anomaly detection framework that combines an unsupervised autoencoder trained on normal transactions to capture reconstruction error patterns with a supervised XGBoost classifier trained on the same dataset. The hybrid system integrates both scores via an optimized thresholding mechanism to balance sensitivity and specificity. We evaluated the model on the publicly available Kaggle creditcard.csv dataset comprising 284,807 transactions, with only 492 labelled fraudulent. Results The proposed model achieved superior performance, with a recall of 0.9250, precision of 0.9569, F1-score of 0.9407, and Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of 0.9407, with an accuracy of 0.9998, surpassing the results of similar published models using the same dataset. Conclusions This framework provides a practical, reproducible, high-performance solution for detecting financial fraud. The code, model configuration, and data-processing pipeline were made available to support transparency and future research.

                <p>by Thomas Bonte, Oriane Pourcelot, Adham Safieddine, Floric Slimani, Florian Mueller, Dominique Weil, Edouard Bertrand, Thomas Walter</p>

The cell cycle is a series of regulated stages during which a cell grows, replicates its DNA, and divides. It consists of four phases – two growth phases (G1 and G2), a replication phase (S), and a division phase (M) – each characterized by distinct transcriptional programs and impacting most other cellular processes. In imaging assays, the cell cycle phase can be identified using specific cell-cycle markers. However, the use of dedicated cell-cycle markers can be impractical or even prohibitive, as they occupy fluorescent channels that may be needed for other reporters. To address this limitation we propose a method to infer the cell cycle phase from a widely used fluorescent reporter: SiR-DNA, thereby bypassing the need for phase-specific markers while leveraging information already present in common experimental setups. Our method is based on a Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE), enhanced with two auxiliary tasks: predicting the average intensity of phase-specific markers and enforcing temporal consistency through latent space regularization. The reconstruction task ensures that the latent space captures cell cycle–relevant features, while the temporal constraint promotes biological plausibility. The resulting model, CC-VAE, classifies cell cycle phases with high accuracy from widely used DNA markers and can thus be applied to high-content screening datasets not specifically designed for cell cycle analysis. CC-VAE is freely available, along with a new, publicly released dataset comprising over 600,000 labeled HeLa Kyoto nuclear images to support further development and benchmarking in the community.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1013217">How cells tame noise while maintaining ultrasensitive transcriptional responses</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Eui Min Jeong, Chang Yoon Chung, Jae Kyoung Kim</p>

Ultrasensitive transcriptional switches are essential for converting gradual molecular inputs into decisive gene expression responses, enabling critical behaviors such as bistability and oscillations. While cooperative binding, relying on direct repressor-DNA binding, has been classically regarded as a key ultrasensitivity mechanism, recent theoretical works have demonstrated that combinations of indirect repression mechanisms—sequestration, blocking, and displacement—can also achieve ultrasensitive switches with greater robustness to transcriptional noise. However, these previous works have neglected key biological constraints such as DNA binding kinetics and the limited availability of transcriptional activators, raising the question of whether ultrasensitivity and noise robustness can be sustained under biologically realistic conditions. Here, we systematically assess the impact of these factors on ultrasensitivity and noise robustness under physiologically plausible conditions. We show that while various repression combinations can reduce noise, only the full combination of all three indirect mechanisms consistently maintains low noise and high ultrasensitivity. As a result, biological oscillators employing this triple repression architecture retain precise rhythmic switching even under high noise, and even when activators are shared across thousands of target genes. Our findings offer a mechanistic explanation for the frequent co-occurrence of these repression mechanisms in natural gene regulatory systems.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3003564">Plasmid streamlining drives the extinction of antibiotic resistance plasmids under selection for horizontal transmission</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Andrew C. Matthews, Sonja Lehtinen, Tatiana Dimitriu</p>

Conjugative plasmids carrying antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes are critical for the spread of AMR, due to their ability to transmit horizontally between bacterial hosts. We previously observed that during experimental evolution in the presence of abundant susceptible <i>Escherichia coli</i> hosts, the AMR plasmid R1 rapidly evolves variants with increased horizontal transmission due to mutations causing increased plasmid copy number. Yet AMR was progressively lost from the evolving populations. Here, we show that AMR loss was associated with evolution of streamlined plasmids in which the AMR region is spontaneously deleted, making plasmid carriage undetectable by plating on selective antibiotic-containing media. These plasmids transmit both vertically and horizontally more efficiently than the ancestral AMR plasmid, driving AMR extinction in bacterial populations and effectively acting as an intrinsic defence against AMR plasmids. A simple model of plasmid competition further shows that any horizontal or vertical transmission advantage conferred by plasmid streamlining would be enough to drive the displacement of competing AMR plasmids, with a given horizontal transmission advantage leading to faster replacement in conditions favoring horizontal transmission. Our results suggest that within-host plasmid evolution or engineered streamlined plasmids could be exploited to limit the spread of AMR in natural populations of bacteria.

                <p>by Kevin F. P. Bennett, Andrew W. Wood, Marcella D. Baiz, Lan-Nhi Phung, Irby J. Lovette, David P. L. Toews</p>

Introgression between species has the potential to shape evolutionary trajectories in important ways, but uncovering complex introgression dynamics has only recently been made possible by advances in genomics. Warblers of the avian family Parulidae exemplify rapid diversification and sexual trait divergence, and we endeavored to study historical introgression in the family. We sequenced multiple genomes of nearly every species, constructed a phylogeny for the family, and investigated gene flow across the genome and at genes known for controlling feather color. We found that DNA haplotypes including the gene <i>BCO2</i>, which encodes an enzyme that degrades yellow carotenoids, have spread among genera multiple times—from <i>Vermivora</i> to <i>Geothlypis</i> and from <i>Leiothlypis</i> to multiple <i>Cardellina</i> and <i>Setophaga</i> species. Patterns of inheritance in the latter case point to introgression that occurred 0.5 to 2 million years ago, and the shared haplotype among recipient species is less than 100 nucleotides long. Separately, we found evidence of introgression from red <i>Cardellina</i> species to both of the two red <i>Myioborus</i> species at <i>BDH1L</i> and from one red <i>Myioborus</i> species to the other at <i>CYP2J19</i>; both are key genes in the pathway that converts yellow carotenoids to red ketocarotenoids. Our results show that introgression is a common mechanism for the evolution of colorful plumage in parulid warblers and hint at complex histories of gene flow behind some of the Western Hemisphere’s most colorful birds.

                <p>by Qiu C. Wu, Aishwarya Swaminathan, Ashley Winward, Logan Lalonde, Yung Hwang, Noah Littman, Merav Socolovsky, Allon M. Klein</p>

Red blood cell production is regulated by erythropoietin (Epo), maintaining tissue oxygen tension in the steady state and in response to stress. To date, only a handful of factors other than Epo are known to stimulate erythropoiesis, limiting therapeutic options. We recently found that IL-17, a pleiotropic pro-inflammatory cytokine, interacts synergistically with Epo to increase formation of erythroid colonies <i>in vitro</i>. Here, we administered IL-17 to mice to determine whether it accelerates erythropoiesis <i>in vivo</i>. We found that while IL-17 alone had little effect on erythroid and other hematopoietic lineages, combined treatment with both IL-17 and Epo generated a specific and strong synergistic response in erythroid progenitors that significantly increased erythropoietic rate. IL-17 administration also accelerated the erythropoietic response of mice to hypoxia. Single-cell transcriptomic analysis showed that IL-17 acts by sensitizing erythroid progenitors to Epo, rather than through a distinct transcriptional response. Using a dynamical model, we propose that this mechanism optimizes conflicting requirements in the regulation of erythropoiesis, balancing the need for low-cost maintenance of the steady state, with a sufficiently fast stress response. Further, our findings suggest a potentially broadly applicable mechanism whereby pleiotropic cytokines are able to exert lineage-specific effects when their actions are dependent on synergism with lineage-specific factors.

                Monoaminergic neurotransmission has long been recognized as essential for the development, maintenance, and plasticity of the nervous system, with classical models defining serotonin, dopamine, and histamine as extracellular messengers acting through cell surface receptors. Broadening this view, emerging evidence reveals that biogenic amines also covalently modify proteins, a process termed ‘monoaminylation’, to directly influence intracellular signaling. The discovery of non-canonical monoamine signaling across subcellular compartments offers new insights into brain–body communication. Here, we review the evolving signaling landscape of protein monoaminylations and highlight new chemical–biological tools for probing their impact on neural development, plasticity, and disease.

                In brief, Rubio et al. demonstrate that Helios is expressed by exhausted CD8+ T cells and favors the progression from exhausted progenitor (Tpex) into terminally exhausted (Tex) cells, limiting anti-tumor immune responses. Helios inhibition, by genetic or pharmacological approaches, improves anti-tumoral responses by expanding the pool of Tpex cells.

                Preza et al. show that DEC1, a circadian clock regulator, promotes mature insulin responses to glucose stimulation in human stem cell-derived islet organoids. DEC1 is restricted to maturing β cells, where it regulates circadian insulin responsiveness, respiration, and mitochondrial turnover, highlighting circadian control as a lever to enhance islet organoid functionality.

                Brown adipose tissue is extensively vascularized, which is essential for its physiological activities. Li et al. show that nutrient/stress-sensing O-GlcNAc signaling in brown adipocytes dynamically adapts to environmental stimuli to stimulate brown adipose tissue vascularization and thermogenesis via a KCP-mediated paracrine mechanism.

                Using a zebrafish model of brain infection, Hayes et al. find that mycobacteria infect the brain not within macrophages, but as extracellular bacteria that attach to endothelial cells of the blood-brain barrier. Using a glycolipid, mycobacteria trigger the opening of gaps in endothelial cell junctions, allowing transit into the brain.

                Sleep promotes memory by reorganizing cortical circuits. Rolle et al. discovered that VIP interneurons, which regulate inhibition, are suppressed during slow-wave sleep but activated during spindles and slow oscillations. Their unique infraslow coupling to spindles, absent in SST and PV interneurons, suggests a specialized role in memory consolidation.

                Tarcsay, Masala, et al. designed a behavioral task that requires mice to either discriminate or generalize between contexts to receive rewards. They report that the extent of hippocampal context representation increases when context is behaviorally relevant (discrimination). Such modulation primarily impacts the spatiotemporal code of place cells.

Bandi et al. demonstrate that parietal cortex is causally required for maintaining high-performance states during auditory localization. Parietal cortex population activity distinguishes performance states and exhibits enhanced correlational structure only during the high-performance state, unlike primary auditory cortex.

">Pial collaterals propagate neurovascular responses across functional units</a></h4>

              
                Neurovascular coupling refers to the regulation of cerebral blood flow in response to neuronal activity, a process forming the basis for multiple functional neuroimaging techniques. However, the mechanisms that coordinate neurovascular responses across distinct cortical arterial territories remain poorly understood. Here we show that pial collaterals, arterio-arterial connections traditionally considered dormant under physiological conditions, serve as active conduits that propagate neurovascular signals between adjacent cortical territories and functional units. We demonstrate that neuronal activity in the somatosensory cortex triggers direct vascular signaling via endothelial Kir2.1 channels through pial collaterals, synchronizing blood flow responses beyond the activated area. The loss of pial collaterals abolished inter-territorial coupling without affecting local neurovascular responses. These results reveal that pial collaterals are critical regulators of cerebral perfusion.

">Insular cortex predictions regulate glucose homeostasis</a></h4>

              
                Brain-body interactions are essential for physical and emotional homeostasis. The brain uses information from the external world to predict upcoming bodily changes. This process involves interoceptive predictions, which are thought to play a central role in brain-body interactions. Yet there is little direct experimental evidence causally linking interoceptive predictions to regulation of bodily physiology. Here we address this by focusing on insular cortex and glucose homeostasis. We find that just before the onset of a meal, insular cortex exhibits a transient burst of activity, reflecting a prediction of the future metabolic state. This transient predictive burst of activity is essential for anticipatory insulin release, subsequent post-meal insulin release, post-meal glucose and lipid homeostasis, and post-meal metabolism signaling in the liver. Our results highlight that insular cortex predictive computations are essential for anticipatory physiological control and for subsequently maintaining metabolic homeostasis.

">Altered Brain Network Topology during Successful Response Inhibition in Children with Binge Eating</a></h4>

              
                Aim: Although a risk factor for the later development of eating disorders, few studies examine the neural underpinnings of binge eating (BE) in children. Preliminary evidence suggests a role of the corticostriatal system; the purpose of this study was to evaluate the role of the inhibitory control brain network for risk of BE in children. Methods: Data from 65 children with BE (57% girls) and 84 matched controls (52% girls) from the 4.0 baseline release of the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study were included. Stop Signal Task-based fMRI data were analyzed using graph theoretic techniques. Global and nodal network properties (e.g. efficiency, betweenness-centrality) were compared for between-group differences and sex-by-group interactions. Results: Despite comparable behavioral performance, children with BE showed significantly increased nodal efficiency of the right postcentral gyrus and left middle frontal gyrus (MFG), and increased connectedness of the right postcentral gyrus compared to control children. Children with BE showed distinct network hubs including the right MFG and left insula, while controls had distinct hubs in the right orbitofrontal and left fusiform gyri. Group-specific sex differences were found in the functioning of insular and frontal cortices. Conclusion: Increased efficiency and connectedness in frontal and parietal nodes of the inhibitory control network functioning in children with BE may represent a vulnerability for overeating. Distinct sex differences in functioning in children with BE compared to control children may reflect specific vulnerabilities to BE in the inhibitory control system in boys and girls that may contribute to sex differences in prevalence.

">Brain Dynamics During the Resting State</a></h4>

              
                Functional MRI in the absence of tasks reveals dynamic large-scale configurations. Yet important gaps in our understanding remain: (1) What type of dynamics are observed during brain states? (2) What type of dynamics are observed between brain states? We address these questions by developing a multi-level Switching Linear Dynamical System (SLDS) model, which jointly estimates state-specific equations of motion and probabilistic state transitions. Within states, the inferred dynamics were stable attractors: model estimated fixed points closely matched observed fMRI activity. A central finding was that dynamic states did not map one-to-one onto canonical static large-scale networks; instead, the relationship was many-to-many, with each state engaging multiple networks and each network participating in several states. For example, a default-mode related state also engaged attention/control net-works. Between states, transitions were structured (i.e., non-random) and heterogeneous. While some state transitions were relatively abrupt in terms of fMRI activity change (e.g., between a default-related network and an attention/control-related network), others were much smoother. Indeed, vector-field analyses in latent space quantified both toggle-like (abrupt) switches and smoother changes, revealing distinct transition pathways. To link systems-level organization to brain regions, we introduced region-level dynamics importance and state transition importance measures. Subcortical regions, particularly basal ganglia structures, dominated the dynamics of the highest-occupancy state, suggesting corticostriatal loops may scaffold a baseline regime from which excursions into other states arise. Importantly, regions most influential for within-state dynamics sometimes differed from those driving state transitions, demonstrating that fMRI signal magnitude alone does not uniquely uncover how regions contribute to system-level properties. Our SLDS framework provides a principled bridge between discrete-state and continuous-trajectory perspectives of resting state dynamics, clarifying what the brain does while in a state and how it moves between states during rest.

">Corticofugal gated recurrency captures auditory cortical responses</a></h4>

              
                Memory is essential for the neural processing of natural sounds. It has been proposed that cortical memory is subserved by gated recurrency, a powerful machine learning method that enables memory of sequential dependencies. However, standard forms lack biological realism. We built a computational model using a subtractive form of gated recurrency, consistent with cortical circuitry and feedback that resembles corticofugal projections. This architecture outperformed state-of-the-art models with delay lines or non-biological gated recurrency at predicting auditory cortical responses to natural sounds. Its performance was further improved by incorporating a network layer that mirrors the high neuronal density in superficial cortical layers. Analyzing the model, we found that memory retention is longer in secondary than in primary auditory cortex, and that gated recurrency particularly helps capture responses during abrupt changes and quiet periods in the sounds. This work lays out the fundamental functional circuitry of the auditory pathway for processing the sequential dependencies in natural sounds.

">Thermodynamics of consciousness: A non-invasive perturbational framework</a></h4>

              
                The quest for reliable and objective measures of consciousness is critical in basic and clinical neuroscience. Across species, the Perturbational Complexity Index (PCI) has emerged as a robust empirical marker by directly perturbing the brain, yet its underlying principles of physics are not fully understood. Here, we bridge this gap by introducing a non-invasive framework based on generative whole-brain models of non-equilibrium brain dynamics. Using these models, we identified violations of the Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem (FDT) in humans and rodents across wakefulness, anesthesia, and disorders of consciousness. Mirroring the patterns observed with PCI, we found decreased FDT violations in unresponsive disorders of consciousness and anesthesia compared to conscious conditions. This reveals a close link between PCI and non-equilibrium dynamics in spontaneous brain signals, grounding PCI in fundamental principles of physics. Overall, this framework offers new complementary, non-invasive, model-based avenues for understanding the nature of consciousness and for developing objective tools to assess its loss and recovery in health and disease. It also provides a principled foundation for discovering novel strategies to restore consciousness.

">Non-uniform effects of remaining field spread on the estimation of M/EEG activity and connectivity between regions of interest</a></h4>

              
                In M/EEG analyses, it is often convenient to extract time series of activity originating from the regions of interest (ROIs). However, due to the spread of electric and magnetic fields, M/EEG recordings capture activity from all sources within the brain. Commonly used approaches for the extraction of ROI activity only partially alleviate this problem, and field spread remains a challenge even at the level of ROI time series. Because of the remaining field spread (RFS), the extracted time series captures activity not only from the considered ROI but also from other regions (not necessarily neighboring ones). The amount of RFS can strongly affect the validity of interpretations: with more RFS, the extracted time series becomes less representative of the ROI. However, neither the amount nor the pattern of RFS is usually known. In this study, we apply the cross-talk function (CTF) to analyze contributions of all sources across the brain to the extracted ROI time series, thereby quantifying the degree of RFS. With CTF, we show that the effect of RFS on the extraction of ROI activity and on the estimation of inter-regional connectivity is highly non-uniform across the cortex. In particular, ROIs farther away from the recording sensors are more likely to capture activity and connectivity from other areas. Finally, we validate this observation in simulations and complement it by investigating spurious and ghost interactions in real data. Overall, our results illustrate how CTF can be used as a diagnostic tool to quantify the effects of RFS and to evaluate pipelines for the extraction of ROI activity.

">Spatiotemporal Network Dynamics Reveal Alzheimer's Disease Progression</a></h4>

              
                Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by progressive disruptions in large-scale brain networks that precede cognitive decline, yet conventional functional connectivity analyses often fail to detect disruptions in coordination among large-scale brain networks that may be critical for early detection. This study leverages quasi periodic patterns (QPPs) and complex principal component analysis (cPCA) to characterize spatiotemporal network alterations across longitudinally stable (normal cognitive, mild cognitive impairment, dementia of Alzheimer's type) and transitioning (normal cognitive to mild cognitive impairment, mild cognitive impairment to dementia of Alzheimer's type) cohorts from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative using resting state fMRI. QPPs were used to derive recurrent spatiotemporal templates and network integrity measures at the intrinsic connectivity network level, while cPCA decomposed Hilbert transformed time series into complex valued patterns that capture amplitude and phase relationships. Nonparametric group comparisons revealed a structured trajectory in which limbic, subcortical, and higher cognition networks, including triple network components, are affected early, followed by progressive disruption in visual, cerebellar, sensorimotor, and additional triple network systems. Transitioning cohorts showed many of these alterations before formal diagnostic conversion, indicating that spatiotemporal signatures carry preclinical information. QPP based metrics were particularly sensitive to limbic and subcortical degradation, whereas cPCA emphasized changes in higher order, visual, and cerebellar patterns, revealing complementary aspects of the same underlying pathology. These findings extend prior QPP only work and highlight the utility of combining QPP and cPCA based measures as a dynamic, network-level biomarker framework for AD progression. with potential applications in early detection, characterizing disease trajectories, and treatment monitoring.

Patients commonly present with epilepsy and TSC-associated neuropsychiatric disorders (TANDs), including intellectual disability and anxiety. Our previous work identified anxiety-like behavior in tsc2vu242 zebrafish mutants, characterized by enhanced thigmotaxis. We found that anxiety-like behavior in tsc2vu242 zebrafish mutants was rescued by Rac1 inhibitors. These findings prompted further investigation into Rac1 signaling in the context of TSC pathology. Using G-LISA and FRET live imaging, we confirmed elevated Rac1 activity in the mutant brains. Rac1 activity was reduced following NSC23766 and EHT1864 treatment. Compared to wild-type controls, Rac1 activity in mutants was elevated by 50% in untreated animals, and reduced by ~30-40% after Rac1 inhibitors. Moreover, aberrant connectivity between brain hemispheres that correlated with anxiety before was restored after Rac1 inhibition. Transcriptomic profiling revealed 1,260 DEGs between homozygous and heterozygous tsc2vu242 zebrafish. Rac1 inhibition restored the expression of approximately 1,000 genes toward wild-type levels. KEGG pathway analysis identified significant enrichment in mTOR signaling and focal adhesion, while GO terms highlighted processes including axon guidance, axonogenesis, and neuronal projection. Collectively, our findings support a functional role for Rac1 in TSC pathology, linking cytoskeletal dysregulation with aberrant axon development and anxiety-like behavior. Rac1 inhibition emerges as a promising therapeutic avenue for modulating both brain structure and function in TSC-associated anxiety.

">Pre-clinical validation of a novel AAV-mediated gene therapy for KCNV2 retinopathy improves visual function in a mouse model and expression in patient organoids</a></h4>

              
                Voltage-gated (Kv) potassium channels are critical for neuronal physiology, and their dysfunction can lead to serious consequences. For example, mutations in the silent modulatory Kv8.2 subunit are known to cause irreversible inherited blindness (KCNV2 retinopathy). This is a currently incurable condition that causes lifelong visual loss, reduced visual acuity, photoaversion, night blindness and abnormal colour vision, alongside a distinctive supernormal electrophysiological (ERG) retinal response to light. In this study, we demonstrate that AAV-mediated gene replacement therapy delivering a codon-optimised human KCNV2 gene subretinally into Kv8.2 knock-out mice significantly restores retinal function. Treated mice exhibited improved ERG responses and correct expression of KCNV2 and its encoded Kv8.2 protein in photoreceptors. Recovery of visually guided scotopic and photopic optomotor responses to wildtype levels was achieved at lower vector doses, highlighting dose-dependent efficacy. Furthermore, treatment of human retinal organoids derived from a KCNV2 patient iPSC line resulted in substantial Kv8.2 protein rescue. This work provides the first preclinical proof-of-concept for the safety and therapeutic potential of gene therapy for KCNV2 retinopathy, laying a strong foundation for future clinical trials.

">Modularity in the DCC extracellular domain elicits distinct effects on axon guidance</a></h4>

              
                Complex neuronal circuits arise from a small set of cell-surface receptors that position neurons, promote axon extension, and define synaptic connections. A central receptor is Deleted in Colon Cancer (DCC), which mediates both short- and long-range axon guidance and confines migrating neurons to the central nervous system. DCC's versatility reflects its ability to interact at distinct sites of its extracellular domain with two ligands, Netrin-1 and Draxin, which also bind to each other. Alternative splicing further alters the Netrin-1 binding site and modulates affinity. By generating two mouse lines with mutations that selectively impair DCC binding to Netrin-1 and/or Draxin, we show that molecular modularity within the DCC extracellular domain is essential for precise circuit assembly. An eight-amino acid insertion in the DCClong isoform is required for Netrin-1-dependent long-range commissural axon guidance in the spinal cord. Conversely, isoleucine 372 in the Draxin binding site enables DCC clustering and is necessary for all known DCC functions, including axon guidance in the spinal cord and retina and neuronal migration in the brainstem. Draxin also supports long-range commissural guidance, but mutations in its binding site cause stronger defects. These results underscore how DCC's distinct modules drive specific developmental responses.

">Activation of cannabinoid receptor CB1 leads to aberrant myelination in development</a></h4>

              
                The endocannabinoid system (ECS) has a widespread role in the development and function of the central nervous system (CNS). Cannabinoid receptors like CB1 and CB2 can be activated with exogenous cannabinoids most popularly known as tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) or cannabis and cannabidiol (CBD). The components of the ECS are expressed early in fetal development, and prenatal exposure to cannabis can lead to structural changes in white matter. White matter is composed of neuronal axons ensheathed in myelin, a lipid-rich insulation that facilitates saltatory conduction and maintains axon integrity. In the CNS, myelin is made by specialized glial cells called oligodendrocytes (OLs), which in addition to neurons also express components of the ECS. However, while several studies have focused on how the ECS regulates neuronal development, there is a limited understanding of its impact on OL development or myelin formation. Therefore, our current study set out to understand how pharmacological activation of the ECS alters OL differentiation and myelin formation in vivo. We administered WIN 55,212-2 (WIN 55), a CB1 and CB2 agonist, to larval zebrafish and longitudinally analyzed OL development and myelination in vivo. Interestingly, we observed an increase in non-axonal ensheathments in the spinal cord, which appeared to be surrounding neuronal cell bodies. These non-axonal ensheathments were dependent on CB1, as the addition of WIN 55 in a global CB1 mutant prevented this phenotype. Furthermore, this ectopic cell body ensheathment occurred independently from normal myelination processes, as individual OLs did not exhibit changes in the number of myelin sheaths, sheath length, or total myelin output. This study shows that activation of CB receptors in vivo leads to increased non-axonal ensheathment without significantly changing OL differentiation or normal myelin formation. Future studies can further investigate the pathways that drive this phenotype to better understand how exogenous cannabinoid activation can regulate the precision of oligodendrocyte ensheathment.

">Distributed neural dynamics underlie the shift from movement preparation to execution</a></h4>

              
                Dissociating the neural mechanisms of movement preparation from those of execution across the brain is fundamental to understanding motor control. Invasive recordings in primary motor cortex (M1) indicate that shared neural populations support both phases by unfolding within orthogonal subspaces or "manifolds", yet whether and how these dynamics evolve across the broader set of brain regions involved in memory-guided skilled action remains poorly understood. Here, we used magnetoencephalography (MEG) data obtained during a memory-guided delayed finger-sequence task to track fast population dynamics across M1, premotor cortices, and the hippocampus. Linear discriminant analysis decoding of sequence-specific preparatory and execution patterns revealed a transition from preparation to execution patterns across all regions prior to movement onset. Importantly, the onset of execution exhibited region-specific timing, with M1 shifting last, {approx} 100 ms before the first button press, consistent with the established cortical motor hierarchy. Low-dimensional trajectories showed that preparatory and execution states occupied distinct manifolds, yet were not fully orthogonal, suggesting partial overlap in tuning. MEG dynamics were dominated by peri-movement phase activity in primary motor and premotor regions. Nevertheless, above-chance sequence decoding was recoverable from all motor and premotor regions during execution, and in M1 during preparation. The state shift and the decoding accuracy was driven by distributed modulations across multiple frequency bands, indicating that full-band population dynamics carry richer information than band-limited features alone. These results demonstrate that non-invasive MEG can resolve continuous, hierarchical neural state transitions in the human brain in the context of memory-guided movement control. They offer mechanistic insight into distributed motor-related brain dynamics and support developing brain-computer-interfaces that incorporate signals from multiple brain regions beyond the primary motor cortex.

">PKC-dependent MYRF dysregulation links Aβ pathology to oligodendrocyte, myelin and cognitive alterations in Alzheimer's disease</a></h4>

              
                Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized not only by neuronal loss and synaptic dysfunction but also by emerging evidence of oligodendrocyte and myelin pathology. Amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}), a hallmark of AD, disrupts oligodendrocyte homeostasis through mechanisms that remain poorly understood. Here, we investigated the role of the myelin regulatory factor (MYRF), a transcription factor essential for oligodendrocyte maturation, in AD-related glial dysfunction. Using the 3xTg-AD mouse model, we observed aberrantly induced maturation dynamics and reduced oligodendrocyte lineage cell density at 12 months in the dentate gyrus, accompanied by increased MYRF expression. Interestingly, sustained MYRF overexpression was found to be toxic for oligodendrocytes in vitro. Moreover, in vitro and in vivo experiments further demonstrated that A{beta} exposure elevates MYRF protein levels and enhances its transcriptional activity, pointing to post-translational regulation. Mechanistically, A{beta} impaired GSK3-dependent phosphorylation and Fbxw7-mediated ubiquitination of MYRF, prolonging N-MYRF stability, an effect prevented by PKC inhibition in vitro. Intracerebroventricular infusion of PKC inhibitor Go6983 normalized MYRF levels, restored oligodendrocyte populations and myelin integrity, and improved hippocampal-dependent spatial learning in 3xTg-AD mice, with locomotor activity and anxiety-like behavior remaining unaffected. Together, these findings identify MYRF dysregulation as a mechanistic link between A{beta}/PKC signaling and oligodendrocyte pathology, and highlight PKC inhibition as a potential strategy to restore oligodendroglial function and cognition in AD.

">Offline cerebello-cortico-striatal dynamics predict motor strategy exploration and retention in skill learning</a></h4>

              
                Learning a motor skill requires exploring multiple possible solutions to find and retain an optimal strategy. The exploration and consolidation of the motor strategy are usually considered to be segregated respectively between task practice and rest periods. Here we show that two types of offline reactivations of neuronal representations of locomotor strategies in a brain-wide motor circuit are associated with exploration and retention. During short rests between trials, replays of these brainwide representations predict subsequent shifts in strategies indicating that distributed offline processes participate in strategy exploration. Shifts in strategy are consolidated, and their retention follows population reactivation in cerebellar sleep spindles and stabilization of cerebello-cerebral functional connectivity patterns, consistent with the role of spindles in brain plasticity. Overall, motor strategy optimization and consolidation are supported by two intertwined but distinct types of offline distributed reactivation events involving interregional interactions.

">Artificial hibernation uncovers distinct synaptic engram architecture for memory retention</a></h4>

              
                The memory trace at the neuronal and synaptic levels remains controversial. Stable, larger spines are thought to support memory, but the high turnover of dendritic spines and the drifting of neuronal representations following memory formation suggest alternative possibilities. To elucidate a structural trace underlying memory retention, we utilize a mouse model of artificial hibernation. During hibernation, hippocampal neurons exhibited a substantial reduction in their activity and an extensive elimination of dendritic spines and synapses. Despite these changes, their memory and associated hippocampal neuronal representations are intact after arousal. We find that a subset of spines is maintained during hibernation. These spatially clustered engram-engram synapses are exclusively protected from elimination and characterized by synaptic contacts with multi-synaptic boutons. These findings suggest that synaptic engram architecture, rather than larger spines per se, is resilient to network remodeling and underlies long-term memory retention.

">Soluble epoxide hydrolase upregulation in Alzheimer's disease promotes blood-brain barrier dysfunction</a></h4>

              
                Recent advances in anti-amyloid therapies for Alzheimer's disease have been promising, but they have also highlighted critical challenges, including increased vascular complications, such as amyloid-related imaging abnormalities. Emerging evidence suggests that the soluble epoxide hydrolase may be a promising therapeutic target due to the involvement of sEH-derived diols in inflammation, oxidative stress, and vascular destabilization. APPPS1 mice were crossed with an inducible soluble epoxide hydrolase knock-out mouse line. The knock-out was induced before onset of amyloid deposition, and then the mice were analyzed using histological, molecular, and RNA sequencing techniques. Here, we identify astrocytic soluble epoxide hydrolase as a key mediator of vascular instability in Alzheimer's disease. Targeted astrocyte-specific deletion of soluble epoxide hydrolase in APPPS1 mice dramatically mitigated vascular changes, reducing the vascular amyloid burden by 67.95% and preserving VE-cadherin architecture. Importantly, vasomotion was markedly impaired in the Alzheimer's disease model and was preserved in soluble epoxide hydrolase-deficient animals. Transcriptomic profiling of vasculature in APPPS1xsEH{Delta}AC mice revealed upregulated expression of genes critical for neurovascular protection. These findings identify soluble epoxide hydrolase as a central regulator of neurovascular dysfunction and underscore its therapeutic potential in increasing vascular stability in Alzheimer's disease.

">Ischemic injury triggers a protective microglial phenotype in models of Aβ pathology</a></h4>

              
                Microglia are highly plastic cells that are capable of integrating subsequent insults. As the majority of Alzheimers Disease (AD) patients also show cerebrovascular pathology, we here aimed to dissect the interactions between AD and ischemic brain injury on the microglial response to amyloid beta pathology. Surprisingly, we find that ischemic stroke in the presence of cerebral amyloid beta-amyloidosis results in the generation of a novel neuroprotective microglial phenotype. These microglia drive a rapid accumulation of highly dense amyloid beta plaques that exhibit a relatively benign nature and are strikingly similar to Amyloid beta plaques observed in patients that are resilient to AD pathology. Thus, our data do not only highlight the impact of a co-morbid state of brain ischemia and amyloid beta pathology on the microglial phenotype but also identify novel molecular pathways that may serve to promote beneficial microglial functions in AD.

">Inter- and intra-individual differences in brain sex map to neuroendocrine profiles</a></h4>

              
                Sex hormone fluctuations modulate structural and functional brain dynamics, yet little is known how sex steroid levels map onto the expression of sex differences in the brain. Here, we trained machine learning models for brain sex classification based on anatomical structures in cross-sectional data of N = 1090 individuals (50% females, age matched). Applied to dense sampled data of one male and two females in different hormonal states (naturally cycling, oral contraceptive user, pregnancy), we linked inter- and intra-individual fluctuations in brain sex to neuroendocrine modulation. We found lower variation in brain sex across time in the male compared to the female subjects. Oral contraceptive use was associated with a more female-like brain, while (inverted) U-shaped brain sex trajectories emerged across menstrual cycle phases and pregnancy trimesters. Overall, our findings suggest that changes in brain sex capture hormone-related plasticity over time in dense sampled individuals.

">Systematic Errors in DC Offset Measurement and Mitigation at Neurostimulation Electrodes: Causes, Implications and Solutions</a></h4>

              
                Objective: Neuromodulation therapies are becoming increasingly common as a therapeutic strategy to treat neurological disorders and deficits. Despite their widespread use, the frameworks used to evaluate device longevity and electrochemical safety are limited, producing variable results for platinum (Pt) electrodes across studies. In addition, next-generation neuromodulation electrodes like thin-film microelectrode arrays (TFMEAs) are more prone to failure by virtue of their smaller size, higher edge to bulk ratios, and greater sensitivity to electrochemical dissolution processes. Two potential contributors to the variability in reported electrochemical safety limits and device performance are particularly sensitive to scaling electrodes to smaller geometries, namely: 1) insufficient measurement device input impedance and 2) unmitigated stimulator leakage currents. Approach: To explore these effects, we first characterize the impact of electrode size (1.27 x 10-4 to 7.85 x 10-3 cm2) on apparent open circuit potential (VaOCP) and interpulse potential (VIPP) measurements at platinum electrodes across measurement instrumentation configurations. Next, we evaluated the effectiveness of commonly used DC mitigation strategies, including stimulation with capacitive coupling (CC), and with capacitive coupling combined with cathode/anode shorting after each pulse (CC+ES), as a function of electrode size. Main Results: Without proper DC mitigation, insufficient measurement input impedance leads to an underestimation of DC offsets ({Delta}VIPP) and, consequently, overestimation of charge injection limit (Qinj) at Pt electrodes. In contrast, when DC offsets are properly mitigated and the input impedance of the measurement device is sufficient, the experimentally derived charge injection limits for Pt electrodes are larger than what has been reported historically. Significance: By identifying the instrumentation-related confounds biasing measurements of electrochemical safety limits, this work provides a more consistent basis for the assessment of Qinj for safety, as well as a framework for identifying and mitigating DC offset as a potential source of variability in electrophysiological findings across studies using TFMEAs.

">The circadian clock regulates scavenging of fluid-borne substrates by brain border-associated macrophages</a></h4>

              
                Circadian disruptions perturb the brain and immune system and increase the risk of developing Alzheimer's Disease (AD), yet whether this involves dysregulation of brain immunity remains less clear. Here, we perform single-cell RNA sequencing of the brain immune compartment around the day-night cycle and identify brain border-associated macrophages (BAMs) as highly rhythmic cells. During the rest phase, we find that BAMs exhibit coordinated upregulation of endocytic genes and enhanced uptake of extracellular fluid-borne material including amyloid-beta. Rhythmicity in BAM scavenging is regulated by the clock gene Bmal1, mediated by the endocytic receptor CD206, and perturbed with age. In a mouse model of AD, we show that deletion of Bmal1 in BAMs worsens perivascular and leptomeningeal amyloid-beta plaque burden. Our results identify endocytosis as a specialized and rhythmic BAM function and identify perturbed timing of brain border immune functions as a potential mechanism by which circadian disruptions precipitate amyloidosis.

">Automated assessment of tDCS electrode placement accuracy based on structural MRI</a></h4>

              
                Purpose: Accurate electrode placement is essential for studies using transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) since it determines whether - and to which extent - the intended brain region was modulated. Precise electrode placement also reduces between-subject variability. Using in-scanner tDCS, accuracy and precision of electrode placement can be determined. Previous studies manually segmented electrode positions from structural MRI, a process that is time-consuming and prone to error. We therefore developed an algorithm that automatedly extracts electrode coordinates from structural MRI. Methods: We applied this algorithm to 49 datasets acquired at different field strengths (3 T and 7 T), with two image resolutions and electrode montages (bifrontal or ring-shaped) targeting the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. We validated its accuracy by comparing the automatedly extracted coordinates with manual annotations from two independent readers. We then used the actual and intended electrode coordinates to simulate how electrode placement deviations influenced the resulting electric field. Results: For all setups and scanners, the median localization error of the algorithm was 2.3 mm. It was within 1 mm of the variability between human readers (2.7 mm), indicating human-level reliability. Large deviations (> 20 mm) from intended positions led to substantial changes in the electric field - up to 35% for the ring-shaped montage - highlighting the need for placement verification in tDCS studies. Conclusion: The proposed algorithm obviates the need for manual electrode segmentation and allows an objective evaluation of electrode placement accuracy and precision for in-scanner tDCS. It may be used to relate electrode position errors to stimulation effects, thereby supporting reproducible tDCS research.

">Plasmalogen-Independent Neuroprotection: Synthetic alkyl ether lipids activate signaling to mitigate neuroinflammation and enhance cognitive function</a></h4>

              
                Neuroinflammation is a key driver of neurodegenerative disorders, with chronic activation of the NF-{kappa}B pathway contributing to neuronal dysfunction and disease progression. In this study, we report that KIT-8, a synthetic alkyl ether lipid, exerts potent anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects despite its inability to be converted into plasmalogens within cells unlike its analog KIT-13, which is known to generate plasmalogens. Remarkably, KIT-8 activates key intracellular signaling pathways, including phosphorylation of ERK and AKT, and enhances brain-derived neurotrophic factor (Bdnf') expression in Neuro2A cells, thereby mimicking the actions of both KIT-13 and natural plasmalogens. Furthermore, KIT-8 significantly improves memory function in mice, underscoring its inherent therapeutic potential. Importantly, the biological activity of KIT-8 suggests that plasmalogen synthesis is not required for its functional effects, introducing a novel concept in ether lipid biology. Supporting this notion, we identified additional alkyl ether lipid analogs, KIT-19 and KIT-20, which also demonstrated anti-inflammatory properties despite lacking the ability to generate plasmalogens. These findings indicate that the ether bond structure alone may be sufficient to confer biological activity. To explore this further, we designed and synthesized a series of structurally distinct alkyl ether lipids (KIT compounds) retaining an ether bond at the sn-2 position. In an LPS-induced inflammatory model using mouse-derived microglial MG6 cells, selected compounds KIT-8, KIT-19, and KIT-20 significantly suppressed NF-{kappa}B signaling, reduced p65 nuclear translocation, and downregulated the expression of pro-inflammatory mediators IL-1{beta} and NOS2. Given the cognitive benefits associated with plasmalogens in Alzheimer's disease, our findings position alkyl ether lipids as promising standalone bioactive molecules, capable of mitigating neuroinflammation and enhancing neuronal function independently of plasmalogen synthesis.

">Analytical meditation improves physiological well-being in expert practitioners: a study on central and peripheral neurophysiological correlates</a></h4>

              
                Meditation has been long associated with improvements in mental well-being, emotional regulation, and attentional control. Yet, the diversity of meditative techniques and participant expertise has hindered the systematic identification of their neurophysiological correlates supporting these benefits. To address this challenge, we investigated the neurophysiological signatures of concentrative and analytical meditation in 35 experienced Tibetan monk practitioners. EEG, ECG, EDA, and respiration were simultaneously recorded during Concentrative, Loving-Kindness and Emptiness meditations. Linear-mixed-models revealed significant modulations in autonomic and cortical activity across meditations. Peripheral indices indicated enhanced parasympathetic tone, decreases respiratory rate, and gradual increase in EDA - reflecting a state of relaxed-alertness with concurrent vagal engagement and sustained sympathetic arousal. EEG analyses supported this state showing elevated gamma-band power during analytical meditations. These findings suggest that advanced meditative states foster an adaptive integration of autonomic and cortical responses, supporting the emergence of relaxed-vigilance - a psychophysiological condition associated with well-being and cognitive flexibility.

">The Research Landscape of Dynamic Functional Connectivity in Parkinson's Disease: Systematic Review and Interactive Tool</a></h4>

              
                Dynamic functional connectivity (dFC) analysis of functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data has emerged as a powerful framework for characterizing the time-varying network disruptions underlying Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the rapid expansion of this field has introduced substantial methodological heterogeneity, creating a fragmented landscape that complicates knowledge synthesis and clinical translation. To address this, we performed a systematic review to map the conceptual and methodological diversity of dFC research in PD. Beyond a traditional static synthesis, we developed DynaPD, an open-source interactive application that allows researchers to dynamically explore study designs, analytical pipelines, and reported findings. Our synthesis of 37 eligible studies reveals a landscape defined by methodological contrast. While preprocessing strategies exhibited high variability (divergence), we observed a marked convergence on core analytical choices, specifically the use of Independent Component Analysis (ICA) for parcellation and the sliding-window technique coupled with k-means clustering for state identification. Regarding empirical findings, a consensus emerged on the relevance of specific dynamic features - namely dwell time, fraction time, and number of transitions - yet clinical interpretations varied, particularly concerning the implications of strongly connected versus sparsely connected states. We further identified stated limitations across the studies, including a predominance of cross-sectional designs, small sample sizes, and inconsistent reporting standards. These findings highlight the urgent need for longitudinal studies with extended acquisition protocols and standardized reporting frameworks. By providing both a systematic evidence synthesis and a living interactive tool, this work aims to consolidate the diverse dFC literature, fostering a more coherent and cumulative path toward precision neurology in PD.

">A stuttering-associated Gnptab variant alters fine-motor kinematics</a></h4>

              
                Precise reach-to-grasp movements rely on complex cortico-basal ganglia and cerebellar circuits, and can be affected by cellular pathway defects. We investigated whether mild Gnptab deficiency, affecting mannose-6-phosphate-dependent lysosomal enzyme targeting, impairs fine motor behaviors in mice. Using the staircase test, high-frame-rate video, and markerless tracking, we assessed reaching and grasping in Gnptab-mutant and control littermates. Our data suggest that Gnptab-mutant mice retrieved about 75% fewer pellets than controls and exhibited abnormal grasping, characterized by increased wrist extension and larger digit angles, decreased digital velocity, and shorter reach distances, while elbow angles remained largely unchanged. These findings suggest a specific deficit in grasp shaping and trajectory control, rather than overall limb positioning. Our data establishes a quantitative link between GNPTAB-related lysosomal pathway disruption and fine-motor impairments, providing a valuable model for understanding how cellular dysfunction impacts motor circuit function.

">Therapeutic modulation of the calpastatin/calpain pathway restores calpain-mediated synaptic proteolysis and preserves motor neurons survival and function in C9orf72 ALS</a></h4>

              
                A hexanucleotide repeat expansion (GGGGCC) in the C9orf72 gene is the most prevalent genetic cause of ALS, with early neuromuscular junction (NMJ) dysfunction being a key pathological feature. Current therapies provide only limited symptomatic relief, underscoring the need for targeted, mechanism-based interventions. Using a C9orf72 ALS zebrafish model (C9-miR) and patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) motor neurons, we identified significant downregulation of calpastatin, the endogenous inhibitor of calpains, a calcium-dependent protease family implicated in neurodegeneration. We demonstrate that restoring calpastatin function through calpain inhibition with calpeptin or a novel calpastatin-derived peptide ameliorates locomotor deficits and NMJ dysfunction in the C9-miR zebrafish model. These interventions enhance synaptic vesicle turnover and quantal release at the NMJ while improving motor neuron excitability and synaptic integrity in iPSC-derived motor neurons. N-terminomic/TAILS mass spectrometry approaches revealed direct calpain-mediated cleavage of synaptic proteins in motor neurons derived from C9orf72 patients. Proteolysis of key synaptic proteins, such as spectrin, is prevented by calpeptin and calpastatin peptide treatments. Our findings establish the calpastatin/calpain axis as a pivotal regulator of synaptic function in C9orf72-associated ALS and identify it as a promising therapeutic target, offering a novel strategy to restore synaptic transmission and potentially halt disease progression.

">Network Rerouting Under Ayahuasca: Temporally and Hemisphere-Resolved EEG Connectomics</a></h4>

              
                Ayahuasca profoundly alters conscious experience, yet robust, time-resolved EEG markers of its network-level effects remain limited. We combined machine learning with complex-network analysis to quantify how functional connectivity reorganizes across time and hemispheres in resting-state EEG from a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial including three 5-min sessions: pre-dose (T1), 2 h post-dose (T2), and 4 h post-dose (T3). The cohort consisted of naive ayahuasca users, a population known to exhibit attenuated or more stable acute responses, making the detection of network-level changes particularly challenging. Connectivity was estimated using multiple metrics and sliding windows (10-120 s), and network features were computed and averaged to ensure statistical validity. A representation-selection step identified Spearman correlation and an intermediate temporal scale as optimal, with classification performance peaking at 60-70 s (independent-test AUC and accuracy = 0.93). Linear mixed models revealed a bilateral decrease in eigenvector centrality (weaker hub influence), increased degree heterogeneity in the right hemisphere, and reduced global efficiency in the left. Edge-level analyses localized these effects: Posterior-left connections weakened acutely (lowest at T2), whereas right temporal-central coupling transiently strengthened (highest at T2). Together, these convergent results support a mechanistic summary: as hub-centric shortcuts weaken, communication is increasingly routed through alternative, more distributed and less efficient pathways, with a right-lateralized expression at a later time. Methodologically, the window-optimized, hemisphere-resolved, and edge-validated pipeline extends prior EEG work and highlights temporal scale (approximately 60 s) as a biologically meaningful parameter for detecting psychedelic-induced network reorganization.

">Relative contribution of gonads and sex chromosomes to sex differences in cell-type gene expression in the mouse medial septum and sex-biased disease risk</a></h4>

              
                Background While sex differences in the brain have traditionally been attributed to gonadal hormones, emerging evidence points to regulation by sex chromosomes. This study aims to differentiate the influence of gonads versus sex chromosomes on cellular gene expression in the mouse medial septum (MS), a critically understudied brain region. Methods Using single nucleus RNA-sequencing and the Sex Chromosome Trisomy mouse model, we (1) quantified sex differences in cellular gene expression and (2) isolated sex-biasing effects by identifying perturbed cell types, differentially expressed genes, biological pathways, and gene networks, which were integrated with GWAS data to explore links with sex-biased human phenotypes. Results Our analysis revealed that volumetric sex differences in the MS are mirrored by widespread transcriptomic changes across cell types. Critically, genetic effects displayed elevated relevance compared to sex hormones in driving sex-biased gene expression. These effects converge to regulate synaptic/neuronal development, transcriptional regulation, and cellular metabolism. Sex chromosome-associated DEGs were enriched for various human disorders, suggesting a cellular and mechanistic basis for their sex-biased patterns. Conclusions Our findings challenge the classical gonad-centric views of sexual differentiation, as the MS displays sex-biased transcriptional regulation driven by sex chromosome-associated effects that are highly relevant for human health.

">Drosophila maintain a consistent navigational goal angle for days to weeks</a></h4>

              
                Past work has demonstrated that Drosophila can keep to a consistent navigational bearing for minutes to hours. Here, we ask whether they can do so over days to weeks. First, we describe an experimental rig that allows individual head-fixed Drosophila to live for at least two weeks within a virtual-reality environment. Flies walk on a spherical treadmill and receive sugar drops at defined moments as food. Individuals express robust circadian and sleep rhythms on these rigs. We further show that flies freely navigating an environment containing a single visual orienting cue (akin to the sun) will often pick a unique direction and walk forward along that direction for tens to hundreds of meters over days to weeks. This preferred direction can be considered a goal angle because individuals will repeatedly correct for experimentally induced virtual rotations away from this angle. Flies rely on the visual cue to effectively progress forward along the goal angle--walking in circles without it--and they return to walking forward along the same angle in the morning after spending a full night (twelve hours) in darkness without the cue. These results argue for the existence of navigation goals in the Drosophila brain with a persistence time of days to weeks. Furthermore, the technology introduced here may enable trained behaviors across thousands of reinforcement trials in Drosophila, a paradigm central to mammalian neuroscience yet absent in flies.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-238/v5?src=rss">Association between perceived oral health and oral health–related quality of life among hospital staff [version 5; peer review: 5 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background Oral health is closely linked to well-being at work; however, evidence in hospital personnel remains limited. Methods Cross-sectional study in a Level II-1 hospital (n = 72). Oral-health–related quality of life (OHRQoL) was measured with OHIP-14 and perceived oral health (POH) with a modified HU-DBI. Bivariate associations were estimated with Spearman’s ρ and 95% confidence intervals; domain-level relationships were examined with proportional-odds ordinal logistic regression (Nagelkerke’s pseudo-R2). Results OHRQoL was distributed as 38.9% Excellent, 26.4% Fair and 34.7% Poor; POH concentrated in the Low level (52.8%), followed by Excellent (29.2%) and Fair (18.1%). POH correlated positively with OHRQoL (ρ = 0.391; 95% CI 0.18–0.57; p = 0.001). Domain-level analyses showed the strongest links for psychological discomfort (ρ = 0.421; p < 0.001; pseudo-R2 = 0.111; p = 0.027) and physical disability (ρ = 0.319; p = 0.006; pseudo-R2 = 0.167; p = 0.004); social disability (ρ = 0.242; p = 0.040; pseudo-R2 = 0.124; p = 0.017) and handicap (ρ = 0.298; p = 0.011; pseudo-R2 = 0.131; p = 0.013) were smaller but significant, whereas functional limitation was non-significant (ρ = 0.096; p = 0.424; pseudo-R2 = 0.014; p = 0.6). Conclusions Better perceived oral health is significantly associated with higher oral-health-related quality of life among hospital staff. Consequently, targeted workplace strategies, including education for self-care, pain management, and functional support, could enhance oral well-being. Moreover, open instruments and pilot reliability outputs are available to ensure transparency and reproducibility.

                <p>Loss of function variants of <I>SCN1B</I> are associated with a range of developmental and epileptic encephalopathies (DEEs), including Dravet syndrome. These DEEs feature a wide range of severe neurological disabilities, including changes to social, motor, mood, sleep, and cognitive function which are notoriously difficult to treat, and high rates of early mortality. While the symptomology of <I>SCN1B</I>-associated DEEs indicates broad changes in neural function, most research has focused on epilepsy-related brain structures and function. Mechanistic studies of <I>SCN1B</I>/<I>Scn1b</I> have delineated diverse roles in development and adult maintenance of neural function, via cell adhesion, ion channel regulation, and other intra- and extra-cellular actions. However, use of mouse models is limited as knock-out of <I>Scn1b</I>, globally and even in some cell-specific models (e.g., parvalbumin+ interneuron-specific knock-out) in adult mice, leads to severe and progressive epilepsy, health deterioration, and 100% mortality within weeks. Here, we report findings using male and female mice of a novel transgenic line in which <I>Scn1b</I> was specifically deleted in cerebellar Purkinje cells. Unlike most existing models, these mice survive and thrive. However, we quantified marked decrements to Purkinje cell physiology as well as motor, social, and cognitive dysfunction. Our data indicates that cerebellar Purkinje cells are an important node for dysfunction and neural disabilities in <I>SCN1B</I>-related DEEs and combined with previous work identify this as a potentially vital site for understanding mechanisms of DEEs and developing therapies that can treat these disorders holistically.</p>

                <p>Heterogeneity of presynaptic input and postsynaptic intrinsic excitability are two major variables that regulate neuronal firing rates and patterns. Yet, little is known about how these variables interplay to diversify the fidelity of excitation-spike coupling. To investigate their reciprocal relationship, we took advantage of the one-to-one innervation of mature calyx of Held&ndash;principal neuron synapses at the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB) in the auditory brainstem of male and female mice. Given that sustainability of synaptic drive is directly correlated with the morphological complexity of presynaptic calyces, we characterized the intrinsic excitability of postsynaptic neurons with morphologically identified inputs. We discovered that morphologically simple calyces (stalks and &le;10 swellings) providing weaker synaptic drive preferentially innervate principal neurons that exhibit lower stimulation-spike coupling fidelity and display phasic firing patterns, while neurons contacted by complex calyces (stalks and &gt;20 swellings) providing stronger synaptic drive exhibit higher stimulation-spike coupling fidelity and are predominantly associated with tonic firing. Phasic and tonic firing neurons have similar action potential shape and composition of low-threshold Kv1 and high-threshold Kv3 potassium currents but display marked differences in their input resistance and resting potassium conductance. Our results support a model in which a postsynaptic gradient of leak potassium channel density complements the presynaptic morpho-functional continuum to create an extended dynamic range of MNTB outputs. This synergy expands the coding capacity within a single population of neurons and supports multiple streams of auditory processing.</p>

                <p>Epilepsy constitutes a clinically manifest excitability disorder that is characterized by aberrant electrophysiological activity in the electroencephalogram (EEG). The correct identification of the seizure onset zone relies on the visual detection of pathological waveforms and the assessment of their morphology, rhythmicity, and density. Recent advances in quantitative EEG analyses indicated that aperiodic EEG background activity might provide complementary information to traditional qualitative methods. Importantly, aperiodic activity, and specifically the slope of the 1/f<I><sup></sup></I> decay function of the power spectrum, might constitute a biomarker of the underlying population excitability dynamics. Hence, in the context of epileptic activity, an altered spectral slope is often considered as a signature of pathological excitability. To date, it remained unclear if this straightforward interpretation also applies to states of manifest seizure activity. To address this question, we recorded intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) during focal seizures from patients diagnosed with pharmacoresistant epilepsy (18 patients, 11 females). The results demonstrate that the spectral slope successfully delineates seizure activity. However, the spectral slope was sensitive to the presence and waveform shape of distinct epileptic components. By combining iEEG recordings with simulations, we demonstrate that epileptic spiking activity and associated slow-wave components differentially impact spectral slope estimates. These results offer a more parsimonious explanation for the biophysical origins of aperiodic activity as compared with the concept of an underlying balance between excitation and inhibition.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/50/e0203252025?rss=1">Behavioral Relevance of Early Neural Coding of Low-Level Odor Features in Humans</a></h4>

              
                <p>Understanding how the brain transforms peripheral sensory inputs into higher-level representations, and how these contribute to perception and behavioral performance, is a central question in sensory neuroscience. However, in human olfaction, the temporal evolution of neural odor codes and their functional significance remain poorly characterized, especially at early stages. To address which odor features define early neural responses and how these relate to olfactory function, we recorded EEG from male and female participants as they inhaled diverse odors. Participants also completed standardized tests of odor detection, discrimination, and identification, along with questionnaires. Time- and frequency-resolved decoding and representational similarity analysis revealed that early theta activity encodes low-level physicochemical properties of odor molecules, with encoding peaking at 370 ms. Critically, the fidelity of this early theta coding to odor physicochemical properties selectively correlated with participants&rsquo; trait-level odor discrimination ability, but not with other olfactory measures. In contrast, delta-band representations of pleasantness emerged later (peaking at 980&nbsp;ms), linked only to trait-level odor affective reactivity, as measured by questionnaires. These results suggest that earlier theta-band representations reflect a distinct functional role from the later-emerging delta-band activity and are associated with olfactory performance. Extending these findings, separate EEG recordings during a task involving odor discrimination showed that early theta decoding accuracy was significantly higher on correct than incorrect trials, indicating that theta-band coding accounts for trial-by-trial performance fluctuations. Collectively, our study demonstrates that early theta-band representations of low-level odor features&mdash;prior to perceptual representations&mdash;are already functionally relevant to odor-guided behavior.</p>

                <p>Hippocampal maps and ventral prefrontal cortex (vPFC) value and goal representations support foraging in continuous spaces. How might hippocampal&ndash;vPFC interactions control the balance between behavioral exploration and exploitation? Using fMRI and reinforcement learning modeling, we investigated vPFC and hippocampal responses as humans (38 female, 34 male) explored and exploited a continuous one-dimensional space, with out-of-session and out-of-sample replication (23 female, 20 male). The spatial distribution of rewards, or value landscape, modulated activity in the hippocampus and default network vPFC subregions, but not in ventrolateral prefrontal control subregions or medial orbitofrontal limbic subregions. While prefrontal default network and hippocampus displayed higher activity in less complex, easy-to-exploit value landscapes, vPFC&ndash;hippocampal connectivity increased in uncertain landscapes requiring exploration. Further, synchronization between prefrontal default network and posterior hippocampus scaled with behavioral exploration. Considered alongside electrophysiological studies, our findings suggest that exploration targets are identified through coordinated activity binding prefrontal default network value representations to posterior hippocampal maps.</p>

                <p>Anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is a prefrontal area implicated in functions including cognitive control, attention, and prediction. Mouse ACC receives input from the visual system and uses visual information to direct behavior. While extensive work has described experience-dependent plasticity in mouse V1, less is known about how ACC itself adapts to visual experience. Our previous work demonstrated that visual sequences, presented across days, can drive plasticity in the timing of visually evoked responses in mouse ACC. However, it is not known whether this plasticity ("sequence plasticity") reflects familiarity to the first stimulus in a sequence or expectation of subsequent stimuli&mdash;a distinction that is critically important for understanding its functional significance. We recorded visually evoked responses in awake, head-fixed female and male mice trained with visual sequences across days. Visual sequences drove plasticity in ACC, expressed through a change in response timing, that reflects familiarity to the first stimulus. In addition, experience-dependent plasticity could be induced using single-orientation stimuli. Together, these findings suggest that "sequence plasticity" in ACC does not in fact require sequences, but rather reflects a broader phenomenon that we term stimulus-specific response plasticity in timing (SRPT). Our prior work demonstrated that ACC plasticity is impaired in a mouse model of Angelman syndrome (AS). Here, AS model mice showed abnormal responses to familiar visual stimuli in ACC, despite normal plasticity in V1. Together, this work demonstrates how mouse ACC adapts to familiar visual stimuli and describes impaired ACC function in a mouse model of a neurodevelopmental disorder.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/50/e0636252025?rss=1">Dual Role of LH-GABA Neurons in Encoding Alcohol Reward and Aversive Memories</a></h4>

              
                <p>One of the core aspects of alcohol use disorder is continued use despite negative consequences. Individuals with an alcohol use disorder typically engage in behaviors which represent a failure to integrate the aversive consequences of their actions. The neural mechanisms of learning about conflicting experiences remain poorly understood. Previous research has highlighted the critical role of GABAergic neurons in the lateral hypothalamus (LH-GABA) in rewarding memories. However, whether this role extends to aversive outcomes and competition between rewarding and aversive outcomes remains unexplored. In this study, we sought to elucidate the role of LH-GABA neurons in encoding and expressing alcohol reward and aversive memories using fiber photometry calcium imaging. We used a dual-virus approach to confine expression of jGCaMP7f to GABAergic neurons in LH of male and female Long&ndash;Evans rats. In our first experiment, following acquisition of a cue&ndash;alcohol association, a mild footshock was introduced on 50% of the trials. In the second experiment, we used three different cues to signal alcohol, footshock, or no consequence. Subsequently, we combined these conditioned stimuli in pairs to evoke motivational conflict. Our results reveal that LH-GABA activity is associated with cues predictive of both appetitive and aversive outcomes and is highest to a cue predictive of an aversive outcome. Additionally, the response of LH-GABA activity to an aversive shock stimulus is attenuated in the presence of alcohol. In summary, our findings show the activity of LH-GABA neurons is involved in learning both appetitive and aversive associations and their interaction in conflict.</p>

                <p>Infants preferentially process familiar social signals, but the neural mechanisms underlying continuous processing of maternal speech remain unclear. Using EEG-based neural encoding models based on temporal response functions, we investigated how 7-month-old human infants track maternal versus unfamiliar speech and whether this affects simultaneous face processing. Infants (13 boys, 12 girls) showed stronger neural tracking of their mother's voice, independent of acoustic properties, suggesting an early neural signature of voice familiarity. Furthermore, central encoding of unfamiliar faces was diminished when infants heard their mother's voice and face tracking accuracy at central electrodes increased with earlier occipital face tracking, suggesting heightened attentional engagement. However, we found no evidence for differential processing of happy versus fearful faces, contrasting previous findings on early emotion discrimination. Our results reveal interactive effects of voice familiarity on multimodal processing in infancy: while maternal speech enhances neural tracking, it may also alter how other social cues, such as faces, are processed. The findings suggest that early auditory experiences shape how infants allocate cognitive resources to social stimuli, emphasizing the need to consider cross-modal influences in early development.</p>

                <p>Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a highly prevalent disorder with limited therapeutic options. The central amygdala (CeA) is a critical brain region as dysregulation within the CeA and the corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) system are associated with AUD pathology. CeA CRF1 receptors regulate alcohol drinking and have served as a therapeutic target in alcohol treatment. One emerging potential therapeutic for AUD is psilocybin. Psilocybin has been shown to decrease drinking in some clinical studies; however, the effects are variable and the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Psilocybin engages many brain regions, including the CeA, and may produce therapeutic effects on drinking through interactions with CeA CRF1 neurons. The current study explores the effects of psilocin, the active metabolite of psilocybin, on voluntary ethanol drinking and CeA CRF1 activity to understand potential mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effects of psilocin. Psilocin acutely decreased ethanol consumption in mice exposed to two different models of chronic ethanol exposure without producing changes in locomotor behavior. Psilocin increased CeA activation and decreased relative CRF1 activation in CeA subregions from ethanol-naive female CRF1:GFP mice. These results were also observed in chronic ethanol-exposed mice at 24 and 72&nbsp;h withdrawal timepoints. Psilocin increased corticosterone at 24&nbsp;h withdrawal but not at 72&nbsp;h withdrawal. Collectively, these results demonstrate that psilocin engages CeA circuitry and decreases relative CRF1 activation, in parallel with acute reductions in drinking. These results contribute to our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the actions of psilocin and inform the interpretation of therapeutic effects in clinical studies.</p>

                <p>The role of P2X4, one of the most abundant ionotropic purinergic receptors in the central nervous system, is explored in the context of auditory function. We observed, by using constitutive and conditional P2X4mCherryIN knock-in adult mouse models of either sex, a specific high expression of mCherry-tagged P2X4 in living cochlear outer hair cells (OHCs), from immature postnatal stages to adulthood. This P2X4-mCherry expression, confirmed by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy in wild-type (WT) mice, was mainly concentrated in the intracellular apical region of OHCs, in the area of Hensen's body, a lysosomal-rich region, specifically labeled with the fluorescent dye lysotracker. In addition, the basal cholinergic efferent synaptic region of the OHCs was found to express P2X4 at the cell membrane. Surprisingly, the assessment of the hearing function in constitutive P2X4 knock-out (P2X4KO) mice showed improved auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) with smaller latencies and lower thresholds. These P2X4KO mice, as well as conditional Myo15-Cre:P2X4KO mice, displayed enhanced distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs), suggesting an improved electromechanical "amplification" activity by OHCs. These mutant animals showed reduced inhibition of DPOAEs by contralateral noise, consistent with a weaker inhibitory effect of the medial cholinergic olivocochlear (MOC) efferent circuit on OHCs. When P2X4KO mice were exposed to noise (white noise 95&nbsp;dB SPL, 12&nbsp;h), ABRs decreased and partially recovered much like WT mice, but DPOAEs showed faster recovery. We concluded that the MOC negative feedback modulation of cochlear micromechanics, in addition to involve Ca<sup>2+</sup> permeable &alpha;9/&alpha;10 nicotinic receptors, also requires the activation of postsynaptic P2X4 receptors in OHCs.</p>

                <p>GPR85/SREB2 is an exceptionally conserved orphan seven-transmembrane receptor with poorly understood biological function. Here, we combine genetic, imaging, transcriptomic, electrophysiological, and behavioral approaches in zebrafish to uncover the properties and roles of Gpr85 across development and adulthood. We show that, as in mammals, <I>gpr85</I> is expressed in diverse neuronal populations within the central nervous system, retina, and intestine. Using a fluorochrome-tagged Gpr85 construct expressed in native domains, we provide the first in vivo evidence that Gpr85 is enriched at synaptic sites in both the brain and retina. Transcriptomic profiling of cerebellar granule cells (GCs) lacking Gpr85 reveals gene expression changes consistent with increased neuronal activity. Electrophysiological recordings from cerebellar slices confirm that Gpr85-deficient GCs exhibit heightened excitability. Functionally, Gpr85 loss enhances light-triggered motor responses in larval zebrafish. Together, these findings position Gpr85 as a synapse-enriched modulator of neuronal excitability and sensory-driven behavior, offering new insight into its roles.</p>

                <p>Humans are skilled at recognizing everyday objects from pictures, even if we have never encountered the depicted object in real life. However, if we have encountered an object, how does that real-world experience affect the representation of its photographic image in the human brain? We developed a paradigm that involved brief real-world manual exploration of everyday objects prior to the measurement of brain activity with fMRI while viewing pictures of those objects (40 participants, 28 females). We found that while object-responsive regions in the lateral occipital and ventral temporal cortex contained robust visual representations of specific objects, those representations were not modulated by brief real-world exploration. However, there was an effect of visual experience in object-responsive regions in the form of repetition suppression of the BOLD response over repeated presentations of the object images. Real-world experience with an object produced foci of increased activation in the medial parietal and posterior cingulate cortex, regions that have previously been associated with the encoding and retrieval of remembered items in explicit memory paradigms. Our discovery that these regions are engaged during spontaneous recognition of real-world objects from their 2D image demonstrates that modulation of activity in medial regions by familiarity is neither stimulus nor task-specific. Overall, our results support separable coding in the human brain of the visual appearance of an object from the associations gained via real-world experience. The richness of object representations beyond their photographic image has important implications for understanding object recognition in the human brain and in computational models.</p>

                <p>Opioid use disorder (OUD) is characterized by high relapse rates, underscoring an urgent need to identify neurobiological mechanisms of opioid seeking. The paraventricular thalamus (PVT) is a key brain region implicated in drug seeking in humans and rodents. While the role of its downstream targets is beginning to be clarified, the upstream inputs that regulate PVT activity during opioid seeking remain poorly understood. The prelimbic cortex (PL) provides substantial excitatory input to the PVT and has a well-established role in cue-guided behaviors and drug seeking. However, the contribution of the PL -&gt; PVT pathway to heroin seeking is yet to be elucidated. To address this knowledge gap, we trained male and female rats to self-administer heroin for 12&nbsp;d and then used a pathway-specific chemogenetic approach to transiently inhibit PL -&gt; PVT projections during a cued heroin seeking test following 14&nbsp;d of abstinence. We found that chemogenetic inhibition of this pathway significantly reduced heroin seeking. We next examined synaptic plasticity at PL -&gt; PVT synapses ex vivo on withdrawal day 14 and found that abstinence from heroin self-administration induced an increase in AMPA/NMDA ratio compared with saline controls. Importantly, the increase in synaptic strength was normalized by applying an ex vivo optogenetic long-term depression (LTD) protocol. Finally, we applied the same optogenetic LTD protocol in vivo immediately before the cued seeking test and found that depotentiation of PL -&gt; PVT synaptic activity significantly reduced heroin seeking. These findings identify PL -&gt; PVT inputs as key drivers of heroin seeking and demonstrate that weakening this pathway reduces opioid seeking.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/50/e1083252025?rss=1">The Bed Nucleus of the Stria Terminalis-Deep Mesencephalic Nucleus Circuit Linking Emotion and Wakefulness</a></h4>

              
                <p>The bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), a part of the extended amygdala, integrates emotional and arousal-related signals. While GABAergic BNST (GABA<sup>BNST</sup>) neurons have been implicated in promoting transitions from non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep to wakefulness, their downstream mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we identify a neuronal circuit through which GABA<sup>BNST</sup> neurons promote arousal via projections to a midbrain region known as the deep mesencephalic nucleus (DpMe), located within the broader mesencephalic reticular formation. In male mice, we used a combination of optogenetics, fiber photometry, neural ablation, and tracing approaches to dissect this circuit. Optogenetic stimulation of GABA<sup>BNST</sup> terminals in the DpMe during NREM sleep elicited rapid transitions to wakefulness and increased activity of glutamatergic DpMe (GLUT<sup>DpMe</sup>) neurons, as assessed by <I>c-fos</I> mRNA expression and calcium imaging. Similarly, an aversive air-puff activated GLUT<sup>DpMe</sup> neurons, suggesting engagement by emotionally salient stimuli. Ablation of GLUT<sup>DpMe</sup> neurons markedly attenuated arousal responses triggered by GABA<sup>BNST</sup> stimulation, underscoring their essential role in this circuit. While monosynaptic rabies tracing revealed local input neurons to GLUT<sup>DpMe</sup> cells, in situ hybridization identified few <I>Vgat-</I>positive interneurons among them. These findings suggest that GABA<sup>BNST</sup> neurons may influence GLUT<sup>DpMe</sup> neurons through noncanonical GABAergic mechanisms or via more complex local circuits beyond a simple disinhibition model. Together, these findings delineate a previously uncharacterized BNST&ndash;DpMe circuit that allows emotionally relevant stimuli to override sleep and promote arousal. This pathway may contribute to stress-related sleep disturbances and represents a potential target for therapeutic treatments for sleep disorders associated with emotional dysregulation.</p>

                <p>Impaired GABAergic inhibition, so-called neural disinhibition, in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus has been linked to cognitive deficits. The novel object recognition (NOR) task has been used widely to study cognitive deficits in rodents. However, the contribution of prefrontal cortical and hippocampal GABAergic inhibition to NOR task performance has not been established. Here, we investigated NOR task performance in male Lister hooded rats following regional neural disinhibition or functional inhibition, using intracerebral microinfusion of the GABA<SUB>A</SUB> receptor antagonist picrotoxin or agonist muscimol, respectively. Our infusion targets were the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), dorsal hippocampus (DH), and ventral hippocampus (VH). Using a within-subject design, we compared NOR task performance (1&nbsp;min retention delay) following bilateral regional saline, picrotoxin, or muscimol infusions made before the acquisition phase. In mPFC, neither functional inhibition nor neural disinhibition affected object recognition memory. However, in both the DH and VH, neural disinhibition impaired NOR relative to saline control, mainly by reducing novel object exploration time. In addition, functional inhibition of the DH impaired NOR, whereas VH functional inhibition tended to reduce novel object exploration at the highest dose used (alongside substantial nonspecific behavioral effects). Overall, our data suggest that hippocampal, but not prefrontal, GABAergic inhibition contributes to NOR at a 1&nbsp;min retention delay. Moreover, such NOR performance likely requires balanced neural activity in the DH, with both too little and too much DH activity impairing NOR memory. Our findings support that the NOR task can be used to investigate hippocampal GABAergic dysfunction in rodent models.</p>

                <p>The synaptic circuits established by thalamocortical axons from the ventral posteromedial (VPM) and posterior (Po) nuclei in the first somatosensory cortex have been mapped in high detail as they are a prime model in functional and modeling studies of the interactions between the thalamus and cerebral cortex. In addition, VPM and Po neurons innervate the second somatosensory area (S2), but the synaptic organization of their axons in this area remained essentially unknown. On adult male mice, we combined axon labeling with serial section transmission electron microscopy and focused ion beam-scanning electron microscopy to measure and compare functionally relevant structural parameters of synaptic boutons (SBs), e.g., bouton and mitochondrial volume, vesicle pool size, as well as postsynaptic density (PSD) distribution and size. We report that SBs established by caudal VPM and rostral Po synapses resemble each other in their pre- and postsynaptic ultrastructure, while caudal Po SBs are on average 50% smaller in size, number of synaptic vesicles, and total PSD area. We observed a high prevalence (&gt;20%) of small synaptic contacts located in axon intervaricose regions that selectively contact thin, headless dendritic spines (a morphology associated with functionally "silent" synapses). In addition, comparison of the S2 SBs with our previous quantitative data on VPM and Po S1 SBs reveals that the wiring of thalamocortical synapses in Areas S2 and S1 is similar, supporting the view that both areas can process in parallel specific somatosensory signal streams.</p>

                <p>Studies of cognitive flexibility suggest that switching between different tasks can entail a transient switch cost. Here, we asked whether analogous switch costs exist in the context of switching between different motor skills. We tested whether participants (23 males and 12 females) could switch between a newly learned skill associated with a novel visuomotor mapping and an existing skill associated with an intuitive mapping. Participants showed increased errors in trials immediately following a switch between mappings. These errors were attributable to persisting with the preswitch policy rather than imperfect implementation or retrieval of the postswitch policy. A subset of our participants further learned a second new skill. Switching between these two novel skills was initially very challenging but improved with further training. Our findings suggest that switching between newly learned motor skills can be challenging and that errors in the context of switching between skills are primarily attributable to perseveration with the wrong control policy.</p>

                <p>Nociceptive afferents and dorsal horn neurons undergo significant functional changes in pathological pain conditions. The structural remodeling of synapses of C afferents, which may contribute to the long-term maintenance of these changes, is not well understood. To investigate this issue, we used quantitative immuno-electron microscopy with serial sections to examine the structural changes of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP)-immunopositive (+) and isolectin-B4+ (IB4+) axon terminals (boutons) and their pre- and postsynaptic elements in the rat medullary dorsal horn (MDH, trigeminal caudal nucleus). The study was conducted at 4&nbsp;d (CFA 4-day) and 21&nbsp;d (CFA 21-day) following complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) injection into the vibrissa pad of the male Sprague Dawley rats, when thermal hyperalgesia was severe and had recovered, respectively. The ultrastructural parameters correlated with synaptic strength (bouton volume, mitochondrial volume, docked vesicle number, postsynaptic density area, dendritic spine number and size) in CGRP+ and IB4+ boutons and their postsynaptic dendrites increased significantly in the CFA 4-day group compared with control. The fraction of IB4+ boutons receiving axoaxonic synapses and the number of GAD65/67+ boutons involved in pre- and postsynaptic inhibition decreased significantly in the CFA 4-day group compared with control; these changes were restored to control levels in the CFA 21-day group. These structural changes in the C afferents and their pre- and postsynaptic elements in the MDH following inflammation may provide the morphological basis for the development and long-term maintenance of craniofacial inflammatory pain.</p>

                <p>Sleep and feeding&mdash;typically mutually exclusive behaviors that are vital for survival and health&mdash;are intricately linked. Across species, chronic sleep loss or deprivation is associated with increased caloric intake, while fasting typically induces sleep suppression. Despite evidence for a dynamic relationship between these behaviors, how sleep affects eating habits and how changes in feeding behavior and nutrition alter sleep are not completely understood. Distinct neuronal manipulations in <I>Drosophila melanogaster</I> can dissociate sleep loss from subsequent homeostatic rebound, offering an optimal platform to examine the precise interplay between these fundamental behaviors. Here, we investigated concomitant changes in sleep and food intake in individual flies, as well as respiratory metabolic expenditure that accompany behavioral and neuronal manipulations that induce sleep loss in males. We find that sleep disruptions resulting in energy deficit through increased metabolic expenditure and manifesting as increased food intake were consistently followed by rebound sleep. In contrast, sleep loss that does not induce rebound sleep was not accompanied by increased metabolism and food intake. Our results suggest that homeostatic sleep rebound is linked to energy deficit accrued during sleep loss. Collectively, these findings support the notion that sleep functions to conserve energy and highlight the need to examine the effects of metabolic therapeutics on sleep. Our findings also stress the importance of precise measurements of sleep and the value of considering multiple indicators of energy balance, including metabolism and food intake.</p>

                <p>A diapause program that anticipates harsh seasonal environments contributes to flexible seasonal adaptation of organisms. Many animals use the photoperiod as a cue for seasonal sensing, and a circadian clock system is suggested to be important for photoperiodic physiological regulation. Although brain regions that are important for photoperiodic responses have been reported, the detailed system linking the circadian clock to photoperiodic diapause switching remains unclear. Here, we show the circadian clock-based neural mechanism for diapause switching by the female insect <I>Riptortus pedestris</I>, which enters reproductive diapause. This study focused on the insect neuroendocrine center, pars lateralis (PL), and analyzed its role in the photoperiodic control of diapause. PL neurons mainly express two types of neuropeptides: corazonin or short neuropeptide F (sNPF). RNA interference (RNAi) has demonstrated the importance of these neuropeptides in controlling diapause. Corazonin is essential for diapause induction under short photoperiod, and sNPF contributes to the appropriate determination of diapause according to the photoperiod. Additionally, electrophysiological analyses revealed that PL peptidergic neurons photoperiodically changed their neural activity, switching from active to silent mode by diapause-averting long photoperiod. We demonstrated that positive and negative regulators of the circadian clock are reciprocally involved in switching of PL activity and diapause. RNAi of a positive regulator <I>cycle</I> activates PL activity and induces reproductive diapause under long photoperiod, whereas that of a negative regulator <I>period</I> silences PL activity and averts diapause under short photoperiod. Our findings highlight that PL peptidergic neurons mediate the circadian clock system and the photoperiodic control of diapause.</p>

                <p>Across brain regions and species, the dynamics and balance of excitation and inhibition critically determine neuronal firing. The hippocampal dentate gyrus is a brain area thought to be strongly regulated by inhibition. In vivo, it exhibits remarkably sparse activity, a characteristic proposed to underlie computational tasks like pattern separation. Several populations of interneurons mediate strong feedforward as well as feedback inhibition onto granule cells. However, how the dynamics of inhibition controls granule cell activity in vivo is insufficiently studied. Using two-photon in vivo Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging in mice of either sex, we show that sensory stimulation activates only a small number of dentate gyrus granule cells, while inducing widespread inhibition across the remaining granule cell population. Dual-color imaging of both bulk medial perforant path activity and individual granule cell activity allowed us to probe input&ndash;output conversion in this pathway. To examine the interplay of MPP-evoked excitation and inhibition at the cellular level, we used in vivo whole-cell patch-clamp recordings, while simultaneously photo-activating MPP inputs. Our findings reveal that MPP-triggered inhibition is fast, significantly larger than excitation, and long-lasting. These results reveal specific properties of inhibition in the dentate gyrus inhibition that are likely crucial for its computational functions, in maintaining sparse activity with a high signal-to-noise ratio.</p>

                Purpose Game-based learning enhances eye health education and skill acquisition but poses distinct challenges in developing effective educational games. The present study aims to demonstrate the developmental challenges encountered at various stages of creating e-learning game prototypes for training eye health professionals. Methods Structured focus group discussions (FGDs) were conducted involving all the stakeholders involved in game development, the subject experts, and the technical experts. The four phases of FGDs were as follows: i) Ideation and team development; ii) Identifying the competencies and mapping these with cognition; iii) Concept to prototype development; a) Defining questions and data points; b) Accumulating content; and iv) Prototype testing and feedback. The FGDs were audio recorded, the descriptive data were transcribed verbatim, and the data were thematically analysed. Results The challenges differed in every phase of the game development. Data on the strengths and weaknesses of the game development were collected via participant recall. Throughout the project, the technical team had to understand the requirements of the subject experts and vice versa. Participants’ understanding of e-learning games varied across the teams. Choosing appropriate topics for game development, identifying and mapping underlying cognition to exit competency, generating data, translating concepts into games, determining the role of communication in maintaining team dynamics, and seeking early feedback from end-users were some of the challenges encountered. Conclusion The lessons learned from overcoming procedural challenges in this study may be applied by others who are developing game-based educational tools for eye health education.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-1389/v1?src=rss">Mixed Plasmodium Infections: Report of Four Cases from the Military Hospital of Tunis [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Malaria is a life-threatening vector-borne disease caused by five species of the genus Plasmodium (P.) It can present as mixed infections that remain underreported and pose diagnostic, therapeutic and prognostic challenges. The objective of the present study was to describe the epidemiological, clinical, and biological features of four cases of mixed Plasmodium infection. Methods This retrospective descriptive study included cases of mixed Plasmodium infections diagnosed at the Parasitology Laboratory of the Military Hospital of Tunis between 2022 and 2025. Diagnosis was established using May–Grünwald–Giemsa–stained thin blood smears, Giemsa–stained thick smears, and rapid diagnostic tests. Plasmodium species were identified according to standard microscopic morphological criteria. Results We report four cases of mixed Plasmodium infection diagnosed in military personnel returning from deployment in Central Africa. The patients were aged 31–52 years (mean age 38.8 years) with sex ratio 3. They presented within 10–30 days post-return with fever (38–42 °C) associated with headache, myalgia, abdominal pain, and/or vomiting. All had adhered to malaria chemoprophylaxis, and three reported no prior malaria episodes, while one patient had a history of six previous attacks. Rapid diagnostic tests were positive for pan-Plasmodium pLDH in all cases; two patients were also positive for HRP2. Peripheral blood smears confirmed mixed infections. Parasitemia was generally low (<1% in three cases, 1% in one case). Treatment consisted of artemether–lumefantrine (Coartem®) for all patients, combined with primaquine for those with P. ovale infection. Clinical evolution was favorable in all cases, and follow-up blood smears on days 3, 7, and 28 confirmed parasitological clearance, with only rare degenerated trophozoites observed in one patient on day 3. Conclusion Mixed Plasmodium infections can influence disease severity, treatment outcomes, and drug resistance. Accurate diagnosis and radical therapy are keys to preventing relapses.

                <p>by Davide Luciano, F. Emil Thomasen, Kresten Lindorff-Larsen, Gaston Courtade</p>

The activity of GT-B glycosyltransferases depends on their conformational flexibility and high substrate specificity, but the molecular basis of these features is still not well defined. The GT70 family contains a single well-characterized enzyme, GumK, a glucuronosyltransferase from <i>Xanthomonas campestris</i> required for xanthan gum biosynthesis. Here, we applied multiscale molecular simulations and sequence analysis to probe GumK dynamics and substrate specificity. We show that GumK undergoes twisting and bending motions constrained by interdomain contacts and modulated by membrane anchoring. Acceptor-substrate binding within an amphiphilic clamp promotes opening, whereas donor-substrate binding stabilizes closure, defining a substrate-dependent catalytic cycle. Specificity for UDP-glucuronate is mediated by a conserved electrostatic environment centered on Lys307 and a hydrophobic triad that orients the sugar moiety. On the acceptor side, the binding site selectively accommodates polyisoprenyl carriers up to three isoprene units in length and wraps around the substrate, constraining the trisaccharide moiety in a catalytically competent conformation. Comparative analysis highlights GumK-specific motifs that distinguish it from homologous GTs. This work provides mechanistic insight into the GT70 family and the dynamic behavior of GT-B enzymes, establishing principles for the rational engineering of GumK to modify the monosaccharide composition of xanthan gum.

Rhythmic structure enables precise temporal expectations that are essential to human communication, including speech and music. Computational models have been developed to account for how humans perceive, produce, and learn rhythmic sequences. However, it is unclear how different types of models relate to each other and how they can be evaluated. In this review and perspective, we discuss how three major classes of models—entrainment, probabilistic, and timekeeper models—have been used to study rhythmic expectations. We critically assess each model class in terms of its level of explanation, the rhythmic behaviors it captures, its ability to account for learning and enculturation, and its ability to integrate other features, such as pitch. We show that entrainment, probabilistic, and timekeeper models differ substantially in the aspects of rhythmic expectations they can capture. To move the field forward, we propose that model comparison and integration are crucial. We identify key challenges to this effort, such as the varying nature of the input and output signals and divergent modeling goals. To address these challenges, we arrive at several practical recommendations: to equate input and output signals when comparing models, to consider several model outcomes beyond goodness-of-fit measures in model evaluation, to use model-integration efforts to inform theory building, and to make code and data openly accessible. Ultimately, understanding how models of rhythmic expectations relate, and how features in these models account for behavioral, neural, and cognitive aspects of rhythmic expectations, will deepen our understanding of a core aspect of human behavior.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1013759">Randomized Spatial PCA (RASP): A computationally efficient method for dimensionality reduction of high-resolution spatial transcriptomics data</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Ian K. Gingerich, Brittany A. Goods, H. Robert Frost</p>

Spatial transcriptomics (ST) provides critical insights into the spatial organization of gene expression, enabling researchers to unravel the intricate relationship between cellular environments and biological function. Identifying spatial domains within tissues is key to understanding tissue architecture and mechanisms underlying development and disease progression. Here, we present Randomized Spatial PCA (RASP), a novel spatially-aware dimensionality reduction method for ST data. RASP is designed to be orders-of-magnitude faster than existing techniques, scale to datasets with 100,000+ locations, support flexible integration of non-transcriptomic covariates, and reconstruct de-noised, spatially-smoothed gene expression values. RASP itself is not a clustering or domain detection method; cell types and spatial regions are obtained by clustering the RASP PCs, and the effective cluster resolution depends on the K-nearest-neighbor (kNN) graph and a smoothing parameter <i>β</i>. It employs a randomized two-stage PCA framework and configurable spatial smoothing. RASP was compared to BASS, GraphST, SEDR, SpatialPCA, STAGATE, and CellCharter using diverse ST datasets (10x Visium, Stereo-Seq, MERFISH, 10x Xenium) on human and mouse tissues. In these benchmarks, RASP delivers comparable or superior accuracy in tissue-domain detection while achieving substantial improvements in computational speed. Its efficiency not only reduces runtime and resource requirements but also makes it practical to explore a broad range of spatial-smoothing parameters in a high-throughput fashion. By enabling rapid re-analysis under different parameter settings, RASP empowers users to fine-tune the balance between resolution and noise suppression on large, high-resolution subcellular datasets—a critical capability when investigating complex tissue architecture.
