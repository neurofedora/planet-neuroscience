	<p>Background: Despite promising results, the role of intra-arrest hypothermia in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) remains controversial. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of trans-nasal evaporative cooling (TNEC) during resuscitation on neurological recovery in OHCA patients admitted alive to the hospital. Methods: A post hoc analysis of the PRINCESS trial, including only patients admitted alive to the hospital, either assigned to TNEC or standard of care during resuscitation. The primary endpoint was favorable neurological outcome (FO) defined as a Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) of 1&amp;amp;ndash;2 at 90 days. The secondary outcomes were overall survival at 90 days and CPC 1 at 90 days. Subgroup analyses were performed according to the initial cardiac rhythm. Results: A total of 149 patients in the TNEC and 142 in the control group were included. The number of patients with CPC 1&amp;amp;ndash;2 at 90 days was 56/149 (37.6%) in the intervention group and 45/142 (31.7%) in the control group (p = 0.29). Survival and CPC 1 at 90 days was observed in 60/149 patients (40.3%) vs. 52/142 (36.6%; p = 0.09) and 50/149 (33.6%) vs. 35/142 (24.6%; p = 0.11) in the two groups. In the subgroup of patients with an initial shockable rhythm, the number of patients with CPC 1 at 90 days was 45/83 (54.2%) in the intervention group and 27/78 (34.6%) in the control group (p = 0.01). Conclusions: In this post hoc analysis of admitted OHCA patients, no statistically significant benefits of TNEC on neurological outcome at 90 days was found. In patients with initial shockable rhythm, TNEC was associated with increased full neurological recovery.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Speech and music recruit frequency-specific distributed and overlapping cortical networks</a></h4>

              
                To what extent do speech and music processing rely on domain-specific and domain-general neural networks? Adopting a dynamical system framework, we investigate the presence of frequency-specific and network-level selectivity and combine it with a statistical approach in which a clear distinction is made between shared, preferred, and category-selective neural responses. Using intracranial EEG recordings in 18 epilepsy patients listening to natural and continuous speech and music, we show that the majority of focal and network-level neural activity is shared between speech and music processing. Our data also reveal an absence of regional selectivity. Instead, neural selectivity is restricted to distributed and frequency-specific coherent oscillations, typical of spectral fingerprints. Our work addresses a longstanding debate and redefines an epistemological posture on how to map cognitive and brain functions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The effects of biological sex on estimates of persistent inward currents in the human lower limb</a></h4>

              
                Non-invasive recordings of motor unit (MU) spike trains help us understand how neural drive is modulated by various motor commands and/or physiological conditions. The majority of study participants in human and non-human animal physiology studies are male, and it is assumed mechanisms uncovered in these studies are shared between males and females. However, sex differences in neurological impairment and physical performance warrant the study of sex as a biological variable in human physiology and performance. To begin addressing this gap in the study of biophysical properties of human motoneurons, we quantified MU discharge rates and estimates of persistent inward current (PIC) magnitude in both sexes by quantifying {Delta}F. We decomposed MU spike trains from the tibialis anterior (TA), medial gastrocnemius (MG), and soleus (SOL) using high-density surface electromyography and blind source separation algorithms. Ten participants of each sex performed slow triangular (10s up and down) isometric contractions to a peak of 30% of their maximum voluntary contraction. We then used linear mixed effects models to determine if peak discharge rate and {Delta}F were predicted by the fixed effects of sex, muscle, and their interaction. Despite similar peak discharge rates across all muscles, {Delta}F was larger ({chi}2(1) = 6.26, p = 0.012) in females (4.73 [0.242 pps]) than males (3.81 [0.240 pps]). These findings suggest that neuromodulatory drive and/or biophysical properties of motoneurons differ between the sexes and may contribute to differences in MU discharge patterns.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Controlling Neocortical Epileptic Seizures using Forced TemporalSpike-Time Stimulation: An In Silico Computational Study</a></h4>

              
                Epileptic seizure is typically characterized by highly synchronized episodes of neural activity. Existing stimulation therapies focus purely on suppressing the pathologically synchronized neuronal firing patterns during the ictal (seizure) period. While these strategies are effective in suppressing seizures when they occur, they fail to prevent the re-emergence of seizures once the stimulation is turned off. Previously, we developed a novel neurostimulation motif, which we refer to as "Forced Temporal Spike-Time Stimulation" (FTSTS) [1] that has shown remarkable promise in long-lasting desynchronization of excessively synchronized neuronal firing patterns by harnessing synaptic plasticity. In this paper, we build upon this prior work [1] by optimizing the parameters of the FTSTS protocol in order to efficiently desynchronize the pathologically synchronous neuronal firing patterns that occur during epileptic seizures using a recently published computational model of neocortical-onset seizures [2]. We show that the FTSTS protocol applied during the ictal period can modify the excitatory-to inhibitory synaptic weight in order to effectively desynchronize the pathological neuronal firing patterns even after the ictal period. Our investigation opens the door to a possible new neurostimulation therapy for epilepsy.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">GABA decrease is associated with degraded neural specificity in the visual cortex of glaucoma patients</a></h4>

              
                Glaucoma is an age-related neurodegenerative disease of the visual system, affecting both the eye and the brain. Yet its underlying metabolic mechanisms and neurobehavioral relevance remain largely unclear. Here, using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy and functional magnetic resonance imaging, we investigated the GABAergic and glutamatergic systems in the visual cortex of glaucoma patients, as well as neural specificity, which is shaped by GABA and glutamate signals and underlies efficient sensory and cognitive functions. Our study showed that among the older adults, both GABA and glutamate levels decrease with increasing glaucoma severity regardless of age. Further, the reduction of GABA but not glutamate predicted the neural specificity. This association was independent of the impairments on the retina structure and age. Our results suggest that glaucoma-specific decline of GABA undermines neural specificity in the visual cortex and that targeting GABA could improve the neural specificity in glaucoma.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Proteomics of resilience to Alzheimer's disease identifies brain regional soluble Aβ levels, actin filament processes, and response to injury</a></h4>

              
                Resilience to Alzheimer's disease (RAD) is an uncommon combination of high disease burden without dementia that may provide critical insights into limiting the clinical impact of this incurable disease. In this study, we used mass spectrometry-based proteomics to quantify regional protein differences that characterize RAD. Starting with over 700 brain donations, we identified 43 extensively annotated research participants who met stringent inclusion exclusion criteria and analyzed matched isocortical regions, hippocampus, and caudate nucleus. Differential expression analysis of 7,115 soluble proteins identified lower isocortical and hippocampal soluble A{beta}; peptide levels as a significant feature of RAD. Protein co-expression analysis revealed a group of 181 densely-interacting proteins significantly associated with RAD that were enriched for actin filament-based process, cellular detoxification, and wound healing in isocortex and hippocampus. We further support our findings using data from 689 human isocortical samples from four independent external cohorts that were the closest approximations of our clinico-pathologic groups. The molecular basis of RAD, a widely replicated state in older adults for which there is no experimental model, likely holds important insights into therapeutic interventions for Alzheimer's disease.

                Apolipoprotein 4 (APOE) {epsilon}4 genotype is the most prevalent risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Although APOE4 differs from its non-pathological APOE3 isoform only by the C112R mutation, the mechanism of its proteinopathy is poorly understood. Here, we combine experimental and computational techniques to uncover a domino-like effect of C112R mutation on APOE4 behavior. We found that C112R substitution in APOE4 induces long-distance (>15 [A]) conformational changes leading to the formation of a T-shaped dimeric unit that is geometrically different and more aggregation-prone than the APOE3 structure. AD drug candidate tramiprosate and its metabolite 3-sulfopropanoic acid induce APOE3-like conformational behavior in APOE4 and suppress its aggregation propensity. Analysis of APOE {varepsilon}4/{varepsilon}4 cerebral organoids treated with tramiprosate revealed its effect on cholesteryl esters, the storage products of excess cholesterol. Overall, our results connect the APOE4 structure with its aggregation propensity, providing a new druggable target for neurodegeneration and ageing.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Longitudinal investigation of changes in resting-state co-activation patterns and their predictive ability in the zQ175 DN mouse model of Huntington's disease</a></h4>

              
                Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by expanded ([&ge;]40) glutamine-encoding CAG repeats in the huntingtin gene, which leads to dysfunction and death of predominantly striatal and cortical neurons. While the genetic profile and behavioural signs of the disease are better known, changes in the functional architecture of the brain, especially before the behavioural signs become apparent, are not fully and consistently characterized. In this study, we sought markers at pre, early and late manifest states of phenotypic progression in the heterozygous (HET) zQ175 delta-neo (DN) mouse model, using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (RS-fMRI). This mouse model shows molecular, cellular, and circuitry alterations that resemble those seen in HD in humans. Specifically, we investigated, longitudinally, changes in co-activation patterns (CAPs) that are the transient states of brain activity constituting the resting-state networks (RSNs). Most robust changes in the temporal properties of CAPs occurred at the late manifest state; the durations of two anti-correlated CAPs, characterized by simultaneous co-activation of the default-mode-like network (DMLN) and co-deactivation of the lateral-cortical network (LCN) and vice-versa, were reduced in the zQ175 DN HET animals compared to the wild-type mice. Changes in the spatial properties, measured in terms of activation levels of different brain regions, during CAPs were found at all three states and became progressively more pronounced at the manifest states. We then assessed the cross-validated predictive power of CAP metrics to distinguish HET animals from controls. Spatial properties of CAPs performed significantly better than the chance level at all three states with 80% classification accuracy at the early and late manifest states.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">1H-MRS characterization of metabolic changes induced by photoperiod in the sheep brain: a promising eye into in-vivo adult neurogenesis?</a></h4>

              
                The hypothalamus is a central structure of the mammalian brain, which controls physiological, endocrine and metabolic brain homeostasis. Despite this essential role, little is known about the normal and altered neurochemical changes occurring within the hypothalamic structures. Here, the metabolism of the hypothalamus of ewes was investigated at 3T using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS). We used the sensitivity of these animals to photoperiod i.e. the ratio of day to night length, to investigate the hypothalamic metabolic changes and their relationship to hypothalamic adult neurogenesis. A longitudinal study involving 4 ewes per timepoint was conducted at 4 time points (P01, P02, P03 and P04) during long days (LD) and 4 time points during short days (SD). Significant metabolic changes were found between LD and SD at all time points in particular for glutamate (Glu), glutamine, myo-inositol and total N-acetyl-Aspartate (NAA). During SD, glutamate and glutamine concentrations were significantly smaller at P01 compared to all other time points while significant neurochemical changes occurred during the entire LD period. Neurochemical changes relative to P01 remained stable during LD and SD except for Glu and Gln which increased between P01 and P02 during SD. Relative metabolic changes were significantly higher on average for NAA and Glu and significantly smaller on average for total choline during SD compared to LD, respectively, paralleling the average changes in the numbers of neural stem cells and glial and oligodendrocyte progenitors found by immunohistochemistry. Despite important differences between MRS and immunohistochemistry in terms of spatial resolution, both techniques suggest complementary findings that should contribute to a better characterization of the hypothalamus during photoperiodism and adult neurogenesis. We conclude that 1H-MRS could be a promising non-invasive translational technique to investigate the existence of adult neurogenesis in-vivo in gyrencephalic

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Entorhinal grid-like codes and time-locked network dynamics track others navigating through space</a></h4>

              
                Navigating through crowded, dynamically changing social environments requires the ability to keep track of other individuals. Grid cells in the entorhinal cortex are a central component of self-related navigation but whether they also track others' movement is unclear. Here, we propose that entorhinal grid-like codes make an essential contribution to socio-spatial navigation. Sixty human participants underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while observing and re-tracing different paths of a demonstrator that navigated a virtual reality environment. Results revealed that grid-like codes in the entorhinal cortex tracked the other individual navigating through space. Further, the activity of grid-like codes was time-locked to increases in co-activation and entorhinal-cortical connectivity that included the striatum, the hippocampus, parahippocampal and right posterior parietal cortices, altogether modulated by accuracy when subsequently re-tracing the paths. This suggests that network dynamics time-locked to entorhinal grid-cell-related activity might serve to distribute information about the "socio-spatial map" throughout the brain.

	<p>Psychiatric disorders are a class of complex disorders characterized by brain dysfunction with varying degrees of impairment in cognition, emotion, consciousness and behavior, which has become a serious public health issue. The NGFR gene encodes the p75 neurotrophin receptor, which regulates neuronal growth, survival and plasticity, and was reported to be associated with depression, schizophrenia and antidepressant efficacy in human patient and animal studies. In this study, we investigated its association with schizophrenia and major depression and its role in the behavioral phenotype of adult mice. Four NGFR SNPs were detected based on a study among 1010 schizophrenia patients, 610 patients with major depressive disorders (MDD) and 1034 normal controls, respectively. We then knocked down the expression of NGFR protein in the hippocampal dentate gyrus of the mouse brain by injection of shRNA lentivirus to further investigate its behavioral effect in mice. We found significant associations of s2072446 and rs11466162 for schizophrenia. Ngfr knockdown mice showed social and behavioral abnormalities, suggesting that it is linked to the etiology of neuropsychiatric disorders. We found significant associations between NGFR and schizophrenia and that Ngfr may contribute to the social behavior of adult mice in the functional study, which provided meaningful clues to the pathogenesis of psychiatric disorders.</p>

	<p>Shooting is a sport dominated by psychological factors. Hence, disturbing the shooter&amp;amp;rsquo;s sensory function during aiming will seriously affect his psychological state and shooting performance. Electroencephalograph (EEG) measurements of 30 skilled marksmen in the shooting preparation stage under noisy disturbance, weak light, and normal conditions were recorded. Therefore, the differences in neural mechanisms in the shooter&amp;amp;rsquo;s brain during shooting aiming in different disturbance conditions were explored using an analytical approach that employs functional connectivity and brain network analysis based on graph theory. The relationship between these brain network characteristics and shooting performance was also compared. The results showed that (1) the average connection strength in the beta frequency band and connection intensity in the left and right temporal lobes of the shooters under noise disturbance were significantly higher than those under the other two conditions, and their brain networks also showed a higher global and local efficiency. In addition, (2) the functional connection intensity in the occipital region of the beta band was higher than that in the normal condition in the weak-light condition. The information interaction in the left parietal region also increased continually during the shooting process. (3) Furthermore, the shooters&amp;amp;rsquo; eigenvector centrality in the temporal and occipital regions with limited sensory function in the two conditions was lower than those in the normal condition. These findings suggest that noise disturbance activates the arousal level of the shooter&amp;amp;rsquo;s brain and enhances the information processing efficiency of the brain network; however, it increases the mental workload. In weak-light conditions, shooters focus more on visual information processing during aiming and strengthen the inhibition of functions in the brain regions unrelated to shooting behavior. Audiovisual disturbance renders the cortical regions equivalent to the audiovisual perception function in the shooter&amp;amp;rsquo;s brain less important in the entire brain network than in the normal condition. Therefore, these findings reveal the effect of audiovisual disturbance on the functional network of the cortex in the shooting preparation stage and provide a theoretical basis for further understanding the neural mechanism of the shooting process under sensory disturbances.</p>

	<p>Postoperative delirium (POD) is a complication characterized by disturbances in attention, awareness, and cognitive function that occur shortly after surgery or emergence from anesthesia. Since it occurs prevalently in neurosurgical patients and poses great threats to the well-being of patients, much emphasis is placed on POD in neurosurgical units. However, there are intricate theories about its pathogenesis and limited pharmacological interventions for POD. In this study, we review the recent insights into its pathogenesis, mainly based on studies within five years, and the five dominant pathological theories that account for the development of POD, with the intention of furthering our understanding and boosting its clinical management.</p>

	<p>Background: Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s dementia (AD) is a degenerative disease that impairs cognitive function, initially, and then motor or other function, eventually. Motor coordination function impairment usually accompanies cognition impairment but it is seldom examined whether it can reflect the clinical outcomes of AD. Methods: 113 clinically diagnosed AD patients with a mean age of 78.9 &amp;amp;plusmn; 6.9 years underwent an annual neuropsychological assessment using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), the Cognitive Abilities Screening Instrument (CASI), the Sum of Boxes of Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR-SB), and the CDR. The cerebral coordination function was evaluated through correlations among 15 joints with a kinetic depth sensor annually. An intra-individual comparison of both cognitive and motor coordination functions was performed to examine their correlations. Results: The changes in coordination function in the lower limbs can significantly reflect the clinical outcomes, MMSE (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), CASI (p = 0.006), CDR (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), and CDR-SB (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), but the changes in upper limbs can only reflect the clinical outcome in CDR (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). Conclusions: The use of a kinetic depth sensor to determine the coordination between joints, especially in lower limbs, can significantly reflect the global functional and cognitive outcomes in AD. Such evaluations could be another biomarker used to evaluate non-cognitive outcomes in AD for clinical and research purposes.</p>

	<p>This study aims to investigate distractibility quantified by recording and analyzing eye movements during task-irrelevant distraction in children with and without ADHD and in children with and without neurological disorders. Gaze behavior data and press latencies of 141 participants aged 6&amp;amp;ndash;17 that were collected during a computerized distraction paradigm with task-irrelevant stimuli (IDistrack) were analyzed. Children using attention-regulating medication were excluded from participation. Data were analyzed for subgroups that were formed based on the presence of neurological disorders and the presence of ADHD separately. Participants with ADHD and participants with neurological disorders spent less time fixating on the target stimuli compared to their peers without ADHD (p = 0.025) or their peers without neurological disorders (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). Participants with and without ADHD had equal press latencies (p = 0.79). Participants with neurological disorders had a greater press latency compared to their typically developing peers (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). Target fixation duration shows a significant association with parent-reported attention problems (r = &amp;amp;minus;0.39, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). We conclude that eye tracking during a distraction task reveals potentially valid clinical information that may contribute to the assessment of dysfunctional attentional processes. Further research on the validity and reliability of this paradigm is recommended.</p>

	<p>Abstract: Multisensory integration refers to sensory inputs from different sensory modalities being processed simultaneously to produce a unitary output. Surrounded by stimuli from multiple modalities, animals utilize multisensory integration to form a coherent and robust representation of the complex environment. Even though multisensory integration is fundamentally essential for animal life, our understanding of the underlying mechanisms, especially at the molecular, synaptic and circuit levels, remains poorly understood. The study of sensory perception in Caenorhabditis elegans has begun to fill this gap. We have gained a considerable amount of insight into the general principles of sensory neurobiology owing to C. elegans&amp;amp;rsquo; highly sensitive perceptions, relatively simple nervous system, ample genetic tools and completely mapped neural connectome. Many interesting paradigms of multisensory integration have been characterized in C. elegans, for which input convergence occurs at the sensory neuron or the interneuron level. In this narrative review, we describe some representative cases of multisensory integration in C. elegans, summarize the underlying mechanisms and compare them with those in mammalian systems. Despite the differences, we believe C. elegans is able to provide unique insights into how processing and integrating multisensory inputs can generate flexible and adaptive behaviors. With the emergence of whole brain imaging, the ability of C. elegans to monitor nearly the entire nervous system may be crucial for understanding the function of the brain as a whole.</p>

	<p>The present work is a replication article based on the paper &amp;amp;ldquo;Are there shared neural correlates between dyslexia and ADHD? A meta-analysis of voxel-based morphometry studies&amp;amp;rdquo; by McGrath and Stoodley (2019). In the original research, the authors used activation likelihood estimation (ALE), a technique to perform coordinate-based meta-analysis (CBMA), to investigate the existence of brain regions undergoing gray matter alteration in association with both attention-deficit/hyper-activity disorder (ADHD) and dyslexia. Here, the same voxel-based morphometry dataset was analyzed, while using the permutation-subject images version of signed differential mapping (PSI-SDM) in place of ALE. Overall, the replication converged with the original paper in showing a limited overlap between the two conditions. In particular, no significant effect was found for dyslexia, therefore precluding any form of comparison between the two disorders. The possible influences of biological sex, age, and medication status were also ruled out. Our findings are in line with literature about gray matter alteration associated with ADHD and dyslexia, often showing conflicting results. Therefore, although neuropsychological and clinical evidence suggest some convergence between ADHD and dyslexia, more future research is sorely needed to reach a consensus on the neuroimaging domain in terms of patterns of gray matter alteration.</p>

	<p>Proper brain development requires the precise coordination and orchestration of various molecular and cellular processes and dysregulation of these processes can lead to neurological diseases. In the past decades, post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression has been shown to contribute to various aspects of brain development and function in the central nervous system. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), short non-coding RNAs, are emerging as crucial players in post-transcriptional gene regulation in a variety of tissues, such as the nervous system. In recent years, miRNAs have been implicated in multiple aspects of brain development, including neurogenesis, migration, axon and dendrite formation, and synaptogenesis. Moreover, altered expression and dysregulation of miRNAs have been linked to neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a powerful imaging technology to obtain high-quality, detailed structural and functional information from the brains of human and animal models in a non-invasive manner. Because the spatial expression patterns of miRNAs in the brain, unlike those of DNA and RNA, remain largely unknown, a whole-brain imaging approach using MRI may be useful in revealing biological and pathological information about the brain affected by miRNAs. In this review, we highlight recent advancements in the research of miRNA-mediated modulation of neuronal processes that are important for brain development and their involvement in disease pathogenesis. Also, we overview each MRI technique, and its technological considerations, and discuss the applications of MRI techniques in miRNA research. This review aims to link miRNA biological study with MRI analytical technology and deepen our understanding of how miRNAs impact brain development and pathology of neurological diseases.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Stroke is a leading cause of human death and disability. Effective early treatments with reasonable therapeutic windows remain critically important to improve the outcomes of stroke. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is an established noninvasive technique that has been applied clinically and in animal research for multiple brain disorders, but few studies have examined acute neuroprotection against ischemic stroke. The present investigation tested the novel approach of low-frequency repetitive TMS (rTMS) as an acute treatment after ischemic stroke.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Adult male rats received focal ischemic surgery through occlusion of the right middle cerebral artery for 60 minutes. The rats received either rTMS or sham treatment with 1.5-, 3-, 4-, or 7-hour delay after the onset of stroke. Low-frequency and low-intensity rTMS was applied to the rat brain for two 30-minute episodes separated by a 1-hour interval.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Three days after stroke, compared to stroke controls, rats receiving rTMS treatment with a 1.5-hour delay showed a 35% reduction of infarct volume. Protective effects were also seen with 3- or 4-hour-delayed treatments by rTMS, shown as reduced infarct volume and cell death. rTMS treatment upregulated the antiapoptotic factor Bcl-2 and downregulated the proapoptotic caspase-3 cleavage, expressions of Bax and matrix metallopeptidase-9. In sensorimotor functional assessments 3 to 21 days after stroke, rats receiving rTMS treatment with a 1.5- or 3-hour delay showed significantly better performance compared to stroke controls.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>These results support the inference that low-frequency rTMS may be feasible as a neuroprotective acute treatment after ischemic stroke. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

                Ablation of the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) Pantr2 re- sults in microcephaly in a knockout murine model of cor- ticogenesis, however, the precise mechanisms used are un- known. We present evidence that Pantr2 is a trans-acting lncRNA that regulates gene expression and chromatin ac- cessibility both in vivo and in vitro. We demonstrate that ec- topic expression of Pantr2 in a neuroblastoma cell line alters gene expression under differentiating conditions, and that both loss and gain of function of Pantr2 results in changes to cell-cycle dynamics. We show that expression of both the transcription factor Nfix and the cell cycle regulator Rgcc are negatively regulated by Pantr2. Using RNA binding pro- tein motif analysis and existing CLIP-seq data, we annotate potential HuR and QKI binding sites on Pantr2, and demon- strate that HuR does not directly bind Pantr2 using RNA immunoprecipitation assay. Finally, using Gene Ontology enrichment analysis, we identify disruption of both Notch and Wnt signaling following loss of Pantr2 expression, indi- cating potential Pantr2-dependent regulation of these path- ways.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Noninvasive, automated and reliable detection of spreading depolarizations in severe traumatic brain injury using scalp EEG</a></h4>

              
                Background: Noninvasive detection of spreading depolarizations (SD), as a potentially treatable mechanism of worsening brain injuries after traumatic brain injuries (TBI), has remained elusive. Current methods to detect SDs are based on intracranial recording, an invasive method with limited spatial coverage. Less invasive methods to diagnose SD are needed to improve generalizability and application of this emerging science and to guide worsening brain injury treatments. Here, we demonstrate, for the first time, a signal processing paradigm that can enable automated detection of SDs using noninvasive electroencephalography (EEG). Methods: Building on our previously developed WAVEFRONT algorithm, we have designed a novel automated SD detection method. This algorithm, with learnable parameters and improved velocity estimation, extracts and tracks propagating power depressions, as well as near-DC shifts using low-density EEG. This modified WAVEFRONT is robust to the amplitude outliers and non-propagating depressions on the scalp. We show the feasibility of detecting SD events (700 total SDs) in continuous, low-density scalp EEG recording (95{+/-}42.2 hours with 19 electrodes) acquired from 12 severe TBI patients who underwent decompressive hemicraniectomy (DHC) and intracranial EEG that could be used as a ground truth for event detection. We quantify the performance of WAVEFRONT in terms of SD detection accuracy, including true positive rate (TPR) and false positive rate (FPR), as well as the accuracy of estimating the frequency of SDs. Results: WAVEFRONT achieves the best average validation accuracy of 74% TPR (with 95% confidence interval of 70.8%-76.7%), with less than 1.5% FPR using Delta band EEG. Preliminary evidence suggests that WAVEFRONT can achieve a very good performance (regression with R2 [~=] 0.71) in the estimation of SD frequencies. Conclusions: We demonstrate feasibility and quantify the performance of noninvasive SD detection after severe TBI using an automated algorithm. WAVEFRONT can potentially be used for diagnosis and monitoring of worsening brain injuries to guide treatments by providing a measure of SD frequency. Extension of these results to patients with intact skulls requires further study.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Efficiency of heterogenous functional connectomes explains variance in callous-unemotional traits after computational lesioning of cortical midline and salience regions</a></h4>

              
                Callous-unemotional (CU) traits are a youth antisocial phenotype hypothesized to be a result of differences in the integration of multiple brain systems. However, mechanistic insights into these brain systems are a continued challenge. Where prior work describes activation and connectivity of the connectome in relation to these systems, new mechanistic insights can be derived by removing nodes and characterizing changes in network properties (hereafter referred to as computational lesioning) to characterize the resilience and vulnerability of the brains functional connectome. Here, we study the resilience of connectome integration in CU traits by estimating changes in efficiency after computationally lesioning individual-level connectomes. From resting-state data of 86 participants (48% female, age: mean= 14.52, SD= 1.31) drawn from the Nathan Kline institutes Rockland study, individual-level connectomes were estimated using graphical lasso. Computational lesioning was conducted both sequentially and by targeting global and local hubs. We calculated changes in network efficiency after each lesion. Then, elastic net regression was applied to determine how these changes explained variance in CU traits. Follow-up analyses characterized modeled node hubs, examined moderation, determined impact of targeting, and decoded the brain mask by comparing regions to meta-analytic maps. Elastic net regression revealed that computational lesioning of 23 nodes, network modularity, and Tanner stage explained variance in CU traits. Hub assignment of selected hubs differed at higher CU traits. No evidence for moderation between simulated lesioning and CU traits was found. Targeting global hubs increased efficiency and targeting local hubs had no effect at higher CU traits. Identified brain mask meta-analytically associated with more emotion and cognitive terms. Although reliable patterns were found across participants, adolescent brains were heterogeneous even for those with a similar CU traits score. Adolescent brain response to simulated lesioning revealed a pattern of connectome resiliency and vulnerability that explains variance in CU traits, which can aid prediction of youth at greater risk for higher CU traits.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Too Much Information Is No Information: How Machine Learning and Feature Selection Could Help in Understanding the Motor Control of Pointing</a></h4>

              
                The aim of this study was to develop the use of Machine Learning techniques as a means of multivariate analysis in studies of motor control. These studies generate a huge amount of data, the analysis of which continues to be largely univariate. We propose the use of machine learning classification and feature selection as a means of uncovering feature combinations that are altered between conditions. High dimensional electromyograms (EMG) vectors were generated as several arm and trunk muscles were recorded while subjects pointed at various angles above and below the gravity neutral horizontal plane. We used Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) to carry out binary classifications between the EMG vectors for pointing at a particular angle, versus pointing at the gravity neutral direction. Classification success provided a composite index of muscular adjustments for various task constraints (in this case, pointing angles). In order to find the combination of features that were significantly altered between task conditions, we conducted a post classification feature selection i.e. investigated which combination of features had allowed for the classification. Feature selection was done by comparing the representations of each category created by LDA for the classification. In other words computing the difference between the representations of each class. We propose that this approach will help with comparing high dimensional EMG patterns in two ways; i) quantifying the effects of the entire pattern rather than using single arbitrarily defined variables and ii) identifying the parts of the patterns that convey the most information regarding the investigated effects.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Tight control of the APP-Mint1 interaction in regulating amyloid production</a></h4>

              
                Generation of amyloid-beta (A{beta}) peptides through the proteolytic processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) is one pathogenic event in Alzheimer's disease (AD). APP is a type I transmembrane protein and endocytosis of APP mediated by the endocytic YENPTY sequence is a key step in A{beta} generation. We and others have found that Mints, a family of cytosolic adaptor proteins, directly binds to the YENPTY motif of APP via phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domain of Mints, facilitates APP trafficking and processing. We also show mutation of Tyr633 of Mint1 (Mint1Y633A) enhances APP binding and processing. Now, we created a low-affinity Mint1 mutant that targets two conserved residues, Tyr549 and Phe610 (Mint1Y549A/F610A), that reduced APP binding. Here, we investigate how perturbing the APP-Mint1 interaction alters APP and Mint1 cellular dynamics as well as Mint1's interaction with its other binding partners. We show that Mint1Y633A increased binding affinity specifically for APP and presenilin1, enhanced APP endocytosis, and A{beta} secretion in primary neurons. Conversely, Mint1Y549A/F610A exhibited reduced APP affinity and A{beta} secretion. In fact, the effect of Mint1Y549A/F610A on A{beta} release was greater compared to knocking down all three Mint proteins, supporting targeting APP-Mint1 interaction as a potential AD therapeutic.

	<p>Aiming to examine whether specific motor signs are associated with worse performance in specific cognitive domains among cognitively unimpaired (CU) individuals, we performed a cross-sectional analysis of data from the baseline evaluations of older, CU participants from the National Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s Coordinating Center (NACC) Uniform Data Set. In total, 8149 CU (&amp;amp;ge;60 years) participants were included. Of these, 905 individuals scored &amp;amp;ge; 2 on at least one of the motor domains of the Unified Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s Disease Rating Scale part III (UPDRSIII). Cognitively impaired individuals, participants with psychiatric disorders and/or under treatment with antipsychotic, anxiolytic, sedative or hypnotic agents were excluded. Nine motor signs were examined: hypophonia, masked facies, resting tremor, action/postural tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia, impaired chair rise, impaired posture/gait and postural instability. Their association with performance on episodic memory, semantic memory, language, attention, processing speed or executive function was assessed using crude and adjusted linear regression models. Individuals with impaired chair rise had worse episodic memory, semantic memory, processing speed and executive function, while those with bradykinesia had worse language, processing speed and executive function. Sensitivity analyses, by excluding participants with cerebrovascular disease or PD, or other Parkinsonism, produced similar results with the exception of the relationship between bradykinesia and language performance.</p>

	<p>Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s Disease (AD) is characterized by cognitive impairment and the presence of amyloid-&amp;amp;beta; (A&amp;amp;beta;) plaques and tau tangles. This study was conducted to assess the effects of white button mushroom (WBM) supplementation on spatial memory and plaque formation in mice with mutations in amyloid (A&amp;amp;beta;). Mice with amyloid precursor protein (hAPP) mutations and their wildtype (WT) littermates were fed a 10% white button mushroom (WBM) feed ad libitum three times per week, in addition to their normal diet. Morris water maze (MWM) was conducted at 14 and 32 weeks of age to assess spatial memory and A&amp;amp;beta; plaque pathology in the hippocampus was analyzed. Our results showed that hAPP mice on the WBM diet were faster in reaching the platform in the MWM compared to hAPP mice on the control diet at 32 weeks (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). Significantly fewer plaque deposits were found in the hippocampi of hAPP mice on the WBM diet compared to those on the control diet at 32 weeks (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). Overall, hAPP mice on the WBM diet had improved spatial memory at 32 weeks of age compared to those on the control diet and exhibited fewer amyloid plaques.</p>

	<p>A better understanding of biological and emotional variables associated with health-related quality of life in people with long-COVID is needed. Our aim was to identify potential direct and indirect effects on the relationships between sensitization-associated symptoms, mood disorders such as anxiety/depressive levels, and sleep quality on health-related quality of life in people suffering from post-COVID-19 pain. One hundred and forty-six individuals who were hospitalized due to COVID-19 during the first wave of the pandemic and suffering from long-term post-COVID-19 pain completed different patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs), including clinical features, symptoms associated with sensitization of the central nervous system (Central Sensitization Inventory), mood disorders (Hospital Anxiety and Depressive Scale), sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index), and health-related quality of life (paper-based five-level version of EuroQol-5D) in a face-to-face interview conducted at 18.8 (SD 1.8) months after hospitalization. Different mediation models were conducted to assess the direct and indirect effects of the associations among the different variables. The mediation models revealed that sensitization-associated symptoms and depressive levels directly affected health-related quality of life; however, these effects were not statistically significant when sleep quality was included. In fact, the effect of sensitization-associated symptomatology on quality of life (&amp;amp;beta; = &amp;amp;minus;0.10, 95% CI &amp;amp;minus;0.1736, &amp;amp;minus;0.0373), the effect of depressive levels on quality of life (&amp;amp;beta;= &amp;amp;minus;0.09, 95% CI &amp;amp;minus;0.1789, &amp;amp;minus;0.0314), and the effect of anxiety levels on quality of life (&amp;amp;beta; = &amp;amp;minus;0.09, 95% CI &amp;amp;minus;0.1648, &amp;amp;minus;0.0337) were all indirectly mediated by sleep quality. This study revealed that sleep quality mediates the relationship between sensitization-associated symptoms and mood disorders (depressive/anxiety levels) with health-related quality of life in individuals who were hospitalized with COVID-19 at the first wave of the pandemic and reporting post-COVID-19 pain. Longitudinal studies will help to determine the clinical implications of these findings.</p>

	<p>(1) Aim: We aim to evaluate the association between arousals during sleep and subclinical coronary atherosclerosis detected by coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA) in patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). (2) Methods: This was a cross-sectional study. Consecutive newly diagnosed OSA patients, who underwent coronary CTA examinations within 3 months of the sleep study, were eligible. We used the arousal index (ArI) derived from polysomnography to assess arousals during sleep and a semi-automated plaque quantification software to characterize and quantify the subclinical coronary atherosclerosis. Multiple regression models were used to evaluate the associations of the ArI with the coronary atherosclerotic plaque presence, volume, and composition. (3) Results: A total of 99 patients with OSA were included in the study. In the multivariable models, patients with a high ArI (ArI &amp;amp;gt; 32.2 events/h) were more likely to have coronary plaques compared to those with a low ArI (ArI &amp;amp;le; 32.2 events/h) (OR: 3.29 [95% CI: 1.284 to 8.427], p = 0.013). Furthermore, the ArI exhibited significant associations with total (&amp;amp;beta; = 0.015), noncalcified (&amp;amp;beta; = 0.015), and low-attenuation (&amp;amp;beta; = 0.012) coronary plaque volume after accounting for established risk factors (p = 0.008, 0.004, and 0.002, respectively). However, no association between the ArI and calcified plaque volume was found. (4) Conclusion: Repetitive arousals during sleep are associated with an increased coronary plaque burden in patients with OSA, which remained robust after adjusting for multiple established cardiovascular risk factors.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Paradigm shift in medical education due to the COVID-19 pandemic: guidelines for developing a blended learning curriculum in medical education [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has transformed the world’s economy, health and education in a blink of an eye. Almost 1 billion learners have been affected across the globe. This has resulted in a paradigm shift to blended learning. Therefore, it was felt necessary to provide practical guidelines for the development of blended curriculum in medical education. It would help to overcome the challenges faced due to unprecedented transformation of medical education on account of pandemic. Methods: Guidelines based on personal experience of the authors and literature search were developed using the complex adapted blended learning system (CALBS) framework. Seven experts developed these guidelines using the nominal group technique. The consent form and literature for CABLS framework was shared with experts. The experts developed the guidelines independently during phase one of the technique. After a given time, phase 2 started with moderator mediated discussion about the individual guidelines developed by the experts. After discussion and mutual consensus four types of guideline ideas were developed. During the third phase the experts ranked the guideline ideas on a scale of 1 to 5. The guideline idea that ranked highest was selected as a final guideline for developing a blended learning curriculum. Results: The group consensus resulted in developing seven guidelines for a blended course or curriculum in medical education. These guidelines are based on a conceptual framework supplemented by expert’s own personal experience and current evidence from literature. Conclusions: These guidelines would provide a comprehensive and systematic approach to develop a blended learning curriculum in medical education.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Sex-related differences in symptom presentation of patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: In patients with myocardial infarction, atypical symptoms at onset have been demonstrated in women. We aimed to investigate the presence of sex-related differences in symptom presentation in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) to enable earlier diagnosis and treatment. Methods: We assessed symptoms on admission to hospital in 343 patients with aSAH in this retrospective single-center cohort-study. Univariate statistical analysis was performed by comparing sexes including the whole study population and subgroups (dichotomized using Fisher scale 1-2 vs. 3-4, WFNS grade 1-3 vs. 4-5, and anterior vs. posterior circulation aneurysms, respectively). Results: The majority of patients was female (63.6%, n=218, vs. 36.4%, n=125), the mean age 57.4 years (standard deviation (SD) 13.3) with older women compared to men (59.2, SD 13.8, vs. 54.4, SD 11.6; p=0.003). Anterior communicating artery (AcomA) aneurysms were most common (30.9%, n=106), predominantly in men (43.2%, n=54, vs. 23.9%, n=52; p=0.0002), whereas posterior communicating artery (PcomA) aneurysms were more frequent in women (19.3%, n=42, vs. 8.8%, n=11; p=0.005). Exercise-induced headache was more often reported by men (10.4%, n=13, vs. 5%, n=11; p=0.04) in all patients as well as in the subgroup of WFNS 1-3. Anisocoria was more frequent in women within the subgroup of severely impaired consciousness (WFNS 4-5; 25.3%, n=22, vs. 10.7%, n=6; p=0.032). For all other symptoms, there was no evidence for sex-specific differences in the whole study group as well as in subgroups. Conclusion: Our results show no evidence for relevant sex-related differences in symptom presentation at onset in aSAH patients. Women presenting with an acute onset anisocoria should be screened even more carefully for an underlying ruptured Pcom aneurysm.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Aspergillus oryzae attenuates quorum sensing -associated virulence factors and biofilm formation in Klebsiella pneumoniae extended-spectrum beta-lactamases [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Klebsiella pneumoniae communicate between and among species using quorum sensing (QS). Biofilm formation and virulence factors are regulated by QS. This QS is indirectly responsible for K. pneumoniae pathogenicity. Inhibiting QS is a novel and highly effective method for controlling K. pneumoniae extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (KP-ESBL) infections. This study aimed to investigate how Aspergillus oryzae extracellular protein (AOEP) affected QS and KP-ESBL virulence factors. Methods: Methods used included minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) through the microdilution method, biofilms with crystal violet staining, extracellular polysaccharides using the Congo Red assay, quantifying the expression of genes coding for capsular polysaccharide (wzI gene) and adhesion (mrkA gene) through quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), siderophore level measurement using Chrome Azurol sulphonate assay (CAS assay), biofilm morphology using a scanning electron microscope (SEM), and confirmation using the life span killing assay method on Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans). Results: In vitro studies revealed that AOEP inhibited biofilms and exopolysaccharides (EPS) in KP-ESBL at the sub-MIC level. In addition, AOEP inhibited the expression of the mrkA gene, which is involved in the adhesion process. Furthermore, an in vivo study revealed that AOEP levels of 75 and 150 µg/mL respectively increased C. elegans survival rates by 72.67% and 80.76% against K. pneumoniae infection. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the extracellular protein of A. oryzae may be an effective QS inhibitor and a novel anti-virulence agent to control bacterial pathogens.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Viewing the global health system as a complex adaptive system – implications for research and practice [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                The global health system (GHS) is ill-equipped to deal with the increasing number of transnational challenges. The GHS needs reform to enhance global resilience to future risks to health. In this article we argue that the starting point for any reform must be conceptualizing and studying the GHS as a complex adaptive system (CAS) with a large and escalating number of interconnected global health actors that learn and adapt their behaviours in response to each other and changes in their environment. The GHS can be viewed as a multi-scalar, nested health system comprising all national health systems together with the global health architecture, in which behaviours are influenced by cross-scale interactions. However, current methods cannot adequately capture the dynamism or complexity of the GHS or quantify the effects of challenges or potential reform options. We provide an overview of a selection of systems thinking and complexity science methods available to researchers and highlight the numerous policy insights their application could yield.   We also discuss the challenges for researchers of applying these methods and for policy makers of digesting and acting upon them. We encourage application of a CAS approach to GHS research and policy making to help bolster resilience to future risks that transcend national boundaries and system scales.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Case Report: Interstitial-intralesional laser therapy and laser-assisted new attachment procedure for the treatment of alveolar bone loss provoked by an aggressive pyogenic granuloma [version 3; peer review: 2 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: A pyogenic granuloma (PG) is a common benign vascular lesion found in the oral cavity. The gold standard treatment of this lesion, comprising surgical excision and the elimination of etiological factors, cannot avoid tooth loss in the case of an aggressive pyogenic granuloma. Because of the prominent properties of 980 nm and 635 nm diode lasers in photocoagulation and photobiomodulation, we applied these wavelengths in the treatment of a large pyogenic granuloma with alveolar bone loss. Case presentation: Our objective was to use a combination of interstitial-intralesional laser therapy, photocoagulation and laser-assisted new attachment procedure (LANAP) to preserve the teeth and periodontal tissue in a case of an aggressive pyogenic granuloma. Results: The patient was a 13-year-old Thai male with a pyogenic granuloma involving the interdental papilla and lingual gingiva of the lower left first and second molars. The teeth were also displaced by the lesion. After treatment with three sessions of photocoagulation, three sessions of interstitial-intralesional laser therapy and two sessions of LANAP, the lesion was completely resolved. The periodontal status of the teeth was improved at the six-month follow-up. Conclusion: The combination of interstitial-intralesional laser therapy, photocoagulation and LANAP was able to treat an aggressive pyogenic granuloma with tooth preservation.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Understanding molecular mechanisms and predicting phenotypic effects of pathogenic tubulin mutations</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Thomas J. Attard, Julie P. I. Welburn, Joseph A. Marsh</p>

Cells rely heavily on microtubules for several processes, including cell division and molecular trafficking. Mutations in the different tubulin-α and -β proteins that comprise microtubules have been associated with various diseases and are often dominant, sporadic and congenital. While the earliest reported tubulin mutations affect neurodevelopment, mutations are also associated with other disorders such as bleeding disorders and infertility. We performed a systematic survey of tubulin mutations across all isotypes in order to improve our understanding of how they cause disease, and increase our ability to predict their phenotypic effects. Both protein structural analyses and computational variant effect predictors were very limited in their utility for differentiating between pathogenic and benign mutations. This was even worse for those genes associated with non-neurodevelopmental disorders. We selected tubulin-α and -β disease mutations that were most poorly predicted for experimental characterisation. These mutants co-localise to the mitotic spindle in HeLa cells, suggesting they may exert dominant-negative effects by altering microtubule properties. Our results show that tubulin mutations represent a blind spot for current computational approaches, being much more poorly predicted than mutations in most human disease genes. We suggest that this is likely due to their strong association with dominant-negative and gain-of-function mechanisms.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Rule-based and stimulus-based cues bias auditory decisions via different computational and physiological mechanisms</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Nathan Tardiff, Lalitta Suriya-Arunroj, Yale E. Cohen, Joshua I. Gold</p>

Expectations, such as those arising from either learned rules or recent stimulus regularities, can bias subsequent auditory perception in diverse ways. However, it is not well understood if and how these diverse effects depend on the source of the expectations. Further, it is unknown whether different sources of bias use the same or different computational and physiological mechanisms. We examined how rule-based and stimulus-based expectations influenced behavior and pupil-linked arousal, a marker of certain forms of expectation-based processing, of human subjects performing an auditory frequency-discrimination task. Rule-based cues consistently biased choices and response times (RTs) toward the more-probable stimulus. In contrast, stimulus-based cues had a complex combination of effects, including choice and RT biases toward and away from the frequency of recently presented stimuli. These different behavioral patterns also had: 1) distinct computational signatures, including different modulations of key components of a novel form of a drift-diffusion decision model and 2) distinct physiological signatures, including substantial bias-dependent modulations of pupil size in response to rule-based but not stimulus-based cues. These results imply that different sources of expectations can modulate auditory processing via distinct mechanisms: one that uses arousal-linked, rule-based information and another that uses arousal-independent, stimulus-based information to bias the speed and accuracy of auditory perceptual decisions.

Calmodulin (CaM) is a calcium sensor which binds and regulates a wide range of target-proteins. This implicitly enables the concentration of calcium to influence many downstream physiological responses, including muscle contraction, learning and depression. The antipsychotic drug trifluoperazine (TFP) is a known CaM inhibitor. By binding to various sites, TFP prevents CaM from associating to target-proteins. However, the molecular and state-dependent mechanisms behind CaM inhibition by drugs such as TFP are largely unknown. Here, we build a Markov state model (MSM) from adaptively sampled molecular dynamics simulations and reveal the structural and dynamical features behind the inhibitory mechanism of TFP-binding to the C-terminal domain of CaM. We specifically identify three major TFP binding-modes from the MSM macrostates, and distinguish their effect on CaM conformation by using a systematic analysis protocol based on biophysical descriptors and tools from machine learning. The results show that depending on the binding orientation, TFP effectively stabilizes features of the calcium-unbound CaM, either affecting the CaM hydrophobic binding pocket, the calcium binding sites or the secondary structure content in the bound domain. The conclusions drawn from this work may in the future serve to formulate a complete model of pharmacological modulation of CaM, which furthers our understanding of how these drugs affect signaling pathways as well as associated diseases.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">DLoopCaller: A deep learning approach for predicting genome-wide chromatin loops by integrating accessible chromatin landscapes</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Siguo Wang, Qinhu Zhang, Ying He, Zhen Cui, Zhenghao Guo, Kyungsook Han, De-Shuang Huang</p>

In recent years, major advances have been made in various chromosome conformation capture technologies to further satisfy the needs of researchers for high-quality, high-resolution contact interactions. Discriminating the loops from genome-wide contact interactions is crucial for dissecting three-dimensional(3D) genome structure and function. Here, we present a deep learning method to predict genome-wide chromatin loops, called DLoopCaller, by combining accessible chromatin landscapes and raw Hi-C contact maps. Some available orthogonal data ChIA-PET/HiChIP and Capture Hi-C were used to generate positive samples with a wider contact matrix which provides the possibility to find more potential genome-wide chromatin loops. The experimental results demonstrate that DLoopCaller effectively improves the accuracy of predicting genome-wide chromatin loops compared to the state-of-the-art method Peakachu. Moreover, compared to two of most popular loop callers, such as HiCCUPS and Fit-Hi-C, DLoopCaller identifies some unique interactions. We conclude that a combination of chromatin landscapes on the one-dimensional genome contributes to understanding the 3D genome organization, and the identified chromatin loops reveal cell-type specificity and transcription factor motif co-enrichment across different cell lines and species.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Prioritizing interventions for preventing COVID-19 outbreaks in military basic training</a></h4>

Like other congregate living settings, military basic training has been subject to outbreaks of COVID-19. We sought to identify improved strategies for preventing outbreaks in this setting using an agent-based model of a hypothetical cohort of trainees on a U.S. Army post. Our analysis revealed unique aspects of basic training that require customized approaches to outbreak prevention, which draws attention to the possibility that customized approaches may be necessary in other settings, too. In particular, we showed that introductions by trainers and support staff may be a major vulnerability, given that those individuals remain at risk of community exposure throughout the training period. We also found that increased testing of trainees upon arrival could actually increase the risk of outbreaks, given the potential for false-positive test results to lead to susceptible individuals becoming infected in group isolation and seeding outbreaks in training units upon release. Until an effective transmission-blocking vaccine is adopted at high coverage by individuals involved with basic training, need will persist for non-pharmaceutical interventions to prevent outbreaks in military basic training. Ongoing uncertainties about virus variants and breakthrough infections necessitate continued vigilance in this setting, even as vaccination coverage increases.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Disentangling choice value and choice conflict in sequential decisions under risk</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Laura Fontanesi, Amitai Shenhav, Sebastian Gluth</p>

Recent years have witnessed a surge of interest in understanding the neural and cognitive dynamics that drive sequential decision making in general and foraging behavior in particular. Due to the intrinsic properties of most sequential decision-making paradigms, however, previous research in this area has suffered from the difficulty to disentangle properties of the decision related to (a) the value of switching to a new patch versus, which increases monotonically, and (b) the conflict experienced between choosing to stay or leave, which first increases but then decreases after reaching the point of indifference between staying and switching. Here, we show how the same problems arise in studies of sequential decision-making under risk, and how they can be overcome, taking as a specific example recent research on the ‘pig’ dice game. In each round of the ‘pig’ dice game, people roll a die and accumulate rewards until they either decide to proceed to the next round or lose all rewards. By combining simulation-based dissections of the task structure with two experiments, we show how an extension of the standard paradigm, together with cognitive modeling of decision-making processes, allows to disentangle properties related to either switch value or choice conflict. Our study elucidates the cognitive mechanisms of sequential decision making and underscores the importance of avoiding potential pitfalls of paradigms that are commonly used in this research area.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Theoretical investigation of active listening behavior based on the echolocation of CF-FM bats</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Takahiro Hiraga, Yasufumi Yamada, Ryo Kobayashi</p>

Bats perceive the three-dimensional environment by emitting ultrasound pulses from their nose or mouth and receiving echoes through both ears. To determine the position of a target object, it is necessary to know the distance and direction of the target. Certain bat species that use a combined signal of long constant frequency and short frequency modulated ultrasounds synchronize their pinnae movement with pulse emission, and this behavior has been regarded as helpful for localizing the elevation angle of a reflective sound source. However, the significance of bats’ ear motions remains unclear. In this study, we construct a model of an active listening system including the motion of the ears, and conduct mathematical investigations to clarify the importance of ear motion in direction detection of the reflective sound source. In the simulations, direction detection under rigid ear movements with interaural level differences was mathematically investigated by assuming that bats accomplish direction detection using the amplitude modulation in the echoes caused by ear movements. In particular, the ear motion conditions required for direction detection are theoretically investigated through exhaustive simulations of the pseudo-motion of the ears, rather than simulations of the actual ear motions of bats. The theory suggests that only certain ear motions, namely three-axis rotation, allow for accurate and robust direction detection. Our theoretical analysis also strongly supports the behavior whereby bats move their pinnae in the antiphase mode. In addition, we suggest that simple shaped hearing directionality and well-selected uncomplicated ear motions are sufficient to achieve precise and robust direction detection. Our findings and mathematical approach have the potential to be used in the design of active sensing systems in various engineering fields.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Predictive factor of renal function recoverability in upper-tract obstructive uropathy after percutaneous nephrostomy and Double -J stent insertion in Indonesian National Referral Hospital [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: Obstructive uropathy (OU) is defined as an alteration in any level of the urinary tract that is caused by abnormalities of its system organs, or external pathological factors. Hydronephrosis and progressive renal impairment are signs of upper-tract OU. OU  accounted to be around 0,9% - 3,8% of prevalence for etiology of hydronephrosis. The aim of OU treatment is to achieve optimal urinary diversion, either by retrograde intra-ureteral stenting or percutaneous drainage. However, improvement of renal function after urinary diversion is not always evident. The purpose of this study was to identify predictive factors of improvement in renal function following ureteral stent insertion or percutaneous nephrostomy in OU cases. Methods: This was a retrospective, single-center study on patients with OU, who underwent ureteral stenting with Double J (DJ) stent or percutaneous nephrostomy. Several commonly measured clinical indices were documented, including preoperative haemoglobin, Ht, leucocyte, thrombocyte, serum creatinine, blood urea, electrolyte, blood urea to serum creatinine ratio, and renal parenchymal thickness. We focused on finding which parameters correlated with postsurgical decrease in serum creatinine level. Result: We evaluate 567 patients that underwent DJ stent insertion and percutaneous nephrostomy. There was a statistically significant relationship between parenchymal thickness with post-operative creatinine serum decrease, with an OR of 11.24 (p<0.01, CI 7,5 – 16,8). Another parameter that has a statistically significant relationship with successful operative outcomes was blood urea to serum creatinine with OR = 27,9 (p-value < 0.01, 95% CI 17,4 – 44,8. Other laboratory factors had no statistical significance in predicting renal function recoverability. Conclusion: There was a statistically significant relationship between renal parenchymal thickness and blood urea-creatinine ratio with a favourable operational outcome in OU, as evidenced by a reduction in postoperative creatinine serum level.

                Background There is evidence that patients with COVID-19 have a higher prevalence of mental health problems than the normal population. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of mental health problems and their associated factors in patients with asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic in the hospitel in Thailand. Methods Mental health problems were evaluated using the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale - 21 items, and Patient Health Questionnaire-9. The prevalence of mental health problems was presented by frequency and percentage. McNemar's test was used to compare the prevalence of mental health problems between day 1 and day 7. Binary logistic regression was used to identify potential predictors of mental health problems. Results A total of 186 participants (68.3% female; mean age = 37.21 years (SD 13.66) were recruited. The depression, anxiety, and stress rate on day 1 of admission was 26.9%, 32.3% and 25.8%, respectively. Having mild COVID-19 symptoms was a significantly associated factor with anxiety (OR=2.69, 95%CI: 1.05-6.89) and stress (OR=4.53, 95%CI: 1.32-15.55). Conclusions There was a high rate of mental health problems in COVID-19 patients. Detecting and managing mental health problems should be considered standard care for COVID-19 patients.

                Background: Open Science seeks to render research outputs visible, accessible and reusable. In this context, Research Data and Research Software sharing and dissemination issues provide real challenges to the scientific community, as consequence of recent progress in political, legal and funding requirements. Methods: We take advantage from the approach we have developed in a precedent publication, in which we have highlighted the similarities between the Research Data and Research Software definitions. Results: The similarities between Research Data and Research Software definitions can be extended to propose protocols for Research Data dissemination and evaluation derived from those already proposed for Research Software dissemination and evaluation. We also analyze FAIR principles for these outputs. Conclusions: Our proposals here provide concrete instructions for Research Data and Research Software producers to make them more findable and accessible, as well as arguments to choose suitable dissemination platforms to complete the FAIR framework. Future work could analyze the potential extension of this parallelism to other kinds of research outputs that are disseminated under similar conditions to those of Research Data and Research Software, that is, without widely accepted publication procedures involving editors or other external actors and where the dissemination is usually restricted through the hands of the production team.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Associated predictor covariates of cervical cancer stage and impact on survival at Khartoum oncology hospital, Sudan [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Cervical cancer can be invasive and advanced at diagnosis causing devastating suffering and premature death. The cancer stage at presentation is related to survival evaluation and several factors determine stage. The aim of the study was to examine predictors covariates associated with cervical cancer stage at diagnosis and its impact on patient prognosis and survival. Methods: This retrospective cross-sectional study was carried out at Khartoum oncology hospital, Sudan. Participants were 239 cervical cancer patients diagnosed and treated between 2011-2015. Patients’ pathological and socio-demographic data were extracted from their medical files and survival times were calculated from follow-up. Chi-square, Kaplan-Meier, Log-rank test and Cox regression model were used to examine relationships between demographic and clinical variables and survival outcome. Results: The mean age of the participants was 56.91 years and the majority were ≥45 years. Cancer survival analysis showed that the stage at diagnosis had limited association with socio-demographic factors, except where patients reside. Multivariate regression using the Cox proportional hazard model confirmed strongly that stage (p=0.035), chemotherapy (p=0.000) and radiotherapy (p=0.001) were the most likely predictor covariates of patient prognosis and survival time. Conclusions: The results of this study suggest cancer stage at diagnosis and certain treatments are the most important factors impacting the prognosis and survival of patients with cervical cancer. Early detection and vaccination of women against HPV infection provide enormous opportunities for early diagnosis, more effective treatment and better chances of survival.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Qualitative analysis of HIV and AIDS disease transmission: impact of awareness, testing and effective follow up [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Since the early 1980s, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and its accompanying acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) have spread worldwide, becoming one of the world's major global health issues. From the beginning of the epidemic until 2020, about 79.3 million people became infected, with 36.3 million deaths due to AIDS illnesses. This huge figure is a result of those unaware of their status due to stigmatization and invariably spreading the virus unknowingly. Methods: Qualitative analysis through a mathematical model that will address HIV unaware individuals and the effect of an increasing defaulter on the dynamics of HIV/AIDS was investigated. The impact of treatment and the effect of inefficient follow-up on the transmission of HIV/AIDS were examined. The threshold for the effective reduction of the unaware status of HIV through testing, in response to awareness, and the significance of effective non-defaulting in treatment commonly called defaulters loss to follow-up as these individuals contribute immensely to the spread of the virus due to their increase in CD4+ count was determined in this study. Stability analysis of equilibrium points is performed using the basic reproduction number $R_0$, an epidemiological threshold that determines disease eradication or persistence in viral populations. We tested the most sensitive parameters in the basic reproduction numbers. The model of consideration in this study is based on the assumption that information (awareness) and non-stigmatization can stimulate change in the behaviours of infected individuals, and can lead to an increase in testing and adherence to treatment. This will in turn reduce the basic reproduction number, and consequently, the spread of the virus. Results: The results portray that the early identification and treatment are inadequate for the illness to be eradicated. Conclusions: Other control techniques, such as treatment adherence and effective condom usage, should be investigated in order to lessen the disease's burden.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Disease Progression in CMT related to MPZ Mutations: A Longitudinal Study</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The paucity of longitudinal natural history studies in <i>MPZ</i>-neuropathy remains a barrier to clinical trials. We have completed a longitudinal natural history study in patients with <i>MPZ</i>-neuropathies across 13 sites of the Inherited Neuropathy Consortium.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Change in Charcot Marie Tooth Examination scores (CMTES) and Rasch modified CMTES (CMTES-R) scores were evaluated using longitudinal regression over a 5-year period in subjects with <i>MPZ</i>-neuropathy. Data from 139 patients with <i>MPZ</i>-neuropathy were examined.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The average baseline CMTES and CMTES-R scores were 10.84 (SD 6.0, range 0 – 28) and 14.60 (SD= 7.56, range 0 - 32), respectively. A mixed regression model showed significant change in CMTES at years 2-5 [mean change from baseline of 0.87 points at 2 years (p=0.008)]. Subgroup analysis revealed greater change in CMTES at 2 years in subjects with axonal as compared to demyelinating neuropathy [mean change of 1.30 points, (p=0.016) versus 0.06 points, (p=0.889)]. Patients with a moderate baseline neuropathy severity also showed more notable change, by estimate, than those with mild or severe neuropathy [mean 2 year change of 1.14 for baseline CMTES 8-14 (p=0.025), versus -0.03 for baseline CMTES 0-7 (p=0.958) and 0.25 for baseline CMTES ≥15 (p=0.6897)]. The progression in patients harboring specific <i>MPZ</i> mutations was highly variable.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>CMTES scores are sensitive to change over time in adult patients with axonal but not demyelinating forms of <i>MPZ</i>-neuropathy. Change in CMTES was greatest in patients with moderate baseline disease severity. These findings will inform future clinical trials of <i>MPZ</i>-neuropathies.</p>

                <p>Nature Reviews Neuroscience, Published online: 07 October 2022; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41583-022-00643-z">doi:10.1038/s41583-022-00643-z</a></p>Fluorescent sensors of molecular activity have revolutionized our knowledge of the brain. However, their signals report a reaction between the target and the sensor molecules rather than the activity of interest per se. Thus, understanding the location, sensitivity and imaging environment of a sensor should help to avoid misinterpretation of its readout.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Stability and asynchrony of local communities but less so diversity increase regional stability of Inner Mongolian grassland</a></h4>

              
                Extending knowledge on ecosystem stability to larger spatial scales is urgently needed because present local-scale studies are generally ineffective in guiding management and conservation decisions of an entire region with diverse plant communities. We investigated stability of plant productivity across spatial scales and hierarchical levels of organization and analyzed impacts of dominant species, species diversity, and climatic factors using a multisite survey of Inner Mongolian grassland. We found that regional stability across distant local communities was related to stability and asynchrony of local communities. Using only dominant instead of all-species dynamics explained regional stability almost equally well. The diversity of all or only dominant species had comparatively weak effects on stability and synchrony, whereas a lower mean and higher variation of precipitation destabilized regional and local communities by reducing population stability and synchronizing species dynamics. We demonstrate that, for semi-arid temperate grassland with highly uneven species abundances, the stability of regional communities is increased by stability and asynchrony of local communities and these are more affected by climate rather than species diversity. Reduced amounts and increased variation of precipitation in the future may compromise the sustainable provision of ecosystem services to human well-being in this region.

                We created a new nonhuman primate model of the genetic neurodegenerative disorder Huntington’s disease (HD) by injecting a mixture of recombinant adeno-associated viral vectors, serotypes AAV2 and AAV2.retro, each expressing a fragment of human mutant <i>HTT</i> (<i>mHTT</i>) into the caudate and putamen of adult rhesus macaques. This modeling strategy results in expression of mutant huntingtin protein (mHTT) and aggregate formation in the injected brain regions, as well as dozens of other cortical and subcortical brain regions affected in human HD patients. We queried the disruption of cortico-basal ganglia circuitry for 30 months post-surgery using a variety of behavioral and imaging readouts. Compared to controls, mHTT-treated macaques developed working memory decline and progressive motor impairment. Multimodal imaging revealed circuit-wide white and gray matter degenerative processes in several key brain regions affected in HD. Taken together, we have developed a novel macaque model of HD that may be used to develop disease biomarkers and screen promising therapeutics.

                Macrophages and their precursor cells, monocytes, are the first line of defense of the body against foreign pathogens and tissue damage. Although the origins of macrophages are diverse, some common transcription factors (such as PU.1) are required to ensure proper development of monocytes/macrophages. Here we report that the deficiency of <i>zbtb14</i>, a transcription repressor gene belonging to <i>ZBTB</i> family, leads to an aberrant expansion of monocyte/macrophage population in zebrafish. Mechanistically, Zbtb14 functions as a negative regulator of <i>pu.1</i>, and SUMOylation on a conserved lysine is essential for the repression activity of Zbtb14. Moreover, a serine to phenylalanine mutation found in an acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patient could target ZBTB14 protein to autophagic degradation. Hence, <i>ZBTB14</i> is a newly identified gene implicated in both normal and malignant myelopoiesis.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Distinct neurexin-cerebellin complexes control AMPA- and NMDA-receptor responses in a circuit-dependent manner</a></h4>

              
                At CA1→subiculum synapses, alternatively spliced neurexin-1 (Nrxn1<sup>SS4+</sup>) and neurexin-3 (Nrxn3<sup>SS4+</sup>) enhance NMDA-receptors and suppress AMPA-receptors, respectively, without affecting synapse formation. Nrxn1<sup>SS4+</sup> and Nrxn3<sup>SS4+</sup> act by binding to secreted cerebellin-2 (Cbln2) that in turn activates postsynaptic GluD1 receptors. Whether neurexin-Cbln2-GluD1 signaling has additional functions besides regulating NMDA- and AMPA-receptors, and whether such signaling performs similar roles at other synapses, however, remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate using constitutive Cbln2 deletions in mice that at CA1→subiculum synapses, Cbln2 performs no additional developmental roles besides regulating AMPA- and NMDA-receptors. Moreover, low-level expression of functionally redundant Cbln1 did not compensate for a possible synapse-formation function of Cbln2 at CA1→subiculum synapses. In exploring the generality of these findings, we examined the prefrontal cortex where Cbln2 was recently implicated in spinogenesis, and the cerebellum where Cbln1 is known to regulate parallel-fiber synapses. In the prefrontal cortex, Nrxn1<sup>SS4+</sup>-Cbln2 signaling selectively controlled NMDA-receptors without affecting spine or synapse numbers, whereas Nrxn3<sup>SS4+</sup>-Cbln2 signaling had no apparent role. In the cerebellum, conversely, Nrxn3<sup>SS4+</sup>-Cbln1 signaling regulated AMPA-receptors, whereas now Nrxn1<sup>SS4+</sup>-Cbln1 signaling had no manifest effect. Thus, Nrxn1<sup>SS4+</sup>- and Nrxn3<sup>SS4+</sup>-Cbln1/2 signaling complexes differentially control NMDA- and AMPA-receptors in different synapses in diverse neural circuits without regulating synapse or spine formation.

                The estrous cycle is regulated by rhythmic endocrine interactions of the nervous and reproductive systems, which coordinate the hormonal and ovulatory functions of the ovary. Folliculogenesis and follicle progression require the orchestrated response of a variety of cell types to allow the maturation of the follicle and its sequela, ovulation, corpus luteum formation, and ovulatory wound repair. Little is known about the cell state dynamics of the ovary during the estrous cycle and the paracrine factors that help coordinate this process. Herein, we used single-cell RNA sequencing to evaluate the transcriptome of &gt;34,000 cells of the adult mouse ovary and describe the transcriptional changes that occur across the normal estrous cycle and other reproductive states to build a comprehensive dynamic atlas of murine ovarian cell types and states.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Determination of oligomeric states of proteins via dual-color colocalization with single molecule localization microscopy</a></h4>

              
                The oligomeric state of plasma membrane proteins is the result of the interactions between individual proteins and an important determinant of their function. Most approaches used to address this question rely on extracting these complexes from their native environment, which may disrupt weaker interactions. Therefore, microscopy techniques have been increasingly used in recent years to determine oligomeric states <i>in situ</i>. Classical light microscopy suffers from insufficient resolution, but super-resolution methods such as single molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) can circumvent this problem. When using SMLM to determine oligomeric states of proteins, subunits are labeled with fluorescent proteins that only emit light following activation or conversion at different wavelengths. Typically, individual molecules are counted based on a binomial distribution analysis of emission events detected within the same diffraction-limited volume. This strategy requires low background noise, a high recall rate for the fluorescent tag and intensive post-imaging data processing. To overcome these limitations, we developed a new method based on SMLM to determine the oligomeric state of plasma membrane proteins. Our dual-color colocalization (DCC) approach allows for accurate <i>in situ</i> counting even with low efficiencies of fluorescent protein detection. In addition, it is robust in the presence of background signals and does not require temporal clustering of localizations from individual proteins within the same diffraction limited volume, which greatly simplifies data acquisition and processing. We used DCC-SMLM to resolve the controversy surrounding the oligomeric state of two SLC26 multifunctional anion exchangers and to determine the oligomeric state of four members of the SLC17 family of organic anion transporters.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Unbiased proteomic and forward genetic screens reveal that mechanosensitive ion channel MSL10 functions at ER-plasma membrane contact sites in Arabidopsis thaliana</a></h4>

              
                Mechanosensitive (MS) ion channels are an evolutionarily conserved way for cells to sense mechanical forces and transduce them into ionic signals. The channel properties of <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> MscS-Like (MSL)10 have been well studied, but how MSL10 signals remains largely unknown. To uncover signaling partners of MSL10, we employed both a proteomic screen and a forward genetic screen; both unexpectedly implicated ER-plasma membrane contact sites (EPCSs) in MSL10 function. The proteomic screen revealed that MSL10 associates with multiple proteins associated with EPCSs. Of these, only VAMP-associated proteins (VAP)27-1 and VAP27-3 interacted directly with MSL10. The forward genetic screen, for suppressors of a gain-of-function <i>MSL10</i> allele (<i>msl10-3G, MSL10<sup>S640L</sup></i>), identified mutations in the <i>synaptotagmin (SYT)5</i> and <i>SYT7</i> genes. We also found that EPCSs were expanded in leaves of <i>msl10-3G</i> plants compared to the wild type. Taken together, these results indicate that MSL10 associates with and functions with EPCS proteins, providing a new cell-level framework for understanding MSL10 signaling. In addition, placing a mechanosensory protein at EPCSs provides new insight into the function and regulation of this type of subcellular compartment.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Functional neural architecture of cognitive control mediates the relationship between individual differences in bilingual experience and behaviour</a></h4>

              
                Bilinguals have often, but not always, been found to outperform monolinguals on domain-general attentional control. Inconsistent findings have been argued to stem, at least partly, from treating bilingualism as a uniform category and from not considering how neural adaptations to bilingual experiences modulate behavioural outcomes. The present study investigated how patterns of language experience, including language switching behaviour, duration and intensity/diversity of bilingual language use, influence the brain processes underlying cognitive control, and how these in turn translate to cognitive control performance. We examined reaction times and spectral dynamics of the electroencephalograms (EEG) of two-hundred-and-thirty-nine participants (about 70% bilinguals) with diverse language experiences during two cognitive control paradigms testing interference suppression (flanker and Simon task). Using structural equation modelling, we found that different bilingual experience factors were related with neurocognitive measures, which in turn were related with behavioural interference effects, for the flanker but not the Simon task. More specifically, increased frequency of language switching and intensity / diversity of bilingual language usage was negatively related to induced top-down control measures (especially midline-frontal theta), which in turn was beneficial for interference control. In contrast, duration of bilingual engagement correlated negatively with evoked bottom-up control measures (especially P3) and was therefore detrimental to interference control. We demonstrate here for the first time how the different factors of bilingual experience lead to different neural adaptations which impact behavioural outcomes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">ASD gene Bcl11a regulates subcellular RNA localization, associative circuitry, and social behavior</a></h4>

              
                Precise, area-specific connectivity of interhemispheric callosal projection neurons (CPN) in the cerebral cortex is critical for sensory, associative, and behavioral functions. CPN circuitry, which connects and integrates the cerebral hemispheres via the corpus callosum, is centrally implicated in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and intellectual disability (ID). Though transcriptional controls regulating CPN subtype and areal development are partially understood, downstream subcellular molecular machinery that implements CPN circuitry is essentially unknown. Here, we identify that the highly penetrant ASD/ID risk gene Bcl11a/Ctip1 is critical developmentally for appropriate and precise areal targeting of superficial layer CPN (CPNSL) projections, and that its deletion strikingly re-routes some CPNSL projections subcortically, causes dramatic disruption to subcellular CPNSL growth cone (GC) molecular machinery, and disrupts social behavior and cognition in mice. CPNSL-specific embryonic deletion of Bcl11a causes loss of correct homotopic targeting in the contralateral cortex, re-routes a substantial proportion of axonal projections through the anterior commissure, and induces strikingly aberrant, but specific and precise, projections to the basolateral amygdala. Importantly, bilateral deletion of Bcl11a from CPNSL results in abnormal social behavior and working memory. Mechanistically, we identify dysregulation of the CPNSL axonal GC-localized transcriptome in Bcl11a nulls, due to either aberrant transcription or trafficking of individual transcripts. These molecular mis-localizations disrupt axon guidance and CPNSL circuitry formation. Together, this work identifies critical functions for Bcl11a in CPNSL axonal connectivity, development of functional associative-social circuitry, and regulation of subtype-specific subcellular molecular machinery in vivo, revealing novel GC-localized transcripts that regulate precise axonal targeting and circuit formation. These results elucidate development and ASD/ID disease-related circuit disruption of CPNSL, and the importance of understanding circuit-specific subcellular molecular machinery by neurons.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Free-water volume fraction increases non-linearly with age in the white matter of the healthy human brain</a></h4>

              
                The term free-water volume fraction (FWVF) refers to the cerebrospinal and interstitial fluids in the extracellular space of the white matter (WM) of the brain, which has been demonstrated as a sensitive biomarker that correlates with the cognitive performance and the neuropathological processes modifying the interstitial extracellular spaces. It can be quantified by properly fitting the isotropic compartment of the magnetic resonance (MR) signal in diffusion-sensitized sequences. Using N = 287 healthy subjects aged 25-94, this study examines in detail the evolution of the FWVF in the human brain WM across the adult lifespan, which has been previously reported to exhibit a positive trend. We found evidence of a noticeably non-linear gain after the sixth decade of life, with a region-specific variate and varying change rate of the FWVF parameter with age, at the same time a heteroskedastic pattern across the adult lifespan is suggested. On the other hand, the FW-compensated MR signal leads to a region-dependent flattened age-related evolution of the mean diffusivity (MD) and fractional anisotropy (FA), along with a considerable reduction in their variability, as compared to standard studies conducted over the raw MR signal. This way, our study provides a new perspective on the trajectory-based assessment of the brain and explains the source of the variations observed in FA and MD parameters across the lifespan with previous studies with the standard diffusion tensor imaging.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Activity of tonically active neurons in the primate striatum reflects interaction between time processing and reward prediction</a></h4>

              
                The striatum and its dopaminergic input participate in temporal processing and numerous studies provide evidence that interactions between dopamine and acetylcholine are critical for striatal functioning. However, the role of local cholinergic innervation of the striatum in behaviors requiring precise timing has not been specifically investigated. Here, we recorded from presumed striatal cholinergic interneurons, identified as tonically active neurons (TANs), in two male rhesus monkeys performing self-initiated movements after specified learned time intervals have elapsed since a visual cue. We found that 38% of all recorded TANs responded to the cue with a pause in firing and the strength of these responses could be modulated according to the duration of the interval being timed and the accuracy of time estimates. By examining the TAN response to the reward itself and by recording from TANs during a Pavlovian procedure in which no action was required, we found evidence that TAN activity modulation may potentially reflect differences in the animal's prediction of reward. Thus, besides their well-known role in predicting and detecting rewarding events, TANs may generate signals related to the processing of time. Our findings suggest a role of the local cholinergic circuitry in the representation of time within the striatum.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Circadian modulation by time-restricted feeding restores brain transcription and slows amyloid deposition in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.</a></h4>

              
                Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a tragic neurodegenerative disease affecting more than 5 million Americans. Circadian disruptions impact nearly all AD patients, with reversal of sleep/wake cycles and agitation in the evening being common disturbances that manifest early in disease. These alterations support a role for circadian dysfunction as a driver of AD, emphasizing a critical need to investigate the therapeutic potential of circadian-modulating interventions. One of the most powerful regulators of the circadian system is the daily feed/fast cycle. Here we show that time-restricted feeding (TRF) without caloric restriction, improved key disease components including behavior, disease pathology and transcription in the APP23 mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. We found that TRF had the remarkable capability of simultaneously reducing amyloid deposition, increasing A{beta}42 clearance, improving sleep and hyperactivity, and normalizing transcription of circadian, AD and neuroinflammation-associated genes in APP23 mice. Thus, our study unveils for the first time that circadian modulation through timed feeding has far-reaching effects beyond metabolism and affects the brain as the substrate for neurodegeneration. Since the pleiotropic effects of TRF can substantially modify disease trajectory, this intervention has immediate translational value, addressing the crucial need for accessible approaches to reduce or halt AD progression.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Scratch-AID: A Deep-learning Based System for Automatic Detection of Mouse Scratching Behavior with High Accuracy</a></h4>

              
                Mice are the most commonly used model animals for itch research and for development of anti-itch drugs. Most labs manually quantify mouse scratching behavior to assess itch intensity. This process is labor-intensive and limits large-scale genetic or drug screenings. In this study, we developed a new system, Scratch-AID (Automatic Itch Detection), which could automatically identify and quantify mouse scratching behavior with high accuracy. Our system included a custom-designed videotaping box to ensure high-quality and replicable mouse behavior recording and a convolutional recurrent neural network (CRNN) trained with frame-labeled mouse scratching behavior videos, induced by nape injection of chloroquine (CQ). The best trained network achieved 97.6% recall and 96.9% precision on previously unseen test videos. Remarkably, Scratch-AID could reliably identify scratching behavior in other major mouse itch models, including the acute cheek model, the histaminergic model, and a chronic itch model. Moreover, our system detected significant differences in scratching behavior between control and mice treated with an anti-itch drug. Taken together, we have established a novel deep learning-based system that is ready to replace manual quantification for mouse scratching behavior in different itch models and for drug screening.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A novel porcine model of CLN3 Batten disease recapitulates clinical phenotypes</a></h4>

              
                Mouse models of CLN3 Batten disease, a rare lysosomal storage disorder with no cure, have improved our understanding of CLN3 biology and therapeutics through their ease of use and a consistent display of cellular pathology. However, the translatability of murine models is limited by disparities in anatomy, body size, life span, and inconsistent, subtle behavior deficits that can be difficult to detect in CLN3 mutant mouse models, limiting their utility in preclinical studies. Here we present a longitudinal characterization of a novel miniswine model of CLN3 disease that recapitulates the most common human pathogenic variant, an exon 7-8 deletion (CLN3{Delta}ex7/8). Progressive pathology and neuron loss is observed in various regions of the CLN3{Delta}ex7/8 miniswine brain and retina. Additionally, mutant miniswine present with vision impairment and motor abnormalities, similar to deficits seen in human patients. Taken together, the CLN3{Delta}ex7/8 miniswine model shows consistent and progressive Batten disease pathology and behavioral impairment mirroring clinical presentation, demonstrating its value in studying the role of CLN3 and safety/efficacy of novel disease modifying therapeutics.

                Single cell transcriptomic studies have identified a conserved set of neocortical cell types from small post-mortem cohorts. We extend these efforts by assessing cell type variation across 75 adult individuals undergoing epilepsy and tumor surgeries. Nearly all nuclei map to one of 125 robust cell types identified in middle temporal gyrus, but with varied abundances and gene expression signatures across donors, particularly in deep layer glutamatergic neurons. A minority of variance is explainable by known factors including donor identity and small contributions from age, sex, ancestry, and disease state. Genomic variation was significantly associated with variable expression of 150-250 genes for most cell types. Thus, human individuals display a highly consistent cellular makeup, but with significant variation reflecting donor characteristics, disease condition, and genetic regulation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Bridging the neural and algorithmic correlates of action-stopping</a></h4>

              
                Rapid stopping of actions is crucial for survival. The algorithm underlying action-stopping is often described using the independent race model, where the race between independent go- and stop-processes determines whether one is able to stop. However, it is unclear whether humans have neural correlates of these processes. Here, using scalp potentials from three studies, we show that the mu (8-13 Hz) desynchronization over the contralateral motor cortex follows the predictions of a go-process: the activity builds up till an action is made. We also show that the low beta (13-20 Hz) activity over the frontal areas follows the predictions of a stop-process: the activity builds up after the stop signal and prior to the stopping latency. Using these neural correlates, we observed that: 1) The failure to stop mostly results from a rapid go-process, 2) The go-process seems to be influenced by the stop-process during the late stages of action-stopping, 3) Intrinsic prefrontal beta activity has a retardive effect on movement, 4) Violations of independence assumption in the failed stop trials may result from the activity of the stop-process. Future studies may use these neural correlates to resolve the mimicry between models of action-stopping.

                Characterizing the relationship between neuron spiking and the signals electrodes record is vital to defining the neural circuits driving brain function and informing computational modeling. However, electrode biocompatibility and precisely localizing neurons around the electrodes are critical to defining this relationship. Here, we show the ability to localize post-explant recording tips of subcellular-scale carbon fiber electrodes and surrounding neurons. Immunostaining of astrocyte, microglia, and neuron markers confirmed improved tissue health. While neurons near implants were stretched, their number and distribution were similar to control, suggesting that these minimally invasive electrodes demonstrate the potential to sample naturalistic neural populations. This motivated prediction of the spikes produced by neurons nearest to the electrodes using a model fit with recorded electrophysiology. These simulations show the first direct evidence that neuron placement in the immediate vicinity of the recording site influences how many spike clusters can be reliably identified by spike sorting.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Feedback-based motor control can guide plasticity and drive rapid learning</a></h4>

              
                Animals use afferent feedback to rapidly correct ongoing movements in the presence of a perturbation. Repeated exposure to a predictable perturbation leads to behavioural adaptation that counteracts its effects. Primary motor cortex (M1) is intimately involved in both processes, integrating inputs from various sensorimotor brain regions to update the motor output. Here, we investigate whether feedback-based motor control and motor adaptation may share a common implementation in M1 circuits. We trained a recurrent neural network to control its own output through an error feedback signal, which allowed it to recover rapidly from external perturbations. Implementing a biologically plausible plasticity rule based on this same feedback signal also enabled the network to learn to counteract persistent perturbations through a trial-by-trial process, in a manner that reproduced several key aspects of human adaptation. Moreover, the resultant network activity changes were also present in neural population recordings from monkey M1. Online movement correction and longer-term motor adaptation may thus share a common implementation in neural circuits.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Circular RNAs may embed pieces of real-world sensory information into an episodic memory</a></h4>

              
                For a generation, neuroscience has searched for a molecule that stores our memories across time. This search has focused on proteomic mechanisms, but less is known about RNA. Here, we identify a new persisting class of RNA associated with long-term memory - Circular RNAs. Unlike other RNAs, Circular RNAs are stable for days or longer and may provide a means for storing sensory information across time. We leveraged a differential fear conditioning paradigm whereby individual mice sample all real-world sensory inputs (i.e., auditory, visual, gustatory, olfactory, and incidental tactile) in a quasi-stochastic manner prior to receiving different intensities of an unconditioned stimulus (US) foot-shock. While Pavlovian models of learning from the 20th century were critical for understanding elemental associations, they fail to appreciate (1) what US content remains inside of a complex conditioned stimulus (CS) or response (CR - a behavioral manifestation of an episodic memory), (2) what happens when the associations involve multiple senses, and (3) what biologically happens to the real-world US. Given (1) we are constantly sampling information from our environment through all our senses and (2) the US at a given moment in time likely adds value to imprint that multisensory representation, we propose the real-world US is biologically encoded via back-spliced Circular RNAs within the cells and circuits that represent a particular episodic memory and present days later. This logic, best simplified by the equation: CS^(NS+US) = NS degrees ^(x1p(a)+x2p(v)+x3p(t)+x4p(o)+x5p(g)/t)+ US^((((i+(n-1))*is) - (i2) -/t)), allowed us to ask how the formation of similar episodic memories, which only differ in relation to the content of US information, alter Circular RNAs in the CA1 subfield of the hippocampus - a brain area critical for episodic memories. We found that stronger foot-shock USs during conditioning produce stronger memories relative to weaker USs 24-h later. Stronger memories also generalize to novel/safe environments 48-h later. Moreover, the unconditioned response is highly correlated with future CRs, suggesting (1) an understudied relationship between the strength and type of US/URs and future CRs in complex environments as well as (2) fear generalization, at least in the short-term, is associated with the embedding of additional US information. Next-generation Circular RNA sequencing 1-hr after acquisition revealed a remarkably small set of circular RNAs relative to nearly identical, yet weaker, episodic memories in CA1. Gene Ontologies for mice that formed weaker and stronger memories matched those families classically involved in weaker and stronger forms of memory across species. Preliminary in situ hybridization visually confirmed the presence of Circular RNAs in the CA1 subfield. Future experiments will examine the persistence of Circular RNAs in cells of a memory trace (i.e., engram cells; in situ hybridization) at recent (4 days) and remote (21-days) time points. Taken together with our mathematical model for multisensory learning, our data suggest that Circular RNAs do not contribute to the storage of the multisensory configural representation, but perhaps to the storage of discrete pieces of real-world sensory information related to the US that is partially embedded inside of a memory trace early-on. Importantly, in the above model for multisensory learning, the discrete USs are biologically separable from the future CS^(NS+US) associations and US strength is modifiable across time. This work reveals fundamental insights into how we store pieces of real-world sensory information in an episodic memory at the biological level of the brain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Escalation of alcohol intake is associated with regionally decreased insular cortex activity but not associated with changes in taste quality</a></h4>

              
                Background: Intermittent access to ethanol (EtOH) drives persistent escalation of intake and rapid transition from moderate to compulsive-like drinking. Intermittent EtOH drinking may facilitate escalation in part by altering aversion-sensitive neural substrates, such as the insular cortex (IC), thus driving greater approach toward stimuli previously treated as aversive. Methods: We conducted a series of experiments in rats to examine behavioral and neural responses associated with escalation of EtOH intake. First, taste reactivity analyses quantified the degree that intermittent brief-access ethanol exposure (BAEE) alters sensitivity to the aversive properties of EtOH. Next, we determined whether pharmacological IC inhibition facilitated EtOH escalation. Finally, given that IC is primary gustatory cortex, we employed psychophysical paradigms to assess whether escalation of EtOH intake induced changes in EtOH taste. These paradigms measured changes in sensitivity to the intensity of EtOH taste and whether escalation shifts the salient taste quality of EtOH by measuring the degree that the taste of EtOH generalized to a sucrose-like (sweet) or quinine-like (bitter) percept. Results: We found a near complete loss of aversive oromotor responses in EtOH-exposed relative to -naive rats. Additionally, we observed significantly reduced expression of EtOH-induced c-Fos expression in the posterior IC in exposed rats relative to naive rats. Inhibition of the IC resulted in a modest, but statistically reliable increase in acceptance of higher EtOH concentrations in naive rats. Finally, we found no evidence of changes in the psychophysical assessment of the taste of EtOH in exposed, relative to naive, rats. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that neural activity within the IC adapts following escalation of EtOH intake in a manner that correlates with reduced sensitivity to the aversive hedonic properties of EtOH. These data further establish that IC may be driving exposure-induced escalations in EtOH intake and directly contributing to development of compulsive-like EtOH drinking.

                One of the main drivers of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are risk alleles within hundreds of genes, which may interact within shared biological processes through as-yet unclear mechanisms. Here we develop a high-throughput genome-editing-mediated approach to target 14 high-confidence ASD genes within the mouse brain for proximity-based proteomics of endogenous interactomes. The resulting interactomes are enriched for human genes dysregulated in the brain of ASD patients and reveal unexpected, but highly significant, interactions with other lower confidence ASD-risk gene products, positing new avenues to prioritize genetic risk. Importantly, the datasets are enriched for shared cellular functions and genetic interactions that may underlie the disorder. We test this notion by spatial proteomics and CRISPR-based regulation of expression in two ASD models, demonstrating new functional interactions that modulate mechanisms of their dysregulation. Together, our results reveal native protein-interaction networks in ASD, providing new inroads for understanding its cellular neurobiology.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Seeing the future: connectome strength and network efficiency in visual network predict individual ability of episodic future thinking</a></h4>

              
                Episodic future thinking (EFT) refers to the critical ability that people construct vivid mental imagery about future events and pre-experience it, which helps with individual and group decision-making. Although EFT is generally believed to have a visual nature by theorists, little neuroscience evidence had been provided to verify this assumption. Here, by employing the approach of connectome-based predictive modeling (CPM) and graph-theoretical analysis, we analyzed resting-state functional brain image from 191 participants to predict their variability of EFT ability (leave-one-out cross-validation), and validated the results by applying different parcellation schemas and feature selection thresholds. At the connectome strength level, CPM-based analysis revealed that EFT ability could be predicted by the connectome strength of visual network. Further at the network level, graph-theoretical analysis showed that EFT ability could be predicted by the network efficiency of visual network. Moreover, these findings were replicated using different parcellation schemas and feature selection thresholds. These results robustly and collectively supported the visual network being the neural substrates underlying EFT ability from a comprehensive perspective of resting-state functional connectivity strength and the neural network. This study provides indications on how the function of visual network supports EFT ability, and helps to understand the EFT ability from a neural basis perspective.

                The cerebellum is recognized to play a critical role in the automatic and implicit process by which movement errors are used to keep the sensorimotor system precisely calibrated. However, its role in other learning processes frequently engaged during sensorimotor adaptation tasks remains unclear. In the present study, we tested the performance of individuals with cerebellar degeneration on a variant of a visuomotor adaptation task in which learning requires the use of strategic re-aiming, a process that can nullify movement errors in a rapid and volitional manner. Our design allowed us to assess two components of this learning process, the discovery of an appropriate strategy and the recall of a learned strategy. Participants were exposed to a 60{degrees} visuomotor rotation twice, with the initial exposure block assessing strategy discovery and the re-exposure block assessing strategy recall. Compared to age-matched controls, individuals with cerebellar degeneration were slower to derive an appropriate aiming strategy in the initial Discovery block but exhibited similar recall of the aiming strategy during the Recall block. This dissociation underscores the multi-faceted contributions of the cerebellum to sensorimotor learning, highlighting one way in which this subcortical structure facilitates volitional action selection.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The Neural Correlates of Continuous Feedback Processing</a></h4>

              
                Feedback processing is commonly studied by analyzing the brain's response to discrete rather than continuous events. Such studies have led to the hypothesis that rapid phasic midbrain dopaminergic activity tracks reward prediction errors (RPEs), the effects of which are measurable at the scalp via electroencephalography (EEG). Although studies using continuous feedback are sparse, recent animal work suggests that moment-to-moment changes in reward are tracked by slowly ramping midbrain dopaminergic activity. Some have argued that these ramping signals index state values rather than RPEs. Our goal here was to develop an EEG measure of continuous feedback processing in humans, then test whether its behaviour could be accounted for by the RPE hypothesis. Participants completed a stimulus-response learning task in which a continuous reward cue gradually increased or decreased over time. A regression-based unmixing approach revealed EEG activity with a topography and timecourse consistent with the stimulus-preceding negativity (SPN), a scalp potential previously linked to reward anticipation and tonic dopamine release. Importantly, this reward-related activity depended on outcome expectancy: as predicted by the RPE hypothesis, activity for expected reward cues was reduced compared to unexpected reward cues. These results demonstrate the possibility of using human scalp-recorded potentials to track continuous feedback processing, and test candidate hypotheses of this activity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Nicotine enhances intravenous self-administration of cannabinoids in adult rats</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: Nicotine and cannabis are commonly used together, yet few studies have investigated the effects of concurrent administration of both drugs. Nicotine exhibits reinforcement enhancing effects by promoting the reinforcing properties of stimuli including other drugs. As many studies of this effect have used non-contingent nicotine, we implemented a dual-self-administration model where rats are given simultaneous access to two drugs and choose which to self-administer throughout a session. Here, we investigated the effect of self-administered or non-contingently delivered nicotine on cannabinoid self-administration. Methods: Adult male rats were allowed to self-administer the synthetic cannabinoid WIN 55,212-2 (WIN) intravenously, with or without subcutaneous nicotine injections before each session. A separate group of animals were allowed to self-administer WIN, nicotine, or saline using a dual-catheter procedure, where each solution was infused independently and associated with a separate operant response. A third group of male and female rats were allowed to self-administer delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) with or without pre-session injections of nicotine. Results: Nicotine injections increased self-administration of WIN and THC. During dual self-administration, nicotine availability increased saline and WIN infusions but nicotine intake was not changed by WIN or saline availability. Rats preferred nicotine over saline, but preferred nicotine and WIN equally when both were available. The effect of nicotine on cannabinoid self-administration was acute and reversible when nicotine was no longer present. Conclusions: These results expand our understanding of the ability of nicotine to enhance reinforcement of other drugs of abuse and suggest that co-use of nicotine and cannabinoids promotes cannabinoid use in excess of what would be taken alone. Implications: This study utilizes a dual intravenous self-administration model to investigate the ability of nicotine to enhance cannabinoid intake. Our results demonstrate that the reinforcement enhancing properties of nicotine on drug use extend to include cannabinoids, but that this effect occurs specifically when nicotine is administered alongside the cannabinoid. Interestingly, cannabinoid use did not promote nicotine intake, suggesting this mechanism of reinforcement is specific to nicotine.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Multiple Postsynaptic Protein Levels Are Maintained in a Delayed Form of Compensatory, Experience-Dependent Plasticity in Adult Superior Colliculus</a></h4>

              
                Refinement of developing visual projections is reported to depend on visual experience in rats, cats, ferrets, and monkeys. Visual deprivation in these species delays visual pathway development, reportedly maintaining a juvenile condition and prolonging the critical period for plasticity. Deprivation has been associated with retention of immature NMDA and GABAA receptors and a juvenile state of chloride transporters. In contrast, receptive fields (RFs) in superior colliculus (SC) and visual cortex (V1) of Syrian hamsters refine normally with spontaneous activity alone, requiring visual experience only to maintain refined RFs in adulthood. Continued visual deprivation into adulthood leads to RF enlargement. This failure to maintain refined RFs and thus preserve high acuity vision in visually deprived adult SC is associated with a loss of GABA and GAD, caused at least in part by a reduction in BDNF-TrkB signaling. In order to explore the postsynaptic mechanism, we examined GABAA receptor expression levels, location, and subunit composition using Western blotting. In addition, we assayed the GABAA receptor anchoring protein gephyrin and expression levels of the chloride transporters KCC2 and NKCC2. To test the alternate hypothesis that RFs enlarge in adulthood as a result of immature postsynaptic NMDA receptors, we examined NR2A/2B ratios and levels of the anchoring protein PSD-95. We found no evidence supporting visual deprivation-related postsynaptic alterations in receptors, chloride transporters, or anchoring proteins in adult hamsters. Thus, we argue that visual deprivation continued past puberty reveals a new form of maladaptive, inhibitory plasticity in which, rather than retaining juvenile features and extending the critical period, continued lack of inhibition in adulthood reopens the critical period, reversing the refinement of receptive fields to the detriment of visual acuity. These results suggest that attempts to increase plasticity in adulthood for purposes of rehabilitation or recovery from injury should consider the possibility of unintended negative consequences.

                In this paper, we revisit the problem of computational modeling of simple and complex cells for an over-parameterized and direct-fit model of visual perception. Unlike conventional wisdom, we highlight the difference in parallel and sequential binding mechanisms between simple and complex cells. A new proposal for abstracting them into space partitioning and composition is developed as the foundation of our new hierarchical construction. Our construction can be interpreted as a product topology-based generalization of the existing k-d tree, making it suitable for brute-force direct-fit in a high-dimensional space. The constructed model has been applied to several classical experiments in neuroscience and psychology. We provide an anti-sparse coding interpretation of the constructed vision model and show how it leads to a dynamic programming (DP)-like approximate nearest-neighbor search based on {ell}{infty}-optimization. We also briefly discuss two possible implementations based on asymmetrical (decoder matters more) auto-encoder and spiking neural networks (SNN), respectively.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Loss of GABA co-transmission from cholinergic neurons impairs behaviors related to hippocampal, striatal, and medial prefrontal cortex functions</a></h4>

              
                Altered signaling or function of acetylcholine (ACh) has been reported in various neurological diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, Tourette syndrome, epilepsy among others. Many neurons that release ACh also co-transmit the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyrate (GABA) at synapses in the hippocampus, striatum, and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Although ACh transmission is crucial for higher brain functions such as learning and memory, the role of co-transmitted GABA from ACh neurons in brain function remains unknown. Thus, the overarching goal of this study was to investigate how a systemic loss of GABA co-transmission from ACh neurons affected the behavioral performance of mice. To do this, we used a conditional knock-out mouse of the vesicular GABA transporter (vGAT) crossed with the ChAT-Cre driver line to selectively ablate GABA co-transmission at ACh synapses. In a comprehensive series of standardized behavioral assays, we compared Cre-negative control mice with Cre-positive vGAT knock-out mice of both sexes. Loss of GABA co-transmission from ACh neurons did not disrupt the animal's sociability, motor skills or sensation. However, in the absence of GABA co-transmission, we found significant alterations in social, spatial and fear memory as well as a reduced reliance on striatum-dependent response strategies in a T-maze. In addition, male CKO mice showed increased locomotion. Taken together, the loss of GABA co-transmission leads to deficits in higher brain functions and behaviors. Therefore, we propose that ACh/GABA co-transmission modulates neural circuitry involved in the affected behaviors.

                Astrocytes are considered an essential source of blood-borne glucose or its metabolites to neurons. Nonetheless, the necessity of the main astrocyte glucose transporter, i.e. GLUT1, for brain glucose metabolism has not been defined. Unexpectedly, we found that brain glucose metabolism was paradoxically augmented in mice with astrocytic GLUT1 ablation (GLUT1GFAP mice). These mice also exhibited improved peripheral glucose metabolism especially in obesity, rendering them metabolically healthier. Importantly, GLUT1GFAP mice did not present cognitive alterations. Mechanistically, we observed that GLUT1-ablated astrocytes exhibited increased insulin receptor-dependent ATP release, and both astrocyte insulin signalling and brain purinergic signalling are essential for improved brain function and systemic glucose metabolism. Collectively, we demonstrate that astrocytic GLUT1 is central to the regulation of brain energetics, yet its ablation triggers a reprogramming of brain metabolism sufficient to sustain energy requirements, peripheral glucose homeostasis and cognitive function.

                A recent study (Takahashi et al., Neuron, 2022) concluded LINE-1 (L1) retrotransposon activation drives cerebellar ataxia and neurodegeneration. This position was based on L1 upregulation in ataxia telangiectasia (AT) patient cerebellum samples, as measured by RNA-seq, and observation of ataxia and neurodegeneration in mice where cerebellar L1 expression was induced via dCas9-CRISPR. Here, a re-analysis of the RNA-seq data, which were obtained by rRNA depletion rather than polyA+ selection, revealed a high fraction (38.4%) of intronic reads. Significantly (p=0.034) more intronic reads were present in the AT data than the matched controls. This finding provides an alternative and robust explanation for a key result reported by Takahashi et al.: intronic L1 sequences are abundant in pre-mRNAs, and more pre-mRNAs were retained in the AT libraries. This apparent batch effect deserves further examination, as claims of L1-mediated pathogenesis could shape future efforts to treat AT by trying to attenuate L1 activity.

                Caffeine is one of the main ergogenic resources used in exercise and sports. Previously, we presented the ergogenic mechanism of caffeine through neuronal A2AR antagonism in the central nervous system [1]. We demonstrate here that the striatum rules the ergogenic effects of caffeine through neuroplasticity changes. Thirty-four Swiss (8-10 weeks, 47 {+/-} 1.5 g) and twenty-four C57BL6 (8-10 weeks, 23.9 {+/-} 0.4 g) adult male mice were challenged in behavior and electrophysiology experiments using caffeine and SH-SY5Y cells for energetic metabolism. Systemic (15 mg/kg, i.p.) or striatal (bilateral, 15 g) caffeine was psychostimulant in the open field (p < 0.05) and increased gripping muscle power (p < 0.05). Caffeine also induced long-term potentiation (LTP) in striatal slices (p < 0.05) and increased mitochondrial mass (p < 0.05) and membrane potential p < 0.05) in SH-SY5Y dopaminergic cells. In summary, our results demonstrate that caffeine stimulation in the striatum produces ergogenic effects accompanied by an LTP, possibly associated with acute increased mitochondrial metabolism observed in dopaminergic cell lines.

                The acoustic context is ubiquitous, highly informative and often predictable. Yet, we know little about where and how contextual sounds are coded in the brain. We have some understanding about the coding of reinforced sounds in the auditory cortex and subcortical midbrain. Contextual sounds, however, are learned in an unsupervised (non-reinforced) manner. Here we measured plasticity in the auditory midbrain, a hub of incoming and feedback auditory input, and found that it reflected learning of contextual information in a manner that depended on the predictability of the sound-context association and not on reinforcement. We found broad frequency-specific shifts in tuning in auditory midbrain neurons. These shifts were paralleled by an increase in response gain and correlated with an increase in neuronal frequency discrimination. The auditory midbrain, thus, codes for predictable and unsupervised sound-context associations. This points to a subcortical engagement in the detection of contextual sounds, a detection that facilitates the processing of relevant information described to occur in cortical auditory structures.

                Intraneuronal chloride concentrations ([Cl-]i) decrease during development resulting in a shift from depolarizing to hyperpolarizing {gamma}-aminobutyric acid (GABA) responses via chloride-permeable GABAA receptors. This GABA shift plays a pivotal role in postnatal brain development, and can be strongly influenced by early life experience. Here, we assessed the applicability of the recently developed fluorescent SuperClomeleon (SClm) sensor to examine changes in [Cl-]i using two-photon microscopy in brain slices. We used SClm mice of both sexes to monitor the developmental decrease in neuronal chloride levels in organotypic hippocampal cultures. We could discern a clear reduction in [Cl-]i between DIV3 and DIV9 (equivalent to the second postnatal week in vivo) and a further decrease in some cells until DIV22. In addition, we assessed alterations in [Cl-]i in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of P9 male SClm mouse pups after early life stress (ELS). ELS was induced by limiting nesting material between P2 and P9. ELS induced a shift towards higher (i.e. immature) chloride levels in layer 2/3 cells in the mPFC. Although conversion from SClm fluorescence to absolute chloride concentrations proved difficult, our study underscores that the SClm sensor is a powerful tool to measure physiological changes in [Cl-]i in brain slices.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A ternary neural code resolves error and sharpening signals</a></h4>

              
                Theories of attention and learning have hypothesized a central role for high-frequency bursting in cognitive functions, but experimental reports of burst-mediated representations in vivo have been limited. Here we used a novel demultiplexing approach to separate independent streams of information from considering neurons as having three possible states: silent, singlet- and burst-firing. We studied this ternary neural code in vivo while animals learned to behaviorally report direct electrical stimulation of the somatosensory cortex and found two acquired yet independent representations. One code, the event rate, represented the stimulus in a small fraction of cells and showed a small modulation upon detection errors. The other code, the burst fraction, correlated more globally with stimulation and more promptly responded to detection errors. Bursting modulation was potent and its time course evolved, even in cells that were considered unresponsive based on the firing rate. During the later stages of training, this modulation in bursting happened earlier, gradually aligning temporally with the representation in event rate. The alignment of bursting and event rate modulation sharpened firing rate coded representations, and was strongly associated behavioral accuracy. Thus a fine grain separation of spike timing patterns reveals two signals that accompany stimulus representations: an error signal that can be essential to guide learning and a sharpening signal that could enact top-down attention.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Nonuniform structural properties of wings confer sensing advantages</a></h4>

              
                Sensory feedback is essential to both animals and robotic systems for achieving coordinated, precise movements. Mechanosensory feedback, which provides information about body deformation and position in space, depends not only on the properties of sensors but also on the structure in which they are embedded. In insects, wing structure plays a particularly important role in flapping flight: in addition to generating aerodynamic forces, wings provide mechanosensory feedback necessary for guiding flight while undergoing dramatic deformations over the course of each wingbeat. However, the role that wing structure plays in determining mechanosensory information is relatively unexplored. Insect wings exhibit characteristic stiffness gradients, with greatest stiffness at the base and leading edge and lowest stiffness at the tip of the trailing edge. Additionally, wings are subject to both aerodynamic and structural damping. The sensory consequences of stiffness gradients and damping are unknown. Here we examine how both the nonuniform stiffness profile of a wing and its damping impacts sensory performance, using finite elements analysis combined with sensor placement optimization approaches. We show that wings with nonuniform stiffness exhibit several advantages over uniform stiffness wings, resulting in higher accuracy of rotation detection and lower sensitivity to the placement of sensors on the wing. Moreover, we show that higher damping generally improves the accuracy with which body rotations can be detected. These results contribute to our understanding of the evolution of the nonuniform stiffness patterns in insect wings, as well as suggest design principles for robotic systems.

                Background Patients with inactive thyroid hormone (TH) transporter MCT8 display intellectual disability due to an insufficient TH transport and action in the CNS. As a therapeutic strategy, application of Triac (3, 5, 3`-triiodothyroacetic acid) and Ditpa (3, 5 -diiodo-thyropropionic acid) have been proposed as both thyromimetic compounds are not dependent on MCT8 for cellular entry. Here, we tested and directly compared the thyromimetic actions of Triac versus Ditpa in Mct8/Oatp1c1 double knockout mice (Dko), a suitable mouse model for human MCT8 deficiency. Methods: Newborn Dko mice were daily injected during the first three postnatal weeks with either Triac (50 ng/g or 400 ng/g) or Ditpa (400 ng/g or 4000 ng/g) and compared with Wt and Dko mice receiving saline injections. A second cohort of Dko mice was daily injected with Triac (400 ng/g) only between postnatal week 3 and 6. Thyromimetic effects in the CNS and peripheral tissues were monitored at different postnatal time points by immunofluorescence stainings for neural marker proteins, in situ hybridization and quantitative real time PCR. Locomotor performance was assessed in rotarod and hanging wire test. Acute brain slices of Triac treated Dko mice and their respective controls were used for electrophysiological recordings. Results: Only Dko mice injected with Triac (400 ng/g) during the first three postnatal weeks showed normalized myelination, differentiation of cortical GABAergic interneurons as well as locomotor performance. Electrophysiological recordings revealed an increased frequencies of cortical spontaneous miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents in Dko mice and a normalization of this parameter in Triac treated Dko mice. In comparison, treatment of Dko mice with Ditpa at 4000 ng/g during the first three postnatal weeks resulted in normal myelination and cerebellar development but was less effective in restoring neuronal parameters and locomotor function. Finally, Triac was more potent than Ditpa in suppressing Trh and Tshb expression, respectively, and exerts stronger thyromimetic effects in liver and kidneys. Conclusions: In newborn Dko deficient mice, Triac is highly effective and more efficient than Ditpa in promoting CNS maturation and function. Yet, Triac treatment needs to be initiated directly after birth to achieve the most beneficial effects.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neural representational geometry correlates with behavioral differences between monkeys</a></h4>

              
                Animals likely use a variety of strategies to solve laboratory tasks. Traditionally, combined analysis of behavioral and neural recording data across subjects employing different strategies may obscure important signals and give confusing results. Hence it is important to develop techniques that can infer strategy at the single-subject level. We analyzed an experiment in which two monkeys perform a visually cued rule-based task. From the analysis of their performance there is no indication that they used a different strategy. However, when we examined the geometry of stimulus representations in the state space of the neural activities recorded in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, we found striking differences. Our purely neural results predict behavioral differences that we observed by analyzing the reaction times. These analyses provide strong support that the animals employed different strategies. Finally, we used a modeling study to correlate these strategies with the amount of training that the animals received.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Investigating the attentional focus to workplace-related soundscapes in a complex audio-visual-motor task using EEG</a></h4>

              
                In demanding work situations (e.g., during a surgery) the processing of complex soundscapes varies over time and can be a burden for medical personnel. Here we study, using mobile electroencephalography (EEG), how humans process workplace-related soundscapes while performing a complex audio-visual-motor task (3D Tetris). Specifically, we wanted to know how the attentional focus changes the processing of the soundscape as a whole. Participants played a game of 3D Tetris in which they had to use both hands to control falling blocks. At the same time, participants listened to a complex soundscape, similar to what is found in an operating room (i.e., sound of machinery, people talking in the background, alarm sounds, and instructions). In this within-subject design, participants had to react to instructions (e.g., 'place the next Block in the upper left corner') and to sounds depending on the experimental condition, either to a specific alarm sound originating from a fixed location or to a beep sound that originated from varying locations. Attention to the alarm reflected a narrow attentional focus, as it was easy to detect and most of the soundscape could be ignored. Attention to the beep reflected a wide attentional focus, as it required the participants to monitor multiple different sound streams. Results show the robustness of the N1 and P3 event related potential response during this dynamic task with a complex auditory soundscape. Furthermore, we used temporal response functions to study auditory processing to the whole soundscape. This work is a step towards studying workplace-related sound processing in the operating room using mobile EEG.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Disk-Drive-Like Operations in the Hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                The rapid computation of re-playable memories within the hippocampus in the form of spike sequences is a near computer-like operation. Information can be encoded once during the initial experience, and replayed numerous times after in a compressed-time representation. Theta oscillations, sharp-wave ripples, and attractor dynamics have been posited to collectively play a role in the formation and replay of memories. However, the precise interplay between these dynamical states remains elusive. Here, we show that the memory formation dynamics and operations of the hippocampus are not just computer-like, but map directly onto the dynamics and operations of a disk-drive. We constructed a tripartite spiking neural network model where the hippocampus is explicitly described as a disk drive with a rotating disk, an actuator arm, and a read/write head. In this Neural Disk Drive (NDD) model, hippocampal oscillations map to disk rotations in the rotating disk network while attractor dynamics in the actuator arm network point to "tracks" (spike assemblies) on the disk. The read/write head then writes information onto these tracks, which have temporally-structured spikes. Tracks can be replayed during hippocampal ripples for consolidation. We confirmed the existence of interneuron-ring-sequences, predicted by the rotating disk network, in experimental data. Our results establish the hippocampus as a brain region displaying explicit, computer-like operations. Based on the known interactions between the hippocampus and other brain areas, we anticipate that our results may lead to additional models that revisit the hypothesis that the brain performs explicit, computer-like operations.

	<p>Layer-specific cortical microcircuits have been explored through invasive animal studies, yet it is not possible to reliably characterize them functionally and noninvasively in the human brain. However, recent advances in ultra-high-field functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) have made it feasible to reasonably resolve layer-specific fMRI signals with sub-millimeter resolution. Here, we propose an experimental and analytical framework that enables the noninvasive functional characterization of layer-specific cortical microcircuits. Specifically, we illustrate this framework by characterizing layer-specific functional pathways in the corticogeniculate network of the human visual system by obtaining sub-millimeter fMRI at 7T using a task which engages the magnocellular pathway between the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and the primary visual cortex. Our results demonstrate that: (i) center-surround inhibition in magnocellular neurons within LGN is detectable using localized fMRI responses; (ii) feedforward (LGN&amp;amp;rarr; layers VI/IV, layer IV&amp;amp;rarr; layer VI) and feedback (layer VI&amp;amp;rarr;LGN) functional pathways, known to exist from invasive animal studies, can be inferred using dynamic directional connectivity models of fMRI and could potentially explain the mechanism underlying center-surround inhibition as well as gain control by layer VI in the human visual system. Our framework is domain-neutral and could potentially be employed to investigate the layer-specific cortical microcircuits in other systems related to cognition, memory and language.</p>

	<p>The objective of this study was to understand the associations of sleep and cardiorespiratory fitness with hippocampal volume and global cognition among older adults (n = 30, age = 65.8 years, female = 73.3%). Wrist actigraphy provided objective measures of nighttime sleep including sleep duration, average wake bout length (WBL; sleep disturbance), and wake-to-sleep transition probability (WTSP; sleep consolidation). Cardiorespiratory fitness was quantified via cycle exercise using a modified heart rate recovery approach. Magnetic resonance imaging was used to determine hippocampal volume and the Mini-Mental State Examination was used to assess global cognition. Fitness moderated associations of sleep with hippocampal volume and cognitive performance, whereby the association of WBL&amp;amp;mdash;an index of poor sleep&amp;amp;mdash;with hippocampal atrophy was stronger among less-fit individuals, and the association of sleep duration with cognitive performance was stronger among more-fit individuals. Across the fitness levels, a longer WBL was associated with lower cognitive performance, and a higher WTSP&amp;amp;mdash;an index of more consolidated sleep&amp;amp;mdash;was associated with greater hippocampal volume. Sleep and fitness were unrelated to the volume of an amygdala control region, suggesting a degree of neuroanatomical specificity. In conclusion, higher cardiorespiratory fitness may attenuate sleep disturbance-related hippocampal atrophy and magnify the cognitive benefits of good sleep. Prospective studies are needed to confirm these findings.</p>

     alt="Subclass-specific expression patterns of MET receptor tyrosine kinase during development in medial prefrontal and visual cortices"/>
<p>Percentage of MET-expressing neurons in medial prefrontal and primary visual (V1) cortices varies between layer and age in mice. The predominant subclass of MET<sup>+</sup> projection neurons in mPFC is subcortical, including corticothalamic, whereas it is intratelencephalic in V1, demonstrating stark heterogeneity between cortical regions. 

</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p><i>Met</i> encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase (MET) that is expressed during development and regulates cortical synapse maturation. Conditional deletion of <i>Met</i> in the nervous system during embryonic development leads to deficits in adult contextual fear learning, a medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC)-dependent cognitive task. MET also regulates the timing of critical period plasticity for ocular dominance in primary visual cortex (V1). However, the underlying circuitry responsible remains unknown. Therefore, this study determines the broad expression patterns of MET throughout postnatal development in mPFC and V1 projection neurons (PNs), providing insight into similarities and differences in the neuronal subtypes and temporal patterns of MET expression between cortical areas. Using a transgenic mouse line that expresses green fluorescent protein (GFP) in <i>Met<sup>+</sup>
</i> neurons, immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy were performed to visualize MET-GFP<sup>+</sup> cell bodies and PN subclass-specific protein markers. Analyses reveal that the MET expression is highly enriched in infragranular layers of mPFC, but in supragranular layers of V1. Interestingly, temporal regulation of the percentage of MET<sup>+</sup> neurons across development not only differs between cortical regions but also is distinct between lamina within a cortical region. Further, MET is expressed predominantly in the subcerebral PN subclass in mPFC, but the intratelencephalic PN subclass in V1. The data suggest that MET signaling influences the development of distinct circuits in mPFC and V1 that underlie subcerebral and intracortical functional deficits following <i>Met</i> deletion, respectively.</p>

                <p>Severe brain metabolic dysfunction and amyloid-&beta; accumulation are key hallmarks of Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease (AD). While astrocytes contribute to both pathologic mechanisms, the role of their mitochondria, which is essential for signaling and maintenance of these processes, has been largely understudied. The current work provides the first direct evidence that the mitochondrial metabolic switch 17&beta;-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 10 (17&beta;HSD10) is expressed and active in murine astrocytes from different brain regions. While it is known that this protein is overexpressed in the brains of AD patients, we found that 17&beta;HSD10 is also upregulated in astrocytes exposed to amyloidogenic and ischemic stress. Importantly, such catalytic overexpression of 17&beta;HSD10 inhibits mitochondrial respiration during increased energy demand. This observation contrasts with what has been found in neuronal and cancer model systems, which suggests astrocyte-specific mechanisms mediated by the protein. Furthermore, the catalytic upregulation of the enzyme exacerbates astrocytic damage, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and mitochondrial network alterations during amyloidogenic stress. On the other hand, 17&beta;HSD10 inhibition through AG18051 counters most of these effects. In conclusion, our data represents novel insights into the role of astrocytic mitochondria in metabolic and amyloidogenic stress with implications of 17&beta;HSD10 in multiple neurodegenerative mechanisms.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Learning and memory requires coordinated activity between different regions of the brain. Here, we studied the interaction between infralimbic medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and hippocampal dorsal CA1 during associative odorant discrimination learning in the mouse. We found that as the animal learns to discriminate odorants in a go-no go task, the coupling of high-frequency neural oscillations to the phase of  oscillations (-referenced phase-amplitude coupling or tPAC) changes in a manner that results in divergence between rewarded and unrewarded odorant-elicited changes in the  phase-referenced power (tPRP) for &beta; and  oscillations. In addition, in the proficient animal there was a decrease in the coordinated oscillatory activity between CA1 and mPFC in the presence of the unrewarded odorant. Furthermore, the changes in tPAC resulted in a marked increase in the accuracy for decoding contextual odorant identity from tPRP when the animal became proficient. Finally, we studied the role of Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II&alpha; (CaMKII&alpha;), a protein involved in learning and memory, in oscillatory neural processing in this task. We find that the accuracy for decoding the contextual odorant identity from tPRP decreases in CaMKII&alpha; knock-out mice and that this accuracy correlates with behavioral performance. These results implicate a role for tPAC and CaMKII&alpha; in olfactory go-no go associative learning in the hippocampal-prefrontal circuit.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Natural Contrast Statistics Facilitate Human Face Categorization</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>The ability to detect faces in the environment is of utmost ecological importance for human social adaptation. While face categorization is efficient, fast and robust to sensory degradation, it is massively impaired when the facial stimulus does not match the natural contrast statistics of this visual category, i.e., the typically experienced ordered alternation of relatively darker and lighter regions of the face. To clarify this phenomenon, we characterized the contribution of natural contrast statistics to face categorization. Specifically, 31 human adults viewed various natural images of nonface categories at a rate of 12 Hz, with highly variable images of faces occurring every eight stimuli (1.5 Hz). As in previous studies, neural responses at 1.5 Hz as measured with high-density electroencephalography (EEG) provided an objective neural index of face categorization. Here, when face images were shown in their naturally experienced contrast statistics, the 1.5-Hz face categorization response emerged over occipito-temporal electrodes at very low contrast [5.1%, or 0.009 root-mean-square (RMS) contrast], quickly reaching optimal amplitude at 22.6% of contrast (i.e., RMS contrast of 0.041). Despite contrast negation preserving an image&rsquo;s spectral and geometrical properties, negative contrast images required twice as much contrast to trigger a face categorization response, and three times as much to reach optimum. These observations characterize how the internally stored natural contrast statistics of the face category facilitate visual processing for the sake of fast and efficient face categorization.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Risk factors for the incomplete immunization of children of health workers at a tertiary referral hospital in Surabaya, Indonesia [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Health workers as role models play a key role in increasing immunization coverage. The coverage of complete basic immunization in the city of Surabaya is 98.1%, a figure not similar to the incidences of infectious diseases that can be prevented by immunization. This study aims to determine the risk factors for incomplete immunization of the children of health workers. Methods: A case-control questionnaire study comparing incompletely immunized children (case group) and completely immunized children (control group) was done. Participants were children of health workers at a tertiary referral hospital in Surabaya. We conducted interviews and distributed and collected questionnaires from December 2021 to April 2022. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were conducted using the Pearson chi-square test and binary logistic regression. Results: Overall, 148 questionnaires were distributed, 33 of which were excluded due to incomplete data. Therefore, 115 health workers’ children were eligible participants. 62 participants (53.9%) made up the case group, while the control group consisted of 53 participants (46.1%). The average age of the children was 12.5 months, 51.3% were boys and 48.7% were girls. The parental age, parental knowledge, mother's education, and the presence of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has a significant association with the children’s immunization status with p-values of 0.043, 0.005, 0.002, and p < 0.001, respectively. The children of health workers with a low level of knowledge are 4.8 times more likely to be incompletely immunized (OR 4.887, 95% CI 1.346–35.152). In addition, the possibility of the incomplete immunization of a child is eight times higher for a low-income family (OR 8.679; 95% CI 1.429–52.701). Conclusions: Low levels of parental knowledge and income are associated with the occurrence of incomplete immunization among the children of health workers at a tertiary referral hospital in Surabaya.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Role of virtual modality for stroke caregivers in facilitating stroke survivors and assessing their perceptions in the midst of COVID-19 pandemic [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Stroke survivors become either partially or completely dependent on their family members for assistance. Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic has created a new set of challenges for caregiving, due to government-imposed lockdowns. In the current crisis, the crucial role of virtual modality in stroke caregiving can no longer be ignored. Therefore, this review aims to report the utilization of virtual modality to facilitate stroke caregivers in delivering care to stroke survivors in this pandemic. Moreover, it will also assess the perceptions of stroke caregivers in managing stroke survivors during pandemic Methods: An electronic search was carried out between 1 December 2019 to 31 March 2022 to explore the role of virtual platforms to assess stroke caregivers’ perceptions and the use of a distant medium in managing stroke survivors’ care in the COVID-19 era by using four electronic data bases that includes PubMed, CINAHL Plus, Science Direct, and Cochrane. Results The COVID-19 pandemic has undoubtedly complicated the stroke caregiver’s life and their ability to deliver care. Therefore, utilizing virtual medium serves as a unique supplemental resource in warranting patient care continuity. The current review provides evidence for the integration of distant modality in facilitating stroke caregivers to manage stroke survivors and it also assesses their perception during pandemic. Conclusion: The current review provides limited but encouraging data that promotes the efficacy of virtual models in healthcare. It was identified that distant healthcare services are suitable and accessible for the provision of care to the community of stroke caregivers during this pandemic.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Identifying the genes impacted by cell proliferation in proteomics and transcriptomics studies</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Marie Locard-Paulet, Oana Palasca, Lars Juhl Jensen</p>

Hypothesis-free high-throughput profiling allows relative quantification of thousands of proteins or transcripts across samples and thereby identification of differentially expressed genes. It is used in many biological contexts to characterize differences between cell lines and tissues, identify drug mode of action or drivers of drug resistance, among others. Changes in gene expression can also be due to confounding factors that were not accounted for in the experimental plan, such as change in cell proliferation. We combined the analysis of 1,076 and 1,040 cell lines in five proteomics and three transcriptomics data sets to identify 157 genes that correlate with cell proliferation rates. These include actors in DNA replication and mitosis, and genes periodically expressed during the cell cycle. This signature of cell proliferation is a valuable resource when analyzing high-throughput data showing changes in proliferation across conditions. We show how to use this resource to help in interpretation of <i>in vitro</i> drug screens and tumor samples. It informs on differences of cell proliferation rates between conditions where such information is not directly available. The signature genes also highlight which hits in a screen may be due to proliferation changes; this can either contribute to biological interpretation or help focus on experiment-specific regulation events otherwise buried in the statistical analysis.

                <p>by Gerardo Chowell, Sushma Dahal, Amna Tariq, Kimberlyn Roosa, James M. Hyman, Ruiyan Luo</p>

We analyze an ensemble of <i>n</i>-sub-epidemic modeling for forecasting the trajectory of epidemics and pandemics. These ensemble modeling approaches, and models that integrate sub-epidemics to capture complex temporal dynamics, have demonstrated powerful forecasting capability. This modeling framework can characterize complex epidemic patterns, including plateaus, epidemic resurgences, and epidemic waves characterized by multiple peaks of different sizes. We systematically assess their calibration and short-term forecasting performance in short-term forecasts for the COVID-19 pandemic in the USA from late April 2020 to late February 2022. We compare their performance with two commonly used statistical ARIMA models. The best fit sub-epidemic model and three ensemble models constructed using the top-ranking sub-epidemic models consistently outperformed the ARIMA models in terms of the weighted interval score (WIS) and the coverage of the 95% prediction interval across the 10-, 20-, and 30-day short-term forecasts. In our 30-day forecasts, the average WIS ranged from 377.6 to 421.3 for the sub-epidemic models, whereas it ranged from 439.29 to 767.05 for the ARIMA models. Across 98 short-term forecasts, the ensemble model incorporating the top four ranking sub-epidemic models (Ensemble(4)) outperformed the (log) ARIMA model 66.3% of the time, and the ARIMA model, 69.4% of the time in 30-day ahead forecasts in terms of the WIS. Ensemble(4) consistently yielded the best performance in terms of the metrics that account for the uncertainty of the predictions. This framework can be readily applied to investigate the spread of epidemics and pandemics beyond COVID-19, as well as other dynamic growth processes found in nature and society that would benefit from short-term predictions.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Measuring impact of vaccination among wildlife: The case of bait vaccine campaigns for classical swine fever epidemic among wild boar in Japan</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Ryota Matsuyama, Takehisa Yamamoto, Yoko Hayama, Ryosuke Omori</p>

Understanding the impact of vaccination in a host population is essential to control infectious diseases. However, the impact of bait vaccination against wildlife diseases is difficult to evaluate. The vaccination history of host animals is generally not observable in wildlife, and it is difficult to distinguish immunity by vaccination from that caused by disease infection. For these reasons, the impact of bait vaccination against classical swine fever (CSF) in wild boar inhabiting Japan has not been evaluated accurately. In this study, we aimed to estimate the impact of the bait vaccination campaign by modelling the dynamics of CSF and the vaccination process among a Japanese wild boar population. The model was designed to estimate the impact of bait vaccination despite lack of data regarding the demography and movement of wild boar. Using our model, we solved the theoretical relationship between the impact of vaccination, the time-series change in the proportion of infected wild boar, and that of immunised wild boar. Using this derived relationship, the increase in antibody prevalence against CSF because of vaccine campaigns in 2019 was estimated to be 12.1 percentage points (95% confidence interval: 7.8–16.5). Referring to previous reports on the basic reproduction number (<i>R</i><sub>0</sub>) of CSF in wild boar living outside Japan, the amount of vaccine distribution required for CSF elimination by reducing the effective reproduction number under unity was also estimated. An approximate 1.6 (when <i>R</i><sub>0</sub> = 1.5, target vaccination coverage is 33.3% of total population) to 2.9 (when <i>R</i><sub>0</sub> = 2.5, target vaccination coverage is 60.0% of total population) times larger amount of vaccine distribution would be required than the total amount of vaccine distribution in four vaccination campaigns in 2019.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Linear discriminant analysis reveals hidden patterns in NMR chemical shifts of intrinsically disordered proteins</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Javier A. Romero, Paulina Putko, Mateusz Urbańczyk, Krzysztof Kazimierczuk, Anna Zawadzka-Kazimierczuk</p>

NMR spectroscopy is key in the study of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). Yet, even the first step in such an analysis—the assignment of observed resonances to particular nuclei—is often problematic due to low peak dispersion in the spectra of IDPs. We show that the assignment process can be aided by finding “hidden” chemical shift patterns specific to the amino acid residue types. We find such patterns in the training data from the Biological Magnetic Resonance Bank using linear discriminant analysis, and then use them to classify spin systems in an <i>α</i>-synuclein sample prepared by us. We describe two situations in which the procedure can greatly facilitate the analysis of NMR spectra. The first involves the mapping of spin systems chains onto the protein sequence, which is part of the assignment procedure—a prerequisite for any NMR-based protein analysis. In the second, the method supports assignment transfer between similar samples. We conducted experiments to demonstrate these cases, and both times the majority of spin systems could be unambiguously assigned to the correct residue types.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">A caspase–RhoGEF axis contributes to the cell size threshold for apoptotic death in developing Caenorhabditis elegans</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Aditya Sethi, Hai Wei, Nikhil Mishra, Ioannis Segos, Eric J. Lambie, Esther Zanin, Barbara Conradt</p>

A cell’s size affects the likelihood that it will die. But how is cell size controlled in this context and how does cell size impact commitment to the cell death fate? We present evidence that the caspase CED-3 interacts with the RhoGEF ECT-2 in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> neuroblasts that generate “unwanted” cells. We propose that this interaction promotes polar actomyosin contractility, which leads to unequal neuroblast division and the generation of a daughter cell that is below the critical “lethal” size threshold. Furthermore, we find that hyperactivation of ECT-2 RhoGEF reduces the sizes of unwanted cells. Importantly, this suppresses the “cell death abnormal” phenotype caused by the partial loss of <i>ced-3</i> caspase and therefore increases the likelihood that unwanted cells die. A putative null mutation of <i>ced-3</i> caspase, however, is not suppressed, which indicates that cell size affects CED-3 caspase activation and/or activity. Therefore, we have uncovered novel sequential and reciprocal interactions between the apoptosis pathway and cell size that impact a cell’s commitment to the cell death fate.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Infratentorial superficial siderosis and spontaneous intracranial hypotension</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Spontaneous spinal CSF leaks cause intracranial hypotension (SIH) and also may cause infratentorial superficial siderosis (iSS) but the rate of development among different CSF leak types and outcome of treatment are not known. We determined the time interval from SIH onset to iSS and the outcome of treatment.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>1589 patients with SIH underwent neuroimaging and iSS was detected in 57 (23 men and 34 women, mean age 41.3) (3.6%). We examined the type of underlying CSF leak by various imaging modalities. Percutaneous and surgical procedures were used to treat the CSF leak.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>iSS was detected in 46 (10.3%) of 447 patients with ventral CSF leaks, in 2 (3.9%) of 51 patients with dural ectasia, in 5 (2.6%) of 194 patients with CSF-venous fistulas, in 4 (0.9%) of 457 patients with simple meningeal diverticula, and in none of the 101 patients with lateral CSF leaks or the 339 patients with leaks of indeterminate origin (p&lt;0.001). The estimated median latency period from SIH onset to iSS was 126 months. Ventral CSF leaks could not be eliminated with percutaneous procedures in any patient and surgical repair was associated with low risk (&lt;5%) and resulted in resolution of the CSF leak in all patients in whom the exact site of the CSF leak could be determined. Other types of CSF leak were treated with percutaneous or surgical procedures.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>iSS can develop in most types of spinal CSF leak, including CSF-venous fistulas, but mainly in chronic ventral CSF leaks, which require surgical repair.</p>

                <p>The first case of paralytic poliomyelitis in nearly a decade in the US was discovered in a 20-year-old unvaccinated man from Rockland County, New York, in July 2022, who developed acute flaccid myelitis. The isolated virus from stool sampling was found to be a circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2, derived from the oral polio vaccine. Since the discovery of this case, local wastewater surveillance has revealed evidence of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 in local counties, as well as in New York City, representing community transmission. In the wake of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, routine vaccination administration has declined globally, with increasing numbers of communities not vaccinated for poliovirus. Now, with evidence of local community transmission, the clinical implication for at-risk unvaccinated individuals is significant. Here, we review the epidemiological origin of this discovered strain of poliovirus, national and international methods of surveillance for poliovirus, and neurological features of poliovirus. We also highlight the opportunities and challenges involved in monitoring suspected cases, as well as the unique role neurologists might play in national and global poliomyelitis surveillance.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Characteristics and Neural Correlates of Emotional Behavior during Prefrontal Seizures</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>This study was undertaken to characterize clinical expression and intracerebral electroencephalographic (EEG) correlates of emotional expression during prefrontal epileptic seizures.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We performed a descriptive analysis of seizure semiology in patients explored with stereo-EEG (SEEG) for pharmacoresistant prefrontal epilepsy, using a semiquantitative score for seizure-related emotional behavior. Two independent observers scored occurrence and intensity of objective emotional features (face/body movements/vocalization/overall appearance), testing interobserver reliability. Intracerebral electrophysiological changes were documented. Cluster analysis and principal component analysis (PCA) compared behavioral signs with neural SEEG correlates. For each patient, the clinical and anatomoelectrophysiological scores were established, based on a prototypical emotional seizure.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Forty-two patients (469 seizures) were included. Interobserver correlation for emotional signs was satisfactory (kappa = 0.6–0.8). Prevalence of any subjective and/or objective ictal emotional phenomena was 79% (33/42); objective emotional signs occurred in 27 of 42 subjects (64%). Negatively valenced emotional semiology (ictal feeling of fear, defensive and/or aggressive behaviors) was much more prevalent than positively valenced, prosocial behaviors. Cluster analysis and PCA identified 4 groups with different occurrence of emotional signs and cerebral correlates. Two main clusters of negatively valenced behavior were identified: “active threat response,” associated with seizure organizations involving posterior orbitofrontal cortex, anterior cingulate, and dorsolateral and/or ventrolateral prefrontal cortex; and “passive fear,” associated with amygdala, other mesial temporal structures, and posterior orbitofrontal cortex.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Emotional behaviors, especially fear/threat response, are common in prefrontal seizures, reflecting the role of the prefrontal cortex in emotional control. Different cortical seizure localizations were associated with “passive fear” and “active threat response” seizure behaviors at the group level. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

<p>In AUD and KS patients, relationships were found between BEARNI performance and GM volume in FCC, PC, thalamus, and calcarine regions. Comparisons between these GM volumes show similar atrophy in the two patient groups or a graded effect between AUD and KS.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Chronic and excessive alcohol consumption can result in alcohol use disorder (AUD) without neurological complications and in Korsakoff's syndrome (KS) when combined with thiamine deficiency. These two clinical forms are accompanied by widespread structural brain damage in both the fronto-cerebellar (FCC) and Papez circuits (PC) as well as in the parietal cortex, resulting in cognitive and motor deficits. BEARNI is a screening tool especially designed to detect neuropsychological impairments in AUD. However, the sensitivity of this tool to the structural brain damage of AUD and KS patients remains unknown. Eighteen KS patients, 47 AUD patients and 27 healthy controls (HC) underwent the BEARNI test and a 3 T-MRI examination. Multiple regression analyses conducted between GM density and performance on each BEARNI subtest revealed correlations with regions included in the FCC, PC, thalamus and posterior cortex (precuneus and calcarine regions). All these brain regions were altered in KS compared to HC, in agreement with the cognitive deficits observed in the corresponding BEARNI subtests. The comparison between KS and AUD regarding the GM density in the several nodes of the FCC and calcarine regions revealed that they were atrophied to the same extent, suggesting that BEARNI is sensitive to the severity of alcohol-related GM abnormalities. Within the PC, the density of the cingulate cortex and thalamus, which correlated with the memory and fluency subscores, was smaller in KS than in AUD, suggesting that BEARNI is sensitive to specific brain abnormalities occurring in KS.</p>

<p>In vitro tissue engineering provides a novel approach to investigate the cellular and molecular effects of traumatic brain injury. Here, we describe a bioengineered 3D brain-like human tissue culture system to study primary blast-induced traumatic brain injury.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Primary blast injury is caused by the direct impact of an overpressurization wave on the body. Due to limitations of current models, we have developed a novel approach to study primary blast-induced traumatic brain injury. Specifically, we employ a bioengineered 3D brain-like human tissue culture system composed of collagen-infused silk protein donut-like hydrogels embedded with human IPSC-derived neurons, human astrocytes, and a human microglial cell line. We have utilized this system within an advanced blast simulator (ABS) to expose the 3D brain cultures to a blast wave that can be precisely controlled. These 3D cultures are enclosed in a 3D-printed surrogate skull-like material containing media which are then placed in a holder apparatus inside the ABS. This allows for exposure to the blast wave alone without any secondary injury occurring. We show that blast induces an increase in lactate dehydrogenase activity and glutamate release from the cultures, indicating cellular injury. Additionally, we observe a significant increase in axonal varicosities after blast. These varicosities can be stained with antibodies recognizing amyloid precursor protein. The presence of amyloid precursor protein deposits may indicate a blast-induced axonal transport deficit. After blast injury, we find a transient release of the known TBI biomarkers, UCHL1 and NF-H at 6 h and a delayed increase in S100B at 24 and 48 h. This in vitro model will enable us to gain a better understanding of clinically relevant pathological changes that occur following primary blast and can also be utilized for discovery and characterization of biomarkers.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/neuron/inpress.rss">The Neurobiology of Long COVID</a></h4>

              
                Persistent neurological symptoms affect a substantial fraction of people after COVID-19 and represent a major component of long COVID. Here, Monje and Iwasaki review what is understood about the neurobiological underpinnings of long COVID cognitive symptoms.

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/neuron/inpress.rss">Prefrontal-habenular microstructural impairments in human cocaine and heroin addiction</a></h4>

              
                The habenula receives direct input from the prefrontal cortex, driving drug-seeking behaviors in preclinical models of addiction. Using diffusion MRI, King et al. identified microstructural abnormalities in the structural connections of the prefrontal cortex and habenula in humans with cocaine or heroin addiction, extending the translational importance of this circuit.
