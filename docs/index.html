              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16597">Bridging Foundation Models and Efficient Architectures: A Modular Brain Imaging Framework with Local Masking and Pretrained Representation Learning</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2508.16597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Functional connectivity (FC) derived from resting-state fMRI plays a critical role in personalized predictions such as age and cognitive performance. However, applying foundation models(FM) to fMRI data remains challenging due to its high dimensionality, computational complexity, and the difficulty in capturing complex spatiotemporal dynamics and indirect region-of-interest (ROI) interactions. To address these limitations, we propose a modular neuroimaging framework that integrates principles from FM with efficient, domain-specific architectures. Our approach begins with a Local Masked Autoencoder (LMAE) for pretraining, which reduces the influence of hemodynamic response function (HRF) dynamics and suppresses noise. This is followed by a Random Walk Mixture of Experts (RWMOE) module that clusters features across spatial and temporal dimensions, effectively capturing intricate brain interactions. Finally, a state-space model (SSM)-based predictor performs downstream task inference. Evaluated on the Cambridge Centre for Ageing and Neuroscience (Cam-CAN) dataset, our framework achieved mean absolute errors (MAEs) of 5.343 for age prediction and 2.940 for fluid intelligence, with Pearson correlation coefficients (PCCs) of 0.928 and 0.887, respectively-outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods. Visualization of expert distribution weights further enhances interpretability by identifying key brain regions. This work provides a robust, interpretable alternative to LLM-based approaches for fMRI analysis, offering novel insights into brain aging and cognitive function.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16667">BrainPath: Generating Subject-Specific Brain Aging Trajectories</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2508.16667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantifying and forecasting individual brain aging trajectories is critical for understanding neurodegenerative disease and the heterogeneity of aging, yet current approaches remain limited. Most models predict chronological age, an imperfect surrogate for biological aging, or generate synthetic MRIs that enhance data diversity but fail to capture subject-specific trajectories. Here, we present BrainPath, a 3D generative framework that learns longitudinal brain aging dynamics during training and, at inference, predicts anatomically faithful MRIs at arbitrary timepoints from a single baseline scan. BrainPath integrates an age calibration loss, a swap learning strategy, and an age perceptual loss to preserve subtle, biologically meaningful variations. Across held-out ADNI and an independent NACC dataset, BrainPath outperforms state-of-the-art reference models in structural similarity (SSIM), mean squared error (MSE), peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), and MRI age-difference accuracy, while capturing realistic and temporally consistent aging patterns. Beyond methodological innovation, BrainPath enables personalized mapping of brain aging, synthetic follow-up scan prediction, and trajectory-based analyses, providing a foundation for precision modeling of brain aging and supporting research into neurodegeneration and aging interventions.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16760">Rethinking scale in network neuroscience: Contributions and opportunities at the nanoscale</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2508.16760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Network science has been applied widely to study brain network organization, especially at the meso-scale, where nodes represent brain areas and edges reflect interareal connectivity inferred from imaging or tract-tracing data. While this approach has yielded important insights into large-scale brain network architecture, its foundational assumptions often misalign with the biological realities of neural systems. In this review, we argue that network science finds its most direct and mechanistically grounded application in nanoscale connectomics-wiring diagrams reconstructed at the level of individual neurons and synapses, often from high-resolution electron microscopy volumes. At this finer scale, core network concepts such as paths, motifs, communities, and centrality acquire concrete biological interpretations. Unlike meso-scale models, nanoscale connectomes are typically derived from individual animals, preserve synaptic resolution, and are richly annotated with cell types, neurotransmitter identities, and morphological detail. These properties enable biologically grounded, mechanistically interpretable analyses of circuit structure and function. We review how nanoscale data support new forms of network modeling, from realistic dynamical simulations to topology-informed circuit inference, and outline emerging directions in multimodal integration, cross-species comparisons, and generative modeling. We also emphasize the continued importance of meso- and macro-scale connectomics, especially in human neuroscience, and discuss how nanoscale insights can inform interpretation at coarser scales. Together, these efforts point toward a multi-scale future for network neuroscience, grounded in the strengths of each resolution.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16877">A coalgebraic perspective on predictive processing</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2508.16877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predictive processing and active inference posit that the brain is a system performing Bayesian inference on the environment. By virtue of this, a prominent interpretation of predictive processing states that the generative model (a POMDP) encoded by the brain synchronises with the generative process (another POMDP) representing the environment while trying to explain what hidden properties of the world generated its sensory input. In this view, the brain is thought to become a copy of the environment. This claim has however been disputed, stressing the fact that a structural copy, or isomorphism as it is at times invoked to be, is not an accurate description of this process since the environment is necessarily more complex than the brain, and what matters is not the capacity to exactly recapitulate the veridical causal structure of the world. In this work, we make parts of this counterargument formal by using ideas from the theory of coalgebras, an abstract mathematical framework for dynamical systems that brings together work from automata theory, concurrency theory, probabilistic processes and other fields. To do so, we cast generative model and process, in the form of POMDPs, as coalgebras, and use maps between them to describe a form of consistency that goes beyond mere structural similarity, giving the necessary mathematical background to describe how different processes can be seen as behaviourally, rather than structurally, equivalent, i.e. how they can be seen as emitting the same observations, and thus minimise prediction error, over time without strict assumptions about structural similarity. In particular, we will introduce three standard notions of equivalence from the literature on coalgebras, evaluating them in the context of predictive processing and identifying the one closest to claims made by proponents of this framework.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18226">Disentangling the Factors of Convergence between Brains and Computer Vision Models</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2508.18226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many AI models trained on natural images develop representations that resemble those of the human brain. However, the factors that drive this brain-model similarity remain poorly understood. To disentangle how the model, training and data independently lead a neural network to develop brain-like representations, we trained a family of self-supervised vision transformers (DINOv3) that systematically varied these different factors. We compare their representations of images to those of the human brain recorded with both fMRI and MEG, providing high resolution in spatial and temporal analyses. We assess the brain-model similarity with three complementary metrics focusing on overall representational similarity, topographical organization, and temporal dynamics. We show that all three factors - model size, training amount, and image type - independently and interactively impact each of these brain similarity metrics. In particular, the largest DINOv3 models trained with the most human-centric images reach the highest brain-similarity. This emergence of brain-like representations in AI models follows a specific chronology during training: models first align with the early representations of the sensory cortices, and only align with the late and prefrontal representations of the brain with considerably more training. Finally, this developmental trajectory is indexed by both structural and functional properties of the human cortex: the representations that are acquired last by the models specifically align with the cortical areas with the largest developmental expansion, thickness, least myelination, and slowest timescales. Overall, these findings disentangle the interplay between architecture and experience in shaping how artificial neural networks come to see the world as humans do, thus offering a promising framework to understand how the human brain comes to represent its visual world.

                arXiv:2507.09024v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Data-hungry neuro-AI modelling requires ever larger neuroimaging datasets. CNeuroMod-THINGS meets this need by capturing neural representations for a wide set of semantic concepts using well-characterized images in a new densely-sampled, large-scale fMRI dataset. Importantly, CNeuroMod-THINGS exploits synergies between two existing projects: the THINGS initiative (THINGS) and the Courtois Project on Neural Modelling (CNeuroMod). THINGS has developed a common set of thoroughly annotated images broadly sampling natural and man-made objects which is used to acquire a growing collection of large-scale multimodal neural responses. Meanwhile, CNeuroMod is acquiring hundreds of hours of fMRI data from a core set of participants during controlled and naturalistic tasks, including visual tasks like movie watching and videogame playing. For CNeuroMod-THINGS, four CNeuroMod participants each completed 33-36 sessions of a continuous recognition paradigm using approximately 4000 images from the THINGS stimulus set spanning 720 categories. We report behavioural and neuroimaging metrics that showcase the quality of the data. By bridging together large existing resources, CNeuroMod-THINGS expands our capacity to model broad slices of the human visual experience.

                arXiv:2408.12540v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study pattern formation in class of a large-dimensional neural networks posed on random graphs and subject to spatio-temporal stochastic forcing. Under generic conditions on coupling and nodal dynamics, we prove that the network admits a rigorous mean-field limit, resembling a Wilson-Cowan neural field equation. The state variables of the limiting systems are the mean and variance of neuronal activity. We select networks whose mean-field equations are tractable and we perform a bifurcation analysis using as control parameter the diffusivity strength of the afferent white noise on each neuron. We find conditions for Turing-like bifurcations in a system where the cortex is modelled as a ring, and we produce numerical evidence of noise-induced spiral waves in models with a two-dimensional cortex. We provide numerical evidence that solutions of the finite-size network converge weakly to solutions of the mean-field model. Finally, we prove a Large Deviation Principle, which provides a means of assessing the likelihood of deviations from the mean-field equations induced by finite-size effects.

Abstract: Neuroscientists face challenges in analyzing high-dimensional neural recording data of dense functional networks. Without ground-truth reference data, finding the best algorithm for recovering neurologically relevant networks remains an open question. We implemented hybrid quantum algorithms to construct functional networks and compared them with the results of documented classical techniques. We demonstrated that our quantum state fidelity can provide a competitive alternative to classical metrics by revealing distinct functional networks. Our results suggest that quantum computing offers a viable and potentially advantageous alternative for data-driven modeling in neuroscience, underscoring its broader applicability in high-dimensional graph inference and complex system analysis.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16993">Not Just for Archiving: Provable Benefits of Reusing the Archive in Evolutionary Multi-objective Optimization</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2508.16993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) have become the most popular tool for solving widely-existed multi-objective optimization problems. In Multi-Objective EAs (MOEAs), there is increasing interest in using an archive to store non-dominated solutions generated during the search. This approach can 1) mitigate the effects of population oscillation, a common issue in many MOEAs, and 2) allow for the use of smaller, more practical population sizes. In this paper, we analytically show that the archive can even further help MOEAs through reusing its solutions during the process of new solution generation. We first prove that using a small population size alongside an archive (without incorporating archived solutions in the generation process) may fail on certain problems, as the population may remove previously discovered but promising solutions. We then prove that reusing archive solutions can overcome this limitation, resulting in at least a polynomial speedup on the expected running time. Our analysis focuses on the well-established SMS-EMOA algorithm applied to the commonly studied OneJumpZeroJump problem as well as one of its variants. We also show that reusing archive solutions can be better than using a large population size directly. Finally, we show that our theoretical findings can generally hold in practice by experiments on four well-known practical optimization problems -- multi-objective 0-1 Knapsack, TSP, QAP and NK-landscape problems -- with realistic settings.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18105">Arc Routing Problems with Multiple Trucks and Drones: A Hybrid Genetic Algorithm</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2508.18105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Arc-routing problems underpin numerous critical field operations, including power-line inspection, urban police patrolling, and traffic monitoring. In this domain, the Rural Postman Problem (RPP) is a fundamental variant in which a prescribed subset of edges or arcs in a network must be traversed. This paper investigates a generalized form of the RPP, called RPP-mTD, which involves a fleet of multiple trucks, each carrying multiple drones. The trucks act as mobile depots traversing a road network, from which drones are launched to execute simultaneous service, with the objective of minimizing the overall makespan. Given the combinatorial complexity of RPP-mTD, we propose a Hybrid Genetic Algorithm (HGA) that combines population-based exploration with targeted neighborhood searches. Solutions are encoded using a two-layer chromosome that represents: (i) an ordered, directed sequence of required edges, and (ii) their assignment to vehicles. A tailored segment-preserving crossover operator is introduced, along with multiple local search techniques to intensify the optimization. We benchmark the proposed HGA against established single truck-and-drone instances, demonstrating competitive performance. Additionally, we conduct extensive evaluations on new, larger-scale instances to demonstrate scalability. Our findings highlight the operational benefits of closely integrated truck-drone fleets, affirming the HGA's practical effectiveness as a decision-support tool in advanced mixed-fleet logistics.

                arXiv:2508.16792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate the first-ever nontrivial, biologically realistic connectome simulated on neuromorphic computing hardware. Specifically, we implement the whole-brain connectome of the adult Drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly) from the FlyWire Consortium containing 140K neurons and 50M synapses on the Intel Loihi 2 neuromorphic platform. This task is particularly challenging due to the characteristic connectivity structure of biological networks. Unlike artificial neural networks and most abstracted neural models, real biological circuits exhibit sparse, recurrent, and irregular connectivity that is poorly suited to conventional computing methods intended for dense linear algebra. Though neuromorphic hardware is architecturally better suited to discrete event-based biological communication, mapping the connectivity structure to frontier systems still faces challenges from low-level hardware constraints, such as fan-in and fan-out memory limitations. We describe solutions to these challenges that allow for the full FlyWire connectome to fit onto 12 Loihi 2 chips. We statistically validate our implementation by comparing network behavior across multiple reference simulations. Significantly, we achieve a neuromorphic implementation that is orders of magnitude faster than numerical simulations on conventional hardware, and we also find that performance advantages increase with sparser activity. These results affirm that today's scalable neuromorphic platforms are capable of implementing and accelerating biologically realistic models -- a key enabling technology for advancing neuro-inspired AI and computational neuroscience.

                arXiv:2508.16884v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision Transformer (ViT) has prevailed in computer vision tasks due to its strong long-range dependency modelling ability. However, its large model size with high computational cost and weak local feature modeling ability hinder its application in real scenarios. To balance computation efficiency and performance, we propose SAEViT (Sparse-Attention-Efficient-ViT), a lightweight ViT based model with convolution blocks, in this paper to achieve efficient downstream vision tasks. Specifically, SAEViT introduces a Sparsely Aggregated Attention (SAA) module that performs adaptive sparse sampling based on image redundancy and recovers the feature map via deconvolution operation, which significantly reduces the computational complexity of attention operations. In addition, a Channel-Interactive Feed-Forward Network (CIFFN) layer is developed to enhance inter-channel information exchange through feature decomposition and redistribution, mitigating redundancy in traditional feed-forward networks (FNN). Finally, a hierarchical pyramid structure with embedded depth-wise separable convolutional blocks (DWSConv) is devised to further strengthen convolutional features. Extensive experiments on mainstream datasets show that SAEViT achieves Top-1 accuracies of 76.3\% and 79.6\% on the ImageNet-1K classification task with only 0.8 GFLOPs and 1.3 GFLOPs, respectively, demonstrating a lightweight solution for various fundamental vision tasks.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17464">Evolutionary Brain-Body Co-Optimization Consistently Fails to Select for Morphological Potential</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2508.17464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Brain-body co-optimization remains a challenging problem, despite increasing interest from the community in recent years. To understand and overcome the challenges, we propose exhaustively mapping a morphology-fitness landscape to study it. To this end, we train controllers for each feasible morphology in a design space of 1,305,840 distinct morphologies, constrained by a computational budget. First, we show that this design space constitutes a good model for studying the brain-body co-optimization problem, and our attempt to exhaustively map it roughly captures the landscape. We then proceed to analyze how evolutionary brain-body co-optimization algorithms work in this design space. The complete knowledge of the morphology-fitness landscape facilitates a better understanding of the results of evolutionary brain-body co-optimization algorithms and how they unfold over evolutionary time in the morphology space. This investigation shows that the experimented algorithms cannot consistently find near-optimal solutions. The search, at times, gets stuck on morphologies that are sometimes one mutation away from better morphologies, and the algorithms cannot efficiently track the fitness gradient in the morphology-fitness landscape. We provide evidence that experimented algorithms regularly undervalue the fitness of individuals with newly mutated bodies and, as a result, eliminate promising morphologies throughout evolution. Our work provides the most concrete demonstration of the challenges of evolutionary brain-body co-optimization. Our findings ground the trends in the literature and provide valuable insights for future work.

                arXiv:2508.17469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rise of modern deep learning, neural networks have become an essential part of virtually every artificial intelligence system, making it difficult even to imagine different models for intelligent behavior. In contrast, nature provides us with many different mechanisms for intelligent behavior, most of which we have yet to replicate. One of such underinvestigated aspects of intelligence is embodiment and the role it plays in intelligent behavior. In this work, we focus on how the simple and fixed behavior of constituent parts of a simulated physical body can result in an emergent behavior that can be classified as cognitive by an outside observer. Specifically, we show how simulated voxels with fixed behaviors can be combined to create a robot such that, when presented with an image of an MNIST digit zero, it moves towards the left; and when it is presented with an image of an MNIST digit one, it moves towards the right. Such robots possess what we refer to as ``morphological cognition'' -- the ability to perform cognitive behavior as a result of morphological processes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of a high-level mental faculty such as image classification performed by a robot without any neural circuitry. We hope that this work serves as a proof-of-concept and fosters further research into different models of intelligence.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17661">Spacer: Towards Engineered Scientific Inspiration</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2508.17661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in LLMs have made automated scientific research the next frontline in the path to artificial superintelligence. However, these systems are bound either to tasks of narrow scope or the limited creative capabilities of LLMs. We propose Spacer, a scientific discovery system that develops creative and factually grounded concepts without external intervention. Spacer attempts to achieve this via 'deliberate decontextualization,' an approach that disassembles information into atomic units - keywords - and draws creativity from unexplored connections between them. Spacer consists of (i) Nuri, an inspiration engine that builds keyword sets, and (ii) the Manifesting Pipeline that refines these sets into elaborate scientific statements. Nuri extracts novel, high-potential keyword sets from a keyword graph built with 180,000 academic publications in biological fields. The Manifesting Pipeline finds links between keywords, analyzes their logical structure, validates their plausibility, and ultimately drafts original scientific concepts. According to our experiments, the evaluation metric of Nuri accurately classifies high-impact publications with an AUROC score of 0.737. Our Manifesting Pipeline also successfully reconstructs core concepts from the latest top-journal articles solely from their keyword sets. An LLM-based scoring system estimates that this reconstruction was sound for over 85% of the cases. Finally, our embedding space analysis shows that outputs from Spacer are significantly more similar to leading publications compared with those from SOTA LLMs.

                arXiv:2410.07968v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Navigating the vast, rugged, and multi-modal fitness landscapes of protein sequences presents a formidable challenge for computational protein engineering, often trapping algorithms in suboptimal solutions. Existing methods struggle with the exploration-exploitation dilemma, failing to synergize global search with deep local refinement. To overcome this critical barrier, we introduce the Octopus Inspired Optimization (OIO), a novel hierarchical metaheuristic that mimics the octopus's unique neural architecture of centralized control and decentralized, parallel execution. OIO's "individual-tentacle-sucker" framework provides an intrinsic unification of global exploration and parallelized local exploitation, making it structurally ideal for complex combinatorial problems. We validated OIO's efficacy through a rigorous three-tiered experimental framework. On a real-world Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) design benchmark, OIO surpassed a comprehensive suite of 15 competing metaheuristics, including 7 classic algorithms and 8 state-of-the-art methods from the past two years, delivering performance comparable only to a specialized local search algorithm. This success is explained by its fundamental strengths: OIO ranked first on the NK-Landscape benchmark, confirming its architectural suitability for protein-like fitness landscapes, and also ranked first on the gold-standard CEC2022 benchmark, demonstrating the raw power and efficiency of its optimization engine. OIO establishes a new, nature-inspired paradigm for protein engineering, offering a robust and powerful tool with significant potential for advancing therapeutic and enzymatic design.

                arXiv:2501.14285v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The traveling salesman problem (TSP) is a fundamental NP-hard optimization problem. Over the past decades, traditional heuristic methods have achieved substantial success in solving TSP, yet their performance, particularly for large-scale instances, remains to be further improved. The advancement of deep learning technologies over the past decade has driven a growing number of attempts to solve TSP by leveraging neural guidance. However, these efforts predominantly focus on small-scale TSP instances, with limited improvements in solving performance for large-scale instances, revealing persistent scalability challenges. This work presents UNiCS, a novel unified neural-guided cascaded solver for solving large-scale TSP instances. UNiCS comprises a local search (LS) phase and a population-based search (PBS) phase, both guided by a learning component called unified neural guidance (UNG). Specifically, UNG guides solution generation across both phases and determines appropriate phase transition timing to effectively combine the complementary strengths of LS and PBS. While trained only on simple distributions with relatively small-scale TSP instances, UNiCS generalizes effectively to challenging TSP benchmarks containing much larger instances (10,000-71,009 nodes) with diverse node distributions entirely unseen during training. Experimental results on the large-scale TSP instances demonstrate that UNiCS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, with its advantage remaining consistent across various runtime budgets.

                arXiv:2501.16735v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) have been widely applied to multi-objective optimization due to their population-based nature. Population update, a key component in multi-objective EAs (MOEAs), is usually performed in a greedy, deterministic manner. However, recent studies have questioned this practice and shown that stochastic population update (SPU), which allows inferior solutions have a chance to be preserved, can help MOEAs jump out of local optima more easily. Nevertheless, SPU risks losing high-quality solutions, potentially requiring a large population. Intuitively, a possible solution to this issue is to introduce an archive that stores the best solutions ever found. In this paper, we theoretically show that using an archive allows a small population and may enhance the search performance of SPU-based MOEAs. We examine two classic algorithms, SMS-EMOA and NSGA-II, on the bi-objective problem OneJumpZeroJump, and prove that using an archive can reduce the expected running time upper bound (even exponentially). The comparison between SMS-EMOA and NSGA-II also suggests that the $(\mu+\mu)$ update mode may be more suitable for SPU than the $(\mu+1)$ update mode. We also validate our findings empirically. We hope this work may provide theoretical support to explore different ideas of designing algorithms in evolutionary multi-objective optimization.

                arXiv:2505.14841v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) promise energy-efficient computation by mimicking biological neural dynamics, yet existing plasticity rules focus on isolated spike pairs and fail to leverage the synchronous activity patterns that drive learning in biological systems. We introduce spike-synchrony-dependent plasticity (SSDP), a training approach that adjusts synaptic weights based on the degree of synchronous neural firing rather than spike timing order. Our method operates as a local, post-optimization mechanism that applies updates to sparse parameter subsets, maintaining computational efficiency with linear scaling. SSDP serves as a lightweight event-structure regularizer, biasing the network toward biologically plausible spatio-temporal synchrony while preserving standard convergence behavior. SSDP seamlessly integrates with standard backpropagation while preserving the forward computation graph. We validate our approach across single-layer SNNs and spiking Transformers on datasets from static images to high-temporal-resolution tasks, demonstrating improved convergence stability and enhanced robustness to spike-time jitter and event noise. These findings provide new insights into how biological neural networks might leverage synchronous activity for efficient information processing and suggest that synchrony-dependent plasticity represents a key computational principle underlying neural learning.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in modeling graph-structured data, while Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer high energy efficiency through sparse, event-driven computation. However, existing spiking GNNs predominantly operate in Euclidean space and rely on fixed geometric assumptions, limiting their capacity to model complex graph structures such as hierarchies and cycles. To overcome these limitations, we propose \method{}, a novel Geometry-Aware Spiking Graph Neural Network that unifies spike-based neural dynamics with adaptive representation learning on Riemannian manifolds. \method{} features three key components: a Riemannian Embedding Layer that projects node features into a pool of constant-curvature manifolds, capturing non-Euclidean structures; a Manifold Spiking Layer that models membrane potential evolution and spiking behavior in curved spaces via geometry-consistent neighbor aggregation and curvature-based attention; and a Manifold Learning Objective that enables instance-wise geometry adaptation through jointly optimized classification and link prediction losses defined over geodesic distances. All modules are trained using Riemannian SGD, eliminating the need for backpropagation through time. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks show that GSG achieves superior accuracy, robustness, and energy efficiency compared to both Euclidean SNNs and manifold-based GNNs, establishing a new paradigm for curvature-aware, energy-efficient graph learning.

                arXiv:2508.11703v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Algorithmic discovery has traditionally relied on human ingenuity and extensive experimentation. Here we investigate whether a prominent scientific computing algorithm, the Kalman Filter, can be discovered through an automated, data-driven, evolutionary process that relies on Cartesian Genetic Programming (CGP) and Large Language Models (LLM). We evaluate the contributions of both modalities (CGP and LLM) in discovering the Kalman filter under varying conditions. Our results demonstrate that our framework of CGP and LLM-assisted evolution converges to near-optimal solutions when Kalman optimality assumptions hold. When these assumptions are violated, our framework evolves interpretable alternatives that outperform the Kalman filter. These results demonstrate that combining evolutionary algorithms and generative models for interpretable, data-driven synthesis of simple computational modules is a potent approach for algorithmic discovery in scientific computing.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10225">Bridging Models to Defend: A Population-Based Strategy for Robust Adversarial Defense</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2303.10225v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Adversarial robustness is a critical measure of a neural network's ability to withstand adversarial attacks at inference time. While robust training techniques have improved defenses against individual $\ell_p$-norm attacks (e.g., $\ell_2$ or $\ell_\infty$), models remain vulnerable to diversified $\ell_p$ perturbations. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Robust Mode Connectivity (RMC)-oriented adversarial defense framework comprising two population-based learning phases. In Phase I, RMC searches the parameter space between two pre-trained models to construct a continuous path containing models with high robustness against multiple $\ell_p$ attacks. To improve efficiency, we introduce a Self-Robust Mode Connectivity (SRMC) module that accelerates endpoint generation in RMC. Building on RMC, Phase II presents RMC-based optimization, where RMC modules are composed to further enhance diversified robustness. To increase Phase II efficiency, we propose Efficient Robust Mode Connectivity (ERMC), which leverages $\ell_1$- and $\ell_\infty$-adversarially trained models to achieve robustness across a broad range of $p$-norms. An ensemble strategy is employed to further boost ERMC's performance. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets and architectures demonstrate that our methods significantly improve robustness against $\ell_\infty$, $\ell_2$, $\ell_1$, and hybrid attacks.

                arXiv:2402.07949v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diabetes, a chronic condition that impairs how the body turns food into energy, i.e. blood glucose, affects 38 million people in the US alone. The standard treatment is to supplement carbohydrate intake with an artificial pancreas, i.e. a continuous insulin pump (basal shots), as well as occasional insulin injections (bolus shots). The goal of the treatment is to keep blood glucose at the center of an acceptable range, as measured through a continuous glucose meter. A secondary goal is to minimize injections, which are unpleasant and difficult for some patients to implement. In this study, neuroevolution was used to discover an optimal strategy for the treatment. Based on a dataset of 30 days of treatment and measurements of a single patient, a random forest was first trained to predict future glucose levels. A neural network was then evolved to prescribe carbohydrates, basal pumping levels, and bolus injections. Evolution discovered a Pareto front that reduced deviation from the target and number of injections compared to the original data, thus improving patients' quality of life. To make the system easier to adopt, a language interface was developed with a large language model. Thus, these technologies not only improve patient care but also adoption in a broader population.

                arXiv:2403.10112v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Active hypothesis testing is a thoroughly studied problem that finds numerous applications in wireless communications and sensor networks. In this paper, we focus on one centralized and one decentralized problem of active hypothesis testing in the presence of an eavesdropper. For the centralized problem including a single legitimate agent, we present a new framework based on deep NeuroEvolution (NE), whereas, for the decentralized problem, we develop a novel NE-based method for solving collaborative multi-agent tasks, which, interestingly, maintains all computational benefits of our single-agent NE-based scheme. To further reduce the computational complexity of the latter scheme, a novel multi-agent joint NE and pruning framework is also designed. The superiority of the proposed NE-based evasive active hypothesis testing schemes over conventional active hypothesis testing policies, as well as learning-based methods, is validated through extensive numerical investigations in an example use case of anomaly detection over wireless sensor networks. It is demonstrated that the proposed joint optimization and pruning framework achieves nearly identical performance with its unpruned counterpart, while removing a very large percentage of redundant deep neural network weights.

                arXiv:2407.10780v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Herein the topics of (natural) gradient descent, data decorrelation, and approximate methods for backpropagation are brought into a common discussion. Natural gradient descent illuminates how gradient vectors, pointing at directions of steepest descent, can be improved by considering the local curvature of loss landscapes. We extend this perspective and show that to fully solve the problem illuminated by natural gradients in neural networks, one must recognise that correlations in the data at any linear transformation, including node responses at every layer of a neural network, cause a non-orthonormal relationship between the model's parameters. To solve this requires a method for decorrelating inputs at each individual layer of a neural network. We describe a range of methods which have been proposed for decorrelation and whitening of node output, and expand on these to provide a novel method specifically useful for distributed computing and computational neuroscience. Implementing decorrelation within multi-layer neural networks, we can show that not only is training via backpropagation sped up significantly but also existing approximations of backpropagation, which have failed catastrophically in the past, benefit significantly in their accuracy and convergence speed. This has the potential to provide a route forward for approximate gradient descent methods which have previously been discarded, training approaches for analogue and neuromorphic hardware, and potentially insights as to the efficacy and utility of decorrelation processes in the brain.

                arXiv:2407.19183v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph data in real-world scenarios undergo rapid and frequent changes, making it challenging for existing graph models to effectively handle the continuous influx of new data and accommodate data withdrawal requests. The approach to frequently retraining graph models is resource intensive and impractical. To address this pressing challenge, this paper introduces a new concept of graph memory learning. Its core idea is to enable a graph model to selectively remember new knowledge but forget old knowledge. Building on this approach, the paper presents a novel graph memory learning framework - Brain-inspired Graph Memory Learning (BGML), inspired by brain network dynamics and function-structure coupling strategies. BGML incorporates a multi-granular hierarchical progressive learning mechanism rooted in feature graph grain learning to mitigate potential conflict between memorization and forgetting in graph memory learning. This mechanism allows for a comprehensive and multi-level perception of local details within evolving graphs. In addition, to tackle the issue of unreliable structures in newly added incremental information, the paper introduces an information self-assessment ownership mechanism. This mechanism not only facilitates the propagation of incremental information within the model but also effectively preserves the integrity of past experiences. We design five types of graph memory learning tasks: regular, memory, unlearning, data-incremental, and class-incremental to evaluate BGML. Its excellent performance is confirmed through extensive experiments on multiple real-world node classification datasets.

                arXiv:2504.12561v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hopfield networks using Hebbian learning suffer from limited storage capacity. While supervised methods like Linear Logistic Regression (LLR) offer some improvement, kernel methods like Kernel Logistic Regression (KLR) significantly enhance storage capacity and noise robustness. However, KLR requires computationally expensive iterative learning. We propose Kernel Ridge Regression (KRR) as an efficient kernel-based alternative for learning high-capacity Hopfield networks. KRR utilizes the kernel trick and predicts bipolar states via regression, crucially offering a non-iterative, closed-form solution for learning dual variables. We evaluate KRR and compare its performance against Hebbian, LLR, and KLR. Our results demonstrate that KRR achieves state-of-the-art storage capacity (reaching a storage load of 1.5) and noise robustness, comparable to KLR. Crucially, KRR drastically reduces training time, being orders of magnitude faster than LLR and significantly faster than KLR, especially at higher storage loads. This establishes KRR as a potent and highly efficient method for building high-performance associative memories, providing comparable performance to KLR with substantial training speed advantages. This work provides the first empirical comparison between KRR and KLR in the context of Hopfield network learning.

                arXiv:2508.01175v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dominant paradigm in modern neural networks relies on simple, monotonically-increasing activation functions like ReLU. While effective, this paradigm necessitates large, massively-parameterized models to approximate complex functions. In this paper, we introduce the Periodic Linear Unit (PLU), a learnable sine-wave based activation with periodic non-monotonicity. PLU is designed for maximum expressive power and numerical stability, achieved through its formulation and a paired innovation we term Repulsive Reparameterization, which prevents the activation from collapsing into a non-expressive linear function. We demonstrate that a minimal MLP with only two PLU neurons can solve the spiral classification task, a feat impossible for equivalent networks using standard activations. This suggests a paradigm shift from networks as piecewise Taylor-like approximators to powerful Fourier-like function synthesizers, achieving exponential gains in parameter efficiency by placing intelligence in the neuron itself.

">40 Hz Audiovisual Stimulation Improves Sustained Attention and Related Brain Oscillations</a></h4>

              
                Gamma oscillations (30-100 Hz) have long been theorized to play a key role in sensory processing and attention by coordinating neural firing across distributed neurons. Gamma oscillations can be generated internally by neural circuits during attention or exogenously by stimuli that turn on and off at gamma frequencies. However, it remains unknown if driving gamma activity via exogenous sensory stimulation affects attention. We tested the hypothesis that non-invasive audiovisual stimulation in the form of flashing lights and sounds (flicker) at 40 Hz improves attention in an attentional vigilance task and affects neural oscillations associated with attention. We recorded scalp EEG activity of healthy adults (n=62) during one hour of either 40 Hz audiovisual flicker, no flicker as control, or randomized flicker as sham stimulation, while subjects performed a psychomotor vigilance task. Participants exposed to 40 Hz flicker stimulation had better accuracy and faster reaction times than participants in the control groups. The 40 Hz group showed increased 40 Hz activity compared to the control groups in agreement with previous studies. Surprisingly, 40 Hz subjects had significantly lower delta power (2-4 Hz), which is associated with arousal, and higher functional connectivity in lower alpha (8-10 Hz), which is associated with attention processes. Furthermore, decreased delta power and increased lower alpha functional connectivity were correlated with better attention task performance. This study reveals how gamma audiovisual stimulation improves attention performance with potential implications for therapeutic interventions for attention disorders and cognitive enhancement.

">Post-synaptic facilitation and network dynamics underlying stimulus-specific combination sensitivity</a></h4>

              
                Combination-sensitive neurons (CSNs) integrate multiple stimulus features to generate behaviorally meaningful responses. While such neurons are well studied in fast timescale systems such as bat echolocation, the mechanisms enabling extended temporal integration in species like songbirds remain poorly understood. Using a computational model, we show that syllable-specific neurons in the songbird auditory system function as coincidence detectors whose selectivity depends on both post-inhibitory facilitation and persistent network activity. This persistence serves as a "memory trace", allowing precise association of sequential syllables across hundreds of milliseconds. We propose that this dynamic interplay between intrinsic neuronal properties and convergent synaptic inputs gives rise to a higher-order "meta-combination sensitivity" enabling the auditory system to transform discrete acoustic events into temporally extended percepts. Our findings provide a mechanistic framework that bridges theories of coincidence detection with longer-timescale working memory, highlighting the importance of distributed network mechanisms for auditory temporal coding.

                <p>by Moein Khajehnejad, Julian García, Bernd Meyer</p>

Age-polyethism—the age-based allocation of tasks in social insect colonies—is a key feature of division of labour. While its hormonal underpinnings have been studied extensively, the behavioural and environmental mechanisms driving age-polyethism remain poorly understood, especially under ecological stress. We present a novel modelling framework that integrates social learning with task-related environmental feedback to explain the emergence and breakdown of age-polyethism. We develop two models: a Social Learning (SL) model, in which individuals adapt task preferences by copying similar peers, and a Stimulus-Response Threshold Social Learning (SRT-SL) model, which extends this framework by incorporating task-related dynamic stimuli and response thresholds that regulate collective task demand. Our models demonstrate that age-polyethism can emerge from simple social imitation processes, without the need for fixed hormonal schedules. We show that under increasing environmental pressure (e.g., resource scarcity), age-polyethism collapses as younger individuals are forced into tasks typically handled by older workers. Importantly, we find that age-polyethism does not necessarily optimize immediate colony efficiency; instead, it appears to reflect a trade-off between environmental constraints and behavioural coordination. These findings provide a mechanistic and ecologically grounded explanation for empirical observations linking environmental stress to dysfunctional division of labour and colony collapse.

                <p>by Kien Trung Tran, Tran Dang Nguyen, Daniel B. Weissman, Eric Zhewen Li, Sachel Mok, Jennifer L. Small-Saunders, Teun Bousema, Robert J. Zupko, Thu Nguyen-Anh Tran, Maciej F. Boni</p>

When multiple beneficial alleles at multiple loci are present in a population but not linked together in any one individual, there is no general evolutionary result that determines whether recombination will speed up or slow down the emergence and evolution of genotypes carrying multiple beneficial alleles. Translated to infectious disease control, this evolutionary uncertainty means that when multiple types of drug resistance are present we do not know whether recombination will act more strongly to (1) bring together single-resistant genotypes into multi-drug resistant (MDR) genotypes, or (2) break apart MDR genotypes into single-resistant genotypes. In this paper, we introduce a new version of an established and validated individual-based malaria transmission model where we have added 25 drug-resistance related loci, individual mosquito bites, and mosquitoes feeding on multiple hosts in a single meal (interrupted feeds) allowing for recombination events of different <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> genotypes from different hosts. Recombination among <i>P. falciparum</i> genotypes in this model occurs from two sources of variation, multi-clonal infections in single hosts and interrupted feeds on multiple hosts, and we show that 80% to 97% of MDR recombinant falciparum genotypes are projected to occur from single uninterrupted bites on hosts with multi-clonal infections (for malaria prevalence > 5%). Increases in the model’s interrupted feeding rate slowly increase the number of recombination events occurring from interrupted feeds. A comparison of drug-resistance management strategies with this new model shows that, over a 15-year timeframe, triple artemisinin-combination therapies (ACT) strategies show the largest reductions in treatment failures and the longest delays until artemisinin resistance reaches a critical 1% threshold. Multiple first-line therapies (MFT) are second best under these criteria, and ACT cycling approaches are third best. When compared to cycling strategies, MFT strategies generate a greater diversity of recombinant genotypes but fewer recombination events generating MDR and slower emergence of these recombinant MDR genotypes.

                <p>by Samantha Zink, Songrong Qu, Thomas Holton, Eesha Shankar, Paulina Stanley, David S. Eisenberg, Michael R. Sawaya, Jose A. Rodriguez</p>

Predicting the amyloid fold and the propensity of peptide segments to adopt amyloid-like structures remain a challenge. However, recent progress has facilitated structure-based prediction of steric zipper propensity and the use of machine learning to accelerate the calculation of predictive models across many scientific areas. Leveraging these advances, we have developed a new approach for rapid proteome-wide assessment of zipper profiles that is informed by four million steric zipper predictions collected over ten years. This collection is used to build a machine learning model capable of rapidly predicting steric zipper propensity, and allowing for the assessment of zippers at both the protein and proteome level. Our predictions show enrichment for zipper forming segments in proteins involved in cell wall reorganization in yeast, highlighting a potential category of interest for experimental characterization. Overall, our predictive model allows for the exploration of amyloid formation across the tree of life and provides a tool for assessment of both novel and designed sequences for zipper density.

                <p>by Léa Loisel, Vincent Raquin, Maxime Ratinier, Pauline Ezanno, Gaël Beaunée</p>

Arboviruses represent a significant threat to the health of humans, animals, and plants worldwide. Mechanistic modeling has proven useful for elucidating the transmission, anticipating the spread, and predicting the response of arboviruses to control measures. However, most models approximate the intra-vector infection dynamic (IVD), which occurs during the extrinsic incubation period (EIP), by a single stage with an average duration. At the end of this stage, all exposed vectors are expected to become infectious. Strong assumption is hidden behind this: that the EIP is exponentially distributed in the vector population. To assess the validity of this assumption, we developed a stochastic compartmental model that represents successive IVD stages, associated with the crossing or not of the three within-mosquito barriers (infection, dissemination, and transmission). We calibrated the model using an ABC-SMC (Approximate Bayesian Computation - Sequential Monte Carlo) method, which includes model selection. We searched for literature data on experimental infections of <i>Aedes</i> mosquitoes infected by dengue, chikungunya, or Zika viruses. We demonstrated the large discrepancy between the exponential hypothesis and observed EIP distributions for dengue and Zika viruses, and identified more relevant EIP distributions. This work provides a generic modeling framework that can be applied to other arboviruses for which similar data are available. Our model also can be linked to population-scale models to aid future arbovirus control efforts.

                <p>by Jian Peng, Jichuan Quan, Xiaoru Wang</p>
Background <p>While the RNA-binding protein HuR is implicated in individual cancers, its comprehensive diagnostic, prognostic, and immunological roles across diverse cancer types remain unexplored.</p> Methods <p>We performed an integrated pan-cancer analysis of HuR using public datasets. This encompassed expression profiling, survival analysis, diagnostic accuracy assessment, immune microenvironment characterization, and drug sensitivity prediction. We investigated HuR’s regulatory mechanisms through pathway correlation and differential gene expression analyses.</p> Results <p>HuR expression was consistently elevated across multiple cancers and correlated with poor patient prognosis. It demonstrated high diagnostic accuracy (>85%) via TMB/PD-L1 biomarkers. High HuR expression was associated with an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and reduced efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors, establishing it as a key immunoregulatory biomarker. HuR also predicted sensitivity to cell cycle inhibitors and other pathway-targeted drugs. Mechanistically, HuR drives malignancy by dysregulating core processes: cell cycle progression, immune evasion, and cellular metabolism.</p> Conclusions <p>Our pan-cancer analysis establishes HuR as a consistently upregulated oncogenic driver across malignancies, functioning as a potential universal biomarker for prognosis and diagnosis. Its critical roles in modulating the immune response and predicting therapeutic sensitivity highlight its importance for personalized cancer treatment strategies. HuR orchestrates tumorigenesis and malignant progression by integrally regulating vital cellular processes.</p>

                <p>by Bilal Ahmed, Joshua D. Downer, Brian J. Malone, Joseph G. Makin</p>

For static stimuli or at gross (∼1-s) time scales, artificial neural networks (ANNs) that have been trained on challenging engineering tasks, like image classification and automatic speech recognition, are now the best predictors of neural responses in primate visual and auditory cortex. It is, however, unknown whether this success can be extended to spiking activity at fine time scales, which are particularly relevant to audition. Here we address this question with ANNs trained on speech audio, and acute multi-electrode recordings from the auditory cortex of squirrel monkeys. We show that layers of trained ANNs can predict the spike counts of multi-units responding to speech audio and to monkey vocalizations at bin widths of 50 ms and below. For some multi-units, the ANNs explain close to all of the explainable variance—much more than traditional spectrotemporal receptive fields, and more than untrained networks. Non-primary neurons tend to be more predictable by deeper layers of the ANNs, but there is much variation by neuron, which would be invisible to coarser recording modalities.

                <p>by Samuel Torres-Florez, Jorge Luis Flores Anato, Jiahuan Helen He, Vicente Garrido Portilla, Yichen Wu, Mathieu Maheu-Giroux, Étienne Racine, Caroline E. Wagner</p>

During the COVID-19 pandemic, decision-makers had imperfect information and faced resource constraints (i.e., vaccine availability). Public health decisions at the time may not have been optimal for minimizing disease burden. Here, we perform counterfactual evaluations of the impact of various vaccination strategies in Québec (Canada) on the COVID-19 burden from March 2020 to November 2021. In particular, we evaluate the effect of alternative age-specific prioritization sequences of vaccine dose roll-out and assess the impacts of vaccine hesitancy. To achieve this, we develop and calibrate a deterministic, compartmental dynamic transmission model, stratified according to age, susceptibility to infection, viral variant, and issue-specific immunity. The initial conditions and parameters of the model are obtained through a combination of population-based surveillance data and Approximate Bayesian Computation Sequential Monte Carlo (ABC-SMC) parameter estimation methods. We find that, using our calibrated model, the vaccination prioritization policies implemented at the start of the pandemic, where age groups at highest risk were sequentially prioritized, was only outperformed by prioritizing the vaccination of younger, more socially connected groups together with higher-risk individuals aged 50+ (3% fewer hospitalizations compared to the baseline strategy). These results hold when we account for vaccine hesitancy. Specifically, we generally observe the fewest hospitalizations for the optimal strategies at the highest uptake rates (i.e. with the least vaccine refusal). However, certain sub-optimal strategies show higher hospitalization rates for higher vaccine uptake as a result of reduced vaccine dose redistribution to more interconnected age groups. Overall, our findings illustrate how the impact of vaccination strategies depends on population factors (e.g. contact patterns, vaccine uptake, and degree of immunity), age-specific risk of severe disease and transmission dynamics. Understanding these dependencies are important for guiding future decision-making related to priority vaccine administration in the face of known and emerging pathogens and potential shortage of doses.

                <p>by Ching-San Tseng, Zi-hui Zhuang, Hsiang-Wei Hsing, Chia-Ming Lee, Tsan-Ting Hsu, Yu-Kuan Pan, Yi-Ping Hsueh, Bi-Chang Chen, Shen-Ju Chou</p>

The hippocampus is a key brain region for learning and memory that can be divided into multiple compartments, including the dorsal and ventral hippocampi. Each compartment has unique functions, connectivity, and molecular properties. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the specification of these subregions remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the role of COUP-TFI, a patterning transcription factor expressed in a high-caudal-to-low-rostral gradient in hippocampal progenitors, in establishing the dorsal-ventral axis of the hippocampus in mice. The highest COUP-TFI expression in the hippocampal progenitors was observed in the caudal medial pallium that gives rise to the ventral hippocampus, and the lowest expression was found in rostral medial pallium that develops into the dorsal hippocampus. We generated mice with different levels of COUP-TFI expression in the cortex and performed a comprehensive analysis of subregion-specific gene expression across the entire hippocampus in these mice. The deletion of COUP-TFI resulted in an expansion of the dorsal hippocampus at the expense of the ventral hippocampus. Conversely, increased COUP-TFI expression led to the generation of ectopic ventral hippocampus in the dorsal compartments. We further demonstrated that COUP-TFI dose-dependently regulates Wnt signaling pathway, a crucial player in regulating hippocampus development. Together, our findings reveal a novel mechanism governing hippocampal development, in which COUP-TFI determines the fate of hippocampal subregions and balances the hippocampus into dorsal and ventral compartments.

                <p>by Siying Xie, Johannes Singer, Bati Yilmaz, Daniel Kaiser, Radoslaw M. Cichy</p>

The human brain orchestrates object vision through an interplay of feedforward processing in concert with recurrent processing. However, where, when, and how recurrent processing contributes to visual processing is incompletely understood due to the difficulties in teasing apart feedforward and recurrent processing. We combined a backward masking paradigm with multivariate analysis on EEG and fMRI data to isolate and characterize the nature of recurrent processing. We find that recurrent processing substantially shapes visual representations across the ventral visual stream, starting early on at around 100 ms in early visual cortex (EVC) and two later phases of around 175 and 300 ms in lateral occipital cortex (LOC), adding persistent rather than transient neural dynamics to visual processing. Using convolutional neural network models for comparison with the brain, we show that recurrence changes the feature format in LOC from predominantly mid-level to more high-level features. Finally, we show that recurrence is mediated by four distinct spectro-temporal neural components, which span the theta to beta frequency range. Together, our results reveal the nature and mechanisms of the effects of recurrent processing on the visual representations in the human brain.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3003336">Caudal fin shape imprinted during late zebrafish embryogenesis is re-patterned by SONIC hedgehog</a></h4>

Appendage shape is formed during development – and re-established during regeneration – according to spatial and temporal cues that orchestrate local cell behaviors. The caudal fin is the primary appendage used for propulsion in most fishes, and the organ exhibits a range of distinct morphologies adapted for different swimming strategies. Zebrafish caudal fins develop with a forked shape, with longer supportive bony rays at the periphery and shorter rays at the center of the external organ. Here, we show that inducing a transient pulse of <i>sonic hedgehog a (shha)</i> overexpression during late embryonic development leads to excess growth of the central rays, causing the adult caudal fin to grow into a triangular, truncate shape. Our results identify a period – prior to endogenous <i>shha</i> expression and before differentiation of skeletogenic cells in these tissues – during which the imprinted fin shape can be re-patterned by hyper-physiological Shh stimulation. After this critical developmental period, overexpression of <i>shha</i> does not alter the shape of the adult caudal fin. Both global and local ectopic <i>shha</i> overexpression during the critical window of embryogenesis are sufficient to alter the adult fin shape, and a normal forked shape can be rescued by subsequent treatment with an antagonist of the canonical Shh pathway. The early pulse of <i>shha</i> expands <i>hox13</i> expression domains in the fin primordium, and leads to excessive proliferation in the central regions of the fin. After developing with a truncate shape, the truncate morphology was remembered and rebuilt during regeneration, suggesting that the shape imprinted during embryogenesis informs both development and regenerative morphogenesis. Ray-finned fishes have evolved a wide spectrum of caudal morphologies, and the current work offers insights into the developmental time periods and processes that inform growth and ultimate shape of the fin.

     alt="The Ventral Tectal Longitudinal Column: A Midbrain Nucleus for Modulation of Auditory Processing in the Cochlear Nucleus, Superior Olivary Complex, and Inferior Colliculus"/>
<p>The ventral tectal longitudinal column (TLCv) is a midbrain nucleus thought to provide multisensory modulation of acoustic processing via descending projections to the superior olivary complex. We discovered additional projections from the TLCv to the cochlear nucleus and to the inferior colliculus. These projections are much broader than those described previously, suggesting that the TLCv could exert modulation over a wide expanse of the auditory brainstem.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>A ventral tectal longitudinal column (TLCv) has been described in rats and is hypothesized to provide multisensory modulation of acoustic processing in the superior olivary complex. The TLCv is a column of cells in the dorsomedial tectum extending rostro-caudally through the inferior and superior colliculi. It receives ascending auditory input and projects to the superior olivary complex. Further insight into TLCv function has been hampered by limited information on its connections. Here, we provide evidence that a TLCv is recognizable in mice and that it has more extensive connections than previously believed. Deposit of retrograde tracer into the superior olivary complex labels cells bilaterally in the TLCv, comparable to results seen in rats. Viral labeling of neuronal projections demonstrates input to the TLCv from the superior olivary complex and from the inferior colliculus. Thus, the TLCv in mice has inputs and outputs similar to those described in rats. Additional experiments with retrograde tracers revealed more extensive outputs from the TLCv. Neurons in the TLCv are labeled after the deposition of retrograde tracers into the cochlear nucleus or into the inferior colliculus. The projections from the TLCv to these targets, like those to the superior olivary complex, are bilateral. These projections are much broader than those described previously. The results suggest that the TLCv could exert modulation over a wide expanse of the auditory brainstem, from the cochlear nucleus through the inferior colliculus.</p>

     alt="Distribution of Serotonergic Transporter Innervation in the Nucleus Accumbens and Ventral Pallidum Is Highly Conserved Among Primates"/>
<p>We quantified serotonin transporter (SERT) axon length density in the reward pathway of 13 primate species. Serotonergic innervation density within both the nucleus accumbens and ventral pallidum is highly conserved among species, in contrast to our previous findings of human-specific differences in dopaminergic and neuropeptide Y innervation.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The nucleus accumbens (NAcc) and ventral pallidum (VP) are key nodes in the mesolimbic reward pathway that facilitate stimulus salience, including the regulation of social motivation and attachment. Primate species display variation in social behaviors, including different levels of impulsivity, bonding, and aggression. Previous research has implicated neuromodulation of the reward pathway in the differential expression of various social behaviors, suggesting that differences in neurotransmitter innervation may play a role in species-specific patterns. To explore this, we examined serotonergic innervation in the NAcc and VP among primates. We used stereology to quantify serotonin transporter-immunoreactive (SERT-ir) axon length density in the NAcc and VP of 13 primate species, including humans, great apes, and cercopithecid and platyrrhine monkeys. Our data show that serotonergic innervation density within both the NAcc and VP is highly conserved among species. This finding contrasts with our previous findings of higher levels of SERT-ir axons in the dorsal striatum of humans and great apes relative to monkeys, a human-specific increase in dopaminergic innervation within the NAcc and VP, and a human-specific increase of neuropeptide Y in the NAcc, highlighting the mosaic nature of innervation patterns among species.</p>

     alt="Interrelationship Between Intraepithelial Nerve Endings and Epithelial Cells in the Rat Epiglottis Revealed by Array Tomography With Scanning Electron Microscopy"/>
<p>Two types of intraepithelial nerve endings were observed in the epiglottis, i.e., thin nerve fibers/endings with varicosities and terminal swelling and ramified nerve ending consisted of a branched parent axon and large terminal parts. Both nerve endings were closely attached with epithelial cells.

<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Nerve endings in the laryngeal mucosa interact with epithelial cells to generate sensory discharges against various external stimuli. In the present study, we performed array tomography with scanning electron microscopy to examine the morphological interrelationship between intraepithelial nerve endings and epithelial cells in the rat epiglottis. In the epiglottic mucosa, thin nerve fibers/endings and ramified nerve endings were observed in the epithelial layer. Thin nerve fibers/endings had varicosities and terminal swellings, and ran in the shallow grooves of epithelial cells. The varicosities and terminal regions of the nerve fibers/endings were partially associated with epithelial cells, without any identifiable cell junctions or synaptic specializations. On the other hand, intraepithelial ramified nerve endings were detected in the stratified cuboidal epithelium at the base of the epiglottis. The ramified nerve ending consisted of a branched parent axon and large terminal parts that were approximately 3–6 µm in major axis length with irregular contours. The terminal parts of the ramified endings containing numerous mitochondria were closely attached to epithelial cells, as observed in the thin nerve fibers/endings. In conclusion, intraepithelial nerve endings in the epiglottis were in close contact with laryngeal epithelial cells and may be excited by mediators released from epithelial cells in response to various stimuli from the laryngeal lumen.</p>

">Electrical coupling within thalamocortical networks cumulatively reduces cortical correlation to sensory inputs</a></h4>

              
                Thalamocortical (TC) cells relay sensory information to the cortex, as well as driving their own feedback inhibition through collateral excitation of the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN). The GABAergic cells of the TRN are extensively coupled through electrical synapses. While electrical synapses are most often noted for their roles in synchronizing rhythmic forms of neuronal activity, they are also positioned to modulate responses to transient information flow across and throughout the brain, although this effect is seldom explored. Here we sought to understand how electrical synapses embedded within a network of TRN neurons regulate the processing of ongoing sensory inputs during relay from thalamus to cortex. We used Hodgkin-Huxley point models to construct a network of a 9 TC and 9 TRN cells, with one cortical output neuron summing the TC activity. Each pair of TC and TRN cells was reciprocally coupled by chemical synapses. TRN cells were each electrically coupled to two neighboring cells, forming a ring topology. TC cells received synaptic inputs in sequence, with intervals between inputs varying from 10 to 50 ms across simulations. This architecture and sequence of inputs allowed us to assess the functional radius of an electrical synapse by comparing the cumulative effects of each additional TRN electrical synapse on the responses of the TRN and TC cells and the cortical output. Effects of electrical synapses on TRN cell activity were strongest for smaller intervals between inputs, and cumulative with additional synapses. In contrast, effects in TC neurons were strongest for larger intervals between inputs and also increased with coupling strength. Coupling within TRN modulated cortical integration of TC inputs by unexpectedly increasing response rates, duration and reducing spike correlation to the input sequence that was presented to the TC layer. Thus, embedded TRN electrical synapses exert powerful influence on thalamocortical relay, in a cumulative manner. These results highlight the multi-synaptic influences of electrically coupled cells and reinforce that they should be included in more complex and realistic networks of the brain.

">Circuits activated by psychiatric-associated behavior: from brain-wide labeling to regional assessment using Psych-TRAP.</a></h4>

              
                Background: Neuropsychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia and autism, affect a substantial portion of the global population, 1 in 8 individuals. Genetic risk factors have been the major contribution to neuropsychiatric disorders; however, there is limited knowledge of how risk factors lead to brain circuit impairment and neuropsychiatric phenotypes. Rationale: Understanding how risk factors impact brain circuitry in the whole brain level at cellular resolution and their connection to neuropsychiatric phenotypes should help develop specific drug targets and therapeutics targeting precisely the affected cell types and circuits. Methods: We employ a clinically relevant mouse model of one of the major neuropsychiatric genetic risk factors - microdeletion in the 15q13.3 locus. Using the model, we developed a novel technique, Psych-TRAP, to label psychiatric behavior-associated circuits at whole brain level and at cellular level. We validated the genetic mouse model with clinical phenotypes and labelled transiently active cells, using TRAP2, and quantified cell densities in the whole brain using an automated pipeline, ABBA. This is the first ever approach to validate a triple transgenic mouse line with psychiatric microdeletion and understanding the cellular activation pattern and differential recruitment of cells immediately after a psychiatric-like behavior. Key findings: Further, we validated Psych-TRAP by understanding the activation of cells in already known brain areas and novel brain areas and confirmed no direct involvement of non-neuronal cells right after 3-chmabered social interaction (3-CSI). Lastly, we discovered the involvement of a dominant GABAergic component in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), mainly mediated by reelin positive (REL+) neurons and by somatostatin positive (SST+) neurons in the primary somatosensory area-trunk (SSp-tr), in mice harboring 15q13.3 microdeletion. Future implications: Thus, Psych-TRAP is a robust technique to generate mice line with disrupted copy-number variations, label transiently active cells permanently for future circuit manipulations in an unbiased manner and reveal the underlying molecular markers mediating psychiatric behaviors. This can be extended further to understand the molecular mechanisms of active cells from a particular brain area, identified from Psych-TRAP, using spatial transcriptomics and promises a potential technique for translation research targeting specific manifestations.

">Independence and Coherence in Temporal Sequence Computation across the Fronto-Parietal Network</a></h4>

              
                Time processing requires distributed and coordinated cortical dynamics. Flexible yet robust temporal representations can arise from two distinct computational modes: a coherence mode, where multiple cortical areas hold the same elapsed-time estimate, and an independence mode, where each area maintains its own local estimate. However, how the brain switches between these modes has remained unknown. Using mesoscale two-photon calcium imaging, we simultaneously recorded neuronal populations in the secondary motor cortex (M2) and posterior parietal cortex (PPC) of mice performing a novel alternating-interval timing task. Both areas encoded elapsed time through similar high-dimensional sequential activity. Decoding analyses revealed that the fronto-parietal network has both independent and coherent temporal codes. Communication-subspace analysis showed that temporal information was distributed across multiple low-variance subspaces, whereas the largest subspace preferentially encoded behaviour. A twin recurrent neural network (RNN) model with sparse inter-RNN connections and shared high-variance noise reproduced these experimental findings. Moreover, perturbations applied along the dominant shared subspace paradoxically enhanced independence between the two networks. Through a mathematical formalization based on the local Lyapunov exponents, we uncovered how perturbations along different subspaces selectively evoke either independent or coherent communication mode. Together, these results reveal a principle by which fronto-parietal circuits achieve robust yet flexible computation through the interplay of sparse coupling and shared global fluctuations.

">Longitudinal Associations Between Screen Time, Brain Development, and Language Outcomes in Early Childhood</a></h4>

              
                Language development during toddlerhood is supported by both neurobiological maturation and environmental experiences. It relies on reciprocal interaction, and excessive screen time exposure may have a negative impact. In the current study, we investigated how screen time at age two relates to language outcomes and brain development at ages two and three. Seventy toddlers underwent MRI scanning and neurodevelopmental testing, and brain volumes in language-related areas were extracted. Structural equation modelling showed that at age two, there was a negative relationship between screen time and pars triangularis volumes. Importantly, smaller volumes at age two predicted greater screen time usage at age three, mediated by poorer language outcomes. These results suggest that over time, children with smaller volumes and weaker language skills at age 2 became more likely to rely on screens at age 3, suggesting that early vulnerabilities amplify later screen use, highlighting the sensitivity of language networks to environmental input and the potential for screen exposure to alter developmental trajectories.

">Thalamo-insular pathway regulates tic generation via motor-limbic crosstalk</a></h4>

              
                Tic disorders accompanied by premonitory urges are the hallmark symptoms of Tourette syndrome (TS), but the neuronal mechanism remains unsolved. Here, we show that striatal disinhibition induces motor tics in mice. This model exhibits c-Fos activation in both motor and limbic structures, such as the insular cortex (IC). Viral tracing demonstrates that aberrant striatal activity is ultimately transmitted to the insular cortex via the intralaminar thalamic nuclei, a potential target of deep brain stimulation in TS patients. We further identify tic-associated activity in the IC as well as the primary motor cortex (M1). Chemogenetic inhibition of the thalamo-insular pathway suppresses M1 synchronization and alleviates tic-like behaviors. These findings reveal motor-limbic circuit dysfunction as a key mechanism underlying tic disorders.

">Pigs' brain responses to stroking after long-term positive human interactions: An fMRI exploratory study</a></h4>

              
                Positive interactions with humans can induce pleasurable experiences in animals, but their underlying neurobiology mechanisms are unknown. We investigated the brain responses (Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging) to stroking by a human in 20 pigs under general anaesthesia. Ten pigs received positive human contacts over 9 weeks post-weaning (POS) and 10 pigs did not (CTL). Images from CTL pigs showed peaks of activation in the primary somatosensory cortex, caudate nucleus, anterior prefrontal cortex, and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex during stroking. Greater peaks of activation in the anterior prefrontal, ventral anterior cingulate, primary somatosensory and somatosensory association cortices were observed in POS pigs; whereas greater peaks of activation in the amygdala were observed in CTL pigs. Therefore, stroking is perceived and possibly elicited positive emotions in anesthetised pigs, and it may be perceived as more pleasant by experienced pigs than naive pigs, which may rather perceive it as a novel stimulus.

">Similar destabilization of neural dynamics under different general anesthetics</a></h4>

              
                Different classes of anesthetics can induce unconsciousness despite acting through distinct biological mechanisms. This raises the possibility that they produce a convergent effect on the dynamics or temporal evolution of neural population activity. To explore this, we analyzed intracortical electrophysiological recordings during infusions of propofol, ketamine, and dexmedetomidine, using a rigorous method to estimate dynamical stability. We found that all three anesthetics, despite their molecular differences, similarly affect cortical states by destabilizing their dynamics. This destabilization matched the slower recovery from sensory perturbations and longer stimulus-induced autocorrelation times observed during the anesthetic infusions. The destabilization was also reflected predominantly in lower-frequency ranges, linking it to the well-known increase in low-frequency power during anesthesia. Finally, destabilization closely tracked real-time fluctuations in consciousness. Together, these findings suggest that cortical destabilization may be a shared neural correlate of anesthetic-induced unconsciousness, offering a mechanistic explanation for low-frequency oscillations observed during anesthesia.

">Modeling 3D Mesoscaled Neuronal Complexity through Learning-based Dynamic Morphometric Convolution</a></h4>

              
                Accurate reconstruction of neuronal morphology from three-dimensional (3D) light microscopy is fundamental to neuroscience. Nevertheless, neuronal arbors intrinsically exhibit slender, tortuous geometries with high orientation variability, posing significant challenges for standard 3D convolutions whose static, axis-aligned receptive fields lack adaptability to such complex morphology. To address this, we propose the Dynamic Morph-Aware Convolution (DMAC) framework, which incorporates inherent geometric priors into convolution by jointly adapting both the shape and orientation of the kernel. This enables morphology-aware feature extraction tailored to arborized and variably oriented neuronal trajectories. Specifically, we first apply dynamic tubular convolutions to bridge the structural mismatch between isotropic convolution kernels and the slender morphology of neurons. To sufficiently accommodate the 3D orientation variability of neuronal branches, we further introduce a rotation mechanism that dynamically reorients the tubular kernel via two learnable angles (elevation and azimuth), enabling precise alignment with local neuronal directions. We validate our method through extensive experiments on four mesoscaled neuronal imaging datasets, including two from the BigNeuron project (Drosophila and Mouse) and two additional benchmarks (NeuroFly and CWMBS). Our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving average improvements of 5.4% in Entire Structure Average (ESA), 6.9% in Different Structure Average (DSA), and 7.5% in Percentage of Different Structure (PDS). These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed DMAC in capturing complex morphological variations and enhancing structural fidelity across diverse mesoscaled neuronal morphologies.

">M5 positive allosteric modulation alleviates parkinsonian motor deficits</a></h4>

              
                Parkinsons disease is a neurodegenerative movement disorder which is characterized by cardinal motor symptoms of tremor at rest, rigidity, bradykineasia, and postural instability. Underlying these cardinal motor symptoms is thought to be death and dysfunction of nigrostriatal dopamine neurons, and the gold-standard treatment of Parkinsons disease is dopamine replacement therapy with the dopamine precursor L-DOPA. While efficacious, L-DOPA does not treat all motor symptoms and can have serious treatment-related side effects called L-DOPA induced dyskinesias, indicating an immense need for new targets to modulate dopaminergic function for anti-parkinsonian efficacy. One such potential target is the M5 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor, which has a unique expression profile where it is selectively expressed in midbrain dopaminergic neurons and their terminals in the striatum, and previous studies have indicated that M5 can modulate dopamine release and patterning of firing of dopamine neurons. Given this unique expression profile and function of M5, this receptor has an untested potential to modulate parkinsonian motor phenotypes. To test the potential for M5 to modulate Parkinsonian-like motor deficits and dyskinesia, we employed the unilateral 6-OHDA lesioned mouse model to create a hemi-parkinsonian state. Using multiple behavioral assays, including the cylinder test, forepaw adjusting steps assay, and in the Erasmus ladder, in conjunction with prototypical M5 pharmacological tool compounds, we investigated the ability of M5 to modulate parkinsonian motor deficits. Additionally, we tested the ability of M5 to modulate established L-DOPA induced dyskinesia or cause dyskinesia on its own. Overall, we found that M5 PAM alleviates forepaw asymmetry, bradykinesia, and spatial aspects of gait in the Erasmus ladder. Excitingly, M5 PAM does not cause robust dyskinesia, does not affect already established L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia, and does not affect L-DOPA motor efficacy. Taken together with previous findings, the current study suggests that M5 receptors are an exciting novel therapeutic strategy for ameliorating parkinsonian motor deficits even in late-stage models of severe PD without lessening L-DOPAs motor benefit and without affecting existing symptoms of L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia.

">Hippocampal theta sweeps indicate goal direction</a></h4>

              
                Successful spatial navigation requires rapid evaluation of potential future trajectories. Hippocampal "theta sweeps", sequential activation of place cells within individual theta cycles, exhibit predictive dynamics within the ideal timeframe to fulfill this role. However, whether these sequences simply reflect movement-related variables or afford more cognitive goal-directed planning remains unresolved. Using data from a navigation task on the "Honeycomb" maze that allows dissociation of head-, movement- and goal-direction correlates, we found that hippocampal theta sweeps exhibit robust goal-oriented directional biases, independent of movement- or head-direction. An existing model of theta sweeps, with an additional goal-oriented directional input, reproduces these findings and predicts goal-oriented theta phase precession, which we confirm empirically. Replay events during immobility-related sharp wave/ripples are also goal-directed, and therefore more aligned with theta sweeps than experience. Our findings indicate that hippocampal theta sweeps provide a neural substrate for online goal-directed spatial planning.

">Determining perception thresholds of young adults to small continuous moving platform perturbations</a></h4>

              
                Detecting external disturbances is vital for maintaining balance, as corrective actions are initiated to prevent falls. Quantifying people's ability to perceive such disturbances improves our understanding of how balance is maintained. This study aims to: 1) quantify healthy young adults' ability to perceive external perturbations while balancing on a stabilometer, and 2) understand the relationship between balance performance and perturbation magnitude relative to participants' perception threshold. Participants (n=22; 20-35 years) completed a multiple staircase protocol. While standing on a stabilometer mounted on a moving platform, they attempted to keep it horizontal during 10-second trials with small continuous perturbations. After each trial, participants were asked whether they perceived the platform movement. Perturbation magnitudes were adjusted for the next trial based on their response. This process continued for each staircase until the termination criteria were met, at which point participants' individual perception threshold was determined. Participants then performed ten 40-second trials on the stabilometer, two trials in each condition: without perturbation, perturbation at the 100%, 80%, and 50% of the individual's perception threshold, and the pilot study's minimum threshold. Balance performance was defined as time-in-balance ratio and RMS deviation angle from horizontal. Perception thresholds varied significantly between participants individuals, with an RMS acceleration ranging from 2.67 and 12.80 cm/s^2. The results showed that perturbation magnitude has a significant correlation with variability in deviation angle (R=0.24, p=0.0038). The results suggest that some participants can perceive very small perturbations during a challenging balance task. Subthreshold perturbations, although very small, can influence balance performance.

">A fast and child-friendly localizer for the identification of ITG-math based on its preference for mathematical processing</a></h4>

              
                The visual number form area (here referred to as ITG-math) has gained recent attention as a neural substrate of mathematical cognition. However, research on this region has been hindered by difficulties identifying it and its precise function hence remains debated. THere we aimed to: 1) Provide an efficient and child-friendly localizer for the region and 2) explore the impact of different tasks and stimuli on its responses. In the developed localizer, participants are presented with digits and UFOs, while performing a 1-back task either on stimulus numerosity or on stimulus color. We collected two sessions of the localizer from 17 healthy adults. From the localizer data, we could identify ITG-math based on higher responses in the numerosity than the color task in 92% of the participants, whereas contrasting digits with UFOs lead to selective responses in only 32% of the participants. Accordingly, in independent data, ITG-math showed a task preference, but no stimulus preference. Multivariate analyses further revealed task encoding, and a combination of task and stimulus encoding, in the left and right ITG-math, respectively. Our work facilitates further research on ITG-math and suggests that the role of ITG-math in mathematical cognition goes beyond the visual encoding of digits.

">Temporal constraints of conscious tactile perception in the primary somatosensory cortex</a></h4>

              
                The primary somatosensory cortex (S1) has long been implicated in tactile perception, yet its precise role in conscious tactile detection remains uncertain. The current study investigated the causal and time-specific involvement of S1 in tactile detection using single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (spTMS). In two experiments, spTMS was applied over contralateral S1, an active control site (inferior parietal lobe; IPL), or under a sham condition at short (25 & 75 ms; Experiment 1) and longer (130 ms; Experiment 2) intervals following electrotactile stimulation of the finger. Participants performed a go/no-go detection task at sensory threshold. In Experiment 1, tactile sensitivity was significantly reduced following early S1 stimulation compared to both active control and sham conditions. However, no such effect was observed in Experiment 2, indicating a temporally limited role of S1 in conscious detection. Moreover, self-reported TMS-related distraction ratings did not account for the observed sensitivity differences, suggesting sensitivity-specific modulation by early TMS rather than general task disruption. These findings support a causal role for early S1 activity in conscious tactile detection. We propose that disruption at this early stage interferes with the initial encoding of tactile input, thereby attenuating not only immediate perceptual awareness, but also subsequent functions such as discrimination and retention. Overall, the results underscore the constrained role of S1 in conscious stimulus detection and highlight the importance of neural networks beyond S1.

">Neural voice activity detection with high-gamma ECoG signal correlation structure using a chronically implanted brain-computer interface in an individual with ALS</a></h4>

              
                Chronically implanted brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) for speech decoding hold promise for individuals with severe motor impairment. A key translational challenge to wider adoption is understanding and mitigating long-term neural signal variability. This study evaluated whether correlation-based features of electrocorticographic (ECoG) high-gamma signals (HG-C) provide greater long-term stability and robustness than high-gamma log-power (HGLP) features for neural voice activity detection (NVAD). We analyzed an open-source dataset from Angrick et al. [1] of an individual with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis performing a syllable repetition task. Long short-term memory (LSTM) models were trained on HGLP or HG-C features and evaluated across sessions separated from training by up to six months. Feature importance was estimated with permutation-based marginal effects analysis and robustness was tested by simulated electrode disconnections. HG-C achieved comparable to superior NVAD performance, with reduced temporal degradation (-8% vs. -23% F1 score decline). HG-C models leveraged distributed correlation structure and remained stable under both random and systematic electrode disconnections. These findings support HG-C as a candidate neural signal representation for speech BCIs which require long-term stability and robustness while maintaining ease of use for users and caregivers.

">AETA peptide drives Alzheimer's disease signature of synapse dysfunction</a></h4>

              
                INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD), the leading cause of dementia, is marked by early synaptic dysfunction preceding cognitive decline. While amyloid-{beta} ; and Tau remain central to AD research, other pathogenic factors are emerging. We investigated AETA, a novel amyloid precursor protein (APP)-derived peptide, as a mediator of synaptic pathology. METHODS: AETA levels were measured in human AD brains, and the AETA-m mouse model expressing secreted human AETA was assessed at molecular, functional, and behavioral levels for AD-like phenotypes. RESULTS: AETA was significantly elevated in AD brains, especially in females. AETA-m mice displayed hippocampal synaptic gene expression patterns resembling vulnerable human AD regions, disrupted NMDA receptor signaling, dendritic spine loss, and mild hippocampal memory impairments, particularly in females, reflecting prodromal AD pathology. DISCUSSION: These findings identify AETA as an additional driver of synaptic dysfunction and suggest its potential as a therapeutic target for early intervention in AD.

">An emergent disease-associated motor neuron state precedes cell death in a mouse model of ALS</a></h4>

              
                To uncover molecular determinants of motor neuron degeneration and selective vulnerability in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), we generated longitudinal single-nucleus transcriptomes and chromatin accessibility profiles of spinal motor neurons from the SOD1-G93A ALS mouse model. Vulnerable alpha motor neurons showed thousands of molecular changes, marking a transition into a novel cell state we named 'disease-associated motor neurons' (DAMNs). We identified transcription factor regulatory networks that govern how healthy cells transition into DAMNs as well as those linked to vulnerable and resistant motor neuron subtypes. Using spatial transcriptomics, we found reactive glia located near motor neurons early in disease, suggesting early signaling events between motor neurons and glia. Finally, we found that the human orthologs of genomic regions with differential accessibility in SOD1-G93A alpha motor neurons are enriched for single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with human ALS, providing evidence that the genetic underpinnings of motor neuron vulnerability are conserved.

">Metformin decreases RAN proteins, rescues splicing abnormalities and improves behavioral phenotypes in SCA8 BAC mice</a></h4>

              
                Spinocerebellar ataxia type 8 is one member of a larger group of dominantly inherited, debilitating neurological diseases caused by CTG*CAG expansions for which there are no effective disease-targeting treatments. RAN translation, which was discovered in SCA8, has previously been shown to occur across CAG and CUG expansion transcripts, making treatments that work for SCA8 potentially relevant to a much broader group of diseases, including SCA1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 12, Huntington's Disease (HD) Fuch's endothelial corneal dystrophy (FECD), and myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1). The FDA-approved drug, metformin, has been previously shown to reduce RAN protein levels in cells overexpressing SCA8 CAG repeats. Here we show, using SCA8 BAC transgenic mice, that metformin treatment improves ambulatory performance, including rotarod, DigiGait, and open field measures. At the molecular level, metformin-treated mice show reduced RAN protein levels and improved splicing abnormalities without changing the levels of the expanded RNAs. Metformin-treated mice also show decreased neuroinflammation with reduced levels of astrogliosis and reduced numbers of activated microglia. Taken together, these data provide strong support for testing FDA-approved metformin in clinical trials for SCA8 and potentially the broader group of CAG*CTG repeat expansion disorders.

">Remote magnetomechanical neuromodulation uncovers a novel therapeutic mechanism for alleviating Parkinsonian symptoms in freely moving mice</a></h4>

              
                To overcome the limitations of invasive neuromodulation systems, we introduce a wireless magnetomechanical approach for remote, minimally invasive deep brain stimulation (DBS) without chronically implanted electrodes. This method leverages biocompatible nanoscale magnetite nanodiscs (MNDs) with ground vortex magnetisation, which undergo in-plane transitions under low-frequency alternating magnetic fields, thereby generating localised piconewton-scale torques. These torques engage endogenous mechanosensory pathways to modulate neural activity, enabling reversible stimulation without the need for genetic modifications. Calcium imaging validated the rapid neuromodulatory effects of MNDs in vitro and ex vivo, which motivated the subsequent application of magnetomechanical DBS to the subthalamic nucleus in mice. We demonstrated the remote control of motor behaviour in wild-type mice and significant restoration of motor function in a severe hemiparkinsonian model. This study established the first wireless therapeutic magnetomechanical neuromodulation platform that leverages biocompatible nanomaterials and endogenous mechanosensory ion channels, representing a promising step toward untethered, clinically translatable neurotechnology.

">Investigating Neural Correlates of Emotional Regulation as a Function of Age, Race, and Socioeconomic Status</a></h4>

              
                Older adults often show improved emotional regulation with age, a phenomenon known as the aging paradox. This age-related increase in emotional regulation capacity is attributed to enhanced prefrontal cortex control over amygdala reactivity. However, because racial discrimination and economic disadvantage cause chronic stress, typical age-related neural associations may be altered in marginalized groups. Using task-functional MRI data from 8,711 UK Biobank participants aged 50-78, we investigated whether age-related associations in emotion-related brain function, specifically amygdala activation and vmPFC-amygdala connectivity, varied across racial and socioeconomic status (SES) groups. We found that older age was associated with decreased amygdala activation, which is consistent with improved emotional regulation. Yet, lower socioeconomic status was associated with increased amygdala activation, suggesting heightened stress-related reactivity. No significant age-related effects on vmPFC-amygdala connectivity were observed at the population level. Black participants showed a stronger age-related decline in functional connectivity compared to other racial groups. These findings call for more inclusive and diverse neuroimaging studies to better understand brain health across marginalized groups.

">Connectomics Reveals a Feed-Forward Swallowing Circuit Driving Protein Appetite</a></h4>

              
                Nutrient state shapes not only what animals eat, but how they eat it. In Drosophila, protein deprivation prolongs protein-specific feeding bursts, yet the motor mechanism underlying this change remains unknown. Using EM connectomics, we identified a feed-forward pathway from protein-sensitive gustatory receptor neurons to swallowing motor neurons. At its core is the Sustain neuron, which coordinates multiple swallowing motor neurons to move food efficiently through the cibarium and pharynx. This nutrient-dependent facilitation of swallowing sustains long feeding bursts, directly linking internal state to the temporal structure of feeding. Our findings reveal how a dedicated sensorimotor circuit translates physiological need into precise motor control to drive nutrient specific feeding appetite.

">From Sensory Detection to Motor Action: The Comprehensive Drosophila Taste-Feeding Connectome</a></h4>

              
                In Drosophila, the gustatory system is distributed across multiple body parts and tightly couples sensory input to value-based behaviors such as feeding, foraging, and social interactions. Despite this, it has remained one of the least mapped sensory modalities at the EM connectome level. Here, we present the first complete wiring diagram of the adult gustatory system, comprehensively reconstructing gustatory receptor neurons (GRNs) from all peripheral organs in a contiguous EM volume spanning brain, cervical connective, and ventral nerve cord. By integrating this male dataset with existing female and male datasets, we generate a pan-CNS, cross-sex connectome, identify GRN types and subtypes via connectivity-based clustering, assign molecular identities, and uncover sexually dimorphic circuits. We also map all feeding motor neurons and trace how GRN pathways connect to motor and endocrine targets. Using computational approaches, we predict how sensory input is transformed into feeding, foraging, ingestion, and social behaviors, as well as feedforward neuroendocrine regulation. This defines the action space of the gustatory system and provides a unique framework for understanding how internal states shape taste-driven decisions.

">PARP activity is essential for retinal photoreceptor survival in the human homologous RhoI255del mouse model for autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa</a></h4>

              
                Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP) is a group of rare, inherited, neurodegenerative diseases of the retina that primarily affect rod photoreceptors. The initial loss of rods is followed by a secondary cone photoreceptor degeneration and eventually legal blindness. Despite several attempts, RP still remains essentially untreatable. In recent years, inhibition of poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase (PARP) has been proposed as a potential therapeutic strategy of autosomal-recessive RP, based on promising work in preclinical animal models. However, the effects of PARP inhibitors in autosomal-dominant RP are still largely unknown. Here, we employed a novel, human-homologous rhodopsin-mutant RhoI255del/+ mouse model for autosomal dominant RP to assess the impact of different PARP inhibitors on the progression of photoreceptor degeneration. The PARP inhibitors used--olaparib, saruparib, INO1001, and nicotinamide--target different PARP isoforms, and their potentially differential effects were evaluated in organotypic retinal explants cultivated under entirely defined conditions. Readouts comprised in situ activity assays for PARP and calpain-type proteases, the TUNEL assay for cell death, as well as immunostaining for activated calpain-2, activated caspase-3, rhodopsin, and cone arrestin-3. Unexpectedly, and in contrast to previous findings in animal models for recessive RP, all of the included PARP inhibitors led to a marked and dose-dependent rod photoreceptor toxicity in the RhoI255del model for dominant RP. Furthermore, this effect appeared to be independent of rhodopsin expression. On the other hand, both cone photoreceptors and inner retinal neurons were apparently unaffected by PARP inhibition. The present study thus demonstrates the importance of PARP activity for rod photoreceptor viability in a dominant rhodopsin mutant, highlights the need for a deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying photoreceptor degeneration in different RP forms, and cautions against the indiscriminate use of PARP inhibitors for the treatment of RP.

                Recent advances in neuroscience enable recording neuronal signals across hundreds of channels while subjects perform complex tasks involving multiple stimulus dimensions. In this study, we developed a novel encode-decode-classify framework employing a gated recurrent variational autoencoder (VAE) to decode decision-making processes from over 300 simultaneously recorded neuronal channels in the prefrontal cortex and basal ganglia of monkeys performing a multidimensional feature-learning task. Using hierarchical stratified sampling and balanced accuracy, we trained and evaluated the model's ability to predict behavioral choices based on neuronal population dynamics. The results revealed distinct neural coding roles, with anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) channels encoding decision variables collectively and prefrontal cortex (PFC) channels contributing individually to decoding accuracy. This approach demonstrated decoding accuracy for decisions in multi-dimensional feature space that is comparable to single-label decoding accuracy for lower dimensional problems, highlighting the potential of machine learning frameworks to capture complex spatiotemporal neuronal interactions involved in multidimensional cognitive behaviors.

">Protease-activated receptor 1-mediated matrix metalloprotease signalling in sensory neurons</a></h4>

              
                Visceral pain is a prevalent and debilitating symptom of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, current pain therapies are often ineffective, raising the possibility that novel disease mediators might be contributing to pain during inflammation. Our study provides new insights into how matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which are elevated in IBD, stimulate sensory neurons. We demonstrate that MMP3, MMP8, and MMP9 induce intracellular Ca2+ release in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons through activation of protease-activated receptor 1 (PAR1) and subsequent activation of phospholipase C (PLC). Characterisation of the neuronal populations stimulated by these MMPs suggests that a subset is likely nociceptive. In contrast, MMP2 and MMP13, although capable of cleaving PAR1 in other cell types, do not induce Ca2+ mobilisation in DRG neurons. Interestingly, pre-treatment with MMP2 or MMP13 reduces the neuronal response to MMP3 or PAR1 agonist, suggesting that MMP2 and MMP13 act on PAR1 in a manner which prevents further activation. Additionally, MMP10 induces Ca2+ mobilisation in DRG neurons but through a PAR1-independent mechanism. These findings uncover a previously unrecognised role for MMP signalling in sensory neurons, highlighting a potential mechanism by which MMPs could contribute to the pro-nociceptive environment in the inflamed bowel.

">Impaired Sensory Gating During Standing Balance in Parkinson's Disease</a></h4>

              
                While motor deficits in Parkinson's disease (PD) are well-studied, the role of somatosensory processing in postural instability remains unclear. It is unknown whether sensory gating, a mechanism for filtering irrelevant sensory input, is impaired during standing balance in individuals with PD. To address this, we investigated cortical sensory processing in individuals with PD, age-matched older adults (OA), and young adults (YA) as they performed four balance tasks of increasing difficulty. We measured postural sway using a force platform and recorded somatosensory-evoked potentials (SEPs) from the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) following tibial nerve stimulation. Our results showed a clear dissociation between behavior and neurophysiology. Although postural sway was comparable between the PD and OA groups, only the OA and YA groups showed intact sensory gating, with SEP amplitudes decreasing as the balance challenge increased. In contrast, participants with PD demonstrated consistently elevated SEP amplitudes across all conditions. This study provides the first direct evidence of impaired sensory gating during standing balance in PD. These findings indicate a fundamental deficit in the cortical processing of sensory information essential for postural control. Consequently, they underscore the critical need for therapeutic interventions that target sensory integration deficits, not just motor symptoms.

">Dynamic expression of ASCL1 drives neurogenesis from infant and adult macaque Müller glia into immature retinal ganglion cells</a></h4>

              
                Strategies to stimulate the regeneration of neurons in the adult central nervous system can offer universal solutions for neurodegenerative diseases. Taking lessons from naturally regenerating species, such as the zebrafish, we have previously shown that vector-mediated expression of proneural transcription factors can stimulate neurogenesis from the resident Muller glia (MG) population in the adult mouse retina, both in vitro and in vivo. To bring this closer to translation, we now show that vector-mediated expression of the proneural transcription factor ASCL1 can reprogram adult macaque MG into functional neurons. To this end, we established purified MG cultures and show they retain a mature transcriptomic profile that correlates with foveal and peripheral MG. Importantly, MG-derived neurons express retinal ganglion cell markers, can fire action potentials and have a transcriptome that overlaps with developing human and adult macaque retinal ganglion cells. To refine this approach for clinical application, we incorporated microRNA-124 target sites in the reprogramming cassette and show that this restricts expression to MG in mixed primary cultures and intact explant cultures of adult macaque retina. Regulating ASCL1 expression with microRNA-124 target sites maintained the reprogramming efficiency from adult MG cultures and improved the yield of RGC-like neurons from infant MG cultures. Most importantly, with this vector cassette we successfully reprogrammed macaque MG from both adult and infant retina into HuC/D+ neurons. Our findings demonstrate that ASCL1 can induce neurogenesis from macaque MG across ages and provide a targeted, effective strategy for potential clinical translation in retinal repair.

">MiR-23b Neutralization In Brain Endothelium Promotes Blood-Brain Barrier Repair Through Wnt/Beta-catenin Dependent And Independent Mechanisms</a></h4>

              
                Objective: Disruption of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is an early and critical event in the pathogenesis of stroke and other central nervous system (CNS) disorders. Yet, therapeutic strategies to restore BBB integrity remain limited. Approach and Results: Using an unbiased anti-miR library screen, we identify miR-23b as a negative regulator of BBB integrity in brain endothelial cells (BECs). Targeted inhibition of miR-23b with anti-miR -23b in BECs enhances junction protein expression, suppresses transcellular transport, and improves barrier function via Wnt/{beta}-catenin-dependent and -independent mechanisms. In a 3D microfluidic model, anti-miR-23b accelerates vessel maturation, enhances resilience to ischemic injury, and facilitates BBB repair. AAVBR1-mediated delivery of anti-miR-23b to brain endothelium reduces BBB leakage, infarct volume, neurological deficits, and mortality in the rodent transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAo). Conclusion: Thus, miR-23b is a critical regulator of cerebrovascular integrity, and anti-miR-23b may be a promising novel RNA-based therapeutic to enhance BBB repair in stroke and other CNS disorders.

">Sequencing of distinct wing behaviors during Drosophila courtship</a></h4>

              
                Some behaviors, like biting followed by chewing and then swallowing, unfold in stereotyped sequences, while others, such as limb movements during defensive maneuvers, can be flexibly combined as needed. During courtship, male Drosophilid flies produce a series of actions, including orientation, tapping, singing, licking, and copulation, that follow an ordered but temporally variable sequence [1,2]. At shorter timescales, however, individual actions remain highly dynamic. For example, courtship songs are composed of variable sequences of distinct syllables, with their patterning and amplitude actively shaped by female cues [3-5]. Leveraging recent advances in behavioral quantification [6], we discover a new courtship wing behavior that we term "waggling", which is present across multiple Drosophila species and characterized by rhythmic, anti-phase wing movements. We identify an intermediate level of stereotyped behavioral structure: a directional three-part motif where males and females first decelerate to near-complete stillness, followed by male-initiated waggling, which then transitions into courtship song. Wing kinematics during waggle bouts are predictive of wing choice in subsequent songs, suggesting waggling may serve as a preparatory behavior. We then focus on P1/pC1 neurons, known to promote courtship [5,7-11]. Optogenetic activation of specific P1/pC1 neuron subsets in solitary males, without any female cues, is sufficient to recapitulate the entire stillness-to-waggling-to-singing progression. These findings reveal a new layer of stereotyped structure within a flexible courtship display and demonstrate that P1/pC1 neurons can orchestrate multi-action behavioral programs through internal dynamics.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Time-dependent features are present in many sensory stimuli. In the sensory cortices, timing features of stimuli are represented by spatial and temporal code. A potential mechanism by which cortical networks may perform temporal-to-spatial conversion is “reservoir computing.” The state of a recurrently-connected network, or a reservoir, represents current and prior inputs. In this experimental study, we determined whether the state of an isolated cortical network represents temporal information in the inputs. We used patterned optogenetic stimulation of dissociated primary rat cortical cultures. We delivered input sequences of patterns where one of the patterns occurred at different times in each sequence. The state of these experimental networks contained information about input sequences for at least a second, with at least 100-ms precision. Accurate classification required many neurons, suggesting that timing information was encoded via population code. Trajectory of the network state was largely determined by spatial features of the stimulus, with temporal features having a more subtle effect. The duration of spatial information retention was &gt; 2 s, similar to duration of short-term memory in the primary visual cortex. We concluded that local reservoir computation may be a plausible mechanism for temporal-to-spatial code conversion in sensory cortices.</span>

                <p>The interface barrier between the brain surface and the adjacent meninges is important for regulating exchanges of fluid, protein, and immune cells between the CNS and periphery. However, the cell types that form this important interface are not yet fully defined. To address this limitation, we used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and single-cell spatial transcriptomics together with morphological lineage tracing and immunostaining to describe the cell types forming the interface barrier of the adult murine cortex. We show that the cortical interface is composed of three major cell types, leptomeningeal cells, border astrocytes, and tissue-resident macrophages. On the nonparenchymal side, the interface is composed of transcriptionally distinct PDGFR&alpha;-positive leptomeningeal cells that are intermingled with macrophages. This leptomeningeal layer is lined by a population of transcriptionally distinct border astrocytes. The interface neighborhood is rich in growth factor mRNAs, including many leptomeningeal ligands predicted to act on both the border astrocytes and macrophages. On the CNS side of the interface is the relatively cell-sparse cortical layer 1 containing interneurons, microglia, parenchymal astrocytes, oligodendrocyte precursor cells, and oligodendrocytes. Except for the border astrocytes, layer 1 cells are not closely associated with the interface, suggesting that secreted ligands may be the major way the brain interface communicates with the underlying cortical parenchyma. Thus, our data provide a molecular/cellular resource describing the brain interface cell types and their interactions, thereby enabling future studies investigating how this distinct cellular compartment regulates CNS:periphery interactions.</p>

                <p>Autonomic imbalance&mdash;particularly reduced activity from brainstem parasympathetic cardiac vagal neurons (CVNs)&mdash;is a major characteristic of many cardiorespiratory diseases. Therapeutic approaches to selectively enhance CVN activity have been limited by the lack of defined, translationally relevant targets. Previous studies have identified an important excitatory synaptic pathway from oxytocin (OXT) neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus to brainstem CVNs, suggesting that OXT could provide a key selective excitation of CVNs. In clinical studies, intranasal OXT has been shown to increase parasympathetic cardiac activity, improve autonomic balance, and reduce obstructive event durations and oxygen desaturations in obstructive sleep apnea patients. However, the mechanisms by which activation of hypothalamic OXT neurons, or intranasal OXT, enhance brainstem parasympathetic cardiac activity remain unclear. CVNs are located in two cholinergic brainstem nuclei: nucleus ambiguus (NA) and dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus (DMNX). In this study, we characterize the colocalization of OXT receptors (OXTRs) in both CVNs and non-CVN cholinergic neurons in the male and female mouse NA and DMNX nuclei. We found that OXT receptors are highly expressed in CVNs in the DMNX, but not in the NA. OXT increases the firing of DMNX CVN, with no effect on NA CVNs. Selective chemogenetic excitation of OXTR+ CVNs in the DMNX&mdash;achieved by a combination of Cre- and flp-dependent DREADD expression&mdash;evoked a rapid and sustained bradycardia. These findings suggest that activation of DMNX CVNs expressing OXTR with oxytocin may represent a novel translational therapeutic target for restoring autonomic balance in cardiorespiratory disorders.</p>

Mathematical theory that accounts for the stochastic character of spike sequences of IP<sub>3</sub>-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> signalling calculates the probability distributions of the features of the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> time course, their moments and correlations. Including slow feedback from [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> to components of the pathway poses a challenge to stochastic modelling. Here, we present a stochastic model that takes this feedback into account, allows for a non-linear dependency of the open probability of the Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor channel (IP<sub>3</sub>R) on the feedback variable and the inclusion of more than one feedback with different relaxation time scales. We use this novel modelling approach to describe the effect of ER depletion by non-linear rate expressions for Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> release (CICR) and the measured non-linear IP<sub>3</sub>-dependency of the open probability as part of the dynamic feedback. Our theory can calculate spike amplitude distributions, correlation coefficients (C<sub>c</sub>) of interspike intervals (ISIs) and amplitudes, simulate ISI distributions and calculate their moments. We apply it to experiments with HEK293 cells. We find very good agreement between theoretical ISI distributions and their moments with experimental results. Many measured C<sub>c</sub>s show positive values in accordance with the ideas formulated by our theory. Surprisingly, most ISI-amplitude correlations are weak despite the decay of negative feedback during the ISI, which affects spike probability. We even find negative values of C<sub>c</sub>s, which indicate feedback that decreases the open probability of IP<sub>3</sub>R with increasing ISI. The components of the pathway causing this anticorrelation have not yet been identified. Our data suggest that they involve components that are subject to cell variability.

                <p>by Jiangang Shan, Jasper E. Hajonides, Nicholas E. Myers</p>

Recall of stimuli is biased by stimulus history, variously manifested as an attractive bias toward or repulsive bias from previous stimuli (i.e., serial dependence). It is unclear when attractive versus repulsive biases arise and if they share neural mechanisms. A recent model of attractive serial dependence proposes a two-stage process in which adaptation causes a repulsive bias during encoding that is later counteracted by an attractive bias at the decision-making stage in a Bayesian-inference-like manner. Neural evidence exists for a repulsive bias at encoding, but evidence for the attractive bias during the response period has been more elusive. We recently (Hajonides et al., J Neurosci 43:2730–40, 2023) showed in a working memory task that while different stimuli in trial history exerted different (attractive or repulsive) serial biases on behavioral reports, during encoding the neural representation of the current item was always repulsively biased. Here, we assessed whether this discrepancy between neural and behavioral effects is resolved during subsequent decision-making. Multivariate decoding of human magnetoencephalography data during working memory recall showed a neural distinction between attractive and repulsive biases that is consistent with the two-stage model: an attractive neural bias was found in recall period. And stimuli that created a repulsive bias on behavior led to an early repulsive neural bias that is likely to have already been incorporated during the encoding phase. The neural attractive bias late in the trial was replicated in an independent electroencephalogram experiment. Our results suggest that attractive (but not repulsive) serial dependence arises during decision-making, and that priors that influence post-perceptual decision-making are updated by the previous trial’s target, but not by other stimuli.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase inhibitors have shown promising results in treatment of plexiform neurofibromas in neurofibromatosis type 1 patients, but data in adults are limited. The aim of this phase 2 study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of trametinib in adults with neurofibromatosis type 1.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Thirty patients with a diagnosis of generalized or mosaic neurofibromatosis type 1 and a symptomatic inoperable plexiform neurofibroma were treated with 2mg trametinib per day. Primary outcome measures were partial response rate on tumor volume at cycle 12 and overall partial response rate. Partial response was defined as ≥20% decrease in tumor volume compared to baseline as measured with 3-dimensional volumetric analysis on magnetic resonance imaging every sixth cycle. Secondary outcome measures were pain, pain interference, quality of life, and toxicity.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Partial response rate after cycle 12 was 47% (n = 14/30). Overall partial response rate was 50% (n = 15/30). Median best response was −22% decrease of tumor volume (range: −63 to +7%), and median time until best response was 12 cycles (range: 6–42 cycles). Pain score and pain interference were significantly decreased after 12 cycles of treatment. No change in quality of life was reported. Acneiform rash and fatigue were the most reported adverse events. Overall rate of treatment discontinuation because of adverse events was 40%.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>We observed a positive effect of trametinib on tumor volume and significant pain reduction in adults with plexiform neurofibromas. However, adverse events are common and frequently led to early termination of treatment. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                Lueg et al. discovered that deregulated MYC increases cancer cell sensitivity to N-myristoyltransferase inhibitors (NMTis). Mitochondrial dysfunction upon NMTi occurs selectively in high-MYC contexts through impaired complex I via effects on the NMT substrate and complex I assembly factor NDUFAF4. An approach for targeting MYC-driven cancers is revealed.

They highlight therapeutic strategies targeting the matrix-nucleus axis by tuning matrix properties, mechano-priming cells, and targeting mechanosensitive molecules, providing a promising paradigm for disease treatment and tissue regeneration.

                Hahn et al. use male rhesus macaques as a model to characterize the immunological consequences of cross-sex estrogen therapy in primates. 17β-estradiol suppresses endogenous testosterone production, induces female physical traits, and following mRNA vaccination, leads to increased T cell activation and modulation of immune gene expression.

                Gancedo-Verdejo et al. reveal age-associated molecular changes in mouse hippocampus and an age-dependent effect of environmental enrichment, focusing on 3D chromatin structure and gene expression. Environmental enrichment promotes aging-like changes in young mice, likely related to brain maturation; conversely, it reverts age-related alterations in old mice, suggesting neuronal rejuvenation.

                Ablation of lysosomal polyamine transporter ATP13A2 causes lysosome dysfunction, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain elusive. Samaddar et al. demonstrate that ATP13A2 loss causes lysosomal accumulation of polyamines, which, in turn, disrupts Parkinson’s disease-linked lipid hydrolase β-glucocerebrosidase via lysosome deacidification and reduced enzyme-membrane electrostatic interactions in lysosomes.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97860">The gut contractile organoid for studying the gut motility regulated by coordinating signals between interstitial cells of Cajal and smooth muscles</a></h4>

              
                The gut undergoes peristaltic movements regulated by intricate cellular interactions. How these interactions emerge in the developing gut remains poorly explored due to a lack of model system. We here developed a novel contractile organoid that is derived from the muscle layer of chicken embryonic hindgut. The organoid contained smooth muscle cells (SMCs) and interstitial cells of Cajal (ICCs; pacemaker) with few enteric neurons and underwent periodic contractions. The organoid was formed by self-organization with morphological arrangements of ICCs (internal) and SMCs (peripheral), allowing identification of these cells in live. GCaMP-Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging analyses revealed that Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients between ICC-ICC, SMC-SMC, or SMC-ICC were markedly coordinated. Pharmacological studies further suggested a role of gap junctions in ICC-to-SMC signaling, and also possible mechanical feedback from SMC’s contraction to ICC’s pace-making activities. In addition, two organoids with different rhythms became synchronized when mediated by SMCs, unveiling a novel contribution of SMCs to ICC’s pace-making. The gut contractile organoid developed in this study offers a useful model to understand how the rhythm coordination between/among ICCs and SMCs is regulated and maintained during gut development.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/107093">Risk-taking incentives predict aggression heuristics in female gorillas</a></h4>

              
                Competition is commonly reflected in aggressive interactions among groupmates as individuals try to attain or maintain higher social ranks that can offer them better access to critical resources. In this study, we investigate the factors that can shift competitive incentives against higher- or lower-ranking groupmates, that is, more or less powerful individuals. We use a long-term behavioural data set on five wild groups of the two gorilla species starting in 1998, and we show that most aggression is directed from higher- to lower-ranking adult females close in rank, highlighting rank-reinforcement incentives. Yet, females directed 42% of aggression to higher-ranking females than themselves. Females targeted groupmates of higher rank with increasing number of males in the group, suggesting that males might buffer female–female aggression risk. Contrarily, they targeted females of lower rank with increasing number of females in the group, potentially because this is a low-risk option that females prefer when they have access to a larger pool of competitors to choose from. Lactating and pregnant females, especially those in the latest stage of pregnancy, targeted groupmates of higher rank than the groupmates that cycling females targeted, suggesting that energetic needs may motivate females to risk confrontation with more powerful rivals. Our study provides critical insights into the evolution of competitive behaviour, showing that aggression heuristics, the simple rules that animals use to guide their aggressive interactions, are not merely species-specific but also dependent on the conditions that populations and individuals experience.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The strength of neural reinstatement, a correlate of episodic memory retrieval, reportedly reflects the amount and fidelity of mnemonic content and is weaker in older than younger adults, especially for scene memoranda. Based on evidence that age-related declines in cortical thickness and volume contribute to age-related cognitive decline, we analyzed functional magnetic resonance imaging data acquired from healthy young and older adults to examine relationships between cortical thickness, cortical volume, age, and scene-related reinstatement in 3 cortical regions implicated in scene processing: the parahippocampal place area, medial place area, and occipital place area. A “reinstatement index” was estimated from functional magnetic resonance imaging data collected during tests of source memory for scene images, and multiple regression analyses were employed to examine the effects of the variables of interest on scene reinstatement. There were robust age differences in reinstatement, cortical thickness, and cortical volume. In the parahippocampal place area and medial place area, cortical volume fully mediated the effects of age on reinstatement. Additionally, parahippocampal place area reinstatement strength predicted source memory performance independently of cortical volume or age. These findings suggest that age differences in scene reinstatement are mediated by cortical volume and that memory performance and cortical volume are associated with unique components of variance in reinstatement strength.</span>

                <p>Adolescent nicotine use is particularly concerning due to increased susceptibility to long-term effects and dependence during this critical developmental period. This study investigates the therapeutic effects of thiamine on nicotine withdrawal-induced anxiety, anhedonia, and depression in rats. Adolescent rats received nicotine (2&nbsp;mg/kg, s.c.) for 21&nbsp;d, followed by 21&nbsp;d of withdrawal. Thiamine (25 or 50&nbsp;mg/kg, i.p.) was administered during exposure and withdrawal. Behavioral assessments were used to evaluate anxiety- and depressive-like symptoms, and biochemical analyses measured oxidative stress markers, serotonin levels, MAO activity, BDNF, and GFAP as indicators of neuroinflammation in the prefrontal cortex. Nicotine withdrawal significantly elevated anxiety-, depression-, and anhedonia-like behaviors, increased oxidative stress, and upregulated MAO-A activity and GFAP expression, indicating neuroinflammatory effects. Notably, thiamine administration during both nicotine exposure and withdrawal effectively alleviated these behavioral impairments, restored serotonin levels, reduced oxidative stress markers, and mitigated the increase in GFAP expression. Additionally, thiamine alone has been shown to alleviate anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors. This study highlights thiamine's potential as a promising intervention for managing psychological distress associated with nicotine withdrawal. Given the high prevalence of adolescent nicotine use and its associated mental health challenges, further research on thiamine's mechanisms and therapeutic potential is warranted to improve treatment strategies during this critical developmental stage.</p>

                <p>Every neuron contains the same genomic information, but its complement of proteins is the product of countless neuron-specific steps including pre-mRNA splicing. Despite advances in RNA sequencing techniques, pre-mRNA splicing biases that favor one isoform over another are largely inscrutable in live neurons in situ. Here, in <I>Drosophila</I>, we developed bichromatic fluorescent reporters to investigate alternative splicing of <I>cacophony</I> (<I>cac</I>)&mdash;a gene that codes the pore-forming &alpha;<SUB>1</SUB> subunit of the primary neuronal voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel (VGCC). These reporters revealed a neuron-specific pattern of exon biases, highly consistent from one animal to the next, suggesting that each neuron splices a unique and consistent portfolio of VGCC isoforms. Stereotypical patterns were observed within motor neurons and multidendritic sensory neurons of female larvae and also within mushroom body Kenyon cells of female adults. In a validation step, we demonstrated that exon splice bias reporting was not dependent on the choice of fluorophores. Additionally, functional properties of the female larval motor neuron terminals could be generally reconciled with the functional properties predicted for the reported exon bias. The application of this technology to a large gene such as <I>cac</I> provides a precedence for effective exon-reporter design for other <I>Drosophila</I> genes.</p>

                <p>by Haoran Chen, Yangyuan Zhang, Robert F. Murphy</p>

Recent advances in multiplexed fluorescence imaging have provided new opportunities for deciphering the complex spatial relationships among various cell types across diverse tissues. We introduce CytoSpatio, open-source software that constructs generative, multirange, and multitype point process models that capture interactions among multiple cell types at various distances simultaneously. On analyzing five cell types across five tissues, our software showed consistent spatial relationships within the same tissue type, with certain cell types like proliferating T cells consistently clustering across tissue types. It also revealed that the attraction-repulsion relationships between cell types like B cells and CD4-positive T cells vary with tissue type. Models for a published dataset demonstrated consistency with prior findings. CytoSpatio can also generate synthetic tissue patterns from learned models, a capability not provided by previous descriptive, motif-based approaches. This potentially allows spatially realistic simulations of how cell relationships affect tissue biochemistry.

                <p>by Amirmahdi Mostofinejad, David A. Romero, Dana Brinson, Thomas K. Waddell, Golnaz Karoubi, Cristina H. Amon</p>

Differentiation of embryonic stem cells and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) into endoderm derivatives, including thyroid, thymus, lungs, liver, and pancreas, has broad implications for disease modeling and therapy. We utilize and expand a model development approach previously outlined by the authors to construct a model for the directed differentiation of iPSCs into definitive endoderm (DE). Assuming discrete intermediate stages in the differentiation process with a homogeneous population in each stage, three lineage models with two, three, and four populations and three growth models are constructed. Additionally, three models for error distribution are defined, resulting in a total of 27 models. Experimental data obtained <i>in vitro</i> are used for model calibration, model selection, and final validation. Model selection suggests that no transitory state during differentiation expresses the DE biomarkers CD117 and CD184, a finding corroborated by existing literature. Additionally, space-limited growth models, such as logistic and Gompertz growth, outperform exponential growth. Validation of the inferred model with leave-out data results in prediction errors of 26.4%. Using the inferred model, it is predicted that the optimal differentiation period is between 1.9 and 2.4 days, plating populations closer to 300 000 cells per well result in the highest yield efficiency, and that iPSC differentiation outpaces the DE proliferation as the main driver of the population dynamics. We also demonstrate that the model can predict the effect of growth modulators on cell population dynamics. Our model serves as a valuable tool for optimizing differentiation protocols, providing insights into developmental biology.

                <p>by John Robertson, Shorya Consul, Haris Vikalo</p>

Motivation: Oncoviruses, pathogens known to cause or increase the risk of cancer, include both common viruses such as human papillomaviruses and rarer pathogens such as human T-lymphotropic viruses. Computational methods for detecting viral DNA from data acquired by modern DNA sequencing technologies have enabled studies of the association between oncoviruses and cancers. Those studies are rendered particularly challenging when multiple species of oncovirus are present in a tumor sample. In such scenarios, merely detecting the presence of a sequencing read of viral origin is insufficiently informative—instead, a more precise characterization of the viral content in the sample is required.
Results: We address this need with NextVir, to our knowledge the first multi-class viral classification framework that adapts genomic foundation models to detecting and classifying sequencing reads of oncoviral origin. Specifically, NextVir explores several foundation models—DNABERT-S, Nucelotide Transformer, and HyenaDNA—and efficiently fine-tunes them to enable accurate identification of the sequencing reads’ origin. The results demonstrate superior performance of the proposed framework over existing deep learning methods and suggest downstream potential for foundational models in genomics.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1013354">Improving cell-type composition inference in spatial transcriptomics with SpaDAMA</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Lin Huang, Xiaofei Liu, Fangfang Zhu, Wenwen Min</p>

Accurate determination of cell-type composition in disease-relevant tissues is essential for identifying potential disease targets and understanding tissue heterogeneity. Most current spatial transcriptomics (ST) technologies lack single-cell resolution, which makes precise cell-type composition identification challenging. Several deconvolution methods have been developed to address this limitation by relying on single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data from the same tissue as a reference to estimate the cell type composition in ST data spots. However, these methods often overlook the inherent differences between scRNA-seq and ST data. To overcome this challenge, we introduce a Domain-Adversarial Masked Autoencoder (SpaDAMA) method. SpaDAMA leverages Domain-Adversarial Learning (DAL) to facilitate effective knowledge transfer from the source domain (pseudo-ST data generated from scRNA-seq) to the target domain (real ST data). Through adversarial training, SpaDAMA harmonizes the distributions of both datasets and maps them onto a unified latent representation, thereby reducing discrepancies in data modalities. Furthermore, to strengthen the model’s capability in extracting reliable features from real ST data, SpaDAMA employs masking strategies that effectively minimize noise and mitigate spatial artifacts. We validated SpaDAMA on 32 simulated datasets and 4 real-world datasets, demonstrating its superior performance in cell-type deconvolution and providing a promising tool for spatial transcriptomic analyses.

                <p>by Emily R. Bozich, Xiaolu Guo, Jennifer L. Wilson, Alexander Hoffmann</p>

Single-cell studies of signal transduction have revealed complex temporal dynamics that determine downstream biological function. For example, the stimulus-specific dynamics of the transcription factor NFκB specify stimulus-specific gene expression programs, and loss of specificity leads to disease. Thus, it is intriguing to consider drugs that may restore signaling specificity in disease contexts, or reduce activity but maintain signaling specificity to avoid unwanted side effects. However, while steady-state dose-response relationships have been the focus of pharmacological studies, there are no established methods for quantifying drug impact on stimulus-response signaling dynamics. Here we evaluated how drug treatments affect the stimulus-specificity of NFκB activation dynamics and its ability to accurately code ligand identity and dose. Specifically, we simulated the dynamic NFκB trajectories in response to 15 stimuli representing various immune threats under treatment of 10 representative drugs across 20 dosage levels. To quantify the effects on coding capacity, we introduced a Stimulus Response Specificity (SRS) score and a stimulus confusion score. We constructed stimulus confusion maps by employing epsilon network clustering in the trajectory space and in various dimensionally reduced spaces: canonical polyadic decomposition (CPD), functional principal component analysis (fPCA), and NFκB signaling codons (i.e., established, informative dynamic features). Our results indicated that the SRS score and the stimulus confusion map based on signaling codons are best-suited to quantify stimulus-specific NFκB dynamics confusion under pharmacological perturbations. Using these tools we found that temporal coding capacity of the NFκB signaling network is generally robust to a variety of pharmacological perturbations, thereby enabling the targeting of stimulus-specific dynamics without causing broad side-effects.

                <p>by Yuhang Zhang, Tao Sun, Boyang Zang, Sen Wan</p>

Decoding animal decision-making behavior from neural spike data emerges as a particularly challenging problem in neuroscience. To address this, we have devised a decision-making decoding model, incorporating a channel attention bi-directional long short-term memory network (CA-BiLSTM), with the aim of effectively parsing sparse neural spike data across multiple brain regions. Notably, the attention mechanism embedded within this model serves the crucial purpose of adeptly localizing neurons integral to decision-making stability within the task at hand. Specifically, when applied to the reproducible electrophysiology dataset from the International Brain Laboratory (IBL), our proposed model has demonstrated a remarkable capacity for accurately forecasting decision-making behavior in mice. Consequently, this investigation furnishes a novel perspective for unraveling the intricacies of neural decision-making mechanisms.

                <p>by Clara L. Shaw, David A. Kennedy</p>

Spillover of viruses into novel host species occurs frequently. Often, spillover results in dead-end infections in novel hosts, sometimes, in stuttering transmission chains that die out, and rarely, in large epidemics with sustained transmission. If we could identify early which outcome will occur following a spillover event, we could more appropriately invest in efforts to surveil, respond to, or prevent disease emergence. Our goal was to identify early epidemiological characteristics that correlate with these outcomes, including those predictive of population-level virus persistence in novel hosts. To identify these characteristics, we experimentally induced spillover in the <i>Caenorhabditis</i> nematode-Orsay virus system and measured infection prevalence in exposed populations and virus shedding and infection intensity from infected hosts in replicate populations of eight strains belonging to seven non-native host species. We then passaged 20 adult nematodes from exposed populations to virus-free plates where they reproduced, initiating new populations to which they had the potential to transmit virus. We used quantitative PCR to track virus presence in passaged host populations for 10 passages or until virus was undetectable, indicating its loss. We then used a correlative modeling and a mechanistic modeling approach to understand which epidemiological characteristics were associated with population-level viral persistence. In our correlative models, we found that the number of passages until virus loss was associated with early epidemiological characteristics in the spillover host populations, including infection prevalence in the initially exposed population, the ability of hosts to detectably shed the virus, and the relative susceptibility of the host species, but not infection intensity. When all these characteristics were included simultaneously in a correlative model, only infection prevalence and shedding were significantly associated with virus maintenance, and the model explained over half of the variation in the data. We then developed a mechanistic model that attempts to explain virus passage success by using our epidemiological characteristics data to calculate the probability that at least one worm infectious enough to infect a conspecific is transferred during passage. This mechanistic model explained 38% of the variation in the data on its own. With the goal of understanding how our mechanistic model falls short, we used model selection to test a suite of larger models that included or excluded each epidemiological characteristic and included random effects of strain, experimental line, passage number, and block while the mechanistic prediction was included as an offset. We found that 66% of the variation in our data could be explained by a model that included our mechanistic prediction in addition to infection prevalence, infection intensity, and random effects. Altogether, our study demonstrates that early epidemiological characteristics can play a substantial role in explaining the ultimate outcome of a spillover event.

<p>Monosynaptic rabies tracing shows that the ventral subiculum and thalamic paraventricular nucleus are sources of input to a nucleus accumbens shell- ventral pallidum pathway involved in modulating dopamine neuron activity.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The shell of the nucleus accumbens (NAcSh) regulates motivation and reward via its dense projection to the ventral pallidum (VP). This ventral striatopallidal system has also been shown to regulate the activity of midbrain dopamine neurons and the release of dopamine in the NAcSh. The present study applied monosynaptic rabies tracing in the rat to quantify the brain-wide sources of synaptic input to neurons in the medial NAcSh that project to the ventromedial VP. The ventral subiculum of the hippocampus (vSub) was the largest source of input cells to the NAcSh-VP projection neurons. Anterograde tracing of vSub-NAcSh projection neurons demonstrated that their fibers terminated densely in the NAcSh largely avoiding other regions of the striatum. Another relatively strong source of input cells included the anterior part of the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (aPVT). The CA1, lateral septal nucleus, VP, paratenial thalamic nucleus, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, lateral preoptic area and dorsomedial nucleus of the hypothalamus were moderately strong sources of input neurons. The prefrontal cortex, amygdala, and the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala were found to be relatively weak sources of input. A lack of sex differences for all the sources of input identified indicates that there is no apparent sexual dimorphism in the afferents to the striatopallidal system. In summary, the vSub and the aPVT are the major sources of cortical and thalamic monosynaptic inputs to the NAcSh-VP projection neurons where these inputs converge to regulate behavior and dopamine release in the NAcSh.</p>
