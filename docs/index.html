                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To assess comparative effectiveness, safety, and tolerability of off-label rituximab, compared with frequently used therapies approved for multiple sclerosis (MS).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>A Swedish cohort study of persons with relapsing–remitting MS, age 18 to 75 years at inclusion and with a first therapy start or a first therapy switch between 2011 and 2018. Low-dose rituximab was compared with MS-approved therapies. Primary outcomes were proportions with 12 months confirmed disability worsening and change in MS Impact Scale-29 (MSIS-29) scores, respectively. Secondary endpoints included relapses, therapy discontinuation, and serious adverse events. Analyses used an intention-to-treat approach and were adjusted for demographics, MS features, and health characteristics.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We included 2,449 participants as first therapy start and 2,463 as first therapy switch. Proportions with disability worsening at 3 years were 9.1% for rituximab as first therapy and 5.1% after therapy switch, with no differences to MS-approved comparators. Worsening on rituximab was mostly independent of relapses. MSIS-29 with rituximab at 3 years improved by 1.3/8.4 points (physical/psychological) for first disease-modifying therapy (DMT) and 0.4/3.6 for DMT switch, and was mostly similar across therapies. Rituximab had lower relapse rates and higher therapy persistence in both groups. The rate of hospital-treated infections was higher with rituximab after a therapy switch, but not as a first therapy.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This population-based real-world cohort study found low rates of disability progression, mostly independent of relapses, and without significant differences between rituximab and MS-approved comparators. Rituximab led to lower rates of inflammatory activity and higher treatment persistence, but was associated with an increased rate of serious infections. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

">Separating sensory from timing processes: a cognitive encoding and neural decoding approach</a></h4>

              
                The internal clock is a psychological model for timing behavior. According to information theory, psychological time might be a manifestation of information flow during sensory processing. Herein, we tested three hypotheses: (1) whether sensory adaptation reduces (or novelty increases) the rate of the internal clock (2) whether the speed of the clock reflects the amount of cortical sensory processing (3) whether motion tunes clock speed. The current study used an oddball paradigm in which participants detected duration changes while being recorded with electroencephalography (EEG). For data analysis, we combined cognitive modeling with neural decoding techniques. Specifically, we designed Adaptive-Thought-of-Control (ACT-R) models to explain human data and linked them to the sensory EEG features discovered through machine learning. Our results indicate that timing performance is influenced by both timing and non-timing factors. The internal clock may reflect the amount of sensory processing, thereby clarifying a long-standing sensory timing mystery.

	<p>Non-human primates, due to their similarities in immune response to humans, are the preferred model for studying infectious processes and any associated cognitive impairments. Behavioral tests are indispensable for investigating pathogenesis in neuroinfections, especially those that do not manifest with noticeable clinical symptoms, as well as in the transition to a chronic form of the disease. Modeling viral infection requires specialized experimental conditions. Our work describes techniques for investigating mnemonic functions, tiredness, attentional focus, quick-wittedness, and basic behavioral responses in primates under the assumed conditions for infections with viruses that do not have an airborne route of transmission. It also outlines approaches to the training and selection of primates for virological research, as well as analyzing gender differences in learning abilities, the impact of housing conditions on the results, and the correlation between training success and behavioral test scores. These methods will allow a more detailed study of non-human primates as a model for researching cognitive and behavioral impairments under infectious and immune stress, as well as the design of less energy-intensive experiments for evaluating the efficacy and safety of therapeutic and prophylactic strategies at early stages of infection.</p>

                Background The Zika virus (ZIKV) infection has emerged as a global health threat. The causal reasoning is that Zika infection is linked to the development of microcephaly in newborns and Guillain-Barré syndrome in adults. With no clinically approved antiviral treatment for ZIKV, the need for the development of potential inhibitors against the virus is essential. In this study, we aimed to screen phytochemicals from papaya (Carica papaya L.) against NS5 protein domains of ZIKV. Methods Approximately 193 phytochemicals from an online database (IMPACT) were subjected to molecular docking using AutoDock Vina against the NS5-MTase protein domain (5WXB) and -RdRp domain (5U04). Results Our results showed that β-sitosterol, carpaine, violaxanthin, pseudocarpaine, Δ7-avenasterols, Rutin, and cis-β-carotene had the highest binding affinity to both protein domains, with β-sitosterol having the most favorable binding energy. Furthermore, ADMET analysis revealed that selected compounds had good pharmacokinetic properties and were nontoxic. Conclusions Our findings suggest that papaya-derived phytochemicals could be potential candidates for developing antiviral drugs against ZIKV. However, further experimental studies using cell lines and in vivo models are needed to validate their efficacy and safety.

                Background Worldwide, e-commerce, as a business modality that uses information and communication technologies to make transactions of products and services, has become an indispensable part of the global retail market, especially since the COVID-19 pandemic. E-commerce has experienced accelerated growth in recent years, driven by factors such as increased internet penetration, the expansion of mobile devices, user confidence and innovation of digital platforms. Dental offices have found e-commerce an opportunity to improve their competitiveness. The aim of the research was to establish the relationship between the indicators of efficiency maximization in sales and the type of modality of commerce used most by private dental offices within an emerging economy context in Latin-American city. Methods The study was classified as applied research with a non-experimental, correlational and exploratory design. The sample consisted of 34 private dental offices. A simple random probabilistic sampling was chosen. An instrument containing thirteen items including questions about payment, appointments or consultations, and advertising and indicators of efficiency maximization in sales, was used. Results The assessment of the relationship between the efficiency maximization indicators in sales and the commerce employed shows that, beyond cost reduction (PR=8, 95% CI [1.37; 46.81], p=0.021), the type does not have a statistically significant impact on the increase in clients, sales, revenues, and profit increase. (PR=3, 95% CI [0.28; 32.21], p=0.364). Conclusions E-commerce is significantly correlated with a reduction in operational costs.

                <h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>The benefits of intravenous thrombolysis are time-dependent, with maximum efficacy when administered within the first “golden” hour after onset. Nevertheless, the impact of golden hour thrombolysis has not been well quantified.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Medline, Embase, and Web of Science databases were systematically searched from inception to August 27, 2023. We included studies that reported safety and efficacy outcomes of ischemic stroke patients treated with intravenous thrombolysis in the golden hour versus later treatment window. The primary outcome was an excellent functional outcome, defined as a modified Rankin Scale score of 0–1 at 90 days. The secondary efficacy outcome was a good functional outcome (defined as modified Rankin Scale score of 0–2). The main safety outcome was symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Seven studies involving 78,826 patients met the selection criteria. Golden hour thrombolysis was associated with higher odds of 90-day excellent functional outcomes (OR 1.40, 95% CI 1.16–1.67) and 90-day good functional outcomes (OR 1.38, 95% CI 1.13–1.69) compared with thrombolysis outside the golden hour. The number needed to treat to benefit for golden hour thrombolysis to reduce disability by at least 1 level on the modified Rankin Scale per patient was 2.6. Rates of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage and mortality were similar between groups.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Golden hour thrombolysis significantly improved acute ischemic stroke outcomes. The findings provide rationale for intensive efforts aimed at expediting thrombolytic therapy within the golden hour window following the onset of acute ischemic stroke. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

                Background The provision of community health services (CHS) is critical in accelerating primary health care delivery to vulnerable and deprived populations. This systematic review study has been conducted to interrogate the interrelationship between households and community health services in accelerating primary healthcare delivery synthesizing the available empirical studies. The findings are to inform a primary research on structural linkages between households and CHS in Kisumu County, Kenya. Methods This study applied a descriptive approach using a systematic review technique to provide context and substance to the two main research questions: (1) how does the interaction between households and CHWs affect utilization of CHS to promote equity and right to health? (2) How do health-seeking behaviours of households influence their decision-making regarding choices of CHS? We screened the literature from Google scholar, JSTOR, SAGE and EBSCO based on our inclusion criteria, resulting in 21 studies. These studies were assessed for quality and eligibility and data extracted based on relevance to the research study. Results Households place primacy on trust and confidentiality in the interaction with CHWs and this affects uptake of CHS. The social determinants of health are also critical in influencing the health-seeking behaviour of households and individuals and their choice of CHS. The successful models of CHS share the characteristic of community ownership and participation and provides for comprehensive health care teams. Conclusion CHS are critical for the acceleration of primary health care delivery. It forms an important pathway for the achievement of universal health coverage, which is an outcome required for Sustainable Development Goal 3 on health.

                Background Glioblastoma (GBM) is a clinically challenging primary brain tumor with poor survival outcome despite surgical resection and intensive chemoradiation. The metabolic heterogeneity of GBM can become biomarkers for treatment response, resistance, and outcome prediction. The aim of the study is to investigate metabolic distinctions between primary and recurrent GBM tissue and patient plasma to establish feasibility for metabolic profiling. Methods A single-center cohort study analyzed tissue and blood samples from 15 patients with GBM using untargeted metabolomic/lipidomic assays. Metabolomic, lipidomic, and biogenic amine analyses were conducted on GBM tissue and patient plasma at diagnosis and recurrence using untargeted mass spectrometry. The study utilized a small but longitudinally collected cohort to evaluate alteration in metabolites, lipids, and biogenic amines between specimens at diagnosis and recurrence. Results Exploratory analysis revealed significant alteration in metabolites, lipids, and biogenic amines between diagnostic and recurrent states in both tumor and plasma specimens. Notable metabolites differed at recurrence, including N-alpha-methylhistamine, glycerol-3-phosphate, phosphocholine, and succinic acid in tissue, and indole-3-acetate, and urea in plasma. Principal component analysis revealed distinct metabolomic profiles between tumor tissue and patient plasma. Distinct metabolic profiles were observed in GBM tissue and patient plasma at recurrence, demonstrating the feasibility of using metabolomic methodologies for longitudinal studies. One patient exhibited a unique tumor resistance signature at diagnosis, possibly indicating a high-risk metabolomic phenotype. Conclusions In this small cohort, the findings suggest the potential of metabolomic signatures of GBM tissue and patient plasma for risk stratification, outcome prediction, and the development of novel adjuvant metabolic-targeting therapies. The findings suggest metabolic discrepancies at diagnosis and recurrence in tissue and plasma, highlighting potential implications for evaluation of clinical response. The identification of significant changes in metabolite abundance emphasizes the need for larger studies using targeted metabolomics to validate and further explore these profiles.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-689/v1?src=rss">Internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy for individuals with gambling disorder in Indonesia: protocol for a pilot and feasibility study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Gambling disorder (GD) has become a wide concern in Indonesia, as many negative consequences arise from this psychiatric condition. Prompt treatment with an appropriate method of delivery is required to achieve optimal outcomes in GD patients. This protocol paper outlines a study to determine the effectiveness, acceptability, and feasibility of internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) in treating GD in Indonesia. Methods This non-randomized pilot and feasibility study will recruit 20 people with GD. All participants will receive the iCBT intervention through self-learning videos and guided weekly group sessions. The effectiveness of the intervention will be assessed at baseline (week 0), post- treatment completion (week 10), and 6 weeks post-treatment (week 16). The outcomes measured will be the change in gambling symptoms, gambling urges, cognitive distortions, readiness to change, emotional problems, and quality of life of the participants. Discussion The feasibility of iCBT for GD patients in Indonesia will be assessed by this study. The study's results will give an indication of the acceptability of the intervention and the feasibility of a subsequent conclusive trial. The delivery of iCBT may help to address the issue of treatment access in an extensive geographical region and provide immediate implications as a treatment resource for GD in practice.

                Background Establishment of a systematic way of measurement and utilization of indicators for improvement is one of the most challenging issues in monitoring and evaluation of indicators in healthcare settings. In realizing these fundamental challenges, we designed a monitoring and evaluation system incorporating a hospital-wide quality variance report (QVR) system using linked Microsoft Excel® spreadsheets on Microsoft SharePoint®. Methods Indicators were determined at the departmental/unit level in line with the institutional goals, departmental functions, quality expectations, inputs/outputs, clinical priorities, compliance to policies/procedures/protocols/guidelines/pathways as well as in response to gaps in service delivery picked during root cause analyses. The sample design was determined in accordance with the characteristics of the population. Drawing of sample units was done using a simple random sampling technique without replacement or systematic random sampling. The indicator’s monitoring was enhanced visually by allocating colour codes based on performance across the months and quarters. The action plan tab consisted of a platform that aids in documenting corrective actions arising from the performance reviews. Results and discussion The QVR reporting system ensured a standardized format of monitoring throughout the institution with a reduced turnaround time from data collection to analysis. Further, continuity of the monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system was guaranteed even if an individual left the institution. The analysis of the QVR allowed hospital-wide trending on cross-cutting indicators with consequent ease of communication to multiple stakeholders. The automation has saved time and increased accuracy which has enhanced credible engagements during quality meetings. Conclusions Use of this system greatly enhanced quality performance monitoring in the hospital, identification of major bottlenecks that warranted hospital-wide projects or departmental-level projects. The QVR system enhanced the efficiency and accuracy of quality monitoring from data collection through to performance reviews. The QVR structure allows for customized development of an M&E database application software.

                <p>by Qince Li, Zheng Yan, Zhen Wang, Cuiping Liang, Xiqian Wang, Xianghu Wu, Wei Wang, Yongfeng Yuan, Kuanquan Wang</p>

Patients with myocardial ischemia and infarction are at increased risk of arrhythmias, which in turn, can exacerbate the overall risk of mortality. Despite the observed reduction in recurrent arrhythmias through antiarrhythmic drug therapy, the precise mechanisms underlying their effectiveness in treating ischemic heart disease remain unclear. Moreover, there is a lack of specialized drugs designed explicitly for the treatment of myocardial ischemic arrhythmia. This study employs an electrophysiological simulation approach to investigate the potential antiarrhythmic effects and underlying mechanisms of various pharmacological agents in the context of ischemia and myocardial infarction (MI). Based on physiological experimental data, computational models are developed to simulate the effects of a series of pharmacological agents (amiodarone, telmisartan, E-4031, chromanol 293B, and glibenclamide) on cellular electrophysiology and utilized to further evaluate their antiarrhythmic effectiveness during ischemia. On 2D and 3D tissues with multiple pathological conditions, the simulation results indicate that the antiarrhythmic effect of glibenclamide is primarily attributed to the suppression of efflux of potassium ion to facilitate the restitution of [K<sup>+</sup>]<sub>o</sub>, as opposed to recovery of I<sub>KATP</sub> during myocardial ischemia. This discovery implies that, during acute cardiac ischemia, pro-arrhythmogenic alterations in cardiac tissue’s excitability and conduction properties are more significantly influenced by electrophysiological changes in the depolarization rate, as opposed to variations in the action potential duration (APD). These findings offer specific insights into potentially effective targets for investigating ischemic arrhythmias, providing significant guidance for clinical interventions in acute coronary syndrome.

                <p>by Jannik Jauch, Moritz Becker, Christian Tetzlaff, Michael Jan Fauth</p>

Ripples are a typical form of neural activity in hippocampal neural networks associated with the replay of episodic memories during sleep as well as sleep-related plasticity and memory consolidation. The emergence of ripples has been observed both dependent as well as independent of input from other brain areas and often coincides with dendritic spikes. Yet, it is unclear how input-evoked and spontaneous ripples as well as dendritic excitability affect plasticity and consolidation.
Here, we use mathematical modeling to compare these cases. We find that consolidation as well as the emergence of spontaneous ripples depends on a reliable propagation of activity in feed-forward structures which constitute memory representations. This propagation is facilitated by excitable dendrites, which entail that a few strong synapses are sufficient to trigger neuronal firing. In this situation, stimulation-evoked ripples lead to the potentiation of weak synapses within the feed-forward structure and, thus, to a consolidation of a more general sequence memory. However, spontaneous ripples that occur without stimulation, only consolidate a sparse backbone of the existing strong feed-forward structure.
Based on this, we test a recently hypothesized scenario in which the excitability of dendrites is transiently enhanced after learning, and show that such a transient increase can strengthen, restructure and consolidate even weak hippocampal memories, which would be forgotten otherwise. Hence, a transient increase in dendritic excitability would indeed provide a mechanism for stabilizing memories.

                <p>by Simon Nougaret, Laura López-Galdo, Emile Caytan, Julien Poitreau, Frédéric V. Barthélemy, Bjørg Elisabeth Kilavik</p>

Low and high beta frequency rhythms were observed in the motor cortex, but their respective sources and behavioral correlates remain unknown. We studied local field potentials (LFPs) during pre-cued reaching behavior in macaques. They contained a low beta band (<20 Hz) dominant in primary motor cortex and a high beta band (>20 Hz) dominant in dorsal premotor cortex (PMd). Low beta correlated positively with reaction time (RT) from visual cue onset and negatively with uninstructed hand postural micro-movements throughout the trial. High beta reflected temporal task prediction, with selective modulations before and during cues, which were enhanced in moments of increased focal attention when the gaze was on the work area. This double-dissociation in sources and behavioral correlates of motor cortical low and high beta, with respect to both task-instructed and spontaneous behavior, reconciles the largely disparate roles proposed for the beta rhythm, by suggesting band-specific roles in both movement control and spatiotemporal attention.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is believed to be more common in African Americans (AA), but biomarker studies in AA populations are limited. This report represents the largest study to date examining cerebrospinal fluid AD biomarkers in AA individuals.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We analyzed 3,006 cerebrospinal fluid samples from controls, AD cases, and non-AD cases, including 495 (16.5%) self-identified black/AA and 2,456 (81.7%) white/European individuals using cutoffs derived from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, and using a data-driven multivariate Gaussian mixture of regressions.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Distinct effects of race were found in different groups. Total Tauand phospho181-Tau were lower among AA individuals in all groups (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001), and Aβ<sub>42</sub> was markedly lower in AA controls compared with white controls (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001). Gaussian mixture of regressions modeling of cerebrospinal fluid distributions incorporating adjustments for covariates revealed coefficient estimates for AA race comparable with 2-decade change in age. Using Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative cutoffs, fewer AA controls were classified as biomarker-positive asymptomatic AD (8.0% vs 13.4%). After adjusting for covariates, our Gaussian mixture of regressions model reduced this difference, but continued to predict lower prevalence of asymptomatic AD among AA controls (9.3% vs 13.5%).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Although the risk of dementia is higher, data-driven modeling indicates lower frequency of asymptomatic AD in AA controls, suggesting that dementia among AA populations may not be driven by higher rates of AD. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

                Background Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a disease with high mortality, and there are only two specific drugs available for therapeutic management with limitations. The study aims to identify comprehensive therapeutic mechanisms of Zingiber zerumbet rhizomes (ZZR) to treat IPF by using network pharmacology followed battery of in silico studies. Methods The protein-protein interaction network was developed using Cytoscape to obtain core disease targets involved in IPF and their interactive molecules of ZZR. Based on the pharmacophore properties of phytomolecules from ZZR, the drug targets in IPF were explored. Protein-protein interaction network was built in Cytoscape to screen potential targets and components of ZZR. Molecular docking and dynamics were conducted as an empirical study to investigate the mechanism explored through network pharmacology in relation to the hub targets. Results The network analysis conferred kaempferol derivatives that had demonstrated a promising therapeutic effect on the perturbed, robust network hubs of TGF-β1, EGFR, TNF-α, MMP2 & MMP9 reported to alter the biological process of mesenchymal transition, myofibroblast proliferation, and cellular matrix deposition in pulmonary fibrosis. The phytomolecules of ZZR act on two major significant pathways, namely the TGF-β-signaling pathway and the FOXO-signaling pathway, to inhibit IPF. Confirmational molecular docking and dynamics simulation studies possessed good stability and interactions of the protein-ligand complexes by RMSD, RMSF, rGyr, SASA, and principal component analysis (PCA). Validated molecular docking and dynamics simulations provided new insight into exploring the mechanism and multi-target effect of ZZR to treat pulmonary fibrosis by restoring the alveolar phenotype through cellular networking. Conclusions Network pharmacology and in silico studies confirm the multitargeted activity of ZZR in the treatment of IPF. Further in vitro and in vivo studies are to be conducted to validate these findings.

Piezo ensures precise organ growth by regulating cellular processes and tissue architecture through tension-mediated feedback control of cell division and elimination.

                The coordinated activity of many neurons in the brain can be described as a high-dimensional manifold. Morales-Gregorio et al. show that two manifolds appear in the visual cortex of macaques corresponding to the eyes being open or closed. These changes are accompanied by an increase in dimensionality and cortico-cortical communication. Taken together, these observations suggest that as soon as the eyes open V1 is prepared for fast and efficient vision, even in a dark room.

                Adaptive motor behavior depends on the coordinated activity of multiple neural systems distributed across the brain. While the role of sensorimotor cortex in motor learning has been well established, how higher-order brain systems interact with sensorimotor cortex to guide learning is less well understood. Using functional MRI, we examined human brain activity during a reward-based motor task where subjects learned to shape their hand trajectories through reinforcement feedback. We projected patterns of cortical and striatal functional connectivity onto a low-dimensional manifold space and examined how regions expanded and contracted along the manifold during learning. During early learning, we found that several sensorimotor areas in the dorsal attention network exhibited increased covariance with areas of the salience/ventral attention network and reduced covariance with areas of the default mode network (DMN). During late learning, these effects reversed, with sensorimotor areas now exhibiting increased covariance with DMN areas. However, areas in posteromedial cortex showed the opposite pattern across learning phases, with its connectivity suggesting a role in coordinating activity across different networks over time. Our results establish the neural changes that support reward-based motor learning and identify distinct transitions in the functional coupling of sensorimotor to transmodal cortex when adapting behavior.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93971">Fitness landscape of substrate-adaptive mutations in evolved amino acid-polyamine-organocation transporters</a></h4>

              
                The emergence of new protein functions is crucial for the evolution of organisms. This process has been extensively researched for soluble enzymes, but it is largely unexplored for membrane transporters, even though the ability to acquire new nutrients from a changing environment requires evolvability of transport functions. Here, we demonstrate the importance of environmental pressure in obtaining a new activity or altering a promiscuous activity in members of the amino acid-polyamine-organocation (APC)-type yeast amino acid transporters family. We identify APC members that have broader substrate spectra than previously described. Using in vivo experimental evolution, we evolve two of these transporter genes, <i>AGP1</i> and <i>PUT4</i>, toward new substrate specificities. Single mutations on these transporters are found to be sufficient for expanding the substrate range of the proteins, while retaining the capacity to transport all original substrates. Nonetheless, each adaptive mutation comes with a distinct effect on the fitness for each of the original substrates, illustrating a trade-off between the ancestral and evolved functions. Collectively, our findings reveal how substrate-adaptive mutations in membrane transporters contribute to fitness and provide insights into how organisms can use transporter evolution to explore new ecological niches.

">Astrocytic glutamate regulation is implicated in the development of stress-related psychiatric disorders</a></h4>

              
                Severe psychological stress is one of the most potent risk factors for developing a mood or psychotic disorder, yet the underlying molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. Astrocytes are a key brain cell type associated with stress and psychiatric phenotypes in animals, but how this translates to humans is largely unknown. Here, we show that cortical astrocytes are persistently changed both physically and molecularly in humans with psychiatric disorders exposed to profound stress before diagnosis. By profiling the diversity of human astrocytes with single nucleus and spatial transcriptomics, we identified distinct alterations to glutamate-related synaptic functions, supported by histological quantification of >20,000 astrocytes. Alterations were pronounced in females compared to males and in cases exposed to profound stress during childhood. The use of human pluripotent stem cell-derived astrocytes confirmed that glutamate signalling is directly impacted by glucocorticoid activation. Our findings suggest that astrocytes are strategic pharmacological targets for future intervention strategies.

">The Alzheimer's disease gene SORL1 regulates lysosome function in human microglia</a></h4>

              
                The SORL1 gene encodes the sortilin related receptor protein SORLA, a sorting receptor that regulates endo-lysosomal trafficking of various substrates. Loss of function variants in SORL1 are causative for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and decreased expression of SORLA has been repeatedly observed in human AD brains. SORL1 is highly expressed by microglia, the tissue resident immune cells of the brain. Loss of SORLA leads to enlarged lysosomes in hiPSC-derived microglia like cells (hMGLs). However, whether SORLA deficiency contributes to microglia dysfunction and how this is relevant to AD is not known. In this study, we show that loss of SORLA results in decreased lysosomal degradation and lysosomal enzyme activity due to altered trafficking of lysosomal enzymes in hMGLs. Furthermore, lysosomal exocytosis, an important process involved in immune responses and cellular signaling, is also impaired in SORL1 deficient microglia. Phagocytic uptake of fibrillar amyloid beta 1-42 and synaptosomes is increased in SORLA deficient hMGLs, but due to reduced lysosomal degradation, these substrates aberrantly accumulate in lysosomes. Overall, these data highlight the microglial endo-lysosomal network as a potential novel pathway through which SORL1 may increase AD risk and contribute to development of AD. Additionally, our findings may inform development of novel lysosome and microglia associated drug targets for AD.

">Thalamocortical contributions to hierarchical cognitive control</a></h4>

              
                Cognitive flexibility relies on hierarchically structured task representations that organize task contexts, relevant environmental features, and subordinate decisions. Despite ongoing interest in the human thalamus, its role in cognitive control has been understudied. This study explored thalamic representation and thalamocortical interactions that contribute to hierarchical cognitive control in humans. We found that several thalamic nuclei, including the anterior, mediodorsal, ventrolateral, and pulvinar nuclei, exhibited stronger evoked responses when subjects switch between task contexts. Decoding analysis revealed that thalamic activity preferentially encodes task contexts within the hierarchical task representations. To determine how thalamocortical interactions contribute to task representations, we developed a thalamocortical functional interaction model to predict task-related cortical representation. This data-driven model outperformed comparison models, particularly in predicting activity patterns in cortical regions that encode context representations. Collectively, our findings highlight the significant contribution of thalamic activity and thalamocortical interactions for contextually guided hierarchical cognitive control.

">Sex-steroid hormones relate to cerebellar structure and functional connectivity across adulthood</a></h4>

              
                Aging involves complex biological changes that affect disease susceptibility and aging trajectories. Although females typically live longer than males, they have a higher susceptibility to diseases like Alzheimer's, speculated to be influenced by menopause, and reduced ovarian hormone production. Understanding sex-specific differences is crucial for personalized medical interventions and gender equality in health. Our study aims to elucidate sex differences in regional cerebellar structure and connectivity during normal aging by investigating both structural and functional connectivity variations, with a focus on investigating these differences in the context of sex-steroid hormones. The study included 138 participants (mean age = 57(13.3) years, age range = 35-86 years, 54% women). The cohort was divided into three groups: 38 early middle-aged individuals (EMA) (mean age = 41(4.7) years), 48 late middle-aged individuals (LMA) (mean age = 58(4) years), and 42 older adults (OA) (mean age = 72(6.3) years). All participants underwent MRI scans, and saliva samples were collected for sex-steroid hormone quantification (17{beta}-estradiol (E), progesterone (P), and testosterone (T)). We found less connectivity in females between Lobule I-IV and the cuneus, and greater connectivity in females between Crus I, Crus II, and the precuneus with increased age. Higher 17{beta}-estradiol levels were linked to greater connectivity in Crus I and Crus II cerebellar subregions. Analyzing all participants together, testosterone was associated with both higher and lower connectivity in Lobule I-IV and Crus I, respectively, while higher progesterone levels were linked to lower connectivity in females. Structural differences were observed, with EMA males having larger volumes compared to LMA and OA groups, particularly in the right I-IV, right Crus I, right V, and right VI. EMA females showed higher volumes in the right lobules V and VI. These results highlight the significant role of sex hormones in modulating cerebellar connectivity and structure across adulthood, emphasizing the need to consider sex and hormonal status in neuroimaging studies to better understand age-related cognitive decline and neurological disorders.

">Pronouns reactivate conceptual representations in human hippocampal neurons</a></h4>

              
                During discourse comprehension, every new word adds to an evolving representation of meaning that accumulates over consecutive sentences and constrains the next words. To minimize repetition and utterance length, languages use pronouns, like the word 'she', to refer to nouns and phrases that were previously introduced. It has been suggested that language comprehension requires that pronouns activate the same neuronal representations as the nouns themselves. Here, we test this hypothesis by recording from individual neurons in the human hippocampus during a reading task. We found that cells that are selective to a particular noun are later reactivated by pronouns that refer to the cells' preferred noun. These results imply that concept cells contribute to a rapid and dynamic semantic memory network which is recruited during language comprehension. This study uniquely demonstrates, at the single-cell level, how memory and language are linked.

">Presynaptic GABAA receptors control integration of nicotinic input onto dopaminergic axons in the striatum</a></h4>

              
                Axons of dopaminergic neurons express gamma-aminobutyric acid type-A receptors (GABAARs) and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) which are both independently positioned to shape striatal dopamine release. Using electrophysiology and calcium imaging, we investigated how interactions between GABAARs and nAChRs influence dopaminergic axon excitability. Direct axonal recordings showed that benzodiazepine application suppresses subthreshold axonal input from cholinergic interneurons (CINs). In imaging experiments, we used the first temporal derivative of presynaptic calcium signals to distinguish between direct- and nAChR-evoked activity in dopaminergic axons. We found that GABAAR antagonism with gabazine selectively enhanced nAChR-evoked axonal signals. Acetylcholine release was unchanged in gabazine suggesting that GABAARs located on dopaminergic axons, but not CINs, mediated this enhancement. Unexpectedly, we found that a widely used GABAAR antagonist, picrotoxin, inhibits axonal nAChRs and should be used cautiously for striatal circuit analysis. Overall, we demonstrate that GABAARs on dopaminergic axons regulate integration of nicotinic input to shape presynaptic excitability.

">Cortical Processing of Conspecific Vocalizations in Zebra Finches Depends on the Early Acoustical Environment</a></h4>

              
                Sensory experience during development has lasting effects on perception and neural processing. Exposing animals to artificial stimuli early in life influences the tuning and functional organization of the auditory cortex, but less is known about how the rich acoustical environments experienced by vocal communicators affect the processing of complex vocalizations. Here, we show that in zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata), a colonial-breeding songbird species, exposure to a naturalistic social-acoustical environment during development has a profound impact on cortical-level auditory responses to conspecific song. Compared to birds raised by pairs in acoustic isolation, birds raised in a breeding colony had higher average firing rates, selectivity, and discriminability, especially in the narrow-spiking, putatively inhibitory neurons of a higher-order auditory area, the caudomedial nidopallium (NCM). Neurons in colony-reared birds were also less correlated in their tuning and more efficient at encoding the spectrotemporal structure of conspecific song. These results suggest that the auditory cortex adapts to noisy, complex acoustical environments by strengthening inhibitory circuitry, functionally decoupling excitatory neurons while maintaining overall excitatory-inhibitory balance.

">Integrating episodic and spatial context signals in the hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                Episodic and spatial memory are the two key components of the mnemonic system in humans. Episodic memory enables us to remember events from the past whereas spatial memory enables us to form a map-like representation of the environment. Interestingly, these seemingly different functions rely on the same brain structure: the hippocampus. Yet, how the hippocampus supports both at the same time remains unclear. Here, we tested the hypotheses that the hippocampus supports these two systems either via a common coding mechanism or via a parallel processing mechanism. To this end, we combined functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with an episodic life-simulation task and a spatial virtual reality task to manipulate episodic and spatial context associations of objects. We then investigated fMRI adaptation effects between these objects as a result of shared contexts. We found that the fMRI signal in the anterior hippocampus scaled with the combined prediction of shared episodic and spatial contexts, in line with the idea of a common coding mechanism. We found no evidence for a parallel processing mechanism, as there were no differences between episodic and spatial effects. The common coding effect for episodic and spatial memory dovetails with the broader notion of domain-general hippocampal cognitive maps.

">Slow and steady: auditory features for discriminating animal vocalizations</a></h4>

              
                We propose that listeners can use temporal regularities, spectro-temporal correlations that change smoothly over time, to discriminate animal vocalizations within and between species. To test this idea, we used Slow Feature Analysis (SFA) to find the most temporally regular components of vocalizations from birds (blue jay, house finch, American yellow warbler, and great blue heron), humans (English speakers), and rhesus macaques. We projected vocalizations into the learned feature space and tested intra-class (same speaker/species) and inter-class (different speakers/species) auditory discrimination by a trained classifier. We found that: 1) Vocalization discrimination was excellent (> 95%) in all cases; 2) Performance depended primarily on the [~]10 most temporally regular features; 3) Most vocalizations are dominated by [~]10 features with high temporal regularity; and 4)These regular features are highly correlated with the most predictable components of animal sounds.

">An in vivo genetic screen identifies Crq as a potent glial regulator of synapse elimination in development and aging</a></h4>

              
                Neurons and glia work together to regulate neural circuit assembly and maintenance, but our understanding of how remains superficial. In this study, we establish that Drosophila exhibit large-scale synapse formation and elimination as part of circuit maturation, and that glia use conserved molecules to regulate these processes. We used a high throughput ELISA-based screening assay to identify new glial genes that regulate synapse numbers in Drosophila in vivo, including the scavenger receptor ortholog Croquemort (Crq). We found that Crq acts as an essential regulator of glial-dependent synapse elimination during development, leading to excess synapses and progressive seizure susceptibility in flies which lack Crq expression in glia. Loss of Crq in glia also prevents age-related synaptic loss. This work provides a platform to gain insight into the cellular and molecular mechanisms that underlie synapse development and maintenance across the lifespan, and identifies glial Crq as a key regulator of these processes.

">Central tendency and serial dependence in vestibular path integration</a></h4>

              
                Path integration, the process of updating one's position using successive self-motion signals, has previously been studied using visual distance reproduction tasks in which optic flow patterns provide information about traveled distance. These studies have reported that reproduced distances show two types of systematic biases: central tendency and serial dependence. In the present study, we investigated whether these biases are also present in vestibular path integration. Participants were seated on a linear motion platform and performed a distance reproduction task in total darkness. The platform first passively moved the participant a pre-defined stimulus distance which they then actively reproduced by steering the platform back the same distance. Stimulus distances were sampled from short- and long-distance probability distributions and presented in either a randomized order or in separate blocks to study the effect of presentation context. Similar to the effects observed in visual path integration, we found that reproduced distances showed an overall positive central tendency effect as well as a positive, attractive serial dependence effect. Furthermore, reproduction behavior was affected by presentation context. These results were mostly consistent with predictions of a Bayesian Kalman-filter model, originally proposed for visual path integration.

">α/β-Hydrolase domain-containing 6 (ABHD6) accelerates the desensitization and deactivation of TARP γ-2-containing AMPA receptors</a></h4>

              
                AMPA receptors (AMPARs) mediate most of the fast excitatory synaptic transmission in mammalian brain. Their efficacy in responding to presynaptic glutamate release depends on their kinetics, which are determined by AMPARs and their auxiliary subunit composition. /{beta}-Hydrolase domain-containing 6 (ABHD6) is an AMPAR auxiliary subunit that has been shown to negatively regulate the surface delivery of AMPARs and AMPAR-mediated currents. Overexpression of ABHD6 decreased the rising slope and increased the decay {tau} of mEPSCs. However, whether ABHD6 is involved in regulating AMPAR kinetics remains unclear. Here, we found that ABHD6 per se had no effects on the gating kinetics of GluA1 and GluA2(Q) containing homomeric receptors. However, in the presence of the auxiliary subunit TARP {gamma}-2, ABHD6 accelerated the deactivation and desensitization of either GluA1 and GluA2(Q) containing homomeric receptors independent of their splicing isoforms (flip and flop) and the editing isoforms of GluA2 (R or G at position 764), except the deactivation of GluA2(Q)i-G isoform. Besides, the recovery from desensitization of GluA1 with flip splicing isoform was slowed by the co-expression of ABHD6 in the presence of TARP {gamma}-2. Furthermore, the ABHD6 accelerated the deactivation and desensitization of GluA1i/GluA2(R)i-G heteromeric receptors in the presence of TARP {gamma}-2. Therefore, these results demonstrate that ABHD6 regulates AMPAR gating kinetics in a TARP {gamma}-2-dependent manner.

                The motor cortical regions have undergone evolutionary expansion and specialization from rodents to primates. Therefore, the study of these regions in non-human primates (NHPs) is relevant to understand motor control in healthy conditions or in NHP models of movement disorders. The use of calcium imaging and miniature microscopes allows the study of multiple individual neurons in cortical regions. We used this method to examine the activities of supplementary motor area (SMA) and primary motor region (M1) in four rhesus macaques. We implanted gradient index (GRIN) lenses and expressed GCaMP6f in cortical projection neurons in these regions and imaged calcium transients for weeks to months while the animals were at rest (spontaneous or idle condition) or engaged in a simple arm reaching task. We found that in a proportion of cells, in both cortical regions, the calcium activity was directionally tuned during the arm reaching task, in agreement with previous electrophysiological findings. We identified pairs of cells, scattered across the imaging fields in SMA and M1, with synchronous activity. Finally, we found that neurons in SMA and M1 have calcium transients that occur in precisely timed sequences, and that the sequences and neuronal ensembles participating in the sequences are dynamic. The microendoscopic calcium imaging technique can be used to examine calcium dynamics in groups of corticofugal neurons in SMA and M1 and compare patterns of activity among cells.

                Complex movements involve highly coordinated control of local muscle elements. Highly controlled perturbations of motor outputs can reveal insights into the neural control of movements. Here we introduce an optogenetic method, compatible with electromyography (EMG) recordings, to perturb muscles in transgenic mice. By expressing channelrhodopsin in muscle fibers, we achieved noninvasive, focal activation of orofacial muscles, enabling detailed examination of the mechanical properties of optogenetically evoked jaw muscle contractions. We demonstrated simultaneous EMG recording and optical stimulation, revealing the electrophysiological characteristics of optogenetically triggered muscle activity. Additionally, we applied optogenetic activation of muscles in physiologically and behaviorally relevant settings, mapping precise muscle actions and perturbing active behaviors. Our findings highlight the potential of muscle optogenetics to precisely manipulate muscle activity, offering a powerful tool for probing neuromuscular control systems and advancing our understanding of motor control.

                Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative condition, with 20% of familial and 2-3% of sporadic cases linked to mutations in the cytosolic superoxide dismutase (SOD1) gene. Mutant SOD1 protein is toxic to motor neurons, making SOD1 gene lowering a promising approach, supported by preclinical data and the 2023 FDA approval of the GapmeR ASO targeting SOD1, tofersen. Despite the approval of an ASO and the optimism it brings to the field, the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of therapeutic SOD1 modulation can be improved. Here, we developed a chemically stabilized divalent siRNA scaffold (di-siRNA) that effectively suppresses SOD1 expression in vitro and in vivo. With optimized chemical modification, it achieves remarkable CNS tissue permeation and SOD1 silencing in vivo. Administered intraventricularly, di-siRNASOD1 extended survival in SOD1-G93A ALS mice, surpassing survival previously seen in these mice by ASO modalities, slowed disease progression, and prevented ALS neuropathology. These properties offer an improved therapeutic strategy for SOD1-mediated ALS and may extend to other dominantly inherited neurological disorders.

">Weakly nonlinear responses at low intrinsic noise levels in two types of electrosensory primary afferents</a></h4>

              
                Neuronal processing is inherently nonlinear -spiking thresholds or rectification in synapses are central to neuronal computations. Nevertheless, linear response theory has been instrumental in understanding, for example, the impact of noise or synchronous spikes on signal transmission, or the emergence of oscillatory activity. At higher signal-to-noise ratios, however, the third term in the Volterra series becomes relevant. This second-order susceptibility captures nonlinear interactions between pairs of stimulus frequencies. Theoretical results for leaky integrate-and-fire neurons suggest strong responses at the sum of two input frequencies only when these frequencies or their sum match the neuron's baseline firing rate. We here analyze second-order susceptibilities in two types of primary electroreceptor afferents, P-units of the active and ampullary cells of the passive electrosensory system of the wave-type electric fish Apteronotus leptorhynchus. In our combined experimental and modeling approach we find the predicted weakly nonlinear responses in some P-units with very low baseline interspike-interval variability and much stronger in all ampullary cells, which are less noisy than P-units. Such nonlinear responses boost responses to weak sinusoidal stimuli and are therefore of immediate relevance for wave-type electric fish that are exposed to superpositions of many frequencies in social contexts.

">Aberrant TSC-Rheb axis in Oxytocin receptor+ cells mediate stress-induced anxiety</a></h4>

              
                Stress is a major risk for the onset of several maladaptive processes including pathological anxiety, a diffuse state of heightened apprehension over anticipated threats. Pathological anxiety is prevalent in up to 59% of patients with Tuberous Sclerosis complex (TSC), a neurodevelopmental disorder (NDD) caused by loss-of-function mutations in genes for Tuberin (Tsc2) and/or Hamartin (Tsc1) that together comprise the eponymous protein complex. Here, we generated cell type-specific heterozygous knockout of Tsc2 in cells expressing oxytocin receptor (OTRCs) to model pathological anxiety-like behaviors observed in TSC patient population. The stress of prolonged social isolation induces a sustained negative affective state that precipitates behavioral avoidance, often by aberrant oxytocin signaling in the limbic forebrain. In response to social isolation, there were striking sex differences in stress susceptibility in conditional heterozygote mice when encountering situations of approach-avoidance conflict. Socially isolated male mutants exhibited behavioral avoidance in anxiogenic environments and sought more social interaction for buffering of stress. In contrast, female mutants developed resilience during social isolation and approached anxiogenic environments, while devaluing social interaction. Systemic and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC)-specific inhibition of downstream effector of TSC, the integrated stress response (ISR), rescued behavioral approach toward anxiogenic environments and conspecifics in male and female mutant mice respectively. Further, we found that Tsc2 deletion in OTRCs leads to OTR-signaling elicited network suppression, i.e., hypofrontality, in male mPFC, which is relieved by inhibiting the ISR. Our findings present evidence in support of a sexually dimorphic role of prefrontal OTRCs in regulating emotional responses in anxiogenic environments, which goes awry in TSC. Our work has broader implications for developing effective treatments for subtypes of anxiety disorders that are characterized by cell-autonomous ISR and prefrontal network suppression.

">Using fingerprinting as a testbed for strategies to improve reproducibility of functional connectivity</a></h4>

              
                Reproducible functional connectivity-based biomarkers have remained elusive despite the promise of deeply phenotyped consortia. An important component of reproducibility is reliability over repeated measures, often measured by the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Here, we test the use of functional connectome fingerprinting as a way to select pre- and post-processing parameters. We hypothesized that whichever parameters yielded the best fingerprint accuracies would also improve the ICC across scans. Using five datasets from the Consortium for Replicability and Reproducibility, we found that higher identification accuracies were achieved when using: (I) global signal regression; (II) finer brain parcellations; (III) cortical regions compared to subcortical and cerebellar structures; (IV) medial frontal and frontoparietal networks relative to the whole-brain; (V) discriminative edges; (VI) longer scan duration; and (VII) lower sample size. We observed that the ICC was consistently "poor" across the five datasets even with the application of two optimal fingerprint-informed pipelines. The fingerprint-informed pipelines may enable comparison, benchmarking, and adjudication of functional connectivity-based analysis pipelines or novel analytic approaches, as a means to enhance their reproducibility in heterogeneous populations.

">Piezo1 and Piezo2 channels in retinal ganglion cells and the impact of Piezo1 stimulation on light-dependent neural activity</a></h4>

              
                Piezo channels are associated with neuropathology in diseases like traumatic brain injury and glaucoma, but pathways linking tissue stretch to aberrant neural signaling remain unclear. The present study demonstrates that Piezo1 activation increases action potential frequency in response to light and the spontaneous dark signal from mouse retinal explants. Piezo1 stimulation was sufficient to increase cytoplasmic Ca2+ in soma and neurites, while stretch increased spiking activity in current clamp recordings from of isolated retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). Axon-marker beta-tubulin III colocalized with both Piezo1 and Piezo2 protein in the mouse optic nerve head, while RGC nuclear marker BRN3A colocalized with Piezo channels in the soma. Piezo1 was also present on GFAP-positive regions in the optic nerve head and colocalized with glutamine synthetase in the nerve fiber layer, suggesting expression in optic nerve head astrocytes and Muller glia end feet, respectively. Human RGCs from induced pluripotent stem cells also expressed Piezo1 and Piezo2 in soma and axons, while staining patterns in rats resembled those in mice. mRNA message for Piezo1 was greatest in the RPE/choroid tissue, while Piezo2 levels were highest in the optic nerve, with both channels also expressed in the retina. Increased expression of Piezo1 and Piezo2 occurred both 1 and 10 days after a single stretch in vivo; this increase suggests a potential role in rising sensitivity to repeated nerve stretch. In summary, Piezo1 and Piezo2 were detected in the soma and axons of RGCs, and stimulation affected the light-dependent output of RGCs. The rise in RGCs excitability induced by Piezo stimulation may have parallels to the early disease progression in models of glaucoma and other retinal degenerations.

                The recent positively tuned ASAP4-family voltage indicators feature superior photostability compared to the negatively tuned ASAP3, but signal-to-noise ratios for spike detection were not significantly different. To improve spike detection by positively tuned ASAP indicators, we performed multiple rounds of structure-guided saturation mutagenesis of an ASAP4 template while screening directly for faster responses. Our resulting variants, ASAP6.1 and ASAP6b, demonstrated sufficient dynamic range and kinetics, and reported action potentials in vivo by one-photon and two-photon microscopy with high SNR and temporal resolution.

">When your heart isn't in it anymore: Cardiac correlates of task disengagement</a></h4>

              
                Neuroscience is beginning to uncover the role of interoceptive feedback in perception, learning, and decision-making; however, the relation between spontaneous visceral and cognitive dynamics has received surprisingly little scrutiny. Here, we investigate how subjective, physiological, and behavioural indicators of arousal and attentional state vary as a function of cardiac activity and brain-heart coupling. Combined electroencephalogram, electrocardiogram, and pupillometric records were obtained from 25 healthy human adults during the performance of a sustained attention to response task (SART). Thought-probes were intermittently administered during the SART to collect subjective reports of attentional state (i.e., on-task, mind-wandering, mind-blanking) and vigilance level (i.e., alertness). Mind-wandering and mind-blanking reports increased in frequency with time-on-task, but were associated with distinct behavioural profiles. Mind-blanking was further characterised by more profound decreases in heart-rate and pupil size than mind-wandering, and late modulation of the heartbeat-evoked potential. Besides attentional state, lower heart-rate predicted decreased vigilance and pupil size, while heart-rate variability predicted more impulsive behaviour and pupil dilation. Together, these findings reveal that cardiac parameters afford complementary information about arousal states and attentional dynamics, illustrating the complexity of task disengagement from a cognitive and physiological perspective.

">Mapping Individual Differences in the Topological Landscape of Naturalistic Brain Dynamics</a></h4>

              
                Naturalistic stimuli elicit rich subjective experiences through adaptive neural coordination. However, how inherent behavioral traits shape individual neural dynamics in naturalistic settings remains unclear. Here, we introduce a computational framework, STIM, to systematically capture individual differences in brain dynamics while watching diverse movie stimuli. By leveraging Topological Data Analysis, STIM generates a robust group-level dynamical landscape of brain latent states, mapping individual-specific divergence into global topology and local geometry. Applying STIM to large-sample movie fMRI datasets, we found that inter-individual variation in global topology exhibits a center-periphery gradient in the landscape. This gradient significantly explains individual fluid intelligence from a dual perspective, highlighting the importance of both adaptability and diversity of neural dynamics. At the fine-grained narrative level, individual local geometry attributes are associated with context-specific psychological traits beyond cognition. Furthermore, STIM reveals how the dynamical landscape evolves across neurodevelopment and exhibits abnormalities in psychiatric disorders such as autism. In summary, the STIM framework has the potential to transform rich naturalistic stimuli with brain recording into neural 'probes' to measure individual differences in cognition and mental health.

">Breathing modulates network activity in frontal brain regions during anxiety</a></h4>

              
                Anxiety elicits various physiological responses, including changes in respiratory rate and neuronal activity within specific brain regions such as the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Previous research suggests that the olfactory bulb (OB) modulates the mPFC through respiration-coupled neuronal oscillations (RCOs), which have been linked to fear-related freezing behavior. Nevertheless, the impact of breathing on frontal brain networks during other negative emotional responses, such as anxiety-related states characterized by higher breathing rates, remains unclear. To address this, we subjected rats to the elevated plus maze (EPM) paradigm while simultaneously recording respiration and local field potentials in the OB and mPFC. Our findings demonstrate distinct respiratory patterns during EPM exploration: slower breathing frequencies prevailed in the closed arms, whereas faster frequencies were observed in the open arms, independent of locomotor activity, indicating that anxiety-like states are associated with increased respiratory rates. Additionally, we identified RCOs at different frequencies, mirroring the bimodal distribution of respiratory frequencies. RCOs exhibited higher power during open arm exploration, when they showed greater coherence with breathing at faster frequencies. Furthermore, we confirmed that nasal respiration drives RCOs in frontal brain regions, and found a stronger effect during faster breathing. Interestingly, we observed that the frequency of prefrontal gamma oscillations modulated by respiration increased with heightened anxiety levels and breathing frequency. Overall, our study provides evidence for a significant influence of breathing on prefrontal cortex networks during anxious states, shedding light on the complex interplay between respiratory physiology and emotional processing.

">Onset of α5GABA-A Receptor Dependent Hippocampal Trisynaptic Circuit Dysfunction Is Associated Increased Age and Blood Pressure</a></h4>

              
                Hypertension onset with aging is of widespread clinical significance, predominantly in males, yet the neural circuitry underpinnings for hypertension associated memory dysfunction remains unknown. Sprague Dawley (SD) male but not female rats develop age dependent increases in mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) by 16 months of age. We sought to interrogate the functional integrity of the hippocampal trisynaptic circuit (HTC), which is known to participate in memory, to determine whether age-associated increases in MAP contributes to circuitry dysfunction that may lead to mild-cognitive impairment (MCR). Ripples, and specifically sharp-wave ripple oscillations, play a role in memory replay and consolidation during awake immobility among other behaviors. These synchronous high frequency local field potentials (LFPs) in the ripple band (140 to 200 Hz) serve as an HTC level surrogate marker for circuitry function in rodents, non-human primates, and humans. Thus, we asked whether age-associated increased MAP might alter ripple dynamics. Recognizing that each patient responds in a unique way to hypertension we used a within subject design wherein each animal served as its own control in the investigative model. We surgically implanted high density silicon probe electrodes in HTC CA1 of young and aged SD males to determine whether a nootropic drug, 5IA, a negative allosteric modulator of 5 subunit containing type-A GABA receptors, could detect aberrant modulation of ripples within each subject. Here we report that acute oral administration of 5IA selectively modulated ripple amplitude, but not its duration or frequency during epochs of awake immobility. The response of peak ripple amplitude to 5IA is substantially diminished when chronic MAP exceeds 160 mmHg, corresponding to significant hypertension. The results are consistent with a model in which age-associated increases in MAP is associated with dysfunctional 5 GABA-A receptor modulation of ripple amplitude, but not duration or frequency, as a potential precision biomarker for memory dysfunction.

                This study characterizes a fluorescent Slc17a6-tdTomato neuronal reporter mouse line offering strong labeling in axons throughout the optic nerve, dendrites and soma in 99% of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). The model facilitates neuronal assessment ex vivo with wholemounts quantified to show neurodegeneration following optic nerve crush or elevated IOP as related to glaucoma, in vitro with robust Ca2+ responses to P2X7 receptor stimulation in neuronal cultures, and in vivo using a confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscope (cSLO). While the tdTomato signal showed strong overlap with RGC markers, BRN3A and RBPMS, there was no cross-labeling of displaced amacrine cells in the ganglion cell layer. Controls indicated no impact of Slc17a6-tdTomato expression on light-dependent neuronal function, as determined with a microelectrode array (MEA), or on structure, as measured with optical coherence tomography (OCT). In summary, this novel neuronal reporter mouse model offers an effective means to increase the efficiency for real-time, specific visualization of retinal ganglion cells. It holds substantial promise for enhancing our understanding of RGC pathology in glaucoma and other diseases of the optic nerve, and could facilitate the screening of targeted therapeutic interventions for neurodegeneration.

">Ketamine-Induced Unresponsiveness Shows a Harmonic Shift from Global to Localised Functional Organisation.</a></h4>

              
                Ketamine is classified as a dissociative anaesthetic that, in sub-anaesthetic doses, can produce an altered state of consciousness characterised by dissociative symptoms, visual and auditory hallucinations, and perceptual distortions. Given the anaesthetic-like and psychedelic-like nature of this compound, it is expected to have different effects on brain dynamics in anaesthetic doses than in low, sub-anaesthetic doses. We investigated this question using connectome harmonic decomposition (CHD), a recently developed method to decompose brain activity in terms of the network organisation of the underlying human structural connectome. Previous research using this method has revealed connectome harmonic signatures of consciousness and responsiveness, with increased influence of global network structure in disorders of consciousness and propofol-induced sedation, and increased influence of localised patterns under the influence of classic psychedelics and sub-anaesthetic doses of ketamine, as compared to normal wakefulness. When we applied the CHD analytical framework to resting-state fMRI data of volunteers during ketamine-induced unresponsiveness, we found increased prevalence of localised harmonics, reminiscent of altered states of consciousness. This is different from traditional GABAergic sedation, where instead the prevalence of global rather than localised harmonics seems to increase with higher doses. In addition, we found that ketamine's harmonic signature shows higher alignment with those seen in LSD- or psilocybin-induced psychedelic states than those seen in unconscious individuals, whether due to propofol sedation or brain injury. Together, the results indicate that ketamine-induced unresponsiveness, which does not necessarily suppress conscious experience, seems to influence the prevalence of connectome harmonics in the opposite way compared to GABAergic hypnotics. We conclude that the CHD framework offers the possibility to track alterations in conscious awareness (e.g., dreams, sensations) rather than behavioural responsiveness - a discovery made possible by ketamine's unique property of decoupling these two facets.

">Suppressing phagocyte activation by overexpressing the phosphatidylserine lipase ABHD12 preserves sarmopathic nerves</a></h4>

              
                Programmed axon degeneration (AxD) is a key feature of many neurodegenerative diseases. In healthy axons, the axon survival factor NMNAT2 inhibits SARM1, the central executioner of AxD, preventing it from initiating the rapid local NAD+ depletion and metabolic catastrophe that precipitates axon destruction. Because these components of the AxD pathway act within neurons, it was also assumed that the timetable of AxD was set strictly by a cell-intrinsic mechanism independent of neuron-extrinsic processes later activated by axon fragmentation. However, using a rare human disease model of neuropathy caused by hypomorphic NMNAT2 mutations and chronic SARM1 activation (sarmopathy), we demonstrated that neuronal SARM1 can initiate macrophage-mediated axon elimination long before stressed-but-viable axons would otherwise succumb to cell-intrinsic metabolic failure. Investigating potential SARM1-dependent signals that mediate macrophage recognition and/or engulfment of stressed-but-viable axons, we found that chronic SARM1 activation triggers axonal blebbing and dysregulation of phosphatidylserine (PS), a potent phagocyte immunomodulatory molecule. Neuronal expression of the phosphatidylserine lipase ABDH12 suppresses nerve macrophage activation, preserves motor axon integrity, and rescues motor function in this chronic sarmopathy model. We conclude that PS dysregulation is an early SARM1-dependent axonal stress signal, and that blockade of phagocytic recognition and engulfment of stressed-but-viable axons could be an attractive therapeutic target for management of neurological disorders involving SARM1 activation.

">Proteomic Analysis of Dorsal Root Ganglia in a Mouse Model of Paclitaxel-Induced Neuropathic Pain</a></h4>

              
                Paclitaxel is a chemotherapy drug widely used for the treatment of various cancers based on its ability to potently stabilize microtubules blocking division in cancer cells. Paclitaxel-based treatment, however, accumulates in peripheral system sensory neurons and leads to a high incidence rate (over 60%) of chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy. Using an established preclinical model of paclitaxel-induced peripheral neuropathy (PIPN), we examined proteomic changes in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) of adult male mice that were treated with paclitaxel (8 mg/kg, at 4 injections every other day) at a concentration shown to induce mechanical and cold allodynia. High throughput proteomic analysis using liquid chromatography electrospray ionization mass spectrometry identified 165 significantly altered proteins within lumbar DRG in response to paclitaxel administration. Gene ontology enrichment and bioinformatic analysis revealed an effect of paclitaxel on key pathways for mitochondrial regulation, axonal function, and inflammatory as well as purinergic signaling. Proteomic findings also confirmed the effect of paclitaxel on microtubule properties within the DRG. Our findings provide insight into molecular mechanisms that can contribute to PIPN in patients.

	<p>The neuropsychological diagnosis and assessment of alexia remain formidable due to its multifaceted presentations and the intricate neural underpinnings involved. The current study employed a mixed-method design, incorporating cluster and thematic analyses, to illuminate the complexities of alexia assessment. We used the Web of Science and Scopus to retrieve articles spanning from 1985 to February 2024. Our selection was based on identified keywords in relation to the assessment and diagnosis of alexia. The analysis of 449 articles using CiteSpace (Version 6.3.R1) and VOSviewer (Version 1.6.19) software identified ten key clusters such as &amp;amp;lsquo;pure alexia&amp;amp;rsquo; and &amp;amp;lsquo;posterior cortical atrophy&amp;amp;rsquo;, highlighting the breadth of research within this field. The thematic analysis of the most cited and recent studies led to eight essential categories. These categories were synthesized into a conceptual model that illustrates the interaction between neural, cognitive, and diagnostic aspects, in accordance with the International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health (ICFDH) framework. This model emphasizes the need for comprehensive diagnostic approaches extending beyond traditional reading assessments to include specific tasks like character identification, broader visual processing, and numerical tasks. Future diagnostic models should incorporate a diverse array of alexia types and support the creation of advanced assessment tools, ultimately improving clinical practice and research.</p>

	<p>Focal forms of epilepsy can result from a wide range of insults and can vary from focal symptoms to generalized convulsions. Most drugs that have been developed for epilepsy focus on the prevention of seizures. On Electroencephalography (EEG), seizures are characterized by a repetitive buildup of epileptic waveforms that can spread across the brain. Brain regions that produce seizures generate far more frequent &amp;amp;lsquo;interictal&amp;amp;rsquo; spikes seen between seizures, and in animal models, these spikes occur prior to the development of seizures. Interictal spiking by itself has been shown to have significant adverse clinical effects on cognition and behavior in both patients and animal models. While the exact relationships between interictal spiking and seizures are not well defined, interictal spikes serve as an important biomarker that, for some forms of epilepsy, can serve as a surrogate biomarker and as a druggable target. While there are many animal models of seizures for drug development, here we review models of interictal spiking, focusing on tetanus toxin, to study the relationship between interictal spiking, seizures, cognition, and behavior. Studies on human cortical regions with frequent interictal spiking have identified potential therapeutic targets; therefore, having a highly consistent model of spiking will be invaluable not only for unraveling the initial stages of the pathological cascade leading to seizure development but also for testing novel therapeutics. This review offers a succinct overview of the use of tetanus toxin animal models for studying and therapeutic development for interictal spiking.</p>

	<p>Transfer RNAs (tRNAs) are well-known for their essential function in protein synthesis. Recent research has revealed a diverse range of chemical modifications that tRNAs undergo, which are crucial for various cellular processes. These modifications are necessary for the precise and efficient translation of proteins and also play important roles in gene expression regulation and cellular stress response. This review examines the role of tRNA modifications and dysregulation in the pathophysiology of various brain diseases, including epilepsy, stroke, neurodevelopmental disorders, brain tumors, Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease, and Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease. Through a comprehensive analysis of existing research, our study aims to elucidate the intricate relationship between tRNA dysregulation and brain diseases. This underscores the critical need for ongoing exploration in this field and provides valuable insights that could facilitate the development of innovative diagnostic tools and therapeutic approaches, ultimately improving outcomes for individuals grappling with complex neurological conditions.</p>

                Background The quality of registry based studies depends largely on the data accuracy of the registries. The Dutch Perinatal Registry (Perined) is a nationwide database comprising perinatal data digitally provided by different healthcare providers. Perined data are used for comparing outcomes across regions and healthcare institutions as well as for quality analyses and research purposes. However, little is known about the data quality of the Perined database. Therefore, the aim of this study is to assess the quality of Perined data compared to hospital records and case report forms (CRFs) that were part of the IUGR Risk Selection (IRIS) study. Methods In this comparison study data from Perined and the IRIS Study will be used. The IRIS study was a large cluster-randomized trial investigating the effectiveness of routine third trimester ultrasonography in reducing severe adverse perinatal outcomes among Dutch low-risk pregnant women. A subsample of the IRIS study of neonates being at risk of severe adverse perinatal outcomes and their mothers will be used. Baseline demographic data were collected by midwives from participating women at inclusion (around 22 weeks’ gestation) using CRFs, and in-depth neonatal and maternal clinical data were retrieved from hospital records by trained research assistants. These latter IRIS study data were linked and compared to Perined data. Completeness of Perined data will be calculated for every variable. The reliability will be assessed as the percent of agreement between Perined and hospital record data or the CRF-based data. Additionally, intra-class correlation coefficients will be calculated for continuous variables, and Kappa and ‘Prevalence-and-Bias-Adjusted Kappa’ will be calculated for categorical variables. Discussion The results of the proposed comparison study will provide users of Perined data insight in its data quality. This will serve as an example of the accuracy of registry based data used in maternal and neonatal care research.

                Background: Major trauma places substantial demand on critical care services, is a leading cause of death in under 40-year-olds and causes significant morbidity and mortality across all age groups. Various factors influence patient outcome and predefining these could allow prognostication. The aim of this study was to identify predictors of mortality from major trauma in intensive care. Methods: This was a retrospective study of adult trauma patients admitted to general intensive care between January 2018 and December 2019. We assessed the impact on mortality of patient demographics, patterns of injury, injury scores (Glasgow Coma Score (GCS), Charlson’s comorbidity index (CCI), Acute Physiology and Health Evaluation II (APACHE II), Injury Severity Score (ISS) and Probability of Survival Score (Ps19)), number of surgeries and mechanism of injury using logistic regression. Results: A total of 414 patients were included with a median age of 54 years (IQR 34–72). Overall mortality was 18.6%. The most common mechanism of injury was traffic collision (46%). Non-survivors were older, had higher ISS scores with lower GCS on admission and probability of survival scores. Factors independently predictive of mortality were increasing age (OR 1.06, p <0.001) and GCS <15 on admission (OR 7.21, p <0.001). Ps19 was the best predictor of mortality (p <0.001 for each score category), with an AUROC of 0.90. Conclusions: The significant mortality predictors were age, fall from <2 metres, injury of head or limbs, GCS <15 and Ps19. Contrary to previous studies CCI and APACHE II did not significantly predict mortality. Although Ps19 was found to be the best current prognostic score, trauma prognostication would benefit from a single validated scoring system incorporating both physiological variables and injury patterns.

                Background Empirical studies on the impact of devaluation in developing countries, including Ethiopia, have revealed diverse and mixed results. The effects can be positive or negative depending on the specific economic context and policies in place.This study addresses the devaluation puzzle by providing a more comprehensive and nuanced understanding of how devaluation affects the balance of payments and output. Methods To achieve this, we employ a recursive structural vector autoregressive (SVAR) model focusing on Ethiopia from 2001Q1 to 2023Q4. Results The findings reveal that exchange rate shocks negatively affect the balance of payments in both the short and long run, with a greater impact observed in the short run. Shocks in other variables, such as foreign exchange rate reserves, inflation, and interest rates, exert a stronger influence on the balance of payments than the exchange rate itself in the long run. In addition, shocks in the exchange rate significantly impact foreign exchange rate reserves in the long run, highlighting the complex dynamics of exchange rates and the indirect nature of the exchange rate channel. Exchange rate shocks also negatively impact output growth in both the short and long run. Conclusion The study concludes that devaluation has a contractionary effect through various channels. Devaluation increases the money supply, leading to inflationary pressures and a decline in output. It also increases interest rates, which further reduces output. In addition, devaluation reduces foreign exchange reserves, resulting in a fall in the balance of payments and a decrease in output. We suggest policymakers prioritize exchange rate stability through practical monetary and fiscal policies. In general, International financial institutions, particularly the National Bank of Ethiopia, should reconsider their devaluation-focused policies, considering the complexities and potential negative consequences associated with devaluation.

                <p>by Hyeonuk Woo, Yubeen Kim, Chaok Seok</p>

As of now, more than 60 years have passed since the first determination of protein structures through crystallography, and a significant portion of protein structures can be predicted by computers. This is due to the groundbreaking enhancement in protein structure prediction achieved through neural network training utilizing extensive sequence and structure data. However, substantial challenges persist in structure prediction due to limited data availability, with antibody structure prediction standing as one such challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel neural network architecture that effectively enables structure prediction by reflecting the inherent combinatorial nature involved in protein structure formation. The core idea of this neural network architecture is not solely to track and generate a single structure but rather to form a community of multiple structures and pursue accurate structure prediction by exchanging information among community members. Applying this concept to antibody CDR H3 loop structure prediction resulted in improved structure sampling. Such an approach could be applied in the structural and functional studies of proteins, particularly in exploring various physiological processes mediated by loops. Moreover, it holds potential in addressing various other types of combinatorial structure prediction and design problems.

Genome-scale metabolic models (GSMMs) offer a holistic view of biochemical reaction networks, enabling in-depth analyses of metabolism across species and tissues in multiple conditions. However, comparing GSMMs Against each other poses challenges as current dimensionality reduction algorithms or clustering methods lack mechanistic interpretability, and often rely on subjective assumptions. Here, we propose a new approach utilizing logisitic principal component analysis (LPCA) that efficiently clusters GSMMs while singling out mechanistic differences in terms of reactions and pathways that drive the categorization. We applied LPCA to multiple diverse datasets, including GSMMs of 222 <i>Escherichia</i>-strains, 343 budding yeasts (<i>Saccharomycotina</i>), 80 human tissues, and 2943 <i>Firmicutes</i> strains. Our findings demonstrate LPCA’s effectiveness in preserving microbial phylogenetic relationships and discerning human tissue-specific metabolic profiles, exhibiting comparable performance to traditional methods like t-distributed stochastic neighborhood embedding (t-SNE) and Jaccard coefficients. Moreover, the subsystems and associated reactions identified by LPCA align with existing knowledge, underscoring its reliability in dissecting GSMMs and uncovering the underlying drivers of separation.

Biological structures are defined by rigid elements, such as bones, and elastic elements, like muscles and membranes. Computer vision advances have enabled automatic tracking of moving animal skeletal poses. Such developments provide insights into complex time-varying dynamics of biological motion. Conversely, the elastic soft-tissues of organisms, like the nose of elephant seals, or the buccal sac of frogs, are poorly studied and no computer vision methods have been proposed. This leaves major gaps in different areas of biology. In primatology, most critically, the function of air sacs is widely debated; many open questions on the role of air sacs in the evolution of animal communication, including human speech, remain unanswered. To support the dynamic study of soft-tissue structures, we present a toolkit for the automated tracking of semi-circular elastic structures in biological video data. The toolkit contains unsupervised computer vision tools (using Hough transform) and supervised deep learning (by adapting DeepLabCut) methodology to track inflation of laryngeal air sacs or other biological spherical objects (e.g., gular cavities). Confirming the value of elastic kinematic analysis, we show that air sac inflation correlates with acoustic markers that likely inform about body size. Finally, we present a pre-processed audiovisual-kinematic dataset of 7+ hours of closeup audiovisual recordings of siamang (<i>Symphalangus syndactylus</i>) singing. This toolkit (https://github.com/WimPouw/AirSacTracker) aims to revitalize the study of non-skeletal morphological structures across multiple species.

Carbohydrates and glycoproteins modulate key biological functions. However, experimental structure determination of sugar polymers is notoriously difficult. Computational approaches can aid in carbohydrate structure prediction, structure determination, and design. In this work, we developed a glycan-modeling algorithm, <i>GlycanTreeModeler</i>, that computationally builds glycans layer-by-layer, using adaptive kernel density estimates (KDE) of common glycan conformations derived from data in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) and from quantum mechanics (QM) calculations. <i>GlycanTreeModeler</i> was benchmarked on a test set of glycan structures of varying lengths, or “trees”. Structures predicted by <i>GlycanTreeModeler</i> agreed with native structures at high accuracy for both <i>de novo</i> modeling and experimental density-guided building. We employed these tools to design <i>de novo</i> glycan trees into a protein nanoparticle vaccine to shield regions of the scaffold from antibody recognition, and experimentally verified shielding. This work will inform glycoprotein model prediction, glycan masking, and further aid computational methods in experimental structure determination and refinement.

                <p>by Praveen Kumar Viswanathan, Aline Chessel, Maria Dolores Molina, Emmanuel Haillot, Thierry Lepage</p>

In the highly regulative embryo of the sea urchin <i>Paracentrotus lividus</i>, establishment of the dorsal-ventral (D/V) axis critically depends on the zygotic expression of the TGF-β <i>nodal</i> in the ventral ectoderm. <i>nodal</i> expression is first induced ubiquitously in the 32-cell embryo and becomes progressively restricted to the presumptive ventral ectoderm by the early blastula stage. This early spatial restriction of <i>nodal</i> expression is independent of Lefty, and instead relies on the activity of Panda, a maternally expressed TGF-β ligand related to Lefty and Inhibins, which is required maternally for D/V axis specification. However, the mechanism by which Panda restricts the early <i>nodal</i> expression has remained enigmatic and it is not known if Panda works like a BMP ligand by opposing Nodal and antagonizing Smad2/3 signaling, or if it works like Lefty by sequestering an essential component of the Nodal signaling pathway. In this study, we report that Panda functions as an antagonist of the TGF-β type II receptor ACVRII (Activin receptor type II), which is the only type II receptor for Nodal signaling in the sea urchin and is also a type II receptor for BMP ligands. Inhibiting translation of <i>acvrII</i> mRNA disrupted D/V patterning across all 3 germ layers and caused <i>acvrII</i> morphants to develop with a typical Nodal loss-of-function phenotype. In contrast, embryos overexpressing <i>acvrII</i> displayed strong ectopic Smad1/5/8 signaling at blastula stages and developed as dorsalized larvae, a phenotype very similar to that caused by over activation of BMP signaling. Remarkably, embryos co-injected with <i>acvrII</i> mRNA and <i>panda</i> mRNA did not show ectopic Smad1/5/8 signaling and developed with a largely normal dorsal-ventral polarity. Furthermore, using an axis induction assay, we found that Panda blocks the ability of ACVRII to orient the D/V axis when overexpressed locally. Using co-immunoprecipitation, we showed that Panda physically interacts with ACVRII, as well as with the Nodal co-receptor Cripto, and with TBR3 (Betaglycan), which is a non-signaling receptor for Inhibins in mammals. At the molecular level, we have traced back the antagonistic activity of Panda to the presence of a single proline residue, conserved with all the Lefty factors, in the ACVRII binding motif of Panda, instead of a serine as in most of TGF-β ligands. Conversion of this proline to a serine converted Panda from an antagonist that opposed Nodal signaling and promoted dorsalization to an agonist that promoted Nodal signaling and triggered ventralization when overexpressed. Finally, using phylogenomics, we analyzed the emergence of the agonist and antagonist form of Panda in the course of evolution. Our data are consistent with the idea that the presence of a serine at that position, like in most TGF-β, was the ancestral condition and that the initial function of Panda was possibly in promoting and not in antagonizing Nodal signaling. These results highlight the existence of key functional and structural elements conserved between Panda and Lefty, allow to draw an intriguing parallel between sea urchin Panda and mammalian Inhibin α and raise the unexpected possibility that the original function of Panda may have been in activation of the Nodal pathway rather than in its inhibition.

<br/>
<p>Amyloid neuropathy is caused by deposition of insoluble β-pleated amyloid sheets in the peripheral nervous system. It is most common in: (1) light-chain amyloidosis, a clonal non-proliferative plasma cell disorder in which fragments of immunoglobulin, light or heavy chain, deposit in tissues, and (2) hereditary transthyretin (ATTRv) amyloidosis, a disorder caused by autosomal dominant mutations in the <i>TTR</i> gene resulting in mutated protein that has a higher tendency to misfold. Amyloid fibrils deposit in the endoneurium of peripheral nerves, often extensive in the dorsal root ganglia and sympathetic ganglia, leading to atrophy of Schwann cells in proximity to amyloid fibrils and blood–nerve barrier disruption. Clinically, amyloid neuropathy is manifested as a length-dependent sensory predominant neuropathy associated with generalized autonomic failure. Small unmyelinated nerves are involved early and prominently in early-onset Val30Met ATTRv, whereas other ATTRv and light-chain amyloidosis often present with large- and small-fiber involvement. Nerve conduction studies, quantitative sudomotor axon testing, and intraepidermal nerve fiber density are useful tools to evaluate denervation. Amyloid deposition can be demonstrated by tissue biopsy of the affected organ or surrogate site, as well as bone-avid radiotracer cardiac imaging. Treatment of light-chain amyloidosis has been revolutionized by monoclonal antibodies and stem cell transplantation with improved 5-year survival up to 77%. Novel gene therapy and transthyretin stabilizers have revolutionized treatment of ATTRv, improving the course of neuropathy (less change in the modified Neuropathy Impairment Score + 7 from baseline) and quality of life. With great progress in amyloidosis therapies, early diagnosis and presymptomatic testing for ATTRv family members has become paramount. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

                Background Knee osteoarthritis affects the performance of daily activities, independence, and quality of life. The etiopathogenesis of this condition considers the mechanisms of activation of metalloproteinase and reactive oxygen species production pathways. Metalloproteinases-3 (MMP-3) and Glutathione Peroxidase (GPx) may be responsible for cartilage destruction. Aquatic physiotherapy promotes a positive impact on the clinical picture of osteoarthritis, and this study presents an intervention protocol that aims to evaluate the effects of a single session of different aquatic physiotherapy modalities on the biochemical and functional behavior of patients with knee osteoarthritis. Methods This will be a crossover randomized controlled trial in which 15 individuals will be submitted to three aquatic physiotherapy modalities with a minimum 15-day wash-out period in patients over 50 years old and diagnosed with OA in at least one knee, presence of pain and at least one functional dysfunction for at least 6 months, absence of physical limitation that prevents the exercise protocol from being performed, Kellgren and Lawrence ranking between I and IV, walk independently and without auxiliary device. Variations in the concentrations of MMP-3 and GPx in peripheral blood, pain, edema, and flexibility resulting from the three aquatic physiotherapeutic interventions will be evaluated both pre- and immediate post-intervention. The reference group will be submitted to the same aquatic physiotherapy protocols, however, only the biochemical parameters and the self-perception questionnaires will be evaluated.

                Background: Corrective spine surgery is widely accepted for treating severe adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS). Postoperative spinal range of motion (ROM) could be affected after such surgery. In certain populations, such as Muslims, this ROM change can impact daily life, as it may affect the five-times-a-day prayer (Salah). This study aims to assess the influence of spinal fusion (SF) in Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis (AIS) during the daily Islamic prayer (Salah). Methods: SF-AIS patients were videoed while performing Salah prayer. The kinematic documentation was assessed and compared to Salah movements of a control group of age-matched Muslim AIS patients, who had not had surgery. The prayer quality changes were subjectively classified into improved, no change/remained, and worsened, according to the Global Perceived Effect (GPE). Functional outcome and pain were assessed by the Scoliosis Research Society Questionnaire Version 30 (SRS-30). Results: Thirty-nine women and five men (mean age±SD: 14.8±2.3 years) met the inclusion criteria, and unoperated AIS patients were used as control (twenty-two women, mean age±SD: 15.32±1.43 years). The prostrations ROM of the SF-AIS group differed significantly from the control group (p<0.05). The GPE of the prayer movement showed improvement in 36.4%, no change in 59.1%, and worsening in 4.5% of the SF-AIS patients. The worsened group had a significantly lower bowing ROM and higher prostrations ROM compared to all groups of prayer quality changes (p<0.05). SRS-30 scores showed good outcomes (function 4.0±0.2, pain 4.2±0.5), along with the overall bowing ROM and prostrations ROM (84.2±12.0° and 53.4±9.6°, respectively). Moreover, a significant moderate positive correlation between the bowing ROM and pain (r=0.417, p=0.007) was also found. Conclusion: Spinal fusion positively affects AIS Islamic patients in maintaining their daily Salah movement, ROM and prayer quality. Prayer quality assessment should be given extra attention as an adjuvant of the SRS-30 questionnaire to evaluate Muslim patients.

                Background Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is common with a global prevalence of 4%. Dietary regimes with a low content of fermentable oligo-, di-, and monosaccharides and polyol (FODMAP) or a starch- and sucrose-reduced diet (SSRD) have proven to be efficient. The aim of the present study was to describe the recruitment process for a randomized dietary trial with low FODMAP or SSRD for 4 weeks with a follow-up period of 5 months. The results of the dietary trial itself are not included in this paper but will be presented in another publication. Methods The County of Skåne, with 1,41 million inhabitants, was used as a base to perform a dietary trial in which IBS patients, age 18-70 years, were randomized to either low FODMAP or SSRD for 4 weeks. The estimated number of IBS patients in the actual age span was approximately 32,000. The trial was announced through lectures, letters to all primary healthcare centers (n=203), social media (two campaigns), and invitations to IBS patients identified in medical records (n=744). Results Three referrals arrived from the healthcare system, 17 patients contacted the investigators in person after receiving information from their healthcare center, and four patients contacted the investigators after recommendations from friends. Of these, 14 were enrolled in the study. From social media, 218 names were delivered, of which 93 fulfilled the study criteria and were willing to participate when contacted by the investigators (42.7%). Of the 3587 identified IBS patients in medical records in close proximity to the hospital, 744 were randomly contacted. Forty-eight patients (6.5 %) were willing to be included in the study. Thus, 155 patients with IBS were included in this study. Conclusions The inclusion rate for dietary intervention was very low considering the large population informed about the study. Announcements on social media seem to be the best way to recruit patients for intervention. Trial registration NCT05192603, 29/11/2021, ClinicalTrials.gov.

                Background Recent innovations are making radiology more advanced for patient and patient services. Under the immense burden of radiology practice, Artificial Intelligence (AI) assists in obtaining Computed Tomography (CT) images with less scan time, proper patient placement, low radiation dose (RD), and improved image quality (IQ). Hence, the aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the positioning accuracy, RD, and IQ of AI-based automatic and manual positioning techniques for CT kidney ureters and bladder (CT KUB). Methods This prospective study included 143 patients in each group who were referred for computed tomography (CT) KUB examination. Group 1 patients underwent manual positioning (MP), and group 2 patients underwent AI-based automatic positioning (AP) for CT KUB examination. The scanning protocol was kept constant for both the groups. The off-center distance, RD, and quantitative and qualitative IQ of each group were evaluated and compared. Results The AP group (9.66±6.361 mm) had significantly less patient off-center distance than the MP group (15.12±9.55 mm). There was a significant reduction in RD in the AP group compared with that in the MP group. The quantitative image noise (IN) was lower, with a higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) in the AP group than in the MP group (p<0.05). Qualitative IQ parameters such as IN, sharpness, and overall IQ also showed significant differences (p< 0.05), with higher scores in the AP group than in the MP group. Conclusions The AI-based AP showed higher positioning accuracy with less off-center distance (44%), which resulted in 12% reduction in RD and improved IQ for CT KUB imaging compared with MP.

                The increased demand for efficient computation in data analysis encourages researchers in biomedical science to use workflow systems. Workflow systems, or so-called workflow languages, are used for the description and execution of a set of data analysis steps. Workflow systems increase the productivity of researchers, specifically in fields that use high-throughput DNA sequencing applications, where scalable computation is required. As systems have improved the portability of data analysis workflows, research communities are able to share workflows to reduce the cost of building ordinary analysis procedures. However, having multiple workflow systems in a research field has resulted in the distribution of efforts across different workflow system communities. As each workflow system has its unique characteristics, it is not feasible to learn every single system in order to use publicly shared workflows. Thus, we developed Sapporo, an application to provide a unified layer of workflow execution upon the differences of various workflow systems. Sapporo has two components: an application programming interface (API) that receives the request of a workflow run and a browser-based client for the API. The API follows the Workflow Execution Service API standard proposed by the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health. The current implementation supports the execution of workflows in four languages: Common Workflow Language, Workflow Description Language, Snakemake, and Nextflow. With its extensible and scalable design, Sapporo can support the research community in utilizing valuable resources for data analysis.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-682/v1?src=rss">Chronic respiratory health symptoms and associated factors among exposed and unexposed residents to cement dust, in Moodubidire, Dakshina Kannada, Karnataka; a comparative cross sectional study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Exposure to cement dust poses significant risks to respiratory health, particularly among occupational workers. However, the impact of non-occupational cement dust exposure on nearby residents’ pulmonary well-being is often overlooked, particularly in the context of India. This study explores chronic respiratory health symptoms and their predictors in residents exposed to cement dust within a 1 km radius of a cement factory, comparing them with residents residing 5 kms away from the plant. Methods Using a comparative cross-sectional approach, we sampled 542 individuals from both exposed and unexposed communities using a multi-stage sampling technique. In-person interviews were conducted to collect relevant information, and descriptive methods were employed for data analysis. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were utilized to identify factors predicting self-reported chronic respiratory symptoms. Adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated to quantify the strength of the relationships. Results The results revealed a notable disparity in respiratory health between the two groups. Approximately 80% of residents within 1 km proximity to the cement industry reported respiratory symptoms, compared to 31% in the more distant community. Exposed residents were significantly more likely to experience respiratory manifestations, with odds ratios ranging from 5.3 kms to 5.4 kms compared to their unexposed counterparts. Conclusions While it was expected that the cement-exposed group would exhibit a higher burden of chronic respiratory symptoms, a surprising finding was that nearly one-third of non-exposed adult residents living in close proximity also reported adverse respiratory symptoms. This highlights the need for informed policies, including regular screening programs for respiratory health among proximate residents, and effective measures to control dust emissions from cement plants. Overall, the study emphasizes the importance of addressing respiratory health disparities in both occupational and non-occupational settings related to cement dust exposure.

                Background Warfarin is an oral anticoagulant with strict therapeutic levels, dietary restrictions, and drug interactions that play a significant role in the physical, psychological, and social well-being of clients throughout their lives. Thus, the study aimed to assess the HRQoL of warfarin using clients in a cardiac Centre. Methods A cross-sectional descriptive study design was carried out among 270 clients from 10th February to 10th March 2021 in the outpatient department of Manmohan Cardiothoracic, Vascular and Transplant Centre, Nepal. Ethical approval was taken from the Institutional Review Committee, Institute of Medicine (Reference no. 261/2021). A non-probability purposive sampling technique was followed. Data was collected through a structured Interview Schedule by using the WHO QOL-BREF version questionnaire. Variables were coded, entered in EPI-DATA version 3.1, and then transferred to SPSS 16 for descriptive and inferential statistical analysis. Results The mean score for overall quality of life was 55.60±10.25. More than half of the clients (64.8%) had a moderate level of quality of life. The mean scores for the physical, psychological, social, and environmental domains were 47.08±14.39, 56.50±14.35, 64.17±11.50, and 54.65±12.25 respectively. A statistically significant association between age (p=.015), sex (p=.007), socio-economic class (p≤.001), and comorbidities (p=.002) with overall quality of life was observed. Strong positive correlation was observed between physical (r=.768, p≤.001), psychological (r=.794, p≤.001), environmental domain (r=.777, p≤.001) with overall quality of life. Conclusions This study concluded that the warfarin-using clients had moderate mean scores of WHOQOL-BREF. The physical domain was the most compromised one and age, sex, socioeconomic class, and comorbidities in clients were significantly associated with overall quality of life. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct an awareness program for healthcare care professionals and family members regarding the physical, psychological, social, and environmental health of warfarin using clients to improve their quality of life.

                Sponges (Phylum Porifera) are aquatic sessile metazoans found worldwide in marine and freshwater environments. They are significant in the animal tree of life as one of the earliest-branching metazoan lineages and as filter feeders play crucial ecological roles, particularly in coral reefs, but are susceptible to the effects of climate change. In the face of the current biodiversity crisis, genomic data is crucial for species conservation efforts and predicting their evolutionary potential in response to environmental changes. However, there is a limited availability of culturable sponge species with annotated high-quality genomes to further comprehensive insights into animal evolution, function, and their response to the ongoing global change. Despite the publication of a few high-quality annotated sponge genomes, there remains a gap in resources for culturable sponge species. To address this gap, we provide high quality draft genomes of the two congeneric aquarium species Tethya wilhelma and Tethya minuta, small ball-shaped demosponges that are easily maintained long-term in ex situ culture. As such, they offer promising opportunities as laboratory models to contribute to advancing our understanding of sponge biology and provide valuable resources for studying animal evolution, function, and responses to environmental challenges.

                Background A variety of disorders are surgically treated with laparoscopy. Its benefits are frequently considered as being less intrusive, giving superior cosmetic outcomes, and needing a shorter hospital stay because they are based on surgical knowledge and cutting-edge technology. However, laparoscopic surgery under general anaesthesia and pneumoperitoneum may result in adverse pulmonary physiological alterations. This study will make choosing between volume control ventilation and pressure control ventilation for patients undergoing laparoscopic surgeries under general anaesthesia feasible. Method 82 participants of both male and female gender and of the age between 18 and 70, with 41 in each group, will be randomly allotted with pressure control or volume control ventilation. The hemodynamic parameters and ventilatory parameters will be assessed. Data collection and analysis will be done. Expected outcomes To conclude if volume control ventilation or pressure control ventilation is effective in laparoscopic surgeries and which has less hemodynamic responses and better patient outcomes.

                Background The Africa Capacity Building Initiative (ACBI) programme aimed to ‘strengthen the research and training capacity of higher education institutions and support the development of individual scientists in sub-Saharan Africa through UK-Africa research collaborations’ including by funding PhD studentships. We conducted research to understand students’ experiences and to see how consortia-based programmes such as ACBI and their own institutions can enhance PhD students’ research environment and progress. Methods In-depth interviews with 35 ACBI-funded PhD students explored their perspectives about how their research and personal development benefitted from belonging to a research consortium. Questionnaires were used to corroborate interview findings. Results Students recognised that membership of a research consortium provided many benefits compared to less well-resourced peers. By drawing on the programme and consortiums’ resources, they were often able to overcome some limitations in their own institution’s systems and facilities. Through their consortia they could access a wide range of international expertise and support from mentors and colleagues for their technical and psychosocial needs. Multiple consortia opportunities for engaging with the international scientific community and for networking, gave them confidence and motivation and enhanced their career prospects. Conclusion Our study and its recommendations highlight how the breadth and diversity of resources available to PhD students through research consortia can be harnessed to facilitate students’ progress and to create a supportive and conducive research environment. It also underlines how, through a multi-level approach, consortia can contribute to longer-term improvements in institutional research environments for PhD students.

                Examination of bacteria/host cell interactions is important for understanding the aetiology of many infectious diseases. The colony forming unit (CFU) has been the standard for quantifying bacterial burden for the past century, however, this suffers from low sensitivity and is dependent on bacterial culturability in vitro. Our data demonstrate the discrepancy between the CFU and bacterial genome copy number in an osteomyelitis-relevant co-culture system and we confirm diagnosis and quantify bacterial load in clinical bone specimens. This study provides an improved workflow for the quantification of bacterial burden in such cases.

                Metabolic disorders are highly prevalent in modern society. Exercise mimetics are defined as pharmacological compounds that can produce the beneficial effects of fitness. Recently, there has been increased interest in the role of eugenol and transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) in improving metabolic health. The aim of this study was to investigate whether eugenol acts as an exercise mimetic by activating TRPV1. Here, we showed that eugenol improved endurance capacity, caused the conversion of fast-to-slow muscle fibers, and promoted white fat browning and lipolysis in mice. Mechanistically, eugenol promoted muscle fiber-type transformation by activating TRPV1-mediated CaN signaling pathway. Subsequently, we identified IL-15 as a myokine that is regulated by the CaN/nuclear factor of activated T cells cytoplasmic 1 (NFATc1) signaling pathway. Moreover, we found that TRPV1-mediated CaN/NFATc1 signaling, activated by eugenol, controlled IL-15 levels in C2C12 myotubes. Our results suggest that eugenol may act as an exercise mimetic to improve metabolic health via activating the TRPV1-mediated CaN signaling pathway.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94946">Visuo-motor updating in individuals with heightened autistic traits</a></h4>

              
                Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) presents a range of challenges, including heightened sensory sensitivities. Here, we examine the idea that sensory overload in ASD may be linked to issues with efference copy mechanisms, which predict the sensory outcomes of self-generated actions, such as eye movements. Efference copies play a vital role in maintaining visual and motor stability. Disrupted efference copies hinder precise predictions, leading to increased reliance on actual feedback and potential distortions in perceptions across eye movements. In our first experiment, we tested how well healthy individuals with varying levels of autistic traits updated their mental map after making eye movements. We found that those with more autistic traits had difficulty using information from their eye movements to update the spatial representation of their mental map, resulting in significant errors in object localization. In the second experiment, we looked at how participants perceived an object displacement after making eye movements. Using a trans-saccadic spatial updating task, we found that those with higher autism scores exhibited a greater bias, indicating under-compensation of eye movements and a failure to maintain spatial stability during saccades. Overall, our study underscores efference copy’s vital role in visuo-motor stability, aligning with Bayesian theories of autism, potentially informing interventions for improved action–perception integration in autism.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91506">The αC-β4 loop controls the allosteric cooperativity between nucleotide and substrate in the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A</a></h4>

              
                Allosteric cooperativity between ATP and substrates is a prominent characteristic of the cAMP-dependent catalytic subunit of protein kinase A (PKA-C). This long-range synergistic action is involved in substrate recognition and fidelity, and it may also regulate PKA’s association with regulatory subunits and other binding partners. To date, a complete understanding of this intramolecular mechanism is still lacking. Here, we integrated NMR(Nuclear Magnetic Resonance)-restrained molecular dynamics simulations and a Markov State Model to characterize the free energy landscape and conformational transitions of PKA-C. We found that the apoenzyme populates a broad free energy basin featuring a conformational ensemble of the active state of PKA-C (ground state) and other basins with lower populations (excited states). The first excited state corresponds to a previously characterized inactive state of PKA-C with the αC helix swinging outward. The second excited state displays a disrupted hydrophobic packing around the regulatory (R) spine, with a flipped configuration of the F100 and F102 residues at the αC-β4 loop. We validated the second excited state by analyzing the F100A mutant of PKA-C, assessing its structural response to ATP and substrate binding. While PKA-C<sup>F100A</sup> preserves its catalytic efficiency with Kemptide, this mutation rearranges the αC-β4 loop conformation, interrupting the coupling of the two lobes and abolishing the allosteric binding cooperativity. The highly conserved αC-β4 loop emerges as a pivotal element to control the synergistic binding of nucleotide and substrate, explaining how mutations or insertions near or within this motif affect the function and drug sensitivity in homologous kinases.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/85951">Medial anterior prefrontal cortex stimulation downregulates implicit reactions to threats and prevents the return of fear</a></h4>

              
                Downregulating emotional overreactions toward threats is fundamental for developing treatments for anxiety and post-traumatic disorders. The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is critical for top-down modulatory processes, and despite previous studies adopting repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) over this region provided encouraging results in enhancing extinction, no studies have hitherto explored the effects of stimulating the medial anterior PFC (aPFC, encompassing the Brodmann area 10) on threat memory and generalization. Here we showed that rTMS over the aPFC applied before threat memory retrieval immediately decreases implicit reactions to learned and novel stimuli in humans. These effects enduringly persisted 1 week later in the absence of rTMS. No effects were detected on explicit recognition. Critically, rTMS over the aPFC resulted in a more pronounced reduction of defensive responses compared to rTMS targeting the dorsolateral PFC. These findings reveal a previously unexplored prefrontal region, the modulation of which can efficiently and durably inhibit implicit reactions to learned threats. This represents a significant advancement toward the long-term deactivation of exaggerated responses to threats.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/90459">Discovering non-additive heritability using additive GWAS summary statistics</a></h4>

              
                LD score regression (LDSC) is a method to estimate narrow-sense heritability from genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics alone, making it a fast and popular approach. In this work, we present interaction-LD score (i-LDSC) regression: an extension of the original LDSC framework that accounts for interactions between genetic variants. By studying a wide range of generative models in simulations, and by re-analyzing 25 well-studied quantitative phenotypes from 349,468 individuals in the UK Biobank and up to 159,095 individuals in BioBank Japan, we show that the inclusion of a <i>cis</i>-interaction score (i.e. interactions between a focal variant and proximal variants) recovers genetic variance that is not captured by LDSC. For each of the 25 traits analyzed in the UK Biobank and BioBank Japan, i-LDSC detects additional variation contributed by genetic interactions. The i-LDSC software and its application to these biobanks represent a step towards resolving further genetic contributions of sources of non-additive genetic effects to complex trait variation.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93174">Mapping the molecular motions of 5-HT3 serotonin-gated channel by voltage-clamp fluorometry</a></h4>

              
                The serotonin-gated ion channel (5-HT<sub>3</sub>R) mediates excitatory neuronal communication in the gut and the brain. It is the target for setrons, a class of competitive antagonists widely used as antiemetics, and is involved in several neurological diseases. Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) of the 5-HT<sub>3</sub>R in complex with serotonin or setrons revealed that the protein has access to a wide conformational landscape. However, assigning known high-resolution structures to actual states contributing to the physiological response remains a challenge. In the present study, we used voltage-clamp fluorometry (VCF) to measure simultaneously, for 5-HT<sub>3</sub>R expressed at a cell membrane, conformational changes by fluorescence and channel opening by electrophysiology. Four positions identified by mutational screening report motions around and outside the serotonin-binding site through incorporation of cysteine-tethered rhodamine dyes with or without a nearby quenching tryptophan. VCF recordings show that the 5-HT<sub>3</sub>R has access to four families of conformations endowed with distinct fluorescence signatures: ‘resting-like’ without ligand, ‘inhibited-like’ with setrons, ‘pre-active-like’ with partial agonists, and ‘active-like’ (open channel) with partial and strong agonists. Data are remarkably consistent with cryo-EM structures, the fluorescence partners matching respectively apo, setron-bound, 5-HT bound-closed, and 5-HT-bound-open conformations. Data show that strong agonists promote a concerted motion of all fluorescently labeled sensors during activation, while partial agonists, especially when loss-of-function mutations are engineered, stabilize both active and pre-active conformations. In conclusion, VCF, though the monitoring of electrophysiologically silent conformational changes, illuminates allosteric mechanisms contributing to signal transduction and their differential regulation by important classes of physiological and clinical effectors.

                Background: The EEG constitutes a powerful neuroimaging technique for assessing functional brain impairment in COVID-19 patients. Objective: The current investigation compared the EEG among COVID-19 survivors, close contacts and the Cuban EEG normative database, using semi-quantitative visual EEG inspection, quantitative and the current source density measures EEG analysis. Methods: The resting-state EEG activity, quantitative QEEG, and VARETA inverse solution, were evaluated in 173 subjects: 87 patients confirmed cases by the positive reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), 86 close contacts (negative PCR) and the Cuban EEG normative database. All patients were physical, neurological, and clinically assessed using neurological retrospective survey and version 2.1 of the Schedules for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry (SCAN). Results: The GTE score showed significant differences in terms of frequency scores of backgrounds rhythmic activity, diffuse slow activity, and focal abnormality. The QEEG analysis showed a pattern of abnormality with respect to the Cuban EEG normative values, displaying an excess of alpha and beta activities in the fronto-central-parietal areas in both groups. The anomalies, of COVID-19 patients and close contacts, differs in the right fronto-centro parietal area. The COVID 19 group differed-s from the close control group in theta band of the right parieto-central. The symptomatic group of COVID-19 patients differs from asymptomatic patients in delta and theta activities of the parieto-central region. The sources of activation using VARETA showed a difference in cortical activation patterns at alpha and beta frequencies in the groups studied with respect to the normative EEG database. In beta frequency were localized in right middle temporal gyrus in both groups and right angular gyrus in Covid 19 group only. In alpha band, the regions were the left supramarginal gyrus for Covid 19 group and the left superior temporal gyrus for Control group. Greater activation was found in the right middle temporal gyrus at alpha frequency in COVID-19 patients than in their close contacts.

	<p>Cysteamine hydrochloride (Cys-HCl) has been established as a potent ulcerogenic agent of the gastrointestinal (GI) system. GI dysfunction and olfactory deficits are the most common clinical symptoms of many movement disorders, including Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD). Cys-HCl has been shown to interfere with dopamine, a neurotransmitter crucial for motor, olfactory, and cognitive functions. However, the reports on the effect of Cys-HCl treatment on the behavioral aspects and functions of the dopamine system appear to be inconsistent. Therefore, we revisited the impact of Cys-HCl on the motor function in experimental mice using a battery of behavioral tests, such as the pole test (PT), beam-walking test (BWT), and rotarod test (RDT), while the olfactory ability and cognitive functions were examined through the buried-food test (BFT) and Y-maze test. Furthermore, we investigated the effect of Cys-HCl on the number of dopaminergic tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive cells in the substantia nigra (SN) and olfactory bulb (OB) of the experimental mice using immunohistochemistry. The results revealed that Cys-HCl administration in the mice induced significant impairments in their motor balance and coordination, as their movement-related performances were markedly reduced in terms of the behavioral tasks. Mice exposed to Cys-HCl showed pronounced reductions in their odor discrimination abilities as well as cognitive impairments. Strikingly, the number of TH-positive neurons was found to be reduced in the SN and OB of the Cys-HCl-treated group, which is a bonafide neuropathogenic hallmark of PD. This study highlights the potential neurotoxic effects of Cys-HCl in experimental brains and suggests further investigation into its role in the pathogenesis of Parkinsonism.</p>

	<p>Spasticity is a very common sign in the neurological field. It can be defined as &amp;amp;ldquo;a motor disorder marked by a velocity-dependent increase in muscle tone or tonic stretch reflexes&amp;amp;rdquo; associated with hypertonia. It leads to a high risk of limb deformities and pain that prejudices residual motor function, impairing quality of life&amp;amp;rdquo;. The treatment of spasticity depends on its severity and its location and, in general, it is based on rehabilitation, oral therapies (the gamma-aminobutyric acid b agonist baclofen) and injectable medications (i.e., botulin toxins, acting on polysynaptic reflex mechanisms). The botulin toxin type A (BoNT-A) injection has been effectively used to improve different types of spasticity. However, when BoNT-A is not sufficient, a combination of nonpharmacological approaches could be attempted. Therefore, additional intervention, such as conventional physical therapy by itself or further combined with robotic gait training, may be needed. Indeed, it has been shown that combination of BoNT-A and robotics has a positive effect on activity level and upper limb function in patients with stroke, including those in the chronic phase. The aim of this review is to evaluate the efficacy of pharmacological or nonpharmacological treatment in combination with BoNT-A injections on spasticity. The combined therapy of BoNT with conventional or adjunct activities or robot-assisted training, especially with end-effectors, is a valid tool to improve patients&amp;amp;rsquo; performance and outcomes. The combined strategies might rise the toxin&amp;amp;rsquo;s effect, lowering its dosages of botulinum and reducing side effects and costs.</p>

	<p>MANAGE-PD is a validated, web-based tool to assist physicians in identifying patients with Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD) whose symptoms are inadequately controlled by oral medication. Also, a modified patient version of MANAGE-PD (Parkinson Check) is available in Germany. However, prospective research into the clinical utility of MANAGE-PD is lacking. This non-interventional study aimed to assess the real-world clinical utility of the MANAGE-PD and Parkinson Check in PD patients attending a single visit at specialist clinics and neurologist practices in Germany in 2022. Participants&amp;amp;rsquo; disease control was rated by the physicians using their own judgment, and by completing the MANAGE-PD, and by the patients completing the Parkinson Check. Concordance was calculated between the unassisted physician&amp;amp;rsquo;s assessment and the outcome of MANAGE-PD, as well as the Parkinson Check. A total of 278 patients from 19 sites were included in the analyses, of whom 160 patients (57.6%) were assigned to the same category of disease control by physicians&amp;amp;rsquo; judgment and the MANAGE-PD. Concordance was higher in patients treated in specialist clinics (63.9%) than in neurologist practices (43.7%). Concordance between physicians&amp;amp;rsquo; and patients&amp;amp;rsquo; responses was high (&amp;amp;gt;80%) for each question in the Parkinson Check. MANAGE-PD proved to be especially valuable for general neurologists in identifying patients who should be referred to specialist clinics. The Parkinson Check self-assessment generated promising outcomes that merit its more widespread use.</p>

	<p>Counseling can help alleviate tinnitus-caused emotional distress and correct misconceptions, making it an effective rehabilitation option for people with tinnitus. Advances in communication technology have increased the demand for computer-mediated tinnitus counseling; however, the effectiveness of such counseling in reducing tinnitus is unclear. Thus, this study aimed to determine the tinnitus-relieving effects of computer-mediated counseling. Thirty-six participants with tinnitus were randomly assigned to online counseling (15 participants) or video-based counseling (21 participants) groups, defining how remote counseling was conducted. Tinnitus counseling, comprising 100 items, lasted 2 weeks and was separated into six sessions for the online counseling group and 8&amp;amp;ndash;9 items daily for 12 days for the video-based counseling group. The effectiveness of counseling was determined based on score changes between baseline and 2-week follow-up using the Korean version of the Tinnitus Primary Function Questionnaire and Visual Analog Scales for annoyance and loudness. While no significant improvements were observed in other domains, average emotional aspect-related scores showed significant improvements in both groups. Regarding individual results, four and seven participants in the online and video-based counseling groups reported significant improvements in the emotional domain, respectively. Overall, computer-mediated educational counseling might be a rehabilitation option for individuals with tinnitus.</p>

	<p>Background: Technological advancements have been rapidly integrated within the neurosurgical education track since it is a high-risk specialty with little margin for error. Indeed, simulation and virtual reality during training can improve surgical performance and technical skills. Our study aims to investigate the impact of neurosurgical technology-based simulation activities on medical students. Methods and Materials: The &amp;amp;ldquo;Suturing Mission&amp;amp;ndash;The Symposium&amp;amp;rdquo; was a three-day event held at Humanitas University. Participants had access to live-streamed conferences held by worldwide experts in several fields of neurosurgery and practical simulations of dura mater sutures, microvascular anastomosis, and augmented reality neurosurgical approaches. An anonymous survey was conducted at the beginning and end of the event. Results: 141 medical students with a mean age of 21 participated. After the course, 110 participants (77.5%) showed interest in pursuing a surgical path, with a great prevalence in those who had planned to have a surgical career before the event (88.7% vs. 41.4%, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). Participants were also asked about their comfort levels while handling surgical instruments, and a good outcome was reached in 72.7% of participants, with a significant difference between those who had previously attended a suture course (87.8% vs. 66.3%, p = 0.012). Conclusion: Training sessions on surgical simulators were effective in increasing participants&amp;amp;rsquo; interest in pursuing a surgical path, improving their understanding of postgraduate orientation, and boosting their confidence with surgical instruments.</p>

	<p>The pervasive sedentary lifestyle exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly reduced physical activity (PA) among school-age children, necessitating innovative strategies to evaluate short PA breaks that are feasible in a classroom setting. This study explored the cognitive and neurophysiological (electroencephalography; EEG) impacts of short bouts of different PA modalities on inhibitory control (flanker task) and episodic memory (word recognition task) in children. Utilizing a within-participants cross-over design, thirty-six children (n = 36; 9&amp;amp;ndash;12 years old) attended the lab on three separate days with each visit including either a 9 min bout of sustained moderate-intensity cycling, high-intensity interval exercise (HIIE), or seated rest. Event-related potentials (ERPs) were assessed during the flanker task (P3 component) and the word recognition task (LPC and FN400 components) to elucidate the neural mechanisms underpinning behavioral outcomes. Findings indicated no differences in flanker performance but greater episodic memory recall for HIIE compared to seated rest. Neurophysiological results revealed no differences for P3, but notably larger amplitude for LPC and FN400 postcycling, particularly over parietal electrode sites. These results underscore the potential of short PA breaks to improve cognitive and neurocognitive function in children, offering a feasible integration strategy into daily school routines without extensive time commitment.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27010?af=R">Metabolic Dysfunction in New‐Onset Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension: Identification of Novel Biomarkers</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a neurometabolic disease with an increasing incidence. The pathophysiology is unknown, but improvement of diagnosis and management requires discovery of novel biomarkers. Our objective was to identify such candidate biomarkers in IIH, and secondarily, test for associations between identified metabolites and disease severity.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This is a prospective case–control study with collection of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), serum, and clinical data from new-onset, treatment-naïve patients with IIH (n = 60). Patients were included consecutively from 2 tertiary headache centers in Denmark, and age, sex, and body mass index (BMI) -matched healthy controls (n = 35) were recruited. Clinical data were retrieved at ocular remission (n = 55). Samples were analyzed using non-targeted mass spectrometry.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Serum sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), adenosine, and glutamate were 0.46-fold (q &lt; 0.0001), 0.25-fold (q = 0.0048), and 0.44-fold (q &lt; 0.0001) lower, respectively, in IIH. CSF stearoyl-lysophosphatidylcholine (LysoPC-18) and 2-palmitoyl-lysophosphatidylcholine (LysoPC-16) were 0.42 (q = 0.0025) and 0.37 (q &lt; 0.001) -fold lower. LysoPC-18 was higher in patients with moderate–severe versus mild papilledema (<i>p</i> = 0.022). LysoPC-18 correlated positively with retinal nerve fiber layer thickness (<i>p</i> = 0.0012, r = 0.42) and inversely with mean deviation on automated perimetry (<i>p</i> = 0.01, r = −0.35). Higher baseline serum S1P (<i>p</i> = 0.018) and lower CSF LysoPC-16 (<i>p</i> = 0.003) were associated with optic nerve atrophy at ocular remission. Pathway analysis suggests dysregulated lipid metabolism and redox disturbances in new-onset IIH.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>We identify perturbed metabolism in new-onset IIH. S1P and LysoPC-16 demonstrate potential prognostic value due to association with subsequent optic nerve atrophy. This association between specific, differential metabolites and outcome provides substantial evidence for novel biomarkers of clinical significance that should be the focus of further targeted studies.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Estrogens are believed to modulate cognitive functions in part through the modulation of synaptic transmission in the cortex and hippocampus. Administration of 17β-estradiol (E2) can rapidly enhance excitatory synaptic transmission in the hippocampus and facilitate excitatory synaptic transmission in rat lateral entorhinal cortex via activation of the G protein-coupled estrogen receptor-1 (GPER1). To assess the mechanisms through which GPER1 activation facilitates synaptic transmission, we assessed the effects of acute 10 nM E2 administration on pharmacologically isolated evoked excitatory and inhibitory synaptic currents in layer II/III entorhinal neurons. Female Long-Evans rats were ovariectomized between postnatal day (PD) 63 and 74 and implanted with a subdermal E2 capsule to maintain continuous low levels of E2. Electrophysiological recordings were obtained between 7 and 20 days after ovariectomy. Application of E2 for 20 min did not significantly affect AMPA or NMDA receptor-mediated excitatory synaptic currents. However, GABA receptor-mediated inhibitory synaptic currents (IPSCs) were markedly reduced by E2 and returned towards baseline levels during the 20-min washout period. The inhibition of GABA-mediated IPSCs was blocked in the presence of the GPER1 receptor antagonist G15. GPER1 can modulate protein kinase A (PKA), but blocking PKA with intracellular KT5720 did not prevent the E2-induced reduction in IPSCs. GPER1 can also stimulate extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), a negative modulator of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors, and blocking activation of ERK with PD90859 prevented the E2-induced reduction of IPSCs. E2 can therefore result in a rapid GPER1 and ERK signaling-mediated reduction in GABA-mediated IPSCs. This provides a novel mechanism through which E2 can rapidly modulate synaptic excitability in entorhinal layer II/III neurons and may also contribute to E2 and ERK-dependent alterations in synaptic transmission in other brain areas.</p>

	<p>Imbalance and falls in patients with Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD) do not only reduce their quality of life but also their life expectancy. Aging-related symptoms as well as disease-specific motor and non-motor symptoms contribute to these conditions and should be treated when appropriate. In addition to an active lifestyle, advanced exercise training is useful and effective, especially for less medically responsive symptoms such as freezing of gait and postural instability at advanced stages. As treadmill training in non-immersive virtual reality, including dual tasks, significantly reduced the number of falls in PD patients, the mechanism(s) explaining this effect should be further investigated. Such research could help to select the most suitable patients and develop the most effective training protocols based on this novel technology. Real-life digital surrogate markers of mobility, such as those describing aspects of endurance, performance, and the complexity of specific movements, can further improve the quality of mobility assessment using wearables.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/11/6/ENEURO.0108-24.2024?rss=1">Early-Stage Alzheimer's Disease Affects Fast But Not Slow Adaptive Processes in Motor Learning</a></h4>

              
                <p>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by an initial decline in declarative memory, while nondeclarative memory processing remains relatively intact. Error-based motor adaptation is traditionally seen as a form of nondeclarative memory, but recent findings suggest that it involves both fast, declarative, and slow, nondeclarative adaptive processes. If the declarative memory system shares resources with the fast process in motor adaptation, it can be hypothesized that the fast, but not the slow, process is disturbed in AD patients. To test this, we studied 20 early-stage AD patients and 21 age-matched controls of both sexes using a reach adaptation paradigm that relies on spontaneous recovery after sequential exposure to opposing force fields. Adaptation was measured using error clamps and expressed as an adaptation index (AI). Although patients with AD showed slightly lower adaptation to the force field than the controls, both groups demonstrated effects of spontaneous recovery. The time course of the AI was fitted by a hierarchical Bayesian two-state model in which each dynamic state is characterized by a retention and learning rate. Compared to controls, the retention rate of the fast process was the only parameter that was significantly different (lower) in the AD patients, confirming that the memory of the declarative, fast process is disturbed by AD. The slow adaptive process was virtually unaffected. Since the slow process learns only weakly from an error, our results provide neurocomputational evidence for the clinical practice of errorless learning of everyday tasks in people with dementia.</p>

                <p>In the rodent whisker system, active sensing and sensorimotor integration are mediated in part by the dynamic interactions between the motor cortex (M1) and somatosensory cortex (S1). However, understanding these dynamic interactions requires knowledge about the synapses and how specific neurons respond to their input. Here, we combined optogenetics, retrograde labeling, and electrophysiology to characterize the synaptic connections between M1 and layer 5 (L5) intratelencephalic (IT) and pyramidal tract (PT) neurons in S1 of mice (both sexes). We found that M1 synapses onto IT cells displayed modest short-term depression, whereas synapses onto PT neurons showed robust short-term facilitation. Despite M1 inputs to IT cells depressing, their slower kinetics resulted in summation and a response that increased during short trains. In contrast, summation was minimal in PT neurons due to the fast time course of their M1 responses. The functional consequences of this reduced summation, however, were outweighed by the strong facilitation at these M1 synapses, resulting in larger response amplitudes in PT neurons than IT cells during repetitive stimulation. To understand the impact of facilitating M1 inputs on PT output, we paired trains of inputs with single backpropagating action potentials, finding that repetitive M1 activation increased the probability of bursts in PT cells without impacting the time dependence of this coupling. Thus, there are two parallel but dynamically distinct systems of M1 synaptic excitation in L5 of S1, each defined by the short-term dynamics of its synapses, the class of postsynaptic neurons, and how the neurons respond to those inputs.</p>

                Near-death experience (NDE) is a transcendent mental event of uncertain etiology that arises on the cusp of biological death. Since the discovery of NDE in the mid-1970s, multiple neuroscientific theories have been developed in an attempt to account for it in strictly materialistic or reductionistic terms. Therefore, in this conception, NDE is at most an extraordinary hallucination without any otherworldly, spiritual, or supernatural denotations. During the last decade or so, a number of animal and clinical studies have emerged which reported that about the time of death, there may be a surge of high frequency electroencephalogram (EEG) at a time when cortical electrical activity is otherwise at a very low ebb. This oscillatory rhythm falls within the range of the enigmatic brain wave-labelled gamma-band activity (GBA). Therefore, it has been proposed that this brief, paradoxical, and perimortem burst of the GBA may represent the neural foundation of the NDE. This study examines three separate but related questions concerning this phenomenon. The first problem pertains to the electrogenesis of standard GBA and the extent to which authentic cerebral activity has been contaminated by myogenic artifacts. The second problem involves the question of whether agents that can mimic NDE are also underlain by GBA. The third question concerns the electrogenesis of the surge in GBA itself. It has been contended that this is neither cortical nor myogenic in origin. Rather, it arises in a subcortical (amygdaloid) location but is recorded at the cortex via volume conduction, thereby mimicking standard GBA. Although this surge of GBA contains genuine electrophysiological activity and is an intriguing and provocative finding, there is little evidence to suggest that it could act as a kind of neurobiological skeleton for a phenomenon such as NDE.

                Background The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused substantial morbidity and mortality on a global scale. A strong correlation has been found between COVID-19 treatment outcomes and noncommunicable diseases such as cancers. However, there is limited information on the outcomes of cancer patients who were hospitalised for COVID-19. Methods We conducted an analysis on data collected in a large prospective cohort study set-up by the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium (ISARIC). All patients with laboratory-confirmed or clinically-diagnosed SARS-CoV-2 infection were included. Cancer was defined as having a current solid organ or haematological malignancy. The following outcomes were assessed; 30-day in-hospital mortality, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, length of hospitalization and receipt of higher-level care. Results Of the 560,547 hospitalised individuals who were analysed, 27,243 (4.9%) had cancer. Overall, cancer patients were older and had more comorbidities than non-cancer patients. Patients with cancer had higher 30-day in-hospital mortality than non-cancer patients (29.1.3% vs 18.0%) and longer hospital stays (median of 12 days vs 8 days). However, patients with cancer were admitted less often to intensive care units than non-cancer patients (12.6% vs 17.1%) and received less invasive mechanical ventilation than non-cancer patients (4.5% vs 7.6%). The hazard ratio of dying from cancer, adjusted for age, sex and country income level was 1.18 (95%CI: 1.15-1.2). Conclusions This study’s findings underscore the heightened vulnerability of hospitalized COVID-19 patients with cancer, revealing a higher mortality rate, longer hospital stays, and an unstructured pattern of care that reflects the complexity of managing severely ill patients during a public health crisis like the COVID-19 pandemic.

                Background The 2013-2016 West African Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) outbreak resulted in 28,600 cases and 11,300 deaths officially reported to the World Health Organization. Previous studies investigating factors associated with death had conflicting findings, interventions showing promising outcomes had small sample sizes, studies were often single- or dual-country based and most focused on laboratory-confirmed EVD and not on clinically-suspected EVD. We used the Ebola data platform of the Infectious Disease Data Observatory (IDDO) to review individual patient records to assess factors associated with death, and particularly whether there were differences between laboratory-confirmed and clinically-suspected cases. Methods This was a cohort study involving analysis of secondary data in the IDDO database. The study population included all patients classified as having either clinically-suspected or laboratory-confirmed EVD, admitted to 22 Ebola Treatment Units (ETU) in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone between December 2013 and March 2016. Baseline characteristics and treatments were documented along with ETU exit outcomes. Factors associated with death were investigated by multivariable modified Poisson regression. Results There were 14,163 patients, of whom 6,208 (43.8%) were laboratory-confirmed and 7,955 (56.2%) were clinically-suspected. Outcomes were not recorded in 2,889 (20.4%) patients. Of the 11,274 patients with known outcomes, 4,090 (36.3%) died: 2,956 (43.6%) with laboratory-confirmed EVD and 1,134 (18.8%) with clinically-suspected EVD. The strongest risk factor for death was confirmed disease status. Patients with laboratory-confirmed disease had 2.9 times higher risk of death compared to clinically-suspected patients, after adjusting for other co-variables. Other factors significantly associated with death included a higher risk for patients aged ≥60 years and a lower risk for patients in Sierra Leone. Conclusions Although laboratory-confirmed patients admitted to ETUs fared worse than clinically-suspected patients, the latter still had a substantial risk of death and more attention needs to be paid to this group in future EVD outbreaks.

                Background Hypospadias is a common congenital anomaly of the penis characterized by ventral opening of urethra. This abnormality is often accompanied by scrotal abnormalities, where both penile and scrotal development occur at the same time during the fetal period. This study aims to analyze associated scrotal anomalies in children with hypospadias. Methods This is a retrospective cross-sectional study of boys diagnosed with hypospadias during a 6 years period. The age of patients, severity of hypospadias, and associated scrotal anomalies such as penoscrotal transposition (PST), bifid scrotum (BS), and scrotal hypoplasia were assessed. Scrotoplasty procedure was also recorded. The association between the severity of hypospadias, incidence of scrotal anomalies, severity of both PST and BF were analyzed using Chi-square test and alternatively Fisher exact test, p<0,05 considered significant. Results During the study period, there were 240 hypospadias patients, with a median age of 5,6 years. Most patients had severe hypospadias. Associated scrotal anomalies were found in 63,3% of patients. Incidence of scrotal anomaly was higher in patients with severe hypospadias (75%) compared to mild cases (75% vs 36.1%; p<0.001; PR= 2.08 (95% CI: 1.51 – 2.86)). Patients with severe hypospadias had a more severe PST, especially in bilateral minor and major forms compared to patients with mild cases (p<0.001); and was significantly associated with severe and partial type of SB (p<0.001). Patients with a more severe PST tend to have a more severe SB, on contrary, patients with minor PST tend to have a milder or even no BS (p<0.001). Scrotoplasty was performed in 35,4% of cases. Conclusion Most hypospadias patients had associated scrotal anomaly, in which severe hypospadias was associated with the more severe type of PST and BS.

                The Raman effect originates from spontaneous inelastic scattering of photons by matter. These photons provide a characteristic fingerprint of this matter, and are extensively utilized for chemical and biological sensing. The probability of generation, and hence the detection of these Raman scattered photons, is very low; hence, it is difficult to use this directly for sensing in complex matrices. To amplify this signal, surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) has been extensively investigated and has emerged as a powerful analytical tool for sensing diverse analytes, including ions, small molecules, inorganics, organics, radionucleotides, and cells. Plasmonic nanoparticles, called hotspots, exhibit localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR). This amplifies the Raman signal and may offer up to a 1010-fold SERS signal enhancement. The development of SERS active substrates requires further consideration and optimization of several critical features such as surface periodicity, hotspot density, mitigation of sample or surface autofluorescence, tuning of surface hydrophilicities, use of specific (bio) recognition elements with suitable linkers and bioconjugation chemistries, and use of appropriate optics to obtain relevant sensing outcomes in terms of sensitivity, cross-sensitivity, limit of detection, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), stability, shelf-life, and disposability. This article details the optimization of the aforementioned considerations in the use of disposable materials such as commercial grades of paper, textiles, glasses, polymers, and some specific substrates such as blue-ray digital versatile discs (DVDs) for use as SERS-active substrates for point-of-use (POU) sensing applications. The advancements in these technologies have been reviewed and critiqued for analyte detection in resource-limited settings, highlighting the prospects of applications ranging from single-molecule to single-cell detection.

                Background Tuberculosis is one of the diseases that requires comprehensive treatment. This disease is highly contagious and can be transmitted through the air. Climate factors play a role in the increasing cases of tuberculosis. This study aimed to determine the correlation between climatic variables and TB in Kolaka District, Southeast Sulawesi Province, Indonesia, Methods This research was modeled using an autoregressive (AR) Bayesian model with three possible likelihoods; Gaussian, Poisson and Negative Binomial responses. Results Minimum temperature and average temperature, a coefficient of 4.234 suggests that for every 1 degree increase in minimum temperature, there is an estimated increase of approximately four cases, assuming other variables remain constant. Maximum temperature, a coefficient of 17.851 suggests that for every 1 degree increase in maximum temperature, there is an estimated increase of around 17-18 cases, assuming other variables remain constant. Humidity, a coefficient of -13.413 suggests that for every 1% increase in humidity, there is an estimated decrease of around 13 cases, assuming other variables remain constant. Rainfall, a coefficient of -0.327 suggests that for every 1 mm increase in rainfall, there is an estimated decrease of around 0.327 cases, assuming other variables remain constant. Light, a coefficient of -4.322 suggests that for every 1-hour increase in light duration, there is an estimated decrease of around four cases, assuming other variables remain constant. Conclusions Climate change has a significant impact on tuberculosis through temperature-related factors. These factors influence the prevalence, spread, and vulnerability to TB. Addressing these challenges requires a holistic approach involving adaptation planning. Strong public health systems and healthcare infrastructure can help mitigate the risks and impacts of climate change-related tuberculosis.

                Background SARS-CoV-2 first appeared in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. Looking at the prevalence data in the world and in Indonesia, the highest mortality rate due to COVID-19 involves age, gender and comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus. Severity of the condition also refers to coagulation abnormalities, such as abnormal prothrombin time values. Methods This systematic review study and meta-analysis used online literature sourced from PubMed, Science Direct, EBSCO, Cochrane and Google Scholar. The literature used here is literature that has data on age, sex and prothrombin time of COVID-19 patients with diabetes mellitus whose quality is assessed by the NOS (Newcastle-Ottawa Scale) criteria and processing data using Review Manager 5.4. Results Out of 8711 literatures that were traced from various search sources, there were 46 literatures that were included in this study. The results of the analysis on age showed the Standardized Mean Difference (SMD) value of 0.45 and P <0.0001 (95% CI: 0.23–0.68), the gender analysis showed an Odds Ratio (OR) value of 3.28 and P = 0.01 (95% CI: 1.26–8.52) and the prothrombin time analysis showed SMD values of 0.41 and P = 0.07 (95%CI = -0.03–0.85). Conclusion Older and male COVID-19 patients have a higher risk of having diabetes compared to younger and female COVID-19 patients. As diabetes is a comorbidity in COVID-19, it can be concluded that old age and male sex are associated with a more severe disease.

Abdominopelvic forms are relatively rare and may involve the colon as a solid mass, mimicking a malignant tumor. Case presentation A 68-year-old Tunisian man, with a history of diabetes, hypertension, penicillin allergy, and renal failure, presented to the emergency department with abdominal pain, vomiting, and bowel obstruction. CT scan showed an acute intestinal obstruction upstream with obstructive tissular mass at the sigmoid colon. Emergency surgery revealed a sigmoid mass and a pre-perforative cecum. Subtotal colectomy was performed, with ileostomy and distal end closure. Histological examination confirmed Actinomyces infection. The patient was then placed on long-term doxycycline and Bactrim, with no recurrence over a 9-month follow-up period. Conclusion Abdominal actinomycosis, though rare, presents diagnostic challenges. It can be mistaken for malignancy, leading to unnecessary surgery in non-complicated cases, since it is effectively treated by antibiotics. In complicated cases, a combined approach involving both surgery and antibiotic therapy is necessary until the infection is completely eradicated.

<i>Candida albicans</i> is a commensal of the human microbiota that can form biofilms on implanted medical devices. These biofilms are tolerant to antifungals and to the host immune system. To identify novel genes modulating <i>C</i>. <i>albicans</i> biofilm formation, we performed a large-scale screen with 2,454 <i>C</i>. <i>albicans</i> doxycycline-dependent overexpression strains and identified 16 genes whose overexpression significantly hampered biofilm formation. Among those, overexpression of the <i>ZCF15</i> and <i>ZCF26</i> paralogs that encode transcription factors and have orthologs only in biofilm-forming species of the <i>Candida</i> clade, caused impaired biofilm formation both in vitro and in vivo. Interestingly, overexpression of <i>ZCF15</i> impeded biofilm formation without any defect in hyphal growth. Transcript profiling, transcription factor binding, and phenotypic microarray analyses conducted upon overexpression of <i>ZCF15</i> and <i>ZCF26</i> demonstrated their role in reprogramming cellular metabolism by regulating central metabolism including glyoxylate and tricarboxylic acid cycle genes. Taken together, this study has identified a new set of biofilm regulators, including <i>ZCF15</i> and <i>ZCF26</i>, that appear to control biofilm development through their specific role in metabolic remodeling.

Breast cancer is the most prevalent malignancy and the most significant contributor to mortality in female oncology patients. Potassium Two Pore Domain Channel Subfamily K Member 1 (KCNK1) is differentially expressed in a variety of tumors, but the mechanism of its function in breast cancer is unknown. In this study, we found for the first time that KCNK1 was significantly up-regulated in human breast cancer and was correlated with poor prognosis in breast cancer patients. KCNK1 promoted breast cancer proliferation, invasion, and metastasis in vitro and vivo. Further studies unexpectedly revealed that KCNK1 increased the glycolysis and lactate production in breast cancer cells by binding to and activating lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA), which promoted histones lysine lactylation to induce the expression of a series of downstream genes and LDHA itself. Notably, increased expression of LDHA served as a vicious positive feedback to reduce tumor cell stiffness and adhesion, which eventually resulted in the proliferation, invasion, and metastasis of breast cancer. In conclusion, our results suggest that KCNK1 may serve as a potential breast cancer biomarker, and deeper insight into the cancer-promoting mechanism of KCNK1 may uncover a novel therapeutic target for breast cancer treatment.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Studies of the impact of brain injury on memory processes often focus on the quantity and episodic richness of those recollections. Here, we argue that the organization of one's recollections offers critical insights into the impact of brain injury on functional memory. It is well-established in studies of word list memory that free recall of unrelated words exhibits a clear temporal organization. This <i>temporal contiguity effect</i> refers to the fact that the order in which word lists are recalled reflects the original presentation order. Little is known, however, about the organization of recall for semantically rich materials, nor how recall organization is impacted by hippocampal damage and memory impairment. The present research is the first study, to our knowledge, of temporal organization in semantically rich narratives in three groups: (1) Adults with bilateral hippocampal damage and severe declarative memory impairment, (2) adults with bilateral ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) damage and no memory impairment, and (3) demographically matched non-brain-injured comparison participants. We find that although the narrative recall of adults with bilateral hippocampal damage reflected the temporal order in which those narratives were experienced above chance levels, their temporal contiguity effect was significantly attenuated relative to comparison groups. In contrast, individuals with vmPFC damage did not differ from non-brain-injured comparison participants in temporal contiguity. This pattern of group differences yields insights into the cognitive and neural systems that support the use of temporal organization in recall. These data provide evidence that the retrieval of temporal context in narrative recall is hippocampal-dependent, whereas damage to the vmPFC does not impair the temporal organization of narrative recall. This evidence of limited but demonstrable organization of memory in participants with hippocampal damage and amnesia speaks to the power of narrative structures in supporting meaningfully organized recall despite memory impairment.</p>

                Background Tuberculosis (TB) remains a key contributor to global mortality; ranks second as the most fatal infectious disease and seventh among the top ten causes of death in Ghana. There is insufficient literature regarding the utilization of Bayesian hierarchical models for examining the spatial and spatio-temporal dynamics of tuberculosis risk in Ghana. Aim This study addresses this gap by determining TB hotspots regions in Ghana using the Bayesian modeling framework. Methods TB data were obtained from the Ghana Health Service and National Tuberculosis Programme for the 10 administrative regions of Ghana, from 2008 to 2017. Spatial and spatio-temporal TB relative risk for each region were estimated under the Bayesian modeling frameworks. Maps for TB risks were created to visualized regions with TB hotspots. Model fitting and parameter estimation were conducted using integrated nested Laplace approximation via R version 4.3.2. Results Among the baseline predictors, TB cure rate, TB success rate, knowledge about TB, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) prevalence, percentage of literacy, and high income were found to be most significant predictors of TB risk in Ghana. We noted an increased risk of TB infection in the Northern zone and the Eastern and Greater Accra regions in the Southern zone. Spatio-temporal distribution of TB infection risk was predominantly concentrated in the Southern zone. Clustering of TB risk was observed among neighboring regions. Conclusion Factors influencing tuberculosis (TB) risk in Ghana are TB cure rate, TB success rate, knowledge about TB, HIV prevalence, literacy rate, and income level. The risk distribution was mainly concentrated in the Southern zone, with clusters of TB risk observed among neighboring regions. To achieve a significant reduction in TB cases, it is essential to allocate resources to TB hotspots regions and also implement measures to control significant predictors of TB infection risk.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/11-1369/v4?src=rss">Micronutrients in Adverse Pregnancy Outcomes [version 4; peer review: 2 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                About 10 to 20% of reported pregnancies have complications like spontaneous abortion (SA), preeclampsia (PE), preterm birth (PTB), and fetal growth restriction (FGR); 60% are attributed to maternal nutritional alterations. Multiple micronutrients (MMN) are supplemented in the antenatal period, but no proper validation/guidelines are available regarding dosing/time, the need for initiation, and the duration of supplementation. Studies have reported adverse pregnancy complications related to the overuse/unwanted use of multiple micronutrient supplementations during pregnancy. Identifying the exact population requiring supplementation is necessary to prevent its abuse. This article attempts to review the impacts of micronutrient deficiency/supplementation in cases of SA, FGR, and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), preterm delivery and PE. The study used a literature search using PubMed, Google Scholar, Mendeley, and Scopus Databases using search words pregnancy, spontaneous abortion, gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), fetal growth restriction (FGR), preterm delivery, preeclampsia (PE) or “adverse pregnancy” associated with minerals, micronutrients, or supplementation. The review also considered in-house literature databases, a single-window search at Kasturba Medical College (KMC) Health sciences library, MAHE (Manipal Academy of Higher Education). The figures included in the study were created by Biorender.com. Micronutrients play multiple roles during pregnancy and fetoplacental growth stimulating growth hormone secretion, Lysyl oxidase (LOX), involved in the crosslinking between collagen and elastin in the amniotic membrane, downregulation of interleukin (IL)-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-4, IL-6, Il-10, IL-12, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and several chemokines involved in hypertension, immune-inflammatory pathways, attenuate insulin resistance, structural development of neurons and glia. Over-supplementation has led to complications such as spontaneous abortion and gestational diabetes mellitus. Since there is a lack of standardization concerning micronutrient supplementation during pregnancy, there is a need for systematic study related to the role of micronutrients during each trimester of pregnancy to optimize its supplementation and to prevent hazards associated with its abuse.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/12-1226/v2?src=rss">Post-pubertal management of undescended testes from the malignancy risk point of view: a systematic review [version 2; peer review: 1 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background Undescended testes (UDT) is a condition where one or both testes is absent in the scrotum. The general age recommendation in which the treatment should be performed is before 18 months old due to the infertility risk and malignancy in later life. On the other hand, in post-pubertal UDT, the current guideline recommends orchiectomy; however, this recommendation is weak. Therefore, this study aimed to provide a systematic review of post-pubertal UDT treatment, focusing on the malignancy risk point of view. Methods A systematic search was performed using PubMed, Wiley Online Library and the Cochrane Library up to 5 March 2023. Any study with either post-pubertal orchiectomy or orchidopexy in patients with UDT and reporting the testicular malignancy was included. The exclusion criteria were studies with lack of information of UDT correction time, no history of correction and the full text wasn’t available. The data collected were the occurrence of testicular malignancy in post-pubertal UDT patients corrected with any method. Quality and bias assessment was assessed with Newcastle-Ottawa scale and Joanna Briggs Institute tools. Results Seven articles (three case reports and four observational studies) were reviewed with a total of 42 patients who underwent post-pubertal correction of either unilateral or bilateral UDT. The correction age ranged from 13 to 34 years old, with follow-up of 48.7–252 months. Among those who developed malignancies, the most common were seminoma, teratoma and carcinoma in situ of the testes. In addition, this study was able to propose an algorithm for post-pubertal UDT treatment strategy. Conclusions The scarce resource was the main limitation of this study. Nevertheless, this review showed that post-pubertal UDT management should be tailored individually. Several factors that should be considered include the condition of the contralateral descended testis, UDT location, serum testosterone level, patient’s age, comorbidities, and interest in fertility.

                Sudden deafness is a common cause of emergency consultation in otology. Usually, despite investigations, no etiology is known. Intracochlear hemorrhage is a rare cause of sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL) and may be associated with various labyrinthine disorders. In such cases, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the clef of the diagnosis. We report the case of a 70-year-old patient who was referred to our department for sudden hearing loss, tinnitus, and vertigo. Otoscopic and neurological examinations were normal, and pure-tone audiometry revealed left profound sensorineural hearing loss. Videonystagmography (VNG) revealed left vestibular deficit. MRI demonstrated a high signal intensity inside the cochlea on unenhanced T1-weighted images, and no other abnormalities were found; in particular, no enhancement after intravenous administration of gadolinium. No etiology was identified. Vertigo disappeared rapidly with corticosteroid treatment and hyperbaric oxygen therapy, but hearing did not improve. Intra-labyrinthine hemorrhage causing SSNHL is rare, and the hearing prognosis is poor.

                Background The Cipto Triage Method (CTM) is a method developed in Indonesia for assessing the clinical acuity of emergency department patients. To evaluate the accuracy of the CTM, this study compared triage decisions using the CTM performed by nurses to the triage decisions performed by emergency medical officers (EMO). Methods This cross-sectional diagnostic study was performed in a single-centre referral hospital in Jakarta, Indonesia. Adult patients who attended the emergency department (ED) met the inclusion criteria. Trauma cases, pregnancy, and psychiatric disorders were excluded. All eligible patients underwent triage assessment based on CTM by a triage nurse and were then referred to the ED treatment zone for triage assessment performed by an EMO. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and likelihood ratio were calculated. Results Between April and July 2022, 902 participants were randomly selected. The overall accuracy of the triage assessment of the index test was 84.7%, and the PPV of resuscitation and urgent triage was very good (90.5% and 84.5%, respectively). In the non-urgent category, the PPV was acceptable (72%), but the NPV was very good (92.2%). Conclusions Nurse-based triage assessment using CTM in the ED had very good accuracy in determining clinical acuity.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>We have examined the number and distribution of NeuN-immunoreactive cortical white matter interstitial cells (WMICs) and compared them to the neurons in layers 1–6 across the overlying cortex in coronal sections from postnatal macaques. The data have been gathered from over 300 selected regions at gyral crowns, at sulci, and at linear regions of the cortex where we also determined cortical layer thicknesses: standard thicknesses and tangential thicknesses. Cortical thicknesses and cell numbers showed variability according to gyral, linear, or sulcal regions. In spite of these variations, our standardized cell numbers in layers 1 to 6b and interstitial cells underlying layer 6b-white matter boundary have shown a consistent correlation between the number of WMICs and the number of layer 5 and 6a cortical neurons on all cortical regions studied: for each WMIC, there are on the order of five cortical neurons in layer 5 and approximately three cortical neurons in layer 6a, irrespective of the origins of the selected cortical area or whether they are from gyral, linear, or sulcal regions. We propose that the number of interstitial neurons in the postnatal macaque cortex is correlated to the density of neurons within layers 5 and 6a and, from a clinical perspective, the change in density or distribution of interstitial neurons in schizophrenia or epilepsy may in fact be linked to the number of layers 5 and 6a neurons.</p>

     alt="Efferent projections of Nps-expressing neurons in the parabrachial region"/>
<p>We mapped the efferent projections of neuropeptide S (NPS) neurons in the parabrachial nucleus and peri-locus coeruleus using a genetic approach combined with a neural network algorithm (BoutonNet). NPS neurons project via a periventricular and ventral pathway and target the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, dorsomedial hypothalamic nuclues, and tectal longitudinal column. Lighter labeling was seen in descending projections to the brainstem

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>In the brain, connectivity determines function. Neurons in the parabrachial nucleus (PB) relay diverse information to widespread brain regions, but the connections and functions of PB neurons that express <i>Nps</i> (neuropeptide S, NPS) remain mysterious. Here, we use Cre-dependent anterograde tracing and whole-brain analysis to map their output connections. While many other PB neurons project ascending axons through the central tegmental tract, NPS axons reach the forebrain via distinct periventricular and ventral pathways. Along the periventricular pathway, NPS axons target the tectal longitudinal column and periaqueductal gray, then continue rostrally to target the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus. Along the ventral pathway, NPS axons blanket much of the hypothalamus but avoid the ventromedial and mammillary nuclei. They also project prominently to the ventral bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, A13 cell group, and magnocellular subparafasciular nucleus. In the hindbrain, NPS axons have fewer descending projections, targeting primarily the superior salivatory nucleus, nucleus of the lateral lemniscus, and periolivary region. Combined with what is known already about NPS and its receptor, the output pattern of <i>Nps</i>-expressing neurons in the PB region predicts roles in threat response and circadian behavior.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/81698">Discovery of runs-of-homozygosity diplotype clusters and their associations with diseases in UK Biobank</a></h4>

              
                Runs of homozygosity (ROH) segments, contiguous homozygous regions in a genome were traditionally linked to families and inbred populations. However, a growing literature suggests that ROHs are ubiquitous in outbred populations. Still, most existing genetic studies of ROH in populations are limited to aggregated ROH content across the genome, which does not offer the resolution for mapping causal loci. This limitation is mainly due to a lack of methods for the efficient identification of shared ROH diplotypes. Here, we present a new method, ROH-DICE, to find large ROH diplotype clusters, sufficiently long ROHs shared by a sufficient number of individuals, in large cohorts. ROH-DICE identified over 1 million ROH diplotypes that span over 100 SNPs and are shared by more than 100 UK Biobank participants. Moreover, we found significant associations of clustered ROH diplotypes across the genome with various self-reported diseases, with the strongest associations found between the extended HLA region and autoimmune disorders. We found an association between a diplotype covering the HFE gene and hemochromatosis, even though the well-known causal SNP was not directly genotyped or imputed. Using a genome-wide scan, we identified a putative association between carriers of an ROH diplotype in chromosome 4 and an increase in mortality among COVID-19 patients (P-value=1.82×10<sup>-11</sup>). In summary, our ROH-DICE method, by calling out large ROH diplotypes in a large outbred population, enables further population genetics into the demographic history of large populations. More importantly, our method enables a new genome-wide mapping approach for finding disease-causing loci with multi-marker recessive effects at a population scale.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96876">Drosophila medulla neuroblast termination via apoptosis, differentiation and gliogenic switch is scheduled by the depletion of the neuroepithelial stem cell pool</a></h4>

              
                The brain is consisted of diverse neurons arising from a limited number of neural stem cells. <i>Drosophila</i> neural stem cells called neuroblasts (NBs) produces specific neural lineages of various lineage sizes depending on their location in the brain. In the <i>Drosophila</i> visual processing centre - the optic lobes (OLs), medulla NBs derived from the neuroepithelium (NE) give rise to neurons and glia cells of the medulla cortex. The timing and the mechanisms responsible for the cessation of medulla NBs are so far not known. In this study, we show that the termination of medulla NBs during early pupal development is determined by the exhaustion of the NE stem cell pool. Hence, altering NE-NB transition during larval neurogenesis disrupts the timely termination of medulla NBs. Medulla NBs terminate neurogenesis via a combination of apoptosis, terminal symmetric division via Prospero, and a switch to gliogenesis via Glial Cell Missing (Gcm), however, these processes occur independently of each other. We also show that temporal progression of the medulla NBs is mostly not required for their termination. As the <i>Drosophila</i> OL shares a similar mode of division with mammalian neurogenesis, understanding when and how these progenitors cease proliferation during development can have important implications for mammalian brain size determination and regulation of its overall function.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/84747">Arabidopsis transcriptome responses to low water potential using high-throughput plate assays</a></h4>

              
                Soil-free assays that induce water stress are routinely used to investigate drought responses in the plant <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>. Due to their ease of use, the research community often relies on polyethylene glycol (PEG), mannitol, and salt (NaCl) treatments to reduce the water potential of agar media, and thus induce drought conditions in the laboratory. However, while these types of stress can create phenotypes that resemble those of water deficit experienced by soil-grown plants, it remains unclear how these treatments compare at the transcriptional level. Here, we demonstrate that these different methods of lowering water potential elicit both shared and distinct transcriptional responses in <i>Arabidopsis</i> shoot and root tissue. When we compared these transcriptional responses to those found in <i>Arabidopsis</i> roots subject to vermiculite drying, we discovered many genes induced by vermiculite drying were repressed by low water potential treatments on agar plates (and vice versa). Additionally, we also tested another method for lowering water potential of agar media. By increasing the nutrient content and tensile strength of agar, we show the ‘hard agar’ (HA) treatment can be leveraged as a high-throughput assay to investigate natural variation in <i>Arabidopsis</i> growth responses to low water potential.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/90606">Automated multiconformer model building for X-ray crystallography and cryo-EM</a></h4>

              
                In their folded state, biomolecules exchange between multiple conformational states that are crucial for their function. Traditional structural biology methods, such as X-ray crystallography and cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM), produce density maps that are ensemble averages, reflecting molecules in various conformations. Yet, most models derived from these maps explicitly represent only a single conformation, overlooking the complexity of biomolecular structures. To accurately reflect the diversity of biomolecular forms, there is a pressing need to shift toward modeling structural ensembles that mirror the experimental data. However, the challenge of distinguishing signal from noise complicates manual efforts to create these models. In response, we introduce the latest enhancements to qFit, an automated computational strategy designed to incorporate protein conformational heterogeneity into models built into density maps. These algorithmic improvements in qFit are substantiated by superior R<sub>free</sub> and geometry metrics across a wide range of proteins. Importantly, unlike more complex multicopy ensemble models, the multiconformer models produced by qFit can be manually modified in most major model building software (e.g., Coot) and fit can be further improved by refinement using standard pipelines (e.g., Phenix, Refmac, Buster). By reducing the barrier of creating multiconformer models, qFit can foster the development of new hypotheses about the relationship between macromolecular conformational dynamics and function.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/88985">The Alk receptor tyrosine kinase regulates Sparkly, a novel activity regulating neuropeptide precursor in the Drosophila central nervous system</a></h4>

              
                Numerous roles for the Alk receptor tyrosine kinase have been described in <i>Drosophila</i>, including functions in the central nervous system (CNS), however the molecular details are poorly understood. To gain mechanistic insight, we employed Targeted DamID (TaDa) transcriptional profiling to identify targets of Alk signaling in the larval CNS. TaDa was employed in larval CNS tissues, while genetically manipulating Alk signaling output. The resulting TaDa data were analyzed together with larval CNS scRNA-seq datasets performed under similar conditions, identifying a role for Alk in the transcriptional regulation of neuroendocrine gene expression. Further integration with bulk and scRNA-seq datasets from larval brains in which Alk signaling was manipulated identified a previously uncharacterized <i>Drosophila</i> neuropeptide precursor encoded by <i>CG4577</i> as an Alk signaling transcriptional target. <i>CG4577</i>, which we named <i>Sparkly (Spar)</i>, is expressed in a subset of Alk-positive neuroendocrine cells in the developing larval CNS, including circadian clock neurons. In agreement with our TaDa analysis, overexpression of the <i>Drosophila</i> Alk ligand Jeb resulted in increased levels of Spar protein in the larval CNS. We show that Spar protein is expressed in circadian (clock) neurons, and flies lacking Spar exhibit defects in sleep and circadian activity control. In summary, we report a novel activity regulating neuropeptide precursor gene that is regulated by Alk signaling in the <i>Drosophila</i> CNS.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94547">The non-mitotic role of HMMR in regulating the localization of TPX2 and the dynamics of microtubules in neurons</a></h4>

              
                A functional nervous system is built upon the proper morphogenesis of neurons to establish the intricate connection between them. The microtubule cytoskeleton is known to play various essential roles in this morphogenetic process. While many microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) have been demonstrated to participate in neuronal morphogenesis, the function of many more remains to be determined. This study focuses on a MAP called HMMR in mice, which was originally identified as a hyaluronan binding protein and later found to possess microtubule and centrosome binding capacity. HMMR exhibits high abundance on neuronal microtubules and altering the level of HMMR significantly affects the morphology of neurons. Instead of confining to the centrosome(s) like cells in mitosis, HMMR localizes to microtubules along axons and dendrites. Furthermore, transiently expressing HMMR enhances the stability of neuronal microtubules and increases the formation frequency of growing microtubules along the neurites. HMMR regulates the microtubule localization of a non-centrosomal microtubule nucleator TPX2 along the neurite, offering an explanation for how HMMR contributes to the promotion of growing microtubules. This study sheds light on how cells utilize proteins involved in mitosis for non-mitotic functions.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/90735">A novel method for estimating properties of attentional oscillators reveals an age-related decline in flexibility</a></h4>

              
                Dynamic attending theory proposes that the ability to track temporal cues in the auditory environment is governed by entrainment, the synchronization between internal oscillations and regularities in external auditory signals. Here, we focused on two key properties of internal oscillators: their preferred rate, the default rate in the absence of any input; and their flexibility, how they adapt to changes in rhythmic context. We developed methods to estimate oscillator properties (Experiment 1) and compared the estimates across tasks and individuals (Experiment 2). Preferred rates, estimated as the stimulus rates with peak performance, showed a harmonic relationship across measurements and were correlated with individuals’ <i>spontaneous motor tempo</i>. Estimates from motor tasks were slower than those from the perceptual task, and the degree of slowing was consistent for each individual. Task performance decreased with trial-to-trial changes in stimulus rate, and responses on individual trials were biased toward the preceding trial’s stimulus properties. Flexibility, quantified as an individual’s ability to adapt to faster-than-previous rates, decreased with age. These findings show domain-specific rate preferences for the assumed oscillatory system underlying rhythm perception and production, and that this system loses its ability to flexibly adapt to changes in the external rhythmic context during aging.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94748">Coordinated molecular and ecological adaptations underlie a highly successful parasitoid</a></h4>

              
                The success of an organism depends on the molecular and ecological adaptations that promote its beneficial fitness. Parasitoids are valuable biocontrol agents for successfully managing agricultural pests, and they have evolved diversified strategies to adapt to both the physiological condition of hosts and the competition of other parasitoids. Here, we deconstructed the parasitic strategies in a highly successful parasitoid, <i>Trichopria drosophilae</i>, which parasitizes a broad range of <i>Drosophila</i> hosts, including the globally invasive species <i>D. suzukii</i>. We found that <i>T. drosophilae</i> had developed specialized venom proteins that arrest host development to obtain more nutrients via secreting tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs), as well as a unique type of cell—teratocytes—that digest host tissues for feeding by releasing trypsin proteins. In addition to the molecular adaptations that optimize nutritional uptake, this pupal parasitoid has evolved ecologically adaptive strategies including the conditional tolerance of intraspecific competition to enhance parasitic success in older hosts and the obligate avoidance of interspecific competition with larval parasitoids. Our study not only demystifies how parasitoids weaponize themselves to colonize formidable hosts but also provided empirical evidence of the intricate coordination between the molecular and ecological adaptations that drive evolutionary success.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/89889">Choline supplementation in early life improves and low levels of choline can impair outcomes in a mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease</a></h4>

              
                Maternal choline supplementation (MCS) improves cognition in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) models. However, the effects of MCS on neuronal hyperexcitability in AD are unknown. We investigated the effects of MCS in a well-established mouse model of AD with hyperexcitability, the Tg2576 mouse. The most common type of hyperexcitability in Tg2576 mice are generalized EEG spikes (interictal spikes [IIS]). IIS also are common in other mouse models and occur in AD patients. In mouse models, hyperexcitability is also reflected by elevated expression of the transcription factor ∆FosB in the granule cells (GCs) of the dentate gyrus (DG), which are the principal cell type. Therefore, we studied ΔFosB expression in GCs. We also studied the neuronal marker NeuN within hilar neurons of the DG because reduced NeuN protein expression is a sign of oxidative stress or other pathology. This is potentially important because hilar neurons regulate GC excitability. Tg2576 breeding pairs received a diet with a relatively low, intermediate, or high concentration of choline. After weaning, all mice received the intermediate diet. In offspring of mice fed the high choline diet, IIS frequency declined, GC ∆FosB expression was reduced, and hilar NeuN expression was restored. Using the novel object location task, spatial memory improved. In contrast, offspring exposed to the relatively low choline diet had several adverse effects, such as increased mortality. They had the weakest hilar NeuN immunoreactivity and greatest GC ΔFosB protein expression. However, their IIS frequency was low, which was surprising. The results provide new evidence that a diet high in choline in early life can improve outcomes in a mouse model of AD, and relatively low choline can have mixed effects. This is the first study showing that dietary choline can regulate hyperexcitability, hilar neurons, ΔFosB, and spatial memory in an animal model of AD.

	<p>Aim: Remethylation disorders such as 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) deficiency reduce the remethylation of homocysteine to methionine. The resulting hyperhomocysteinemia can lead to serious neurological consequences and multisystem toxicity. The role of MTHFR genotypes has not been investigated in patients with Rett Syndrome (RTT). In this study, we sought to assess the impact of co-occurring MTHFR genotypes on symptom profiles in RTT. Method: Using pharmacogenomic (PGx) testing, the MTHFR genetic polymorphisms rs1801133 (c.665C&amp;amp;gt;T mutation) and rs1801131 (c.1286A&amp;amp;gt;C mutation) were determined in 65 patients (18.7 years &amp;amp;plusmn; 12.1 [mean &amp;amp;plusmn; standard deviation]) with RTT as part of routine clinical care within the Centre for Interventional Paediatric Psychopharmacology (CIPP) Rett Centre, a National and Specialist Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service (CAMHS) in the UK. The clinical severity of patients was assessed using the RTT-anchored Clinical Global Impression Scale (RTT-CGI). Results: The clinical severity symptom distribution varied between the homozygous and heterozygous MTHFR rs1801133 and rs1801131 genotypes. Those with the homozygous genotype had a narrower spread of severity scores across several domains (language and communication, ambulation, hand-use and eye contact clinical domains). Patients with the homozygous genotype had statistically significantly greater CGI-Severity scores than individuals with a non-homozygous MTHFR genotype (Z = &amp;amp;minus;2.44, p = 0.015). When comparing the ratings of moderately impaired (4), markedly impaired (5), severely impaired (6) and extremely impaired (7), individuals with the homozygous MTHFR genotype were more impaired than those with the non-homozygous MTHFR genotype (Z = &amp;amp;minus;2.06, p = 0.039). There was no statistically significant difference in the number of prescribed anti-epileptic drugs between the genotypes. Conclusions: Our findings show that in those with a pathogenic RTT genetic variant, co-occurring homozygotic MTHFR rs1801133 and rs1801131 polymorphisms may act as associative genetic modifiers of clinical severity in a subset of patients. Profiling of rs1801133 and rs1801131 in RTT may therefore be useful, especially for high-risk patients who may be at the most risk from symptom deterioration.</p>

	<p>Attention is an essential psychological component in sports games, which conditions sports success. The purpose of this study was to identify the attention style (internal or external) and the weight of attention qualities depending on the practiced team sport (basketball, volleyball, or handball) and gender (female or male), in athletes aged 15&amp;amp;ndash;18. A total of 177 active athletes (87 female (mean age &amp;amp;plusmn; standard deviation: 16.07 &amp;amp;plusmn; 0.94 years) and 90 male (mean age &amp;amp;plusmn; standard deviation: 15.96 &amp;amp;plusmn; 0.82 years)) were involved in the study, including 62 handball players (28 female and 34 male), 58 volleyball players (30 female and 28 male) and 57 basketball players (29 female and 28 male). In the study, two questionnaires were applied: one implemented to identify the attentive style with the two dimensions internal and external (standardized), called questionnaire for the assessment of attentional style in athletes (QASA), and one designed by us, called questionnaire to identify the weights of attention qualities according to the characteristics of the practiced sport (QAQCS), aiming to identify the most relevant quality of attention, depending on the practiced sport. Cronbach&amp;amp;rsquo;s alpha for both questionnaires was between 0.701 and 0.855. The results recorded in the present study reveal a variation in the attentional style between the groups of athletes and between genders. The results of the study highlight that in handball, girls have a predominantly external style with a total of 10.213 points; in boys&amp;amp;rsquo; handball, the predominant focus of attention is internal with a total score of 9.087 points. Girls&amp;amp;rsquo; volleyball focus of attention is predominantly external, with 8.999 points; in boys&amp;amp;rsquo; volleyball, the attention style is internal, registering a score of 9.713 points. In girls&amp;amp;rsquo; basketball, the predominant focus of attention is internal, with a total score of 8.516 points; in boys&amp;amp;rsquo; basketball, the external attention style is predominant, with 9.213 points. Looking at the weight of attention qualities, it was found that the most relevant for girls is concentration and mobility for handball players, stability was identified in volleyball, and distributiveness in basketball. In boys&amp;amp;rsquo; handball teams, mobility is the most essential, just like in basketball, and in volleyball it was found that stability has the biggest impact. ANOVA analysis highlighted statistically significant differences between groups of sports games by gender category, at both subscales of (QASA), as well as QAQCS, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05. The results of our study highlight differences between the attentional styles and their qualities in relation to the gender and the specific sport played, which determines differentiated approaches to these psychological components</p>

	<p>The original conceptualization of REM sleep as paradoxical sleep was based on its EEG resembling wakefulness and its association with dreaming. Over time, the concept of paradox was expanded to include various associations with REM sleep, such as dream exclusivity, high recall, and pathophysiology. However, none of these associations are unique to REM sleep; they can also occur in other sleep states. Today, after more than fifty years of focused research, two aspects of REMS clearly retain paradoxical exclusivity. Despite the persistent contention that the EEG of human REMS consists of wake-like, low-voltage, non-synchronous electrical discharges, REMS is based on and defined by the intracranial electrical presence of 5&amp;amp;ndash;8 Hz. theta, which has always been the marker of REMS in other animals. The wake-like EEG used to define REMS on human polysomnography is secondary to a generalized absence of electrophysiological waveforms because the strong waves of intracranial theta do not propagate to scalp electrodes placed outside the skull. It is a persistent paradox that the theta frequency is restricted to a cyclical intracranial dynamic that does not extend beyond the lining of the brain. REMS has a persistent association with narratively long and salient dream reports. However, the extension of this finding to equate REMS with dreaming led to a foundational error in neuroscientific logic. Major theories and clinical approaches were built upon this belief despite clear evidence that dreaming is reported throughout sleep in definingly different physiologic and phenomenological forms. Few studies have addressed the differences between the dreams reported from the different stages of sleep so that today, the most paradoxical aspect of REMS dreaming may be how little the state has actually been studied. An assessment of the differences in dreaming between sleep stages could provide valuable insights into how dreaming relates to the underlying brain activity and physiological processes occurring during each stage. The brain waves and dreams of REMS persist as being paradoxically unique and different from waking and the other states of sleep consciousness.</p>

                <p>Formation and retrieval of remote contextual memory depends on cortical engram neurons that are defined during learning. Manipulation of astrocytic G<SUB>q</SUB> and G<SUB>i</SUB> associated G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling has been shown to affect memory processing, but little is known about the role of cortical astrocytic G<SUB>s</SUB>-GPCR signaling in remote memory acquisition and the functioning of cortical engram neurons. We assessed this by chemogenetic manipulation of astrocytes in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of male mice, during either encoding or consolidation of a contextual fear memory, while simultaneously labeling cortical engram neurons. We found that stimulation of astrocytic G<SUB>s</SUB> signaling during memory encoding and consolidation did not alter remote memory expression. In line with this, the size of the mPFC engram population and the recall-induced reactivation of these neurons was unaffected. Hence, our data indicate that activation of G<SUB>s</SUB>-GPCR signaling in cortical astrocytes is not sufficient to alter memory performance and functioning of cortical engram neurons.</p>

                <p>How features of complex visual patterns are combined to drive perception and eye movements is not well understood. Here we simultaneously assessed human observers&rsquo; perceptual direction estimates and ocular following responses (OFR) evoked by moving plaids made from two summed gratings with varying contrast ratios. When the gratings were of equal contrast, observers&rsquo; eye movements and perceptual reports followed the motion of the plaid pattern. However, when the contrasts were unequal, eye movements and reports during early phases of the OFR were biased toward the direction of the high-contrast grating component; during later phases, both responses followed the plaid pattern direction. The shift from component- to pattern-driven behavior resembles the shift in tuning seen under similar conditions in neuronal responses recorded from monkey MT. Moreover, for some conditions, pattern tracking and perceptual reports were correlated on a trial-by-trial basis. The OFR may therefore provide a precise behavioral readout of the dynamics of neural motion integration for complex visual patterns.</p>

                <p>by Soraya Mirzaei, Mojtaba Tefagh</p>

Microbial communities play fundamental roles in every complex ecosystem, such as soil, sea and the human body. The stability and diversity of the microbial community depend precisely on the composition of the microbiota. Any change in the composition of these communities affects microbial functions. An important goal of studying the interactions between species is to understand the behavior of microbes and their responses to perturbations. These interactions among species are mediated by the exchange of metabolites within microbial communities. We developed a computational model for the microbial community that has a separate compartment for exchanging metabolites. This model can predict possible metabolites that cause competition, commensalism, and mutual interactions between species within a microbial community. Our constraint-based community metabolic modeling approach provides insights to elucidate the pattern of metabolic interactions for each common metabolite between two microbes. To validate our approach, we used a toy model and a syntrophic co-culture of <i>Desulfovibrio vulgaris</i> and <i>Methanococcus maripaludis</i>, as well as another in co-culture between <i>Geobacter sulfurreducens</i> and <i>Rhodoferax ferrireducens</i>. For a more general evaluation, we applied our algorithm to the honeybee gut microbiome, composed of seven species, and the epiphyte strain <i>Pantoea eucalypti 299R</i>. The epiphyte strain Pe299R has been previously studied and cultured with six different phyllosphere bacteria. Our algorithm successfully predicts metabolites, which imply mutualistic, competitive, or commensal interactions. In contrast to OptCom, MRO, and MICOM algorithms, our COMMA algorithm shows that the potential for competitive interactions between an epiphytic species and Pe299R is not significant. These results are consistent with the experimental measurements of population density and reproductive success of the Pe299R strain.

Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) can be used for non-invasive evaluation of hemodynamics. However, its routine use is limited by labor-intensive manual segmentation, CFD mesh creation, and time-consuming simulation. This study aims to train a deep learning model to both generate patient-specific volume-meshes of the pulmonary artery from 3D cardiac MRI data and directly estimate CFD flow fields. This proof-of-concept study used 135 3D cardiac MRIs from both a public and private dataset. The pulmonary arteries in the MRIs were manually segmented and converted into volume-meshes. CFD simulations were performed on ground truth meshes and interpolated onto point-point correspondent meshes to create the ground truth dataset. The dataset was split 110/10/15 for training, validation, and testing. Image2Flow, a hybrid image and graph convolutional neural network, was trained to transform a pulmonary artery template to patient-specific anatomy and CFD values, taking a specific inlet velocity as an additional input. Image2Flow was evaluated in terms of segmentation, and the accuracy of predicted CFD was assessed using node-wise comparisons. In addition, the ability of Image2Flow to respond to increasing inlet velocities was also evaluated. Image2Flow achieved excellent segmentation accuracy with a median Dice score of 0.91 (IQR: 0.86–0.92). The median node-wise normalized absolute error for pressure and velocity magnitude was 11.75% (IQR: 9.60–15.30%) and 9.90% (IQR: 8.47–11.90), respectively. Image2Flow also showed an expected response to increased inlet velocities with increasing pressure and velocity values. This proof-of-concept study has shown that it is possible to simultaneously perform patient-specific volume-mesh based segmentation and pressure and flow field estimation using Image2Flow. Image2Flow completes segmentation and CFD in ~330ms, which is ~5000 times faster than manual methods, making it more feasible in a clinical environment.

                <p>by Lars D’Hondt, Friedl De Groote, Maarten Afschrift</p>

The unique structure of the human foot is seen as a crucial adaptation for bipedalism. The foot’s arched shape enables stiffening the foot to withstand high loads when pushing off, without compromising foot flexibility. Experimental studies demonstrated that manipulating foot stiffness has considerable effects on gait. In clinical practice, altered foot structure is associated with pathological gait. Yet, experimentally manipulating individual foot properties (e.g. arch height or tendon and ligament stiffness) is hard and therefore our understanding of how foot structure influences gait mechanics is still limited. Predictive simulations are a powerful tool to explore causal relationships between musculoskeletal properties and whole-body gait. However, musculoskeletal models used in three-dimensional predictive simulations assume a rigid foot arch, limiting their use for studying how foot structure influences three-dimensional gait mechanics. Here, we developed a four-segment foot model with a longitudinal arch for use in predictive simulations. We identified three properties of the ankle-foot complex that are important to capture ankle and knee kinematics, soleus activation, and ankle power of healthy adults: (1) compliant Achilles tendon, (2) stiff heel pad, (3) the ability to stiffen the foot. The latter requires sufficient arch height and contributions of plantar fascia, and intrinsic and extrinsic foot muscles. A reduced ability to stiffen the foot results in walking patterns with reduced push-off power. Simulations based on our model also captured the effects of walking with anaesthetised intrinsic foot muscles or an insole limiting arch compression. The ability to reproduce these different experiments indicates that our foot model captures the main mechanical properties of the foot. The presented four-segment foot model is a potentially powerful tool to study the relationship between foot properties and gait mechanics and energetics in health and disease.

The apicomplexan intracellular parasite <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i> is a major food borne pathogen that is highly prevalent in the global population. The majority of the <i>T</i>. <i>gondii</i> proteome remains uncharacterized and the organization of proteins into complexes is unclear. To overcome this knowledge gap, we used a biochemical fractionation strategy to predict interactions by correlation profiling. To overcome the deficit of high-quality training data in non-model organisms, we complemented a supervised machine learning strategy, with an unsupervised approach, based on similarity network fusion. The resulting combined high confidence network, ToxoNet, comprises 2,063 interactions connecting 652 proteins. Clustering identifies 93 protein complexes. We identified clusters enriched in mitochondrial machinery that include previously uncharacterized proteins that likely represent novel adaptations to oxidative phosphorylation. Furthermore, complexes enriched in proteins localized to secretory organelles and the inner membrane complex, predict additional novel components representing novel targets for detailed functional characterization. We present ToxoNet as a publicly available resource with the expectation that it will help drive future hypotheses within the research community.

OCD has been conceptualized as a disorder arising from dysfunctional beliefs, such as overestimating threats or pathological doubts. Yet, how these beliefs lead to compulsions and obsessions remains unclear. Here, we develop a computational model to examine the specific beliefs that trigger and sustain compulsive behavior in a simple symptom-provoking scenario. Our results demonstrate that a single belief disturbance–a lack of confidence in the effectiveness of one’s preventive (harm-avoiding) actions–can trigger and maintain compulsions and is directly linked to compulsion severity. This distrust can further explain a number of seemingly unrelated phenomena in OCD, including the role of not-just-right feelings, the link to intolerance to uncertainty, perfectionism, and overestimation of threat, and deficits in reversal and state learning. Our simulations shed new light on which underlying beliefs drive compulsive behavior and highlight the important role of perceived ability to exert control for OCD.

Computable biomedical knowledge (CBK) is: “the result of an analytic and/or deliberative process about human health, or affecting human health, that is explicit, and therefore can be represented and reasned upon using logic, formal standards, and mathematical approaches.” Representing biomedical knowledge in a machine-interpretable, computable form increases its ability to be discovered, accessed, understood, and deployed. Computable knowledge artifacts can greatly advance the potential for implementation, reproducibility, or extension of the knowledge by users, who may include practitioners, researchers, and learners. Enriching computable knowledge artifacts may help facilitate reuse and translation into practice. Following the examples of 10 Simple Rules papers for scientific code, software, and applications, we present 10 Simple Rules intended to make shared computable knowledge artifacts more useful and reusable. These rules are mainly for researchers and their teams who have decided that sharing their computable knowledge is important, who wish to go beyond simply describing results, algorithms, or models via traditional publication pathways, and who want to both make their research findings more accessible, and to help others use their computable knowledge. These rules are roughly organized into 3 categories: planning, engineering, and documentation. Finally, while many of the following examples are of computable knowledge in biomedical domains, these rules are generalizable to computable knowledge in any research domain.

Computational biologists are frequently engaged in collaborative data analysis with wet lab researchers. These interdisciplinary projects, as necessary as they are to the scientific endeavor, can be surprisingly challenging due to cultural differences in operations and values. In this Ten Simple Rules guide, we aim to help dry lab researchers identify sources of friction and provide actionable tools to facilitate respectful, open, transparent, and rewarding collaborations.

                <p>by Genís Bayarri, Pau Andrio, Josep Lluís Gelpí, Adam Hospital, Modesto Orozco</p>

Interactive Jupyter Notebooks in combination with Conda environments can be used to generate FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable/Reproducible) biomolecular simulation workflows. The interactive programming code accompanied by documentation and the possibility to inspect intermediate results with versatile graphical charts and data visualization is very helpful, especially in iterative processes, where parameters might be adjusted to a particular system of interest. This work presents a collection of FAIR notebooks covering various areas of the biomolecular simulation field, such as molecular dynamics (MD), protein–ligand docking, molecular checking/modeling, molecular interactions, and free energy perturbations. Workflows can be launched with myBinder or easily installed in a local system. The collection of notebooks aims to provide a compilation of demonstration workflows, and it is continuously updated and expanded with examples using new methodologies and tools.

                <p>by Bartosz A. Gren, Maciej Antczak, Tomasz Zok, Joanna I. Sulkowska, Marta Szachniuk</p>

Unlike proteins, RNAs deposited in the Protein Data Bank do not contain topological knots. Recently, admittedly, the first trefoil knot and some lasso-type conformations have been found in experimental RNA structures, but these are still exceptional cases. Meanwhile, algorithms predicting 3D RNA models have happened to form knotted structures not so rarely. Interestingly, machine learning-based predictors seem to be more prone to generate knotted RNA folds than traditional methods. A similar situation is observed for the entanglements of structural elements. In this paper, we analyze all models submitted to the CASP15 competition in the 3D RNA structure prediction category. We show what types of topological knots and structure element entanglements appear in the submitted models and highlight what methods are behind the generation of such conformations. We also study the structural aspect of susceptibility to entanglement. We suggest that predictors take care of an evaluation of RNA models to avoid publishing structures with artifacts, such as unusual entanglements, that result from hallucinations of predictive algorithms.

                <p>by Yu-Ying Phoebe Hsieh, Wanting Sun, Janet M. Young, Robin Cheung, Deborah A. Hogan, Ajai A. Dandekar, Harmit S. Malik</p>

Fungi and bacteria coexist in many polymicrobial communities, yet the molecular basis of their interactions remains poorly understood. Here, we show that the fungus <i>Candida albicans</i> sequesters essential magnesium ions from the bacterium <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>. To counteract fungal Mg<sup>2+</sup> sequestration, <i>P</i>. <i>aeruginosa</i> expresses the Mg<sup>2+</sup> transporter MgtA when Mg<sup>2+</sup> levels are low. Thus, loss of MgtA specifically impairs <i>P</i>. <i>aeruginosa</i> in co-culture with <i>C</i>. <i>albicans</i>, but fitness can be restored by supplementing Mg<sup>2+</sup>. Using a panel of fungi and bacteria, we show that Mg<sup>2+</sup> sequestration is a general mechanism of fungal antagonism against gram-negative bacteria. Mg<sup>2+</sup> limitation enhances bacterial resistance to polymyxin antibiotics like colistin, which target gram-negative bacterial membranes. Indeed, experimental evolution reveals that <i>P</i>. <i>aeruginosa</i> evolves <i>C</i>. <i>albicans</i>-dependent colistin resistance via non-canonical means; antifungal treatment renders resistant bacteria colistin-sensitive. Our work suggests that fungal–bacterial competition could profoundly impact polymicrobial infection treatment with antibiotics of last resort.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3002686">Humans can infer social preferences from decision speed alone</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Sophie Bavard, Erik Stuchlý, Arkady Konovalov, Sebastian Gluth</p>

Humans are known to be capable of inferring hidden preferences and beliefs of their conspecifics when observing their decisions. While observational learning based on choices has been explored extensively, the question of how response times (RT) impact our learning of others’ social preferences has received little attention. Yet, while observing choices alone can inform us about the direction of preference, they reveal little about the strength of this preference. In contrast, RT provides a continuous measure of strength of preference with faster responses indicating stronger preferences and slower responses signaling hesitation or uncertainty. Here, we outline a preregistered orthogonal design to investigate the involvement of both choices and RT in learning and inferring other’s social preferences. Participants observed other people’s behavior in a social preferences task (Dictator Game), seeing either their choices, RT, both, or no information. By coupling behavioral analyses with computational modeling, we show that RT is predictive of social preferences and that observers were able to infer those preferences even when receiving only RT information. Based on these findings, we propose a novel observational reinforcement learning model that closely matches participants’ inferences in all relevant conditions. In contrast to previous literature suggesting that, from a Bayesian perspective, people should be able to learn equally well from choices and RT, we show that observers’ behavior substantially deviates from this prediction. Our study elucidates a hitherto unknown sophistication in human observational learning but also identifies important limitations to this ability.

                <p>by Jiao Li, Chao Zhang, Yao Meng, Siqi Yang, Jie Xia, Huafu Chen, Wei Liao</p>

The human brain is organized as segregation and integration units and follows complex developmental trajectories throughout life. The cortical manifold provides a new means of studying the brain’s organization in a multidimensional connectivity gradient space. However, how the brain’s morphometric organization changes across the human lifespan remains unclear. Here, leveraging structural magnetic resonance imaging scans from 1,790 healthy individuals aged 8 to 89 years, we investigated age-related global, within- and between-network dispersions to reveal the segregation and integration of brain networks from 3D manifolds based on morphometric similarity network (MSN), combining multiple features conceptualized as a “fingerprint” of an individual’s brain. Developmental trajectories of global dispersion unfolded along patterns of molecular brain organization, such as acetylcholine receptor. Communities were increasingly dispersed with age, reflecting more disassortative morphometric similarity profiles within a community. Increasing within-network dispersion of primary motor and association cortices mediated the influence of age on the cognitive flexibility of executive functions. We also found that the secondary sensory cortices were decreasingly dispersed with the rest of the cortices during aging, possibly indicating a shift of secondary sensory cortices across the human lifespan from an extreme to a more central position in 3D manifolds. Together, our results reveal the age-related segregation and integration of MSN from the perspective of a multidimensional gradient space, providing new insights into lifespan changes in multiple morphometric features of the brain, as well as the influence of such changes on cognitive performance.

                Background Salmonella enterica are bacteria that include more than 2,500 serovars. Most of these serovars have been linked to human foodborne illnesses, mainly related to poultry and pigs. Thus, these animals are considered the reservoirs of many Salmonella serovars and strains related to antibiotic resistance. This study aimed to determine the prevalence, serovars, β-lactam resistance genes, and the risk factors associated with Salmonella enterica in pork commercialized in open markets of Quito city. Methods For this, 165 pork meat samples were taken from municipal markets in three areas in the city. These samples were microbiologically processed following the ISO 6579-2014 standardized method. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test was used to identify Salmonella serotyping and resistance genes. Strains not identified by PCR were typed by the Kauffman White Le Minor scheme. A multivariate analysis was performed to identify risk factors associated with the presence of the microorganism. Results Salmonella prevalence in pork was 9.1%. Identified serovars were 4, [5], 12: i:- (53.3%), Infantis (33.3%), and Derby (13.4%). Furthermore, the β-lactam resistance genes bla CTX-M-65 could be identified in three S. infantis isolates. Multivariate analysis showed that temperature (above 8°C) and cutting surfaces (wood) presented significant association values. Conclusions In conclusion, pork in traditional markets of Quito is contaminated with Salmonella enterica, whose main serovars pose a public health concern, and shows beta-lactam resistance.

                Background Every year, 15% of the global population suffers from migraines, making it a substantial social burden with a significant negative impact on quality of life. This systematic review aims to evaluate the comparative efficacy, safety profiles, cost-effectiveness, and additional dimensions of two prominent chronic migraine (CM) prophylactics: OnabotulinumtoxinA (BoNT-A) and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Methods Using specific keywords related to onabotulinumtoxinA and anti-CGRP treatments for migraines, we conducted a comprehensive search of electronic databases, including PubMed and the Cochrane Library, spanning from 2015 to 2024. The study followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Results Our analysis included 13 publications that revealed notable decreases in migraine frequency and severity with both treatment modalities. While CGRP mAbs demonstrated significant reductions in migraine days with minimal adverse effects, BoNT-A emerged as a superior option due to its cost-efficiency and higher patient satisfaction. Both treatments exhibited mild short-term side effects; however, CGRP mAbs were occasionally associated with extended periods of constipation. The simplicity of adherence, with either monthly self-administered injections of CGRP mAbs or quarterly physician-administered BoNT-A injections, further distinguished these treatments. BoNT-A, in particular, was recognized for enhancing overall quality of life and performance metrics. Conclusions BoNT-A stands out as a low-cost intervention effective across various migraine categories, including chronic, episodic, unilateral, and vestibular types, significantly alleviating pain severity and reducing migraine episode frequency. The findings underscore that both CGRP mAbs and BoNT-A are comparably effective for CM prophylaxis. However, BoNT-A is especially beneficial for patients ineligible for CGRP mAb therapy or those requiring localized treatment with minimal systemic exposure risk. For patients resistant or refractory to BoNT-A, combining it with CGRP mAbs may maximize therapeutic benefits due to their distinct modes of action. The efficacy, safety, and cost-benefit analyses of these medications may help clinicians make more informed treatment decisions based on the study's findings.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-664/v1?src=rss">(Semi)automated approaches to data extraction for systematic reviews and meta-analyses in social sciences: A living review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background An abundance of rapidly accumulating scientific evidence presents novel opportunities for researchers and practitioners alike, yet such advantages are often overshadowed by resource demands associated with finding and aggregating a continually expanding body of scientific information. Data extraction activities associated with evidence synthesis have been described as time-consuming to the point of critically limiting the usefulness of research. Across social science disciplines, the use of automation technologies for timely and accurate knowledge synthesis can enhance research translation value, better inform key policy development, and expand the current understanding of human interactions, organizations, and systems. Ongoing developments surrounding automation are highly concentrated in research for evidence-based medicine with limited evidence surrounding tools and techniques applied outside of the clinical research community. The goal of the present study is to extend the automation knowledge base by synthesizing current trends in the application of extraction technologies of key data elements of interest for social scientists. Methods We report the baseline results of a living systematic review of automated data extraction techniques supporting systematic reviews and meta-analyses in the social sciences. This review follows PRISMA standards for reporting systematic reviews. Results The baseline review of social science research yielded 23 relevant studies. Conclusions When considering the process of automating systematic review and meta-analysis information extraction, social science research falls short as compared to clinical research that focuses on automatic processing of information related to the PICO framework. With a few exceptions, most tools were either in the infancy stage and not accessible to applied researchers, were domain specific, or required substantial manual coding of articles before automation could occur. Additionally, few solutions considered extraction of data from tables which is where key data elements reside that social and behavioral scientists analyze.
