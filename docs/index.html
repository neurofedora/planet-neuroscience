                arXiv:2506.00035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We constructed a computational model of the driver's brain for steering tasks using the active inference framework, grounded in the free energy principle - a theory from computational neuroscience. This model enables quantitative estimation of how accurately the brain learns vehicle dynamics and performs appropriate steering, using a measure called variational free energy. Through driving simulator experiments, we observed strong correlations between variational free energy and both expert drivers' subjective "as-intended" scores and general participants' objective control performance. These results suggest that variational free energy provides a promising quantitative metric for evaluating whether a vehicle behaves "as-intended."

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00040">Constructing a bridge between functioning of oscillatory neuronal networks and quantum-like cognition along with quantum-inspired computation and AI</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2506.00040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum-like (QL) modeling, one of the outcomes of the quantum information revolution, extends quantum theory methods beyond physics to decision theory and cognitive psychology. While effective in explaining paradoxes in decision making and effects in cognitive psychology, such as conjunction, disjunction, order, and response replicability, it lacks a direct link to neural information processing in the brain. This study bridges neurophysiology, neuropsychology, and cognitive psychology, exploring how oscillatory neuronal networks give rise to QL behaviors. Inspired by the computational power of neuronal oscillations and quantum-inspired computation (QIC), we propose a quantum-theoretical framework for coupling of cognition/decision making and neural oscillations - {\it QL oscillatory cognition.} This is a step, may be very small, towards clarification of the relation between mind and matter and the nature of perception and cognition. We formulate four conjectures within QL oscillatory cognition and in principle they can checkedAsanoexperimentally. But such experimental tests need further theoretical and experimental elaboration. One of the conjectures (Conjecture 4) is on resolution of the binding problem by exploring QL states entanglement generated by the oscillations in a few neuronal networks. Our findings suggest that fundamental cognitive processes align with quantum principles, implying that humanoid AI should process information using quantum-theoretic laws. Quantum-Like AI (QLAI) can be efficiently realized via oscillatory networks performing QIC.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00071">Human sensory-musculoskeletal modeling and control of whole-body movements</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2506.00071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coordinated human movement depends on the integration of multisensory inputs, sensorimotor transformation, and motor execution, as well as sensory feedback resulting from body-environment interaction. Building dynamic models of the sensory-musculoskeletal system is essential for understanding movement control and investigating human behaviours. Here, we report a human sensory-musculoskeletal model, termed SMS-Human, that integrates precise anatomical representations of bones, joints, and muscle-tendon units with multimodal sensory inputs involving visual, vestibular, proprioceptive, and tactile components. A stage-wise hierarchical deep reinforcement learning framework was developed to address the inherent challenges of high-dimensional control in musculoskeletal systems with integrated multisensory information. Using this framework, we demonstrated the simulation of three representative movement tasks, including bipedal locomotion, vision-guided object manipulation, and human-machine interaction during bicycling. Our results showed a close resemblance between natural and simulated human motor behaviours. The simulation also revealed musculoskeletal dynamics that could not be directly measured. This work sheds deeper insights into the sensorimotor dynamics of human movements, facilitates quantitative understanding of human behaviours in interactive contexts, and informs the design of systems with embodied intelligence.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00138">Autonomous Behavior and Whole-Brain Dynamics Emerge in Embodied Zebrafish Agents with Model-based Intrinsic Motivation</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2506.00138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomy is a hallmark of animal intelligence, enabling adaptive and intelligent behavior in complex environments without relying on external reward or task structure. Existing reinforcement learning approaches to exploration in sparse reward and reward-free environments, including class of methods known as intrinsic motivation, exhibit inconsistent exploration patterns and thus fail to produce robust autonomous behaviors observed in animals. Moreover, systems neuroscience has largely overlooked the neural basis of autonomy, focusing instead on experimental paradigms where animals are motivated by external reward rather than engaging in unconstrained, naturalistic and task-independent behavior. To bridge these gaps, we introduce a novel model-based intrinsic drive explicitly designed to capture robust autonomous exploration observed in animals. Our method (3M-Progress) motivates naturalistic behavior by tracking divergence between the agent's current world model and an ethological prior. We demonstrate that artificial embodied agents trained with 3M-Progress capture the explainable variance in behavioral patterns and whole-brain neural-glial dynamics recorded from autonomously-behaving larval zebrafish, introducing the first goal-driven, population-level model of neural-glial computation. Our findings establish a computational framework connecting model-based intrinsic motivation to naturalistic behavior, providing a foundation for building artificial agents with animal-like autonomy.

                arXiv:2506.00484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In cognitive neuroscience research, Representational Dissimilarity Matrices (RDMs) are often incomplete because pairwise similarity judgments cannot always be exhaustively collected as the number of pairs rapidly increases with the number of conditions. Existing methods to fill these missing values, such as deep neural network imputation, are powerful but computationally demanding and relatively opaque. We introduce a simple algorithm based on geometric inference that fills missing dissimilarity matrix entries using known distances. We use tests on publicly available empirical cognitive neuroscience datasets, as well as simulations, to demonstrate the method's effectiveness and robustness across varying sparsity and matrix sizes. We have made this geometric reconstruction algorithm, implemented in Python and MATLAB, publicly available. This method provides a fast and accurate solution for completing partial dissimilarity matrices in the cognitive neurosciences.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01508">Driving factors of auditory category learning success</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2506.01508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our brain learns to update its mental model of the environment by abstracting sensory experiences for adaptation and survival. Learning to categorize sounds is one essential abstracting process for high-level human cognition, such as speech perception, but it is also challenging due to the variable nature of auditory signals and their dynamic contexts. To overcome these learning challenges and enhance learner performance, it is essential to identify the impact of learning-related factors in developing better training protocols. Here, we conducted an extensive meta-analysis of auditory category learning studies, including a total of 111 experiments and 4,521 participants, and examined to what extent three hidden factors (i.e., variability, intensity, and engagement) derived from 12 experimental variables contributed to learning success (i.e., effect sizes). Variables related to intensity and training variability outweigh others in predicting learning effect size. Activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis of the neuroimaging studies revealed training-induced systematic changes in the frontotemporal-parietal networks. Increased brain activities in speech and motor-related auditory-frontotemporal regions and decreased activities in cuneus and precuneus areas are associated with increased learning effect sizes. These findings not only enhance our understanding of the driving forces behind speech and auditory category learning success, along with its neural changes, but also guide researchers and practitioners in designing more effective training protocols that consider the three key aspects of learning to facilitate learner success.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01867">EEG Foundation Models for BCI Learn Diverse Features of Electrophysiology</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2506.01867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brain computer interface (BCI) research, as well as increasing portions of the field of neuroscience, have found success deploying large-scale artificial intelligence (AI) pre-training methods in conjunction with vast public repositories of data. This approach of pre-training foundation models using label-free, self-supervised objectives offers the potential to learn robust representations of neurophysiology, potentially addressing longstanding challenges in neural decoding. However, to date, much of this work has focused explicitly on standard BCI benchmarks and tasks, which likely overlooks the multitude of features these powerful methods might learn about brain function as well as other electrophysiological information. We introduce a new method for self-supervised BCI foundation model pre-training for EEG inspired by a transformer-based approach adapted from the HuBERT framework originally developed for speech processing. Our pipeline is specifically focused on low-profile, real-time usage, involving minimally pre-processed data and just eight EEG channels on the scalp. We show that our foundation model learned a representation of EEG that supports standard BCI tasks (P300, motor imagery), but also that this model learns features of neural data related to individual variability, and other salient electrophysiological components (e.g., alpha rhythms). In addition to describing and evaluating a novel approach to pre-training BCI models and neural decoding, this work opens the aperture for what kind of tasks and use-cases might exist for neural data in concert with powerful AI methods.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00730">Getting More from Less: Transfer Learning Improves Sleep Stage Decoding Accuracy in Peripheral Wearable Devices</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2506.00730v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transfer learning, a technique commonly used in generative artificial intelligence, allows neural network models to bring prior knowledge to bear when learning a new task. This study demonstrates that transfer learning significantly enhances the accuracy of sleep-stage decoding from peripheral wearable devices by leveraging neural network models pretrained on electroencephalographic (EEG) signals. Consumer wearable technologies typically rely on peripheral physiological signals such as pulse plethysmography (PPG) and respiratory data, which, while convenient, lack the fidelity of clinical electroencephalography (EEG) for detailed sleep-stage classification. We pretrained a transformer-based neural network on a large, publicly available EEG dataset and subsequently fine-tuned this model on noisier peripheral signals. Our transfer learning approach improved overall classification accuracy from 67.6\% (baseline model trained solely on peripheral signals) to 76.6\%. Notable accuracy improvements were observed across sleep stages, particularly lighter sleep stages such as REM and N1. These results highlight transfer learning's potential to substantially enhance the accuracy and utility of consumer wearable devices without altering existing hardware. Future integration of self-supervised learning methods may further boost performance, facilitating more precise, longitudinal sleep monitoring for personalized health applications.

Using a subset of the ChineseEEG dataset, where each sentence contains approximately ten Chinese characters aligned with 128-channel EEG recorded at 256 Hz, we segment EEG into per-character embeddings and predict full sentences in a zero-shot setting. The decoder is trained with teacher forcing and padding masks to accommodate variable-length sequences. Evaluation on over 1,500 training-validation sentences and 300 held-out test samples shows promising lexical alignment, with a best BLEU-1 score of 6.38\%. While syntactic fluency remains a challenge, our findings demonstrate the feasibility of non-phonetic, cross-modal language decoding from EEG. This work opens a new direction in multilingual brain-to-text research and lays the foundation for future cognitive-language interfaces in Chinese.

                arXiv:2506.01303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Episodic memory enables humans to recall past experiences by associating semantic elements such as objects, locations, and time into coherent event representations. While large pretrained models have shown remarkable progress in modeling semantic memory, the mechanisms for forming associative structures that support episodic memory remain underexplored. Inspired by hippocampal CA3 dynamics and its role in associative memory, we propose the Latent Structured Hopfield Network (LSHN), a biologically inspired framework that integrates continuous Hopfield attractor dynamics into an autoencoder architecture. LSHN mimics the cortical-hippocampal pathway: a semantic encoder extracts compact latent representations, a latent Hopfield network performs associative refinement through attractor convergence, and a decoder reconstructs perceptual input. Unlike traditional Hopfield networks, our model is trained end-to-end with gradient descent, achieving scalable and robust memory retrieval. Experiments on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and a simulated episodic memory task demonstrate superior performance in recalling corrupted inputs under occlusion and noise, outperforming existing associative memory models. Our work provides a computational perspective on how semantic elements can be dynamically bound into episodic memory traces through biologically grounded attractor mechanisms.

                arXiv:2506.01456v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies have shown that integrating multimodal data fusion techniques for imaging and genetic features is beneficial for the etiological analysis and predictive diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, there are several critical flaws in current deep learning methods. Firstly, there has been insufficient discussion and exploration regarding the selection and encoding of genetic information. Secondly, due to the significantly superior classification value of AD imaging features compared to genetic features, many studies in multimodal fusion emphasize the strengths of imaging features, actively mitigating the influence of weaker features, thereby diminishing the learning of the unique value of genetic features. To address this issue, this study proposes the dynamic multimodal role-swapping network (GenDMR). In GenDMR, we develop a novel approach to encode the spatial organization of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), enhancing the representation of their genomic context. Additionally, to adaptively quantify the disease risk of SNPs and brain region, we propose a multi-instance attention module to enhance model interpretability. Furthermore, we introduce a dominant modality selection module and a contrastive self-distillation module, combining them to achieve a dynamic teacher-student role exchange mechanism based on dominant and auxiliary modalities for bidirectional co-updating of different modal data. Finally, GenDMR achieves state-of-the-art performance on the ADNI public dataset and visualizes attention to different SNPs, focusing on confirming 12 potential high-risk genes related to AD, including the most classic APOE and recently highlighted significant risk genes. This demonstrates GenDMR's interpretable analytical capability in exploring AD genetic features, providing new insights and perspectives for the development of multimodal data fusion techniques.

                arXiv:2309.15174v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Abrupt changes in behavior can often be associated with changes in underlying behavioral states. When placed off food, the foraging behavior of C. elegans can be described as a change between an initial local-search behavior characterized by a high rate of reorientations, followed by a global-search behavior characterized by sparse reorientations. This is commonly observed in individual worms, but when numerous worms are characterized, only about half appear to exhibit this behavior. We propose an alternative model that predicts both abrupt and continuous changes to reorientation that does not rely on behavioral states. This model is inspired by molecular dynamics modeling that defines the foraging reorientation rate as a decaying parameter. By stochastically sampling from the probability distribution defined by this rate, both abrupt and gradual changes to reorientation rates can occur, matching experimentally observed results. Crucially, this model does not depend on behavioral states or information accumulation. Even though abrupt behavioral changes do occur, they may not necessarily be indicative of abrupt changes in behavioral states, especially when abrupt changes are not universally observed in the population.

                arXiv:2503.19128v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In typical Stroop experiments, participants perform better when the colors and words are congruent compared to when they are incongruent or neutral. Paradoxically, in some experimental conditions, neutral trials are faster than congruent trials. This phenomenon is known as Reverse Facilitation Effect (RFE). However, RFE has not been consistently replicated, leading to the so-called fragile results. There are some models that capture this effect, but they are not parsimonious. Here we employed our previous model of priming effect, without its conflict monitoring module, to demonstrate that RFE, including its fragility, is mainly due to attentional dynamics with limited resources. The simulations of the RFE resulted from weak attentional activation for neutral stimuli (e.g., non-color or nonword strings) that causes less attentional refraction for the target stimuli (e.g., font colors). The refractory period or attenuation of attention usually happens when meaningful stimuli (color name primes) are used along font color targets. This simpler model provides a straightforward understanding of the underlying processes.

                arXiv:2505.18361v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tactile sensing remains far less understood in neuroscience and less effective in artificial systems compared to more mature modalities such as vision and language. We bridge these gaps by introducing a novel Encoder-Attender-Decoder (EAD) framework to systematically explore the space of task-optimized temporal neural networks trained on realistic tactile input sequences from a customized rodent whisker-array simulator. We identify convolutional recurrent neural networks (ConvRNNs) as superior encoders to purely feedforward and state-space architectures for tactile categorization. Crucially, these ConvRNN-encoder-based EAD models achieve neural representations closely matching rodent somatosensory cortex, saturating the explainable neural variability and revealing a clear linear relationship between supervised categorization performance and neural alignment. Furthermore, contrastive self-supervised ConvRNN-encoder-based EADs, trained with tactile-specific augmentations, match supervised neural fits, serving as an ethologically-relevant, label-free proxy.
  For neuroscience, our findings highlight nonlinear recurrent processing as important for general-purpose tactile representations in somatosensory cortex, providing the first quantitative characterization of the underlying inductive biases in this system. For embodied AI, our results emphasize the importance of recurrent EAD architectures to handle realistic tactile inputs, along with tailored self-supervised learning methods for achieving robust tactile perception with the same type of sensors animals use to sense in unstructured environments.

                arXiv:2506.01659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite substantial research into the biological basis of memory, the precise mechanisms by which experiences are encoded, stored, and retrieved in the brain remain incompletely understood. A growing body of evidence supports the engram theory, which posits that sparse populations of neurons undergo lasting physical and biochemical changes to support long-term memory. Yet, a comprehensive computational framework that integrates biological findings with mechanistic models remains elusive. This work synthesizes insights from cellular neuroscience and computational modeling to address key challenges in engram research: how engram neurons are identified and manipulated; how synaptic plasticity mechanisms contribute to stable memory traces; and how sparsity promotes efficient, interference-resistant representations. Relevant computational approaches -- such as sparse regularization, engram gating, and biologically inspired architectures like Sparse Distributed Memory and spiking neural networks -- are also examined. Together, these findings suggest that memory efficiency, capacity, and stability emerge from the interaction of plasticity and sparsity constraints. By integrating neurobiological and computational perspectives, this paper provides a comprehensive theoretical foundation for engram research and proposes a roadmap for future inquiry into the mechanisms underlying memory, with implications for the diagnosis and treatment of memory-related disorders.

Abstract: Both biological cortico-thalamic networks and artificial transformer networks use canonical computations to perform a wide range of cognitive tasks. In this work, we propose that the structure of cortico-thalamic circuits is well suited to realize a computation analogous to multihead self-attention, the main algorithmic innovation of transformers. We start with the concept of a cortical unit module or microcolumn, and propose that superficial and deep pyramidal cells carry distinct computational roles. Specifically, superficial pyramidal cells encode an attention mask applied onto deep pyramidal cells to compute attention-modulated values. We show how to wire such microcolumns into a circuit equivalent to a single head of self-attention. We then suggest the parallel between one head of attention and a cortical area. On this basis, we show how to wire cortico-thalamic circuits to perform multihead self-attention. Along these constructions, we refer back to existing experimental data, and find noticeable correspondence. Finally, as a first step towards a mechanistic theory of synaptic learning in this framework, we formally derive gradient-based updates for the parameters of a multihead linear self-attention block and propose steps towards their implementation by local synaptic plasticity.

Abstract: This study aims to optimize the evaluation metric of multimodal multi-objective optimization problems using a Regionalized Metric Framework, which provides a certain boost to research in this field. Existing evaluation metrics usually use the reference set as the evaluation basis, which inevitably leads to reference set dependence. To optimize this problem, this study proposes an evaluation metric based on a Regionalized Metric Framework. The algorithm divides the set of solutions to be evaluated into three regions, and evaluates each solution according to a unique scoring function for each region, which is combined to form the evaluation value of the solution set. To verify the feasibility of this method, a comparative experiment was conducted in this study. The results of the experiment are roughly the same as the trend of existing indicators, and at the same time, it can accurately judge the advantages and disadvantages of points equidistant from the reference set. Our method provides a new perspective for further research on evaluation metrics for multimodal multi-objective optimization algorithms.

                arXiv:2506.00490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Combinatorial optimization problems are widely encountered in real-world applications. Designing high-quality heuristic algorithms that efficiently approximate optimal solutions within reasonable time is a critical research challenge. In recent years, many works have explored integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) with Evolutionary Algorithms to automate heuristic algorithm design through prompt engineering. However, these approaches generally adopt a problem-specific paradigm, applying a single algorithm across all problem instances, failing to account for the heterogeneity across instances. In this paper, we propose InstSpecHH, a novel framework that introduces the concept of instance-specific heuristic generation. InstSpecHH partitions the overall problem class into sub-classes based on instance features and performs differentiated, automated heuristic design for each problem subclass. By tailoring heuristics to the unique features of different sub-classes, InstSpecHH achieves better performance at the problem class level while avoiding redundant heuristic generation for similar instances, thus reducing computational overhead. This approach effectively balances the trade-off between the cost of automatic heuristic design and the quality of the obtained solutions. To evaluate the performance of InstSpecHH, we conduct experiments on 4,500 subclasses of the Online Bin Packing Problem (OBPP) and 365 subclasses of the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP). Experimental results show that InstSpecHH demonstrates strong intra-subclass and inter-subclass generalization capabilities. Compared to previous problem-specific methods, InstSpecHH reduces the average optimality gap by more than 5.6\% for OBPP and 0.9\% for CVRP. These results highlight the potential of instance-aware automatic heuristic design to further enhance solution quality.

                arXiv:2506.00825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal optimization requires both exploration and exploitation. Exploration identifies promising attraction basins, while exploitation finds the best solutions within these basins. The balance between exploration and exploitation can be maintained by adjusting parameter settings. The population size adaptation covariance matrix adaption evolutionary strategy algorithm (PSA-CMA-ES) achieves this balance by dynamically adjusting population size. PSA-CMA-ES performs well on well-structured multimodal benchmark problems. In weakly structured multimodal problems, however, the algorithm struggles to effectively manage step-size increases, resulting in uncontrolled step-size blow-ups that impede convergence near the global optimum. In this study, we reformulated the step-size correction strategy to overcome this limitation. We analytically identified the cause of the step-size blow-up and demonstrate the existence of a significance level for population size change guiding a safe passage to step-size correction. These insights were incorporated to form the reformulation. Through computer experiments on two weakly structured multimodal benchmark problems, we evaluated the performance of the new approach and compared the results with the state-of-the-art algorithm. The improved algorithm successfully mitigates step-size blow-up, enabling a better balance between exploration and exploitation near the global optimum enhancing convergence.

Abstract: The Electric Vehicle Routing Problem (EVRP) extends the capacitated vehicle routing problem by incorporating battery constraints and charging stations, posing significant optimization challenges. This paper introduces a Trilevel Memetic Algorithm (TMA) that hierarchically optimizes customer sequences, route assignments, and charging station insertions. The method combines genetic algorithms with dynamic programming, ensuring efficient and high-quality solutions.

                arXiv:2506.01107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The move-acceptance hyper-heuristic was recently shown to be able to leave local optima with astonishing efficiency (Lissovoi et al., Artificial Intelligence (2023)). In this work, we propose two modifications to this algorithm that demonstrate impressive performances on a large class of benchmarks including the classic Cliff$_d$ and Jump$_m$ function classes. (i) Instead of randomly choosing between the only-improving and any-move acceptance operator, we take this choice via a simple two-state Markov chain. This modification alone reduces the runtime on Jump$_m$ functions with gap parameter $m$ from $\Omega(n^{2m-1})$ to $O(n^{m+1})$. (ii) We then replace the all-moves acceptance operator with the operator that only accepts worsenings. Such a, counter-intuitive, operator has not been used before in the literature. However, our proofs show that our only-worsening operator can greatly help in leaving local optima, reducing, e.g., the runtime on Jump functions to $O(n^3 \log n)$ independent of the gap size. In general, we prove a remarkably good runtime of $O(n^{k+1} \log n)$ for our Markov move-acceptance hyper-heuristic on all members of a new benchmark class SEQOPT$_k$, which contains a large number of functions having $k$ successive local optima, and which contains the commonly studied Jump$_m$ and Cliff$_d$ functions for $k=2$.

                arXiv:2506.01117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have gained significant attention for their potential to enable energy-efficient artificial intelligence. However, effective and efficient training of SNNs remains an unresolved challenge. While backpropagation through time (BPTT) achieves high accuracy, it incurs substantial memory overhead. In contrast, biologically plausible local learning methods are more memory-efficient but struggle to match the accuracy of BPTT. To bridge this gap, we propose spatio-temporal decouple learning (STDL), a novel training framework that decouples the spatial and temporal dependencies to achieve both high accuracy and training efficiency for SNNs. Specifically, to achieve spatial decoupling, STDL partitions the network into smaller subnetworks, each of which is trained independently using an auxiliary network. To address the decreased synergy among subnetworks resulting from spatial decoupling, STDL constructs each subnetwork's auxiliary network by selecting the largest subset of layers from its subsequent network layers under a memory constraint. Furthermore, STDL decouples dependencies across time steps to enable efficient online learning. Extensive evaluations on seven static and event-based vision datasets demonstrate that STDL consistently outperforms local learning methods and achieves comparable accuracy to the BPTT method with considerably reduced GPU memory cost. Notably, STDL achieves 4x reduced GPU memory than BPTT on the ImageNet dataset. Therefore, this work opens up a promising avenue for memory-efficient SNN training. Code is available at https://github.com/ChenxiangMA/STDL.

Abstract: This paper introduces SpiceMixer, a genetic algorithm developed to synthesize novel analog circuits by evolving SPICE netlists. Unlike conventional methods, SpiceMixer operates directly on netlist lines, enabling compatibility with any component or subcircuit type and supporting general-purpose genetic operations. By using a normalized netlist format, the algorithm enhances the effectiveness of its genetic operators: crossover, mutation, and pruning. We show that SpiceMixer achieves superior performance in synthesizing standard cells (inverter, two-input NAND, and latch) and in designing an analog classifier circuit for the Iris dataset, reaching an accuracy of 89% on the test set. Across all evaluated tasks, SpiceMixer consistently outperforms existing synthesis methods.

                arXiv:2506.01737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have emerged as a class of bio -inspired networks that leverage sparse, event- driven signaling to achieve low-power computation while inherently modeling temporal dynamics. Such characteristics align closely with the demands of ubiquitous computing systems, which often operate on resource- constrained devices while continuously monitoring and processing time - series sensor data. Despite their unique and promising features, SNNs have received limited attention and remain underexplored (or at least, under-adopted) within the ubiquitous computing community. To address this gap, this paper first introduces the core components of SNNs, both in terms of models and training mechanisms. It then presents a systematic survey of 76 SNN-based studies focused on time-series data analysis, categorizing them into six key application domains. For each domain, we summarize relevant works and subsequent advancements, distill core insights, and highlight key takeaways for researchers and practitioners. To facilitate hands-on experimentation, we also provide a comprehensive review of current software frameworks and neuromorphic hardware platforms, detailing their capabilities and specifications, and then offering tailored recommendations for selecting development tools based on specific application needs. Finally, we identify prevailing challenges within each application domain and propose future research directions that need be explored in ubiquitous community. Our survey highlights the transformative potential of SNNs in enabling energy-efficient ubiquitous sensing across diverse application domains, while also serving as an essential introduction for researchers looking to enter this emerging field.

                arXiv:2506.00178v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Prompt engineering represents a critical bottleneck to harness the full potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) for solving complex tasks, as it requires specialized expertise, significant trial-and-error, and manual intervention. This challenge is particularly pronounced for tasks involving subjective quality assessment, where defining explicit optimization objectives becomes fundamentally problematic. Existing automated prompt optimization methods falter in these scenarios, as they typically require well-defined task-specific numerical fitness functions or rely on generic templates that cannot capture the nuanced requirements of complex use cases. We introduce DEEVO (DEbate-driven EVOlutionary prompt optimization), a novel framework that guides prompt evolution through a debate-driven evaluation with an Elo-based selection. Contrary to prior work, DEEVOs approach enables exploration of the discrete prompt space while preserving semantic coherence through intelligent crossover and strategic mutation operations that incorporate debate-based feedback, combining elements from both successful and unsuccessful prompts based on identified strengths rather than arbitrary splicing. Using Elo ratings as a fitness proxy, DEEVO simultaneously drives improvement and preserves valuable diversity in the prompt population. Experimental results demonstrate that DEEVO significantly outperforms both manual prompt engineering and alternative state-of-the-art optimization approaches on open-ended tasks and close-ended tasks despite using no ground truth feedback. By connecting LLMs reasoning capabilities with adaptive optimization, DEEVO represents a significant advancement in prompt optimization research by eliminating the need of predetermined metrics to continuously improve AI systems.

                arXiv:2506.00377v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The widespread adoption of the Internet of Things (IoT) has raised a new challenge for developers since it is prone to known and unknown cyberattacks due to its heterogeneity, flexibility, and close connectivity. To defend against such security breaches, researchers have focused on building sophisticated intrusion detection systems (IDSs) using machine learning (ML) techniques. Although these algorithms notably improve detection performance, they require excessive computing power and resources, which are crucial issues in IoT networks considering the recent trends of decentralized data processing and computing systems. Consequently, many optimization techniques have been incorporated with these ML models. Specifically, a special category of optimizer adopted from the behavior of living creatures and different aspects of natural phenomena, known as metaheuristic algorithms, has been a central focus in recent years and brought about remarkable results. Considering this vital significance, we present a comprehensive and systematic review of various applications of metaheuristics algorithms in developing a machine learning-based IDS, especially for IoT. A significant contribution of this study is the discovery of hidden correlations between these optimization techniques and machine learning models integrated with state-of-the-art IoT-IDSs. In addition, the effectiveness of these metaheuristic algorithms in different applications, such as feature selection, parameter or hyperparameter tuning, and hybrid usages are separately analyzed. Moreover, a taxonomy of existing IoT-IDSs is proposed. Furthermore, we investigate several critical issues related to such integration. Our extensive exploration ends with a discussion of promising optimization algorithms and technologies that can enhance the efficiency of IoT-IDSs.

                arXiv:2506.00533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural traveling salesman problem (TSP) solvers face two critical challenges: poor generalization for scalable TSPs and high training costs. To address these challenges, we propose a new Rescaling Graph Convolutional Network (RsGCN). Focusing on the scale-dependent features (i.e., features varied with problem scales) related to nodes and edges that influence the sensitivity of GCNs to the problem scales, a Rescaling Mechanism in RsGCN enhances the generalization capability by (1) rescaling adjacent nodes to construct a subgraph with a uniform number of adjacent nodes for each node across various scales of TSPs, which stabilizes the graph message aggregation; (2) rescaling subgraph edges to adjust the lengths of subgraph edges to the same magnitude, which maintains numerical consistency. In addition, an efficient training strategy with a mixed-scale dataset and bidirectional loss is used in RsGCN. To fully exploit the heatmaps generated by RsGCN, we design an efficient post-search algorithm termed Re2Opt, in which a reconstruction process based on adaptive weight is incorporated to help avoid local optima. Based on a combined architecture of RsGCN and Re2Opt, our solver achieves remarkable generalization and low training cost: with only 3 epochs of training on the mixed-scale dataset containing instances with up to 100 nodes, it can be generalized successfully to 10K-node instances without any fine-tuning. Extensive experiments demonstrate our state-of-the-art performance across uniform distribution instances of 9 different scales from 20 to 10K nodes and 78 real-world instances from TSPLIB, while requiring the fewest learnable parameters and training epochs among neural competitors.

                arXiv:2506.00920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep sequence models typically degrade in accuracy when test sequences significantly exceed their training lengths, yet many critical tasks--such as algorithmic reasoning, multi-step arithmetic, and compositional generalization--require robust length extrapolation. We introduce PRISM, a Probabilistic Relative-position Implicit Superposition Model, a novel positional encoding mechanism that enables Transformers to extrapolate accurately up to 10x beyond their training length. PRISM learns continuous relative positions through a differentiable histogram-filter update, preserving position uncertainty via a probabilistic superposition rather than conventional deterministic embeddings. Empirically, PRISM achieves state-of-the-art length extrapolation, successfully generalizing to previously intractable sequence lengths across algorithmic benchmarks--including arithmetic (addition, multiplication), SCAN compositionality tasks, and complex copy variants derived from DeepMind's recent datasets. Our analysis demonstrates that PRISM's stochastic positional encoding maintains sharp and interpretable internal states, providing a theoretical basis for reliable length generalization. These results advance the goal of neural sequence models that remain algorithmically robust at lengths far exceeding their training horizon.

Abstract: While legged robots have achieved significant advancements in recent years, ensuring the robustness of their controllers on unstructured terrains remains challenging. It requires generating diverse and challenging unstructured terrains to test the robot and discover its vulnerabilities. This topic remains underexplored in the literature. This paper presents a Quality-Diversity framework to generate diverse and challenging terrains that uncover weaknesses in legged robot controllers. Our method, applied to both simulated bipedal and quadruped robots, produces an archive of terrains optimized to challenge the controller in different ways. Quantitative and qualitative analyses show that the generated archive effectively contains terrains that the robots struggled to traverse, presenting different failure modes. Interesting results were observed, including failure cases that were not necessarily expected. Experiments show that the generated terrains can also be used to improve RL-based controllers.

Abstract: The increasing scale of modern neural networks, exemplified by architectures from IBM (530 billion neurons) and Google (500 billion parameters), presents significant challenges in terms of computational cost and infrastructure requirements. As deep neural networks continue to grow, traditional training paradigms relying on monolithic GPU clusters become increasingly unsustainable. This paper proposes a distributed system architecture that partitions a neural network across multiple servers, each responsible for a subset of neurons. Neurons are classified as local or remote, with inter-server connections managed via a metadata-driven lookup mechanism. A Multi-Part Neural Network Execution Engine facilitates seamless execution and training across distributed partitions by dynamically resolving and invoking remote neurons using stored metadata. All servers share a unified model through a network file system (NFS), ensuring consistency during parallel updates. A Neuron Distributor module enables flexible partitioning strategies based on neuron count, percentage, identifiers, or network layers. This architecture enables cost-effective, scalable deployment of deep learning models on cloud infrastructure, reducing dependency on high-performance centralized compute resources.

Abstract: Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) are a promising tool in the NISQ era, leveraging quantum computing across diverse fields. However, their performance is hindered by optimization challenges like local minima, barren plateaus, and noise from current quantum hardware. Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE), a key subset of VQAs, approximates molecular ground-state energies by minimizing a Hamiltonian, enabling quantum chemistry applications. Beyond this, VQE contributes to condensed matter physics by exploring quantum phase transitions and exotic states, and to quantum machine learning by optimizing parameterized circuits for classifiers and generative models. This study systematically evaluates over 50 meta-heuristic optimization algorithms including evolution-based, swarm-based, and music-inspired methods-on their ability to navigate VQE's multimodal and noisy landscapes. Using a multi-phase sieve-like approach, we identify the most capable optimizers and compare their performance on a 1D Ising model (3-9 qubits). Further testing on the Hubbard model (up to 192 parameters) reveals insights into convergence rates, effectiveness, and resilience under noise, offering valuable guidance for advancing optimization in noisy quantum environments.

Abstract: Rapid detection of gas concentration is important in different domains like gas leakage monitoring, pollution control, and so on, for the prevention of health hazards. Out of different types of gas sensors, Metal oxide (MOx) sensors are extensively used in such applications because of their portability, low cost, and high sensitivity for specific gases. However, how to effectively sample the MOx data for the real-time detection of gas and its concentration level remains an open question. Here, we introduce a simple analog front-end for one MOx sensor that encodes the gas concentration in the time difference between pulses of two separate pathways. This front-end design is inspired by the spiking output of a mammalian olfactory bulb. We show that for a gas pulse injected in a constant airflow, the time difference between pulses decreases with increasing gas concentration, similar to the spike time difference between the two principal output neurons in the olfactory bulb. The circuit design is further extended to a MOx sensor array, and this sensor array front-end was tested in the same environment for gas identification and concentration estimation. Encoding of gas stimulus features in analog spikes at the sensor level itself may result in data and power-efficient real-time gas sensing systems in the future that can ultimately be used in uncontrolled and turbulent environments for longer periods without data explosion.

                arXiv:2504.07884v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study focuses on mixed-variable black-box optimization (MV-BBO), addressing continuous, integer, and categorical variables. Many real-world MV-BBO problems involve dependencies among these different types of variables, requiring efficient methods to optimize them simultaneously. Recently, stochastic optimization methods leveraging the mechanism of the covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy have shown promising results in mixed-integer or mixed-category optimization. However, such methods cannot handle the three types of variables simultaneously. In this study, we propose CatCMA with Margin (CatCMAwM), a stochastic optimization method for MV-BBO that jointly optimizes continuous, integer, and categorical variables. CatCMAwM is developed by incorporating a novel integer handling into CatCMA, a mixed-category black-box optimization method employing a joint distribution of multivariate Gaussian and categorical distributions. The proposed integer handling is carefully designed by reviewing existing integer handlings and following the design principles of CatCMA. Even when applied to mixed-integer problems, it stabilizes the marginal probability and improves the convergence performance of continuous variables. Numerical experiments show that CatCMAwM effectively handles the three types of variables, outperforming state-of-the-art Bayesian optimization methods and baselines that simply incorporate existing integer handlings into CatCMA.

                arXiv:2310.13391v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to address the challenge of online sequence learning for decision making under uncertainty in non-stationary, partially observable environments. The proposed algorithm, Distributed Hebbian Temporal Memory (DHTM), is based on the factor graph formalism and a multi-component neuron model. DHTM aims to capture sequential data relationships and make cumulative predictions about future observations, forming Successor Features (SFs). Inspired by neurophysiological models of the neocortex, the algorithm uses distributed representations, sparse transition matrices, and local Hebbian-like learning rules to overcome the instability and slow learning of traditional temporal memory algorithms such as RNN and HMM. Experimental results show that DHTM outperforms LSTM, RWKV and a biologically inspired HMM-like algorithm, CSCG, on non-stationary data sets. Our results suggest that DHTM is a promising approach to address the challenges of online sequence learning and planning in dynamic environments.

                arXiv:2405.15927v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spike-based encoders represent information as sequences of spikes or pulses, which are transmitted between neurons. A prevailing consensus suggests that spike-based approaches demonstrate exceptional capabilities in capturing the temporal dynamics of neural activity and have the potential to provide energy-efficient solutions for low-power applications. The Spiketrum encoder efficiently compresses input data using spike trains or code sets (for non-spiking applications) and is adaptable to both hardware and software implementations, with lossless signal reconstruction capability. The paper proposes and assesses Spiketrum's hardware, evaluating its output under varying spike rates and its classification performance with popular spiking and non-spiking classifiers, and also assessing the quality of information compression and hardware resource utilization. The paper extensively benchmarks both Spiketrum hardware and its software counterpart against state-of-the-art, biologically-plausible encoders. The evaluations encompass benchmarking criteria, including classification accuracy, training speed, and sparsity when using encoder outputs in pattern recognition and classification with both spiking and non-spiking classifiers. Additionally, they consider encoded output entropy and hardware resource utilization and power consumption of the hardware version of the encoders. Results demonstrate Spiketrum's superiority in most benchmarking criteria, making it a promising choice for various applications. It efficiently utilizes hardware resources with low power consumption, achieving high classification accuracy. This work also emphasizes the potential of encoders in spike-based processing to improve the efficiency and performance of neural computing systems.

                arXiv:2411.10958v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although quantization for linear layers has been widely used, its application to accelerate the attention process remains limited. To further enhance the efficiency of attention computation compared to SageAttention while maintaining precision, we propose SageAttention2, which utilizes significantly faster 4-bit matrix multiplication (Matmul) alongside additional precision-enhancing techniques. First, we propose to quantize matrices $(Q, K)$ to INT4 in a hardware-friendly thread-level granularity and quantize matrices $(\widetilde P, V)$ to FP8. Second, we propose a method to smooth $Q$, enhancing the accuracy of INT4 $QK^\top$. Third, we propose a two-level accumulation strategy for $\widetilde PV$ to enhance the accuracy of FP8 $\widetilde PV$. The operations per second (OPS) of SageAttention2 surpass FlashAttention2 and xformers by about 3x and 4.5x on RTX4090, respectively. Moreover, SageAttention2 matches the speed of FlashAttention3(fp8) on the Hopper GPUs, while delivering much higher accuracy. Comprehensive experiments confirm that our approach incurs negligible end-to-end metrics loss across diverse models, including those for language, image, and video generation. The code is available at https://github.com/thu-ml/SageAttention.

">In vivo neural activity of electrosensory pyramidal cells: Biophysical characterization and phenomenological modeling</a></h4>

              
                Burst firing is an important property of neuronal activity, thought to enhance sensory encoding. While previous studies show significant differences in burst firing between in vivo and in vitro conditions, how burst firing contributes to neural coding in vivo and how it is modulated by underlying biophysical mechanisms when neurons are under active synaptic bombardments remains poorly understood. Here, we combined intracellular recordings and computational modeling to investigate how cellular and synaptic mechanisms can explain the in vivo firing activity of electrosensory lateral line lobe (ELL) pyramidal cells in Apteronotus leptorhynchus. We developed a biophysically detailed compartmental model incorporating voltage-gated currents, NMDA receptor-mediated calcium influx, calcium-activated SK channels, calcium handling, and stochastic synaptic inputs to reproduce in vivo firing activities of ELL pyramidal cells. Specifically, using bifurcation analysis, we identified dynamical transitions between quiescent, tonic, and bursting regimes, governed by interactions among SK conductance, NMDA receptor activation, and applied current. Model parameters were optimized against in vivo data, accurately reproducing action potential waveforms and temporal dynamics, including characteristic bimodal interspike interval distributions reflecting intra- and inter-burst intervals. We further developed a modified Hindmarsh-Rose model incorporating dual adaptation variables and stochastic noise. This simplified phenomenological model successfully captured burst firings comparable to those observed in the biophysical model and recorded data, while replicating diverse firing patterns observed across the population. Finally, parameter sensitivity analysis revealed slow adaptation dynamics and noise intensity as key determinants of spiking variability within cells. Overall, our modeling results demonstrate that in vivo bursting arises from synergistic interactions between intrinsic conductances (e.g., NMDA-SK coupling), calcium mobilization, and synaptic stochasticity, offering a potential reconciliation for discrepancies with in vitro firing activity. The models provide mechanistic insights into how background synaptic activity modulates burst firing and validate simplified frameworks for studying population-level dynamics.

">Evolution's boldest trick: Neurotransmission modulated whole-brain computation captures full task repertoire</a></h4>

              
                The perhaps most important unsolved problem in neuroscience is how the brain survives in a complex world by performing a rich repertoire of computation on a minimal energy budget. The brain is much better at adapting to the multiplicity of stimuli and outcomes than current generations of computers, artificial neural deep learning and reservoir model architectures. Yet, at first glance the brain appears to use a fixed anatomical architecture to perform the necessary huge variety of computations. But evolution's boldest trick is that in fact the brain's effective connectivity is constantly being updated through neuromodulation to allow the rich repertoire of computation. Inspired by this, we created a whole-brain model using empirical neurotransmitter maps modulating the underlying local regional dynamics. This NEMO (neurotransmission modulated) whole-brain model is able to flexibly compute the full task repertoire and associated functional connectivity of the neuroimaging data from 971 healthy participants. For each individual we defined a measure of 'brain computability' as the fitting of the NEMO whole-brain model to all tasks performed by the individual. Importantly, brain computability correlates with both behavioural performance on individual tasks and with a general behavioural measure of intelligence. Overall, our proposed unifying NEMO framework offers a natural way to sculpt different brain dynamics in a fixed brain architecture to compute the rich repertoire of tasks required for surviving and thriving.

">Quantifying neuronal differentiation using temporal topological persistence</a></h4>

              
                Neuronal anatomical differentiation relies on coordinated neurite dynamics to establish class-type morphology during development. Recent advances in high-throughput time-lapse imaging techniques have transformed our ability to track such growth dynamics, yielding comprehensive anatomical datasets of neuronal morphologies at unprecedented rates. However, analyzing these complex datasets using traditional morphometrics requires manual feature selection, which leads to costly and biased quantification. To overcome these limitations, we applied the Topological Morphology Descriptor (TMD) to extract topological representations of neurons from time-lapse imaging of two cell types within the well-established Drosophila larval sensory dendritic arborization (da) system. We first used TMD to accurately classify the developmental trajectory of Class I da sensory neurons across embryonic and larval stages. However, TMD alone failed to distinguish class-type-specific morphology in Class III neurons, particularly in detecting altered branching rate dynamics in genetically modified mutants. To address this, we extended TMD to a Temporal Topological Morphology Descriptor (TTMD) to incorporate temporal dynamics. TTMD successfully classified mutations in Drosophila Class III da neurons, capturing altered branching rate dynamics in mutant phenotypes. These findings highlight the power of TTMD as an unbiased, scalable framework for analyzing neuronal growth dynamics and linking structural development to genetic and functional variation.

">Coordinated dynamics of excitatory and inhibitory synapse assembly</a></h4>

              
                Neural circuits composed of multitudes of diverse synaptic connections self-organize during mammalian brain development. A balance between excitatory and inhibitory synaptic function is required for information processing by these neural circuits. Despite the importance of this balance, the interplay between excitatory and inhibitory synaptic assembly during circuit establishment remains unclear due to a lack of means to monitor both processes simultaneously. Here, we develop imaging approaches to visualize and track excitatory and inhibitory synapses concurrently. By applying these approaches, we find that despite continual dynamics, excitatory and inhibitory synaptic density remain at synchronized levels during synaptogenesis. These results support coordinated excitatory and inhibitory synapse assembly to maintain functional balance despite continual synaptic turnover.

">Low-Rank Tensor Encoding Models Decompose Natural Speech Comprehension Processes</a></h4>

              
                How does the brain process language over time? Research suggests that natural human language is processed hierarchically across brain regions over time. However, attempts to characterize this computation have thus far been limited to tightly controlled experimental settings that capture only a coarse picture of the brain dynamics underlying human natural language comprehension. The recent emergence of LLM encoding models promises a new avenue to discover and characterize rich semantic information in the brain, yet interpretable methods for linking information in LLMs to language processing over time are limited. In this work, we develop a low-rank tensor regression method to decompose LLM encoding models into interpretable components of semantics, time, and brain region activation, and apply the method to a Magnetoencephalography (MEG) dataset in which subjects listened to narrative stories. With only a few components, we show improved performance compared to a standard ridge regression encoding model, suggesting the low-rank models provide a good inductive bias for language encoding. In addition, our method discovers a diverse spectrum of interpretable response components that are sensitive to a rich set of low-level and semantic language features, showing that our method is able to separate distinct language processing features in neural signals. After controlling for low-level audio and sentence features, we demonstrate better capture of semantic features. Through use of low-rank tensor encoding models we are able to decompose neural responses to language features, showing improved encoding performance and interpretable processing components, suggesting our method as a useful tool for uncovering language processes in naturalistic settings.

">Cortical language areas are coupled via a soft hierarchy of model-based linguistic features</a></h4>

              
                Natural language comprehension is a complex task that relies on coordinated activity across a network of cortical regions. In this study, we propose that regions of the language network are coupled to one another through subspaces of shared linguistic features. To test this idea, we developed a model-based connectivity framework to quantify stimulus-driven, feature-specific functional connectivity between language areas during natural language comprehension. Using fMRI data acquired while subjects listened to spoken narratives, we tested three types of features extracted from a unified neural network model for speech and language: low-level acoustic embeddings, mid-level speech embeddings, and high-level language embeddings. Our modeling framework enabled us to quantify the stimulus features that drive connectivity between regions: early auditory areas were coupled to intermediate language areas via lower-level acoustic and speech features; in contrast, higher-order language and default-mode regions were predominantly coupled through more abstract language features. We observed a clear progression of feature-specific connectivity from early auditory to lateral temporal areas, advancing from acoustic connectivity to speech- and finally to language-driven connectivity. These findings suggest that regions of the language network are coupled through feature-specific communication channels to facilitate efficient and context-sensitive language processing.

">Aberrant cerebrovascular reactivity presents as an early biomarker of psychosis susceptibility in patients with 22q11.2DS</a></h4>

              
                The brain's ability to regulate blood flow is fundamental to both its function and development. In the context of neurodevelopmental disorders such as schizophrenia, understanding the complex interactions between cerebrovascular health and brain function is crucial for unraveling the pathophysiology of psychosis. This study investigates the developmental trajectory of cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) in 22q11 deletion syndrome (22q11.2DS) compared to healthy controls, and its association with psychosis susceptibility. Using a longitudinal data-set of resting-state fMRI, we mapped voxel-level CVR across development. We found significant and early CVR impairments in 22q11.2DS, and in particular in those who later developed positive psychotic symptoms (PPS+). These impairments were evident within the anterior cingulate cortex, frontal lobes, and globi pallidi (GB). We propose that the pattern of CVR reduction presenting early during childhood is possibly linked to blood brain barrier impairment. A decrease in CVR during childhood and within the frontal regions and GB was predictive of subsequent development of positive psychotic symptoms (PPS), which often occurs during adolescence in 22q11.2DS patients. These findings suggest that cerebrovascular health is critical for normal brain development, particularly in regions like the striatum, which are vulnerable to vascular damage due to their anatomical features. These results underline the potential of CVR as an early biomarker for psychosis vulnerability, emphasizing the need for targeted interventions to mitigate neurodevelopmental disruptions of cerebrovascular health in 22q11.2DS.

">Autism-associated SCN2A deficiency disrupts cortico-striatal circuitry in human brain assembloids</a></h4>

              
                Profound autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is frequently attributable to single-gene mutations, with SCN2A (voltage-gated sodium channel NaV1.2) protein-truncating variants (PTVs) being one of the most penetrant. Although cortico-striatal circuitry is implicated as a key node in ASD, the impact of SCN2A deficiency on human neural circuits is unknown. Using the human cortico-striatal assembloid model, we show that the autism-causing PTV SCN2A-C959X impairs long-range cortical axonal projections, reduces striatal spine density, and attenuates excitatory cortical-striatal synaptic transmission. Surprisingly, these assembloids carrying the heterozygous SCN2A nonsense mutation exhibited pronounced network hyperexcitability, a human cell-specific phenotype not observed in Scn2a+/- mice, highlighting a human-specific circuit vulnerability. Collectively, our study unveils human circuit-specific dysfunctions of SCN2A deficiency and SCN2A-mediated ASD.

">Less is More: Lower Levels of Task-Induced Hippocampal Activation Predict Better Performance on a Separate Verbal Memory Evaluation</a></h4>

              
                Memories that differ in content or duration differ in the extent to which they depend on the hippocampus, and also the part of the hippocampus, posterior (pHPC) or anterior (aHPC), that they implicate. Inter-individual differences in learning-related activation in different hippocampal subregions have been found to predict specific differences in memory abilities. The complexity of these relationships creates a setting that is ripe for theoretically informative investigation, but that can also lead to reports of spurious relationships that do not reflect underlying neurobiological associations. Across-study replication is therefore a critical first step toward understanding how differences in hippocampal activity drive individual differences in memory ability. In the domain of verbal memory, Wig et al. (2008) identified a negative relationship between task-induced activation in pHPC and out-of-scanner verbal memory test performance. Replicating this result in an independent sample of 86 participants, we identified the same negative correlation between pHPC activation during a Lithuanian word learning task and out-of-scanner California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT-II) performance. This replication represents a critical step toward understanding how pHPC supports verbal memory by answering the basic question of whether the relationship can be reliably observed.

                The use of citation metrics for evaluation of individual researchers has dramatically increased over the last decade. However, currently existing indices either are based on misleading premises or are cumbersome to implement. This leads to poor assessment of researchers and creates dangerous trends in science, such as overproduction of low quality articles.

Moreover, it can be calculated with the help of freely available software.

                Background This study explores the complex relationship between organizational politics, emotional intelligence and employee behavior in contemporary settings. Organizational politics, which is widespread in organizational settings, has a substantial impact on different aspects of employee behavior. Emotional Intelligence has become a vital factor in individuals’ capacity to successfully traverse the complexities of an organization. This study consolidates current material to offer insights into the impact of organizational politics on employee behavior and the mediating role of emotional intelligence in this connection. Methods A survey was undertaken with a sample size of 500 employees hailing from several Information Technology (IT) and Information Technology Enabled Services (ITES) firms in the Dehradun (Uttarakhand) region. The study employed quantitative methodologies to investigate the correlations between Emotional Intelligence, Perceived Organizational Politics and Employee Behavior. The data were evaluated using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM) to examine the hypothesized correlations and mediation effects. Results The study identified substantial correlations between Emotional Intelligence, Perceived Organizational Politics, and Employee Behavior. Emotional Intelligence was discovered to have a positive impact on Behavioral Dynamics. Perceived Organizational Politics had a substantial influence on both Emotional Intelligence and Behavioral Dynamics. Factors such as Need for Power, Relationship Conflict, Resource Constraints, Role Conflict, and Workforce Diversity were discovered to have an impact on Perceived Organizational Politics. Conclusions The results confirm strong connections between organizational politics, emotional intelligence, and employee behavior, highlighting the significance of these concepts in comprehending employee behavior in organizational environments. The study proposes that enhancing employees' emotional intelligence can alleviate the adverse effects of organizational politics, resulting in enhanced behavioral dynamics. The study also addresses the limits, outlines potential areas for further research, and highlights the managerial implications. It suggests that firms should prioritize the development of emotional intelligence to cultivate a favorable work environment.

                Objective To develop and test the psychometric properties of the Thai version of the Impact and Burden of Care Scale for Caregivers of Persons with Schizophrenia and Co-occurring Methamphetamine Use (TIBSCSM). Methods This pilot study involved 142 caregivers of individuals with schizophrenia and methamphetamine use. Sample adequacy was assessed using the Kaiser–Meyer–Olkin (KMO) method, while Bartlett’s test evaluated the item correlation matrix. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was conducted to identify underlying factors. Results The 32-item TIBSCSM showed convergent validity correlations with two quality-of-life measures. The KMO value was 0.90, and Bartlett’s Test of Sphericity yielded χ2 = 5248.5, df = 496, p < 0.001. The Content Validity Index (CVI) was 1, indicating high internal consistency reliability (α = 0.90). EFA identified four constructs: physical function, self-esteem, role and social enjoyment, and relationship satisfaction. The model exhibited strong reliability and validity, with an average variance extracted (AVE) of 0.948 and composite reliability (CR) of 0.987, accounting for 64.90% of the variance. Conclusion The TIBSCSM scale provides valuable insights for psychiatric nurses and mental health teams to measure the impact and burden experienced by caregivers of individuals with schizophrenia and methamphetamine use. It is particularly useful for nursing, research, education, and clinical practice, especially in addressing the caregiver burdens exacerbated during the COVID-19 pandemic. Implication for nursing and research The TIBSCSM, developed in the Thai context, can facilitate studies evaluating variations in caregiver impact across different settings.

                Introduction Traumatic spinal spondyloptosis, though rare, harbingers a high risk of mortality as well as permanent and disabling neurological deficits. They invariably become socially aloof and marginalized in most parts of our subcontinent owing to the lack of dedicated rehabilitation units amid their poor economic status. There is a paucity of studies pertaining to such rare epiphenomenon within our region. Materials ad Methods A retrospective study of 16 patients presenting with spinal spondyloptosis in a tertiary care center in Nepal was undertaken. The clinical records of the patients were retrieved from the hospital record section to study the demographic variables, modes of injury, American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) grades, salient radiological characteristics, management strategies, and the resultant clinical outcomes. Result The mean age of the cohorts in our study was 40 years with an age range of 25-80 years. Most of the patients presented in ASIA ‘A’ neurological grade (75%). The cervical spine was involved in the majority (68.75%) of cases. 8 (50%) patients left against medical advice, 2 (12.5%) were managed conservatively, and 6 (37.5%) were operated. The posterior-only approach was undertaken in 4(66.67%) cases. Tracheo-oesophageal fistula occurred in 2 (33.33%) patients. And cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak occurred in 2 (33.33%) patients. The overall hospital mortality was 3(37.5%). Conclusion Traumatic spinal spondyloptosis on our center mostly involved cervical spine (68.75%). 75% of the patients presented with ASIA ‘A’ neurological grade. 50% of them left against medical advice. 37.5% were operated. The overall hospital mortality was 37.5%. This study emphasizes the implementation of a national spinal trauma data bank and the systematic implementation of dedicated neuro-rehabilitation units. This will thereby help improve the clinical outcome among these ‘socially aloof’ and marginalized subsets of neurosurgical patients.

A scoping review was performed using the following four databases: Scopus, PubMed, Sage, and Google Scholar. Screening was conducted using the following criteria: articles written in English, open access, and published between 2020 and 2024. Articles must discuss natural disasters and medication preparedness for elderly. In the data search, we input several keywords that include “elderly,” “natural disaster,” “preparedness,” and “medication.” Snowballing was then conducted to find articles on preparedness interventions. Data extraction and analysis were then performed. Results There were 20 articles used in this review and the results highlight that elderly face unique challenges in disaster preparedness including, mobility limitation, restricted access to medication, communication barriers, limited social and social support. Tailored interventions such as disaster education and elderly-focused technology are crucial to improve preparedness and ensure their safety during emergencies. Conclusion The findings from this literature review are the majority of studies showing that most elderly people are not well prepared in facing disasters; however, through various programs that have been implemented by either the government or community, the elderly show more preparation when they encounter any natural disaster.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-550/v1?src=rss">The multi-dimensional impact of psycho-socio-economics on the use of electronic cigarettes [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Objectives To assess the use of electronic cigarettes among college students, health professionals, and young adults in eastern Saudi Arabia, and the integration of psychosocial and economic factors on its use. Methods An online survey consisting of four sections–demographics, knowledge, use, and factors influencing e-cigarette use–was distributed among a convenience sample of young adults. The survey was distributed via social media platforms using snowball sampling. SPSS was used to analyze the data at a 5% significance level. Results In total, 3017 participants responded to the survey. The majority of the participants were male (63%), had a college degree or higher (65.4%), and were younger than 25 years old (53%). Twenty-two percent of the study sample used e-cigarettes constantly, while 22% used it for the trial. The regression model found that females were more likely to use e-cigarettes than males (OR=1.39), but without significance (95% CI=0.87-2.23). Older participants were significantly more likely to use e-cigarettes than those who were younger than 25 years. Compared to nonsmokers, cigarette smokers and former smokers were significantly more likely to use e-cigarettes. The multidimensional impact of psycho-socio-economics found that economic status was not a significant factor, whereas psychological and social factors were inversely related to the use of e-cigarettes. Conclusion In the presence of all factors, the multidimensional influence of psychosocial factors is either less important or inversely related to e-cigarette use.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-549/v1?src=rss">The classification of walking and phases of gait using EEG: a scoping review protocol. [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction Brain computer interfaces (BCI) have potential to optimise rehabilitative robotic assisted gait training by ‘closing the loop’ between humans and robotic devices. However, there is a need to first develop classification systems that can recognise distinct gait phases (e.g. stance and swing phases) and walking from other motor activity, before entraining back to robotic devices in real time. No consensus exists on what electroencephalogram (EEG) data is helpful nor the optimal gait classification system. Therefore, this scoping review aims to map and synthesise current practices in gait classification using EEG providing a compendium of successful classification methods. Objective The objective of this scoping review is to collate and summarise the state-of-the art research relating to the use of EEG to classify walking against any other states and classify the different phases of gait in healthy individuals and/or those with a central neurological pathology. Methodology A scoping review will be conducted, adhering to the JBI methodology and the PRISMA Extension for Scoping Reviews reporting guidelines. Searches will be conducted in electronic bases using a search strategy based on key concepts. Identified studies will be exported to Covidence software for screening by two independent reviewers. Articles will be screened against inclusion and exclusion criteria at title/abstract and full manuscript phases. Included studies will be limited to aforementioned populations. Included studies will collect and utilise EEG data to classify the walking state and/or gait phases. Studies analysing brain activity during gait by other means will be excluded. A data charting proforma will be developed to extract pertinent data. This will be presented in tabular form and by narrative analysis. Implication This scoping review will collate the current body of literature addressing gait classification using EEG, mapping current practices and providing a compendium of classification systems developed to date.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-548/v1?src=rss">Optimizing Treatment Strategies and Risk Stratification in Tibial Fractures: A Meta-Analysis of Fixation Timing, Modality, and Fracture Classification on Acute Compartment Syndrome Risk. [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction Acute compartment syndrome (ACS) following tibial fractures can lead to permanent neuromuscular dysfunction and limb amputation if not rapidly diagnosed and treated a correct manner. The risk factors for ACS development in detailed classified manner remain limited, and the management strategies to minimize risk are controversial. We conducted this meta-analysis to quantify ACS risk factors and evaluate the impact of treatment modalities on ACS incidence in tibial fractures. Methods We searched multiple literature scientific databases up to 17th of April 2025. Primary studies that investigated ACS risk factors in tibial fractures were included. We conducted random and fixed-effects meta-analyses, subgroup analyses, and meta-regression to estimate the risk factors and treatment effects. Study quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Results Seventeen studies with total of 274,962 patients and 10,019 ACS cases met our inclusion criteria. Delayed fixation after 24 hours was associated with 67% reduced ACS risk (OR: 0.33, 95% CI: 0.19-0.58) compared to early fixation, with strongest effects in young males with plateau fractures. Proximal tibial fractures demonstrated significantly higher risk than shaft or distal fractures (OR: 2.02, 95% CI: 1.53-2.66). Male patients had higher risk with two to four folds across age groups. External fixation showed protective effects versus immediate internal fixation, especially for plateau fractures (OR: 0.46, 95% CI: 0.27-0.79). Meta-regression identified fracture type, injury mechanism, and patient demographics explaining 67% of treatment effect variance. Conclusion Our study results are going in an opposite direction to the standard approach of early fixation for tibial fractures, suggesting that delayed fixation or temporary spanning external fixation may significantly reduce ACS risk in high-risk patients. A patient tailored risk-stratified treatment algorithm considering fracture location, patient demographics, and injury mechanism could optimize management according to individual profile to reduce the risk of ACS development furtherly.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1256/v2?src=rss">SCUBA implements a storage format-agnostic API for single-cell data access in R [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                While robust tools exist for the analysis of single-cell datasets in both Python and R, interoperability is limited, and analysis tools generally only accept one object class. Considerable programming expertise is required to integrate tools across package ecosystems into a comprehensive analysis, due to their differing languages and internal data structures. This complicates validation of results and leads to inconsistent visualizations between analysis suites. Conversion between object formats is the most common solution, but this is difficult and error-prone due to the rapid pace of development of the analysis suites and their underlying data structures. To address this, we created SCUBA (Single-Cell Unified Backend API), an R package that implements a unified data access API for all common R and Python single-cell object formats. SCUBA extends the data access approach from the widely used Seurat package to SingleCellExperiment and anndata objects. SCUBA also implements new data-specific access functions for all supported object types. Performance scales well across all SCUBA-supported formats. In addition to performance, SCUBA offers several advantages over object conversion for the visualization and further analysis of pre-processed single-cell data. First, SCUBA extracts only data required for the operation at hand, leaving the original object unmodified. This process is simpler, less error prone, and less memory intensive than object conversion, which operates on the entire dataset. Second, code written with SCUBA can use any supported object class as input, with simple and consistent syntax across object formats. This allows a single analysis script or package (like our interactive single-cell browser, scExploreR) to work seamlessly with multiple object types, reducing the complexity of the code and improving both readability and reproducibility. Adoption of SCUBA will ultimately improve collaboration and reproducible research in single-cell analysis by lowering the barriers between package ecosystems.

                <p>by Siyu Chen, Sudhir Venkatesan, Sofie Arnetorp, Klas Bergenheim, Sabada Dube, Wilhelmine Meeraus, Cátia Ferreira, Sylvia Taylor, Lisa J. White</p>

Many immunocompromised individuals mount inadequate immune responses following COVID-19 vaccination, thus relying on other social distancing behaviours, particularly shielding, for protection, impacting their quality of life. However, little is known about historical/current levels and effectiveness of shielding or factors influencing individuals’ decision to continue shielding. Long-acting antibody pre-exposure prophylaxis (LAAB-PrEP) provides direct protection against COVID-19 in immunocompromised individuals who have been and may continue to shield. However, the proportion and incidence of circulating variants for which LAAB-PrEP would be effective is unpredictable. Given this uncertain behavioural and immuno-epidemiological context, we developed a modelling framework to explore features that most impact health outcomes and cost effectiveness of long-term administration of LAAB-PrEP against COVID-19 infection in immunocompromised individuals in the English context. The model predicted that the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of LAAB-PrEP against COVID-19 in immunocompromised individuals will be largely driven by features of utility of shielding, current/future shielding behaviour, cost of shielding, risk of COVID-19 hospitalisation among immunocompromised individuals and the time horizon used for the cost-effectiveness analysis. The model estimated that for realistic ranges of influential factors, it is possible for LAAB-PrEP to be cost effective under the conditions that most immunocompromised individuals would shield indefinitely if it were not available but would switch to LAAB-PrEP if it were. Thus, if individuals stop shielding when taking LAAB-PrEP, then LAAB-PrEP is cost effective.

                <p>by Yujia Wen, Zhixue He, Chen Shen, Jun Tanimoto</p>

Indirect punishment traditionally sustains cooperation in social systems through reputation or norms, often by reducing defectors’ payoffs indirectly. In this study, we redefine indirect punishment for structured populations as a spatially explicit mechanism, where individuals on a square lattice target second-order defectors—those harming their neighbors—rather than their own immediate defectors, guided by the principle: “I help you by punishing those who defect against you”. Using evolutionary simulations, we compare this adapted indirect punishment to direct punishment, where individuals punish immediate defectors. Results show that within a narrow range of low punishment costs and fines, adapted indirect punishment outperforms direct punishment in promoting cooperation. However, outside this cost-fine region, outcomes vary: direct punishment may excel, both may be equally effective, or neither improves cooperation, depending on the parameter values. These findings hold even when network reciprocity alone does not support cooperation. Notably, when adapted indirect punishment outperforms direct punishment in promoting cooperation, defectors face stricter penalties without appreciably increasing punishers’ costs, making it more efficient than direct punishment. Overall, our findings provide insights into the role of indirect punishment in structured populations and highlight its importance in understanding the evolution of cooperation.

                <p>by Rosie Berners-Lee, Eamonn Gilmore, Francisco Berkemeier, Michael A. Boemo</p>

In order to maintain genomic integrity, DNA replication must be highly coordinated. Disruptions in this process can cause replication stress which is aberrant in many pathologies including cancer. Despite this, little is known about the mechanisms governing the temporal regulation of DNA replication initiation, thought to be related to the limited copy number of firing factors. Here, we present a high (1-kilobase) resolution stochastic model of <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> whole-genome replication in which origins compete to associate with limited firing factors. After developing an algorithm to fit this model to replication timing data, we validated the model by reproducing experimental inter-origin distances, origin efficiencies, and replication fork directionality. This suggests the model accurately simulates the aspects of DNA replication most important for determining its dynamics. We also use the model to predict measures of DNA replication dynamics which are yet to be determined experimentally and investigate the potential impacts of variations in firing factor concentrations on DNA replication.

                <p>by Harini Suri, Karla Salgado-Puga, Yixuan Wang, Nayomie Allen, Kaitlynn Lane, Kyra Granroth, Alberto Olivei, Nathanial Nass, Gideon Rothschild</p>

A crucial aspect of auditory perception is the ability to use sound cues to predict future events and to time actions accordingly. For example, the sound of an approaching vehicle signals when it is safe to cross the street; distinct smartphone notification sounds reflect a call that needs to be answered within a few seconds, or a text that can be read later. Other animals similarly use sounds to plan, time and execute behaviors such as hunting, evading predation and tending to offspring. However, the neural mechanisms that underlie sound-guided prediction of upcoming salient event timing are not well understood. To address this gap, we employed an appetitive sound-triggered reward time prediction behavior in head-fixed mice. We find that mice trained on this task reliably estimate the time from a sound cue to upcoming reward on the scale of a few seconds, as demonstrated by learning-dependent well-timed increases in predictive licking for reward. Moreover, mice showed a dramatic impairment in their ability to use sound to predict delayed reward when the auditory cortex was inactivated, demonstrating its causal involvement. To identify the neurophysiological signatures of auditory cortical reward-timing prediction, we recorded local field potentials during learning and performance of this behavior and found that the magnitude of auditory cortical responses to the sound prospectively encoded the duration of the anticipated sound-reward time interval. Next, we explored how and where these sound-triggered time interval prediction signals propagate from the auditory cortex to time and initiate consequent action. We targeted the monosynaptic projections from the auditory cortex to the posterior striatum and found that chemogenetic inactivation of these projections impaired animals’ ability to predict sound-triggered delayed reward. Simultaneous neural recordings in the auditory cortex and posterior striatum during task performance revealed coordination of neural activity across these regions during the sound cue predicting the time interval to reward. Collectively, our findings identify an auditory cortical-striatal circuit supporting sound-triggered timing-prediction behaviors.

                Background Breast cancer in elderly patients, particularly in centenarians, presents unique diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. Encapsulated papillary carcinoma (EPC) is a rare subtype that typically exhibits indolent behavior, but its aggressive course remains poorly understood. This report describes an exceptional case of EPC in a 102-year-old woman with a rapid metastatic progression. Case Presentation A 102-year-old female with hypertension presented with a one-year history of a progressively enlarging, left-sided breast mass. Imaging revealed a 28 cm cystic mass with a 14 cm intracystic nodule. Biopsy confirmed ER-positive, PR-negative, HER2-negative encapsulated papillary carcinoma (T3N0M0). Mastectomy with axillary dissection revealed a 13 cm tumor with close surgical margins (<0.5 mm). The final histologic examination concluded to a pure EPC. Three months postoperatively, metastatic lesions in the sternum and liver were identified. Despite initiating letrozole and CDK4/6 inhibitor therapy, the patient succumbed to cardiac arrest. Conclusion The case of a 102-year-old female with EPC of the breast illustrates several unique and clinically significant features, including the rarity of metastasis, exceptional tumor size, and implications of advanced age on the disease course and management. This case study in accordance with the CARE guidelines.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Schwann cells (SCs) are required for supporting axons, forming myelin, and facilitating repair through remyelination after injury in the peripheral nervous system (PNS). Processes of differentiation, myelination, and remyelination of SCs are tightly modulated by a complex network of transcription factors and coregulators, including Sox10, Oct6/Pou3f1, Krox20/Egr2, Nab1/2, YY1, COUP-TFII/NR2F2, YAP/TAZ-TEAD1, c-Jun, Sox2, Zeb2, and Etv1/Er81. These factors can regulate the expression of essential target genes such as <i>Mpz</i> and <i>Mbp</i> in SC myelination and repair. Genetic mutations or dysregulation within this network can lead to peripheral neuropathies such as Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease. However, the transcriptional regulatory network of differentiation, myelination, and remyelination of SCs has not been fully understood yet. Thus, this review briefly introduces processes of differentiation, myelination, and remyelination of SCs and explores the role and molecular mechanisms of each transcription factor and coregulator in differentiation and myelination of SCs and their remyelination following nerve injury. Clinical implications for peripheral neuropathies associated with specific gene mutations and variations of transcription factors and coregulators affecting SC biology are also discussed.</p>

                Border ownership (BOS) neurons signal which side of a border is foreground. Franken and Reynolds identify grouping in V4—fast, persistent centripetal ownership preference—which could underlie BOS signals through feedback. Grouping survives stimulus interruption and emerges de novo after saccades; thus, it may provide continuity in scene segmentation.

                Distinct subsets of T cells confer immune protection against infections. Histone modifiers integrate TCRs and other signaling pathways with transcription factors to specify each subset and its function. Herein, Cohen et al. reveal a central role for KMT2D in advancing TFH formation and antibodies while restricting cytolytic Th subsets.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93267">Daptomycin forms a stable complex with phosphatidylglycerol for selective uptake to bacterial membrane</a></h4>

              
                Daptomycin is a potent lipopeptide antibiotic used in the treatment of life-threatening Gram-positive infections, but the molecular mechanism of its interaction with bacterial membrane remains unclear. Here, we show that this interaction is divided into two stages, of which the first is a fast and reversible binding of the drug to phospholipid membrane in milliseconds, and the second is a slow and irreversible insertion into membrane in minutes, only in the presence of the bacteria-specific lipid phosphatidylglycerol, to a saturating point where the ratio of the drug to phosphatidylglycerol is 1:2. Fluorescence-based titration showed that the antibiotic simultaneously binds two molecules of phosphatidylglycerol with a nanomolar binding affinity in the presence of calcium ion. The resulting stable complex is easily formed in a test tube and readily isolated from the membrane of drug-treated bacterial cells, strongly supporting a unique drug uptake mechanism in which daptomycin forms a stable multicomponent complex with calcium and phosphatidylglycerol. Revelation of this novel uptake mechanism provides fresh insights into the mode of action of daptomycin and paves the way to new strategies to attenuate resistance to the drug.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/102911">Otoacoustic emissions but not behavioral measurements predict cochlear nerve frequency tuning in an avian vocal communication specialist</a></h4>

              
                Frequency analysis by the cochlea forms a key foundation for all subsequent auditory processing. Stimulus-frequency otoacoustic emissions (SFOAEs) are a potentially powerful alternative to traditional behavioral experiments for estimating cochlear tuning without invasive testing, as is necessary in humans. Which methods accurately predict cochlear tuning remains controversial due to only a single animal study comparing SFOAE-based, behavioral, and cochlear frequency tuning in the same species. The budgerigar (<i>Melopsittacus undulatus</i>) is a parakeet species with human-like behavioral sensitivity to many sounds and the capacity to mimic speech. Intriguingly, previous studies of critical bands, psychophysical tuning curves, and critical ratios in budgerigars show that behavioral tuning sharpness increases dramatically with increasing frequency from 1 to 3.5 kHz, doubling once per octave with peak tuning sharpness from 3.5 to 4 kHz. The pattern contrasts with slower monotonic growth of behavioral tuning sharpness with increasing frequency in other animals, including most avian species, suggesting a possible auditory specialization in budgerigars. We measured SFOAE-based and cochlear-afferent tuning in budgerigars, for comparison to previously reported behavioral results. SFOAE-based and cochlear-afferent tuning sharpness both increased monotonically and relatively slowly for higher frequencies, in contrast to the behavioral pattern. SFOAE-based tuning in budgerigars accurately predicted cochlear frequency tuning, and both measures aligned with typical patterns of cochlear tuning in other species. Divergent behavioral tuning in budgerigars is unlikely attributable to the periphery and could reflect specializations for central processing of masked signals. Our findings highlight the value of SFOAEs for estimating cochlear tuning and caution against direct inference of peripheral tuning from behavioral critical bands, psychophysical tuning curves, and critical ratios.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101579">Image-based identification and isolation of micronucleated cells to dissect cellular consequences</a></h4>

              
                Recent advances in isolating cells based on visual phenotypes have transformed our ability to identify the mechanisms and consequences of complex traits. Micronucleus (MN) formation is a frequent outcome of genome instability, triggers extensive changes in genome structure and signaling coincident with MN rupture, and is almost exclusively defined by visual analysis. Automated MN detection in microscopy images has proved challenging, limiting discovery of the mechanisms and consequences of MN. In this study we describe two new MN segmentation modules: a rapid model for classifying micronucleated cells and their rupture status (VCS MN), and a robust model for accurate MN segmentation (MNFinder) from a broad range of cell lines. As proof-of-concept, we define the transcriptome of non-transformed human cells with intact or ruptured MN after chromosome missegregation by combining VCS MN with photoactivation-based cell isolation and RNASeq. Surprisingly, we find that neither MN formation nor rupture triggers a strong unique transcriptional response. Instead, transcriptional changes appear correlated with small increases in aneuploidy in these cell classes. Our MN segmentation modules overcome a significant challenge with reproducible MN quantification, and, joined with visual cell sorting, enable the application of powerful functional genomics assays to a wide-range of questions in MN biology.

                Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), an aggressive malignancy with limited tools to predict recurrence and drug sensitivity, exhibits ferroptotic heterogeneity across subtypes. However, the tumor microenvironment (TME) mediated by ferroptosis-related genes remains poorly characterized. This study integrates single-cell and bulk RNA sequencing data from the Gene Expression Omnibus to elucidate ferroptosis-driven TME features in TNBC, employing machine learning to develop prognostic and therapeutic response prediction models. At the single-cell level, T cells were classified into three subpopulations and macrophages into two subpopulations, with their infiltration degrees significantly correlated with clinical outcomes. A risk score model constructed based on these findings demonstrated robust predictive performance, validated in external cohorts with 3-, 4-, and 5-year area under the receiver operating characteristic curves of 0.65, 0.67, and 0.71, respectively. Notably, high-risk patients exhibited enhanced sensitivity to 27 therapeutic agents. By delineating ferroptosis-associated immune heterogeneity, this work provides a risk stratification tool to enhance prognostic precision and therapeutic decision-making in TNBC, while identifying genes offer actionable targets for TNBC precision medicine.

                The imprinted gene <i>ZDBF2</i> is regulated through a unique mechanism involving a transient paternal transcript in early embryos, rather than persistent gametic DNA methylation. In humans and mice, this transcript—<i>CMKLR2-AS</i> (also known as <i>GPR1-AS</i>) or the long isoform of <i>Zdbf2</i> (<i>Liz/Zdbf2linc/Platr12</i>)—arises from the unmethylated paternal allele and initiates secondary epigenetic marks that maintain <i>ZDBF2</i> expression. Here, we investigate the evolutionary origin of this mechanism, and show that the first exon of human <i>GPR1-AS</i> overlaps with a MER21C long terminal repeat (LTR), a retrotransposon subfamily specific to Boreoeutherian mammals. Comparative analyses revealed that this MER21C insertion occurred in the common ancestor of Euarchontoglires, including primates, rodents, and rabbits. Although not annotated, the first exon of mouse <i>Liz</i> displays conserved features with the MER21C-overlapping exon in humans. In rabbit and nonhuman primate placentas, <i>GPR1-AS</i> orthologs with LTR-embedded first exons were also identified. In contrast, in non-Euarchontoglire mammals such as cow and tammar wallaby, <i>ZDBF2</i> is biallelically expressed, suggesting absence of imprinting. These findings suggest that <i>ZDBF2</i> imprinting emerged in Euarchontoglires via MER21C insertion. Together with our prior work on LTR-driven imprinting in oocytes, our findings demonstrate that post-fertilization activation of retrotransposons can also drive lineage-specific acquisition of imprinting.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97846">Chemogenetic stimulation of phrenic motor output and diaphragm activity</a></h4>

              
                Impaired respiratory motor output contributes to morbidity and mortality in many neurodegenerative diseases and neurologic injuries. We investigated if expressing designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs) in the mid-cervical spinal cord could effectively stimulate phrenic motor output to increase diaphragm activation. Two primary questions were addressed: (1) does effective DREADD-mediated diaphragm activation require focal expression in phrenic motoneurons (vs. non-specific mid-cervical expression), and (2) can this method produce a sustained increase in inspiratory tidal volume? Wild-type (C57Bl/6) and ChAT-Cre mice received bilateral intraspinal (C4) injections of an adeno-associated virus (AAV) encoding the hM3D(Gq) excitatory DREADD. In wild-type mice, this produced non-specific DREADD expression throughout the mid-cervical ventral horn. In ChAT-Cre mice, a Cre-dependent viral construct was used to drive neuronal DREADD expression in the C4 ventral horns, targeting phrenic motoneurons. Diaphragm electromyograms (EMG) were recorded in isoflurane-anesthetized spontaneously breathing mice at 4–9 weeks post-AAV delivery. The DREADD ligand JHU37160 (J60) caused a bilateral, sustained (&gt;1 hr) increase in inspiratory EMG bursting in both groups; the relative increase was greater in ChAT-Cre mice. Additional experiments in ChAT-Cre rats were conducted to determine if spinal DREADD activation could increase inspiratory tidal volume during spontaneous breathing, assessed using whole-body plethysmography without anesthesia. Three to four months after intraspinal (C4) injection of AAV driving Cre-dependent hM3D(Gq) expression, intravenous J60 resulted in a sustained (&gt;30 min) increase in tidal volume. Subsequently, phrenic nerve recordings performed under urethane anesthesia confirmed that J60 evoked a &gt;200% increase in inspiratory output. We conclude that targeting mid-cervical spinal DREADD expression to the phrenic motoneuron pool enables ligand-induced, sustained increases in phrenic motor output and tidal volume. Further development of this technology may enable application to clinical conditions associated with impaired diaphragm activation and hypoventilation.

                The mammalian brain is a thick and densely layered structure comprising a huge number of neurons that work together to process information and regulate brain functions. Although various optical methods have been developed to investigate deep brain dynamics, they are limited by technical constraints, invasiveness, suboptimal spatial resolution, and/or a restricted field of view. To overcome these limitations, we developed an implantable, optically optimized microprism interface with a refractive index matched to that of brain tissue and water, enabling minimally-invasive, wide-field two-photon imaging method with enhanced brightness and sub-micron resolution in deep prefrontal areas.

">Alk-Fam150b (augmentor α) expression in the paraventricular nucleus of the mouse hypothalamus at molecular resolution, and its sensitivity to acute stress</a></h4>

              
                Augmentor  (Fam150b) action on the ALK receptor (Alk) has gained significance as a hypothalamic signaling pathway with relevance to the control of food intake and energy homeostasis. In contrast, much less is known about the sensitivity of Fam150b-Alk expression and signaling upon noxious challenges. In this regard, acute stress is of particular interest because augmentor , released from afferents of the food intake circuit of the arcuate hypothalamus in the paraventricular hypothalamus (PVN), could link stress-induced changes in food consumption. Nevertheless, conflicting data exist on whether Fam150b mRNA is expressed in the PVN. Here, we combined single-cell RNA-seq and multiplexed in situ hybridization to demonstrate that both Fam150b and Alk are expressed in the PVN of adult mice, including corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH)-containing neurons. As such, a dichotomy of CRH neurons is present through their mutually exclusive expression of either Fam150b or Scgn (secretagogin). Fam150b and Alk were not co-expressed. When inducing inflammation-associated stress, Fam150b but not Alk mRNA expression increased in a mifepristone-sensitive manner, implying regulation by peripheral glucocorticoid feedback. We suggest that augmentor -ALK signaling could underpin, at least partly, stress-induced changes in feeding and the control of body weight.

">Inhibition of Cxcr4 chemokine receptor signaling improves habituation learning and increases cAMP-PKA signaling in a zebrafish model of Neurofibromatosis type 1</a></h4>

              
                Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a neurogenetic disorder caused by loss of function mutations in the gene neurofibromin 1 (NF1). NF1 encodes neurofibromin, a multifunctional tumor suppressing protein that regulates Ras, cAMP, and dopamine signaling. NF1 predisposes patients to a wide range of symptoms, including peripheral nerve tumors, brain tumors, and cognitive dysfunction. Despite considerable work using animal models to investigate the role of neurofibromin in behavior, translating research into treatment for NF1-associated cognitive dysfunction has not yet been successful. Here, we identify Cxcr4 chemokine receptor signaling as a regulator of habituation learning and modulator of cAMP-PKA signaling in nf1 mutant larval zebrafish. Combining a small-molecule drug screen and RNAseq analysis, we show that cxcr4b expression is increased in nf1 mutants and that pharmacological inhibition of Cxcr4 with AMD3100 (Plerixafor) improves habituation learning in nf1 mutants. We further demonstrate that Plerixafor treatment activates cAMP-PKA pathway signaling but has limited effects on Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK pathway signaling in the nf1 mutant brain. CXCR4 was previously identified as a potential therapeutic target for neurofibromin-deficient tumorigenesis. Our results provide evidence that Cxcr4 signaling also regulates neurofibromin-dependent cognitive function.

                A GGGGCC repeat expansion in C9orf72 is the most common genetic cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). The repeat expansion is translated into five different dipeptide repeat proteins: polyGA, polyGP, polyGR, polyAP and polyPR. To investigate the effect of polyGA, which is the most abundant dipeptide repeat protein in patient brains, we used CRISPR/Cas9 to insert 400 codon-optimized polyGA repeats immediately downstream of the mouse C9orf72 start codon. This generated (GA)400 knock-in mice driven by the endogenous mouse C9orf72 promoter, coupled with heterozygous C9orf72 reduction. (GA)400 mice develop subtle pathology including mild motor dysfunction characterized by impaired rotarod performance. Quantitative proteomics revealed polyGA expression caused protein alterations in the spinal cord, including changes in previously identified polyGA interactors. Our findings show that (GA)400 mice are a complementary in vivo model to better understand C9ALS/FTD pathology and determine the specific role of single DPRs in disease.

">Visual working memory precision is under voluntary control</a></h4>

              
                The ability to store information in visual working memory is essential to plan and successfully execute memory-guided actions in natural human behavior. Typically, visual working memory research investigates how storing affects subsequent action. In doing so, however, the importance of how the action affects prior storing remains underappreciated. Therefore, we here question how the required precision for an action to succeed, affects how relevant visual information is encoded, maintained and finally acted on. To this end, we had participant memorize 1, 2 or 4 colors for delayed continuous report. Crucially, we manipulated how (im)precise the report was allowed to still be marked correct. Behavioral results showed that for actions with higher required precision, reports became more precise, but only when one or two colors were memorized. Also, reports became slower with higher required precision, regardless of the number of colors. By leveraging pupillometry, we further showed that with higher required precision, 1) colors were encoded deeper (since pupils constricted more during presentation), and 2) more effort was exerted to maintain the colors (since pupils dilated more during retention). Moreover, we found that participants kept exerting more effort to be precise (with increasing precision requirements), even when additional effort did not result in better performance anymore. Our findings demonstrate that humans consider their intended actions when encoding and maintaining information in visual working memory. Our results highlight the essential role of action in understanding how visual information is stored during natural goal-directed behavior.

">Spine-Prints: Transposing Brain Fingerprints to the Spinal Cord</a></h4>

              
                Functional connectivity (FC) patterns in the human brain form a reproducible, individual-specific "fingerprint" that allows reliable identification of the same participant across scans acquired over different sessions. While brain fingerprinting is robust across healthy individuals and neuroimaging modalities, little is known about whether the fingerprinting principle extends beyond the brain. Here, we used multiple spinal functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) datasets acquired at different sites to examine whether a fingerprint can be revealed from FCs of the cervical region of the human spinal cord. Our results demonstrate that the functional organisation of the cervical spinal cord also exhibits individual-specific properties, suggesting the potential existence of a spine-print within the same acquisition session. This study provides the first evidence of a spinal cord connectivity fingerprint, underscoring the importance of considering a more comprehensive view of the entire central nervous system. Eventually, these spine-specific signatures could contribute to identifying individualized biomarkers of neuronal connectivity, with potential clinical applications in neurology and neurosurgery.

">Block-structured Bayesian source estimation model for magnetoencephalography signals</a></h4>

              
                The human brain consists of functionally specialized areas that process specific types of information and interact with one another. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) is a neuroimaging technique that captures brain activity at high temporal resolution. However, its spatial resolution is insufficient to accurately localize neural activation, and thus cannot capture the interactive nature of human brain activity. To resolve this issue, various MEG source estimation models have been proposed. In particular, models incorporating prior information from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), which offers superior spatial resolution, have improved source estimation accuracy. However, these models typically ignore the similarity of activity across different brain areas, and still fall short in tracking dynamic brain activity pattern at a sufficient spatial scale. In this study, we developed a block-structured model that integrates information about functional areas and the inter-areal relationships of the human brain into MEG source estimation based on a hierarchical Bayesian framework. We evaluated our model performance using simulation data with sequential activation across multiple brain areas. Results showed that our model outperformed conventional approaches in source estimation accuracy, suggesting that incorporating the functional areal information and inter-areal relationships may enhance MEG source estimation, enabling human neuroimaging at high spatio-temporal resolution.

                We demonstrate a noninvasive approach to measure transgene expression in the brain of nonhuman primates using blood tests with engineered reporters called Released Markers of Activity (RMAs). RMAs can exit the brain and enter the blood-stream via reverse-transcytosis across the blood-brain barrier. We demonstrate that these reporters can be used to repeatedly monitor expression of multiple transgenes in cortical and subcortical brain regions simultaneously over a period of two months. RMAs are also sensitive enough to detect circuit-specific Cre-dependent AAV expression. Through this study, the RMA platform provides a cost-efficient, noninvasive tool for neuroscience study of large animals, enabling sensitive, multi-plexed, and repeatable measurements of gene expression in the brain with a blood test.

We aimed to characterize stroke-related changes in muscle recruitment during reaching by separating tonic (gravity-compensating) and phasic (intersegmental dynamics-related) components of electromyographic (EMG) activity and assessing their relationship to motor impairment. Methods: We recorded surface EMG from 12 upper limb muscles during goal-directed reaching in 8 participants with unilateral ischemic stroke and 9 age-matched controls. Using principal component analysis, we extracted tonic and phasic components of muscle activity and compared their amplitude, directional tuning, and coactivation patterns across groups. Score differences between stroke and control groups were analyzed using generalized linear mixed-effects models, regression analyses, and correlation with time since stroke and previously published muscle torque-based performance indices. Results: Individuals with stroke exhibited disrupted muscle recruitment even with mild motor deficits. Proximal muscles were over-recruited in directions that normally require less muscle activation, indicating abnormal directional tuning. Phasic activation of distal muscles was significantly reduced and declined further with time post-stroke (R2 = 0.52, p = 0.002), while tonic overactivation of proximal muscles was present in all participants with stroke. Coactivation between multiple muscles was altered, with right-hemisphere stroke reducing tonic coactivation in contralateral arms and left-hemisphere stroke increasing it. Abnormal phasic coactivation between proximal and distal muscles was present and correlated with impaired limb propulsion (R2 = 0.67, p = 0.013). Tonic and phasic recruitment deficits were often correlated, suggesting shared disruption of corticospinal and reticulospinal pathways. Conclusions: Stroke causes distinct yet interacting impairments in tonic and phasic muscle recruitment that underlie individual motor deficits. These findings support the need for neuromechanically informed assessment tools that target specific motor pathways to guide individualized rehabilitation strategies.

">Lack of functional STING modulates immunity but does not protect dopaminergic neurons in the alpha-synuclein preformed fibrils Parkinson's Disease mouse model</a></h4>

              
                Microglia response is proposed to be relevant in the neurogenerative process associated with alpha-synuclein (a-syn) pathology in Parkinson's disease (PD). STING is a protein related to the immune sensing of DNA and autophagy, and it has been proposed to be involved in PD neurodegeneration. To investigate this, we injected 10 g of murine pre-formed fibrils (PFFs) of a-syn (or monomeric and PBS as controls) into the striatum of wild-type (WT) and STINGgt/gt mice, which lack functional STING. We examined motor behavior and brain pathology at 1- and 6-months post-injection. STINGgt/gt mice showed more motor changes associated with PFF injection than WT mice. STINGgt/gt mice had a differential immune response to PFF with early and sustained increased microglia numbers and earlier macrophagic CD68 response, but milder changes in the expression of immune-relevant markers such as TLR2, TLR4, IL1b, and TREM2. However, the lack of STING did not induce changes in the extent of a-syn pathology nor the p62 accumulation seen in the model. Altogether, this resulted in a faster but similar degree of nigrostriatal dopaminergic degeneration after 6 months. Therefore, the data do not support a necessary role for STING in the a-syn induced nigral neuronal loss in the PFF-PD mouse model used here. However, the results suggest a functional relevance for STING in the brain response to the excess of amylogenic proteins such as a-syn that can contribute to symptomatic changes.

">Slow-Timescale Regulation of Dopamine Release and Mating Drive over Days</a></h4>

              
                The rise and fall of motivational states may take place over timescales as long as many days. We used mouse mating behavior to model how the brain orchestrates slow-timescale changes in motivation. Male mice become sexually satiated after successful matings, and their motivation to mate gradually recovers over a week. Using deep-brain fluorescence-lifetime imaging in the medial preoptic area (MPOA), we found that tonic dopamine transmission - which regulates mating drive - also declined after mating and re-emerged over a week. Two mechanisms regulated dopamine transmission. First, successful mating transiently reduced tonic firing of hypothalamic dopamine-releasing neurons, thereby inhibiting dopamine release and mating behavior. Second, mating reduced the ability of these neurons to produce and release dopamine, and this ability gradually returned over the week-long recovery time course. Therefore, fast and slow mechanisms of neuronal plasticity cooperate to control the early and late phases of motivational dynamics, respectively.

">Shared and distinct microRNA profiles between HT22, N2A and SH-SY5Y cell lines and primary mouse hippocampal neurons</a></h4>

              
                MicroRNAs (miRNA) are small non-coding RNAs that are key negative regulators of gene expression. Their roles include shaping the gene expression landscape during and after brain development by defining and maintaining levels of proteins that generate the distinct morphological and functional properties of neurons and other brain cell types. HT22, N2A, and SH-SY5Y are common immortalized neuronal cell lines that offer simple, less expensive, and time-saving options for in vitro modelling to evaluate miRNA functions. The extent to which these lines reflect primary neurons remains, however, unclear. Here, we benchmarked the miRNA profiles of cultured mouse hippocampal neurons against Argonaute-loaded miRNAs in the adult mouse hippocampus and miRNA data from the hippocampus of patients with drug-resistant temporal lobe epilepsy. We then compared the miRNA expression landscape in HT22, N2A and SH-SY5Y against mouse hippocampal primary cell cultures. We profiled over 700 miRNAs across the lines and detected 310 miRNAs in all four cell types. This included detection of neuron-enriched miRNAs such as miR-124 and miR-128, although the cell lines typically displayed lower levels of these than in primary neurons and reference adult hippocampal tissue. The miRNA profile in the HT22 cell line showed the highest correlation to the mouse primary neuronal cultures. Together, this study provides a dataset on basal miRNA expression across commonly used cell lines for neuroscience research and evidence for both conserved and distinct profiles that should be used to inform decisions on cell lines for modelling brain and miRNA research.

">Redundancy masking and the compression of information in the brain</a></h4>

              
                The visual world is inherently complex, presenting far more information than a human visual system can process in full. To manage this overload, the visual brain employs several mechanisms. One mechanism that possibly contributes to the reduction of information is redundancy masking (RM): the reduction of the number of perceived items in repeating patterns. For example, when three identical lines are presented in the periphery, observers often perceive only two. The underlying neural mechanisms of RM remain unclear. Here, we use steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) to examine whether redundancy-masked items are neurally suppressed or integrated with neighboring items. Three identical arcs (quarter-circles; 0.44{degrees} line width) were presented in the periphery (eccentricities: 17.3{degrees}, 19.5{degrees}, and 21.7{degrees}), each tagged with a unique frequency. Participants maintained central fixation, monitored via a gaze-contingent control, and reported the number of arcs they predominantly perceived after each 10s trial. We analyzed baseline-corrected amplitudes at each tagged frequency and calculated signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) for fundamental and intermodulation (IM) components, separating trials by behavioral responses (RM: 2 items perceived, non-RM: 3 items perceived). Fundamental frequency comparisons revealed that the outer arc elicited higher SSVEP responses than the inner and middle one under RM, with no significant differences between arcs under non-RM. However, fundamental frequency SNRs did not differ between RM and non-RM perceptions. When we compared IM SNRs, the middle and outer arc's combination was significantly higher during RM compared to non-RM, suggesting increased neural integration between them. These results indicate that RM involves a loss of conscious access to visual information, yet corresponding neural signals are not entirely suppressed. Instead, the neural signatures we found suggest the integration with neighboring elements across space and time. We suggest that redundancy-masked items - although unavailable for conscious report- are still observed in the neural signatures of RM.

">Semantic Memory Traces Reflect How They Were Last Retrieved</a></h4>

              
                Episodic memories are known to change with each act of retrieval. We hypothesize that semantic memories are altered in a similar way when retrieval draws on a core dimension of conceptual knowledge: semantic granularity. Each level, from accessing a concept via unique perceptual features to its thematic context, shapes the retrieval route used to access semantic memories. This study tests whether semantic granularities used to retrieve a concept influences its reactivation during later recognition. Human participants learned and retrieved novel word-image pairs while undergoing fMRI. Following encoding, items were retrieved via one of three semantic levels: item, category, or theme. Later, participants accessed the memories in recognition and cued recall tests. Although behavioral memory performance was matched across conditions, neural activity during recognition varied based on prior retrieval history. Recognition patterns could be classified according to prior retrieval granularity in ventral temporal cortex for both remembered and non-remembered concepts, and in the hippocampus for remembered concepts only. A whole-brain searchlight analysis revealed bilateral clusters along the ventral visual stream, from early visual cortex to fusiform gyrus, where retrieval history was decodable. Representational similarity analyses showed that category-level retrieval increased pattern consistency in early visual cortex and pattern reactivation in ventral temporal cortex, while item-level retrieval enhanced memory trace distinctiveness in visual word form area. Theme-level retrieval increased activity in left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex. These findings show that how we access a concept leaves a detectable trace on subsequent neural reactivation, subtly shaping how conceptual knowledge is organized in the brain.

">Distributed learning across fast and slow neural systems supports efficient motor adaptation</a></h4>

              
                Adaptation is a fundamental aspect of motor learning. Intelligent systems must adapt to perturbations in the environment while simultaneously maintaining stable memories. Classic work has argued that this trade-off could be resolved by complementary learning systems operating at different speeds; yet the mechanisms enabling coordination between slow and fast systems remain unknown. Here, we propose a multi-region distributed learning model in which learning is shared between two populations of neurons with distinct roles and structures: a recurrent 'controller' network which stores a slowly evolving memory, and a feedforward 'adapter' network that rapidly learns to respond to perturbations in the environment. In our model, supervised learning in the adapter produces a predictive error signal that simultaneously tutors consolidation in the controller through a local plasticity rule. Our model offers insight into the mechanisms that may support distributed computations in the motor cortex and cerebellum during motor adaptation.

">D1/D5 Receptor Activation Promotes Long-Term Potentiation and Synaptic Tagging/Capture in Hippocampal Area CA2</a></h4>

              
                Hippocampal area CA2 plays an important role in social memory formation. However, CA2 is characterised by plasticity-resistant Schaffer collateral-CA2 (SC-CA2) synapses and highly plastic entorhinal cortex-CA2 (EC-CA2) synapses. Despite abundant dopaminergic input, the relationship between dopamine signalling and area CA2 synaptic plasticity remains unexplored. Here, we show that SKF-38393-mediated Dopamine D1-like receptor (dopamine D1 and D5 receptors) activation differentially primes CA2 inputs in an NMDAR and protein synthesis-dependent manner. We defined an inverted-U shape relationship between SKF-38393 concentration and EC-CA2 potentiation. Additionally, we observed a priming effect on SC-CA2 plasticity with 50M SKF-38393, relieving plasticity resistance. We also demonstrated that this effect follows canonical protein kinase A (PKA) signalling. Collectively, our results show that D1R activation primes the CA2 for synaptic plasticity. Thus, we propose a link between neuropsychiatric diseases related to impaired dopamine transmission and deficits in hippocampus-dependent social memory.

">Nucleus accumbens neuron subtype translatome signatures in socially stress females</a></h4>

              
                Background: The nucleus accumbens (NAc) is a reward circuitry hub associated with major depressive disorder (MDD) and chronic stress in rodents. While transcriptional adaptations in NAc medium spiny neuron (MSN) subtypes, those enriched in dopamine receptor 1(D1) or dopamine receptor 2 (D2) and adenosine 2a receptor (A2A) are well characterized in socially stressed male rodents, there is less knowledge of MSN subtype adaptations in socially stressed females. Methods: Chronic witness defeat stress (CWDS) was performed in female D1-Cre-RiboTag and A2A-Cre-RiboTag mice. After stress, mice were separated into high- and low-social interactors with a three Chamber Social Interaction test. Following isolation of ribosome-associated mRNA, MSN subtype-specific gene expression profiles were determined with RNA sequencing followed by differential gene expression analysis (DEG) and weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). Consensus WGCNA with male mouse social defeat stress and clinically relevant human transcriptomic datasets was performed to examine the translational sex-specific molecular signatures. Results: 9 DEGs in D1-MSNs and 630 in A2A-MSNs were identified in female stress groups (FDR < 0.05). D1-MSN DEGs were mostly upregulated in CWDS low vs high interactors and were enriched for functions related to energy homeostasis and cell adhesion. A2A-MSN DEGs upregulated in low interactors involved structural molecules while downregulated genes involved neurotransmission. WGCNA identified 9 significant D1- and 5 significant A2A-MSN modules related to cell structure, protein synthesis, synapse and mitochondria. The most impacted modules from each subtype (based on DEG count) were enriched for PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling pathway and regulated by the Nf1 transcription factor. Consensus module analysis identified a module significantly associated with social stress in a sex- and subtype-specific manner in both mice and humans enriched for genes involved in the PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling pathway. Conclusion: Chronic social stress-induced sex-specific molecular signatures were uncovered in female subjects. Consensus modules across stress and clinical populations implicate alterations in MSN subtypes could contribute to MDD signatures among female populations.

">Uncovering the invisible giant: Amyloid β plaques and their proposed association with waste removal in Alzheimer-affected human hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                According to the prevalent 'Amyloid Hypothesis,' the underlying cause for neurodegeneration in Alzheimer Disease (AD) is attributed to the accumulation of misfolded Amyloid {beta} and tau protein in the form of extracellular sticky plaques and neurofibrillary tangles respectively. These protein accumulations are thought to be caused by impaired waste removal. In an alternative hypothesis, we have proposed the existence of an extensive glial canal system that is likely formed by myelinated aquaporin-4 (AQP4)-expressing tanycytes and removes cellular waste from the hippocampal formation. Here, we demonstrate that tanycyte-derived waste-internalizing receptacles are immunoreactive for A{beta} and emanate from specialized nucleus-like organelles in the following referred to as 'tanysomes.' Utilizing RNA-scope in situ hybridization, we demonstrate that these receptacle-forming tanysomes express RNA for AQP4 and the A{beta}-related genes, amyloid precursor protein, and presenilin 1. These findings suggest that A{beta} is likely synthesized where receptacle formation is observed and that A{beta} may play an important structural role in receptacle formation. In AD-affected hippocampus excessive amounts of A{beta}-immunoreactive waste receptacles emerge from tanysomes and have the appearance of plaques in A{beta}-immunolabeled hippocampus. Moreover, we demonstrate that the same receptacle-forming organelles exhibit strong immunolabeling for hyperphosphorylated tau protein in AD-affected tissue. We postulate that both proteins may play important structural roles in waste uptake and that hypertrophic swelling of impaired tanycytes in AD-affected brain may be due to obstructions of this extensive interconnected glial canal system.

">Peripheral anatomy and central connectivity of proprioceptive sensory neurons in the Drosophila wing</a></h4>

              
                Recent advances in electron microscopy (EM) and automated image segmentation have produced synaptic wiring diagrams of the Drosophila central nervous system. A limitation of existing fly connectome datasets is that most sensory neurons are excised during sample preparation, creating a gap between the central and peripheral nervous systems. Here, we bridge this gap by reconstructing wing sensory axons from the Female Adult Nerve Cord (FANC) EM dataset and mapping them to peripheral sensory structures using genetic tools and light microscopy. We confirm the location and identity of known wing mechanosensory neurons and identify previously uncharacterized axons, including a novel population of putative proprioceptors that make monosynaptic connections onto wing steering motor neurons. We also find that proprioceptors of adjacent campaniform sensilla on the wing have distinct axon morphologies and postsynaptic partners, suggesting a high degree of specialization in axon pathfinding and synaptic partner matching. The peripheral location and central projections of wing sensory neurons are stereotyped across flies, allowing this wing proprioceptor atlas and genetic toolkit to guide analysis of other fly connectome datasets.

">Atypical antipsychotics alter microglial functions via astrocyte-derived extracellular vesicles</a></h4>

              
                A limited understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms of atypical antipsychotics has hindered efforts to develop the next generation of treatments for schizophrenia. In particular, there has been little investigation of how medications like clozapine and olanzapine modulate human non-neuronal cells, including astrocytes and microglia. Recent postmortem and serum-based studies suggest that schizophrenia etiology involves dysregulated cellular communication through extracellular vesicles (EVs). Astrocytes are a major source of these EVs and are strongly implicated in the etiology of schizophrenia by convergent data from human postmortem, brain imaging, RNA-sequencing, and genome-wide association studies. We hypothesized that clozapine and olanzapine can affect microglia biology indirectly via astrocytic secretion of EVs. We used in vitro cellular models with primary human astrocytes and PBMC-derived microglial-like cells to investigate the downstream impact of isolated astrocyte-derived EVs (ADEVs) on microglial phenotypes relevant to schizophrenia, including microglial phagocytosis, motility, and morphology. To model microglia-mediated synaptic pruning in vitro, we utilized image-based quantification of microglia engulfment of isolated human synaptosomes. We found that treatment with ADEVs reduced microglial synaptosome phagocytosis in a dose-dependent manner. This reduction was reversed upon addition of ADEVs isolated from astrocytes treated with norclozapine or olanzapine. ADEVs isolated from clozapine-treated astrocytes increased microglial motility, indicating that clozapine alters microglial surveillance activity without affecting phagocytosis through these ADEVs. Together, these results suggest that atypical antipsychotics have distinct and indirect impact on microglia biology mediated by ADEVs. These results highlight a potentially critical role for ADEVs in regulating glial cell communication and suggest they may be promising therapeutic targets for next-generation antipsychotic development.

">Peptides alleviate cognitive impairment by inhibiting and disassembling amyloid-beta aggregates in Alzheimer disease</a></h4>

              
                Alzheimer disease (AD) is a devasting neurodegenerative disorder characterized by beta-amyloid formation, further exacerbated by RIPK1/RIPK3 necrosome-induced programmed necrosis (necroptosis). We previously showed that the RIPK1/RIPK3 necrosome forms a functional amyloid complex using its RIP homotypic interaction motifs (RHIMs). Here, we discovered that the core RIPK1/RIPK3 necrosome shares strikingly structural similarity to the C-terminal region of beta-amyloid (Ab-42), and the RHIM-derived tetrapeptides (IQIG or VQVG) directly inhibit Ab aggregation, disassemble preformed Ab fibrils (PFFs), and reduce RIPK1 polymerization. Also, the peptides exhibit effective membrane permeability and could reduce Ab-40 or Ab-42-induced neural death and TNFa-induced necroptosis in SH-SY5Y cells. IQIG and VQVG injected by ICV increase learning and memory abilities by reducing Ab plaques and hyperphosphorylated tau in the cortex and hippocampus of APP/PS1 double-transgenic mice. Mechanistically, the peptides directly interact with A{beta} to block Ab aggregation and alleviate microglia-mediated neuroinflammation. Strikingly, single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that the peptides-treated AD transgenic mice restored neuronal homeostasis with increased GABAergic neurons and decreased glutamatergic neurons. Furthermore, total cell-cell interaction strength increased while the AD risk gene Apoe expression decreased in the specific oligodendrocyte subtype of peptides-treated AD mice. Thus, our findings revealed that the peptides could improve cognition and memory capabilities and serve as promising structural templates for potential drugs against AD.

<p>In this study, we found that astrocyte-specific HSP60 knockout in male mice led to mitochondrial dysfunction and cellular senescence, disrupting neurotransmitter receptor expression and synaptic proteins, impairing neuroregeneration.

<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Heat Shock Protein 60 (HSP60) plays a critical role in maintaining mitochondrial function in astrocytes and has a significant impact on central nervous system (CNS) health. However, how HSP60 regulates the mitochondrial function of astrocytes to inhibit neuroregeneration remains unknown. In this study, we generated astrocyte-specific HSP60 knockout male mice to investigate the consequences of HSP60 deficiency. Firstly, our results confirmed that HSP60 deficiency caused abnormal expression of mitochondrial function-related genes, causing significant mitochondrial dysfunction, which triggered cellular senescence in astrocytes. Moreover, the alterations of 5-hydroxytryptamine 2A receptor (5-HT2AR), glucocorticoid receptor (GR), dopamine D2 receptor (D2R), and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor subunit 2A (NR2A) expression suggested a disruption in neurotransmission and synaptic plasticity. Additionally, the increased levels of site-1 protease (S1P), truncated brain-derived neurotrophic factor (truncated-BDNF), and synaptophysin indicate synaptic structural and functional impairments. Expectedly, our findings demonstrated mitochondrial dysfunction and cellular senescence in astrocytes, leading to altered expression of neurotransmitter receptors in the cortex, as well as reduced neuronal numbers and neurotransmitter levels in the hippocampus after the deletion of HSP60 in astrocytes of the male mice. Notably, Urolithin A (UA) and the S1P inhibitor, PF429242, were found to alleviate astrocyte senescence and promote neuronal regeneration by inhibiting truncated BDNF expression. In conclusion, our study revealed that HSP60 deficiency in astrocytes induces mitochondrial dysfunction and cellular senescence via the S1P/truncated-BDNF pathway, resulting in disrupted neurotransmitter receptor expression, synaptic protein alterations, and impaired neuroregeneration. These insights underscored the importance of HSP60 in CNS health and provided promising avenues for developing treatments for neurodegenerative disorders.</p>

                Immune pathways and cell types that protect against neurodegenerative processes with aging remain poorly understood. Sulka et al. demonstrate that the innate immune adaptor, STING, provides essential protection against blood-brain barrier breaches and neuromotor deficits during physiological aging. Furthermore, microglial STING is sufficient to protect against these aspects of age-associated decline.

                Background Flooding is one of the most frequent and damaging disasters in Malaysia with major social, economic, and psychological consequences. Compared to material and logistical preparedness, the psychological aspects of disaster management are not given much emphasis. Methods This conceptual paper employs a systematic literature review to understand the factors that predict Malaysians psychological preparedness for floods. The literature search was conducted using databases such as PubMed, Academic Search Ultimate, Directory of Open Access Journals, Supplemental Index and Google Scholar with keywords including “disaster preparedness, flood, natural disaster and psychological preparedness”. Articles were included if they focused on preparedness towards disasters as well as examined coping mechanisms, perceptions and preparedness behaviours in the context of flood-related crises and excluded if they lack methodological rigor. The review synthesized findings using a thematic analysis approach, identifying psychological resilience and coping strategies in flood-affected populations, the role of social support networks in preparedness and recovery as well as mental health implications of floods, including anxiety, trauma, and post-disaster recovery. This synthesis informed the development of a conceptual model to address factors that predict Malaysians psychological preparedness for floods. According to contemporary theories of catastrophe risk reduction and psychological resilience, critical variables included are risk perception, outcome expectancy, self-efficacy, anxiety, and social support. Results It was proposed that these factors work together to determine an individual’s psychological preparedness, enhancing their ability to cope with the psychological and emotional strain of a flood disaster. Conclusions By offering these perspectives, the study contributes to the limited academic discussion on psychological preparedness in Malaysia, which aims to improve the psychological resilience of communities vulnerable to flooding. The proposed framework emphasizes the importance of incorporating psychological preparedness into existing disaster management strategies to reduce the overall damage caused by floods.

                Alternative splicing is crucial in gene regulation, with significant implications in clinical settings and biotechnology. This review article compiles bioinformatics short-read RNA-seq tools for investigating differential splicing; offering a detailed examination of their statistical methods, case applications, and benefits. A total of 22 tools are categorised by their statistical family (parametric, non-parametric, and probabilistic) and level of analysis (transcript, exon, and event). The central challenges in quantifying alternative splicing include correct splice site identification and accurate isoform deconvolution of transcripts. Benchmarking studies show no consensus on tool performance, revealing considerable variability across different scenarios. Tools with high citation frequency and continued developer maintenance, such as DEXSeq and rMATS, are recommended for prospective researchers. To aid in tool selection, a guide schematic is proposed based on variations in data input and the required level of analysis. Emerging long-read RNA sequencing technologies are discussed as a complement to short-read methods, promising reduced deconvolution needs and further innovation.

                Background Human males and females show differences in the incidence of neutrophil-associated diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, and multiple sclerosis, and differences in neutrophil physiological responses such as responses to infection, tissue damage, and chemotactic factors. However, little is known about the basis of sex-based differences in human neutrophils. Methods Starting with human neutrophils from healthy donors, we used RNA-seq to examine total RNA profiles, RNAs not associated with ribosomes and thus not being translated, RNAs in monosomes, and RNAs in polysomes and thus heavily translated. Results There were sex-based differences in the levels of RNAs across free RNA, monosome, and polysome fractions. Male neutrophils had increased levels of mRNAs encoding mitochondrial proteins in the free RNA fractions, indicating low levels of translation. The polysomes of male neutrophils were enriched for mRNAs encoding cytoskeletal organization, cell motility, and cell activation. The polysomes of female neutrophils were enriched for mRNAs associated the regulation of metabolic processes, cytokine responses, and mitochondrial proteins. Conclusions These data indicate that male and female neutrophils have different expression patterns and different translation efficiency of some mRNAs. This may contribute to the observed sex-based differences in neutrophil behavior and neutrophil-associated disease incidence and severity.

                <p>Lactate plays an important role in brain energy metabolism. It contributes to normal brain development and to neuroprotection in diabetic hypoglycemia, but its role in neonatal hypoglycemia is unclear. Moreover, lactate can work as a signaling substance via the lactate receptor HCAR1 (Hydroxycarboxylic acid receptor 1). Recent studies indicate that HCAR1 is protective in mouse models of neonatal hypoxic ischemia and has a role in metabolic regulation in glial cells during hypoglycemia. Here we have studied potential impacts of HCAR1 on axonal and myelin development in the cerebral cortex and corpus callosum of young (P21) wild-type (WT) mice and HCAR1 KO mice and in cortical organotypic brain slice cultures. The HCAR1 KO mice showed lower axonal area relative to WT in both cortex and corpus callosum. However, the myelin area was unaffected by HCAR1 KO. Using particle and colocalization analysis, we show that HCAR1 KO predominantly reduces axonal size in unmyelinated axons. Using an organotypic brain slice model of neonatal hypoglycemia, we find that lactate protects both axonal and myelin development in hypoglycemia, partially via HCAR1. Lastly, live imaging with a pH-sensitive dye on acute cortical brain slices indicates that cellular lactate uptake is influenced by HCAR1. In conclusion, our findings support a role of HCAR1 in axonal development and in lactate&rsquo;s protective effects in hypoglycemia.</p>

                <p>by Inmaculada Villanueva-Baxarias, Anna Pellisé-Tintoré, María Pérez-Rodríguez, Laura Nogué, Pooja Vaziraani, Iris Soveral, Fàtima Crispi, Olga Gómez, Patricia Garcia-Canadilla, Oscar Camara, Bart Bijnens, Gabriel Bernardino</p>

Coarctation of the aorta (CoA) is a common congenital heart defect characterized by aortic narrowing. Prenatally, it has mild hemodynamic effects as right ventricular disproportion and ductus arteriosus (DA) dilation occur as adaptive mechanisms, but their impact on CoA hemodynamics remains poorly understood. To investigate this, we built a closed 0D computational model of fetal circulation and simulated different CoA cardiovascular remodeling patterns, including aortic isthmus (AoI) narrowing, ventricular disproportion, and DA dilation. Our results showed mild AoI narrowing (80% of reference diameter) required up to 1.7 right/left ventricular end-diastolic volume ratio and 115% DA dilation to maintain physiological pressures, wall shear stresses, and organ perfusion. In contrast, severe narrowing (20% of reference AoI diameter) required up to 5 right/left ventricular end-diastolic volume ratio and 125% DA dilation, highlighting the necessity of co-occurrence of prenatal ventricular disproportion and DA dilation to compensate for AoI narrowing. These physiological regions were validated with ultrasonographic measurements from 7 controls and 9 CoA patients. We compared blood pressures, velocities, and volumetric flow rates across different fetoplacental anatomical sites. AoI velocity showed a delayed retrograde flow peak and increased antegrade diastolic velocity with greater AoI narrowing, which may aid in diagnosing CoA. Minimal differences were observed in other velocities and pressures. Volumetric flow rates across varying degrees of AoI narrowing decreased in the AoI and mitral and aortic valves, remained stable in the middle cerebral and umbilical arteries, and increased in the DA and tricuspid and pulmonary valves. Therefore, we corroborated that in fetal CoA a redistribution of blood flow occurs to ensure perfusion of the brain and placenta, without a significant alteration in fetal hemodynamics (blood pressure and velocities) except for increased diastolic velocities in the AoI.

                <p>by Katharina Waury, Stefan Lelieveld, Sanne Abeln, Henk-Jan van den Ham</p>

Repertoire sequencing allows us to investigate the antibody-mediated immune response. The clustering of sequences is a crucial step in the data analysis pipeline, aiding in the identification of functionally related antibodies. The conventional clustering approach of clonotyping relies on sequence information, particularly CDRH3 sequence identity and V/J gene usage, to group sequences into clonotypes. It has been suggested that the limitations of sequence-based approaches to identify sequence-dissimilar but functionally converged antibodies can be overcome by using structure information to group antibodies. Recent advances have made structure-based methods feasible on a repertoire level. However, so far, their performance has only been evaluated on single-antigen sets of antibodies. A comprehensive comparison of the benefits and limitations of structure-based tools on realistic and diverse repertoire data is missing. Here, we aim to explore the promise of structure-based clustering algorithms to replace or augment the standard sequence-based approach, specifically by identifying low-sequence identity groups. Two methods, SAAB+ and SPACE2, are evaluated against clonotyping. We curated a dataset of well-annotated pairs of antibodies that show high overlap in epitope residues and thus bind the same region within their respective antigen. This set of antibodies was introduced into a simulated repertoire to compare the performance of clustering approaches on a diverse antibody set. Our analysis reveals that structure-based methods do group more antibodies together compared to clonotyping. However, it also highlights the limitations associated with the need for same-length CDR regions by SPACE2. This work thoroughly compares the utility of different clustering methods and provides insights into what further steps are required to effectively use antibody structural information to group immune repertoire data.

Bacteria encode a wide range of antiphage systems and a subset of these proteins are homologous to components of the human innate immune system. Mammalian nucleotide-binding and leucine-rich repeat containing proteins (NLRs) and bacterial NLR-related proteins use a central NACHT domain to link detection of infection with initiation of an antimicrobial response. Bacterial NACHT proteins provide defense against both DNA and RNA phages. Here we investigate the mechanism of phage detection by the bacterial NLR-related protein bNACHT25 in <i>E. coli</i>. bNACHT25 was specifically activated by <i>Emesvirus</i> ssRNA phages and analysis of MS2 phage escaper mutants that evaded detection revealed a critical role for Coat Protein (CP). A genetic assay showed CP was sufficient to activate bNACHT25 but the two proteins did not directly interact. Instead, we found bNACHT25 requires the host chaperone DnaJ to detect CP and protect against phage. Our data support a model in which bNACHT25 detects a wide range of phages using an indirect mechanism that may involve guarding a host cell process rather than binding a specific phage-derived molecule.

                <p>by Gagandeep S. Saggu, Jinfeng Shao, Mansoor A. Siddiqui, Maria Traver, Tatiane Macedo-Silva, Joseph Brzostowski, Sanjay A. Desai</p>

Malaria parasites survive in human erythrocytes by importing and digesting hemoglobin within a specialized organelle, the digestive vacuole (DV). Although chloroquine and other antimalarials act within the DV, the routes used by drugs, ions, and amino acids to cross the DV membrane remain poorly understood. Here, we used single DV patch-clamp to identify a novel large conductance anion channel as the primary conductive pathway on this organelle in <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i>, the most virulent human pathogen. This Big Vacuolar Anion Channel (BVAC) is primarily open at the DV resting membrane potential and undergoes complex voltage-dependent gating. Ion substitution experiments implicate promiscuous anion flux with Cl<sup>−</sup> being the primary charged substrate under physiological conditions. Conductance and gating are unaffected by antimalarials targeting essential DV activities and are conserved on parasites with divergent drug susceptibility profiles, implicating an unexploited antimalarial target. A conditional knockdown strategy excluded links to PfCRT and PfMDR1, two drug-resistance transporters with poorly defined transport activities. We propose that BVAC functions to maintain electroneutrality during H<sup>+</sup> uptake, allowing DV acidification and efficient hemoglobin digestion. The channel also facilitates amino acid salvage, providing essential building blocks for parasite growth. Direct transport measurements at the DV membrane provide foundational insights into vacuolar physiology, should help clarify antimalarial action and drug resistance, and will guide therapy development against the parasite’s metabolic powerhouse.

                Background The management of organic waste generated in municipal marketplaces has gained increasing prominence over the last two decades due to its critical impact on urban sustainability, public health, and the environment. This study provides a comprehensive bibliometric analysis of research trends in this area, based on 260 publications indexed in Scopus between 2000 and 2023. Methods This study employed a comprehensive bibliometric method using both quantitative and network analysis approaches. Publications were retrieved from Scopus database using a structured search equation incorporating keywords related to organic waste, municipal marketplaces, and waste management strategies. The final dataset included 260 publications spanning from 2000 to 2023, including original research articles, systematic reviews, book chapters, and conference proceedings. Data were processed using Bibliometrix R-package for productivity metrics (annual scientific output, author productivity, journal impact) and VOSviewer for visualization of bibliographic networks. Co-authorship patterns were analyzed at both author and country levels to find collaboration structures. Keyword co-occurrence analysis was conducted to map thematic clusters and research trends. Additionally, a strategic diagram was constructed to categorize research themes based on relevance to the field and degree of development. Results The findings show a notable surge in publications since 2016, driven by circular economic policies, climate change mitigation efforts, and the demand for sustainable urban solutions. Key authors include Zurbrügg, Tilley, Mpanang’ombe, and Zhang, with significant contributions to composting technologies, waste valorization, and bioenergy solutions. Leading journals such as Journal of Cleaner Production (Q1, IF 2023: 9.7), Sustainability (Switzerland) (Q2, IF 2023: 3.3), and Biocycle (Q4, IF 2023: 0.02) have been pivotal in disseminating interdisciplinary research. Conclusions This analysis reveals a global collaborative effort to optimize organic waste management but identifies persistent challenges, including limited integration in developing regions and fragmented co-authorship networks. The study highlights the need for interdisciplinary approaches and fair knowledge transfer to develop scalable, context-specific solutions that enhance urban sustainability.

[version 3; peer review: 2 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background Academic stress is a significant factor affecting students’ psychological well-being, particularly in higher education. Understanding the mediating roles of social support and self-efficacy can provide insights into how these factors influence students’ psychological well-being in public and private universities. Methods The study examined the mediating roles of social support and self-efficacy in the relationship between academic stress and psychological well-being among university students in Mogadishu, Somalia. Utilizing a stratified sampling technique, data were collected from 663 students across public (52.6%) and private (47.4%) universities through a structured questionnaire and analyzed using path analysis to assess direct and indirect effects. Structural equation modeling technique was used for data analysis. Results The analysis revealed a significant direct effect of academic stress on psychological well-being (β = 0.087, p = 0.001). Social support was significantly related to Academic stress (β = 0.117, p = 0.031) and self-efficacy (β =0.088, p = 0.021). However, both social support (β = 0.099, p = 0.000) and self-efficacy (β = 0.646, p = 0.000) were significantly related to psychological well-being. The mediating analysis showed that social support partially mediated the relationship between academic stress and psychological well-being (Indirect effect = 0.012, CI [0.002, 0.024], p = 0.000), while self-efficacy did not mediate this relationship (Indirect effect = 0.057, CI [0.006, 0.111], p = 0.068). Conclusions The findings suggest a significant positive impact of academic stress on psychological well-being, while social support partially mediates this relationship, highlighting its buffering role. Conversely, self-efficacy, although positively contributing to psychological well-being, does not mediate the effect of academic stress. These results underscore the importance of robust social support systems and targeted interventions to enhance students’ coping mechanisms and overall psychological well-being. Study limitations and implication are discussed.

                Purpose Malaria remains a public health problem in Niger, especially among children under the age of five. To combat this scourge, since 2012, the World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended seasonal malaria chemoprevention (SMC), a strategy based on the administration of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine and amodiaquine (SP-AQ) during the period of high transmission. This systematic review assesses the coverage, efficacy, and challenges of SMC in Niger between 2013 and 2022, analyzing its impact on malaria morbidity and mortality. Materials and methods The PRISMA guidelines were used to ensure a rigorous and comprehensive recording of the systematic review process. Through searches in five different databases, articles were imported into Zotero software, then transferred to the Covidence application, where data processing was carried out. The selected articles were independently evaluated by two reviewers. These included studies that assessed coverage, malaria incidence, and the impact of SMC. Studies published in French and English were included. Data extraction from the included studies was performed, and a quality assessment was conducted, including an evaluation of the risk of bias. Results Among the six studies, three assessed SMC coverage in all eight regions of Niger while also evaluating side effects. They showed high overall coverage but low coverage in some areas. Another study examined the impact in terms of the incidence of complicated malaria, malaria-related hospitalization, and mortality. Another publication revealed that antibody responses against the blood and pre-erythrocytic stages of P. falciparum were higher in the area where SMC was implemented. Conclusions This study demonstrates that SMC has a significant impact on reducing malaria incidence. Although there is high overall coverage, variations exist, particularly in hard-to-reach areas. Few adverse events were reported. However, very few studies are available, highlighting the need for additional research in Niger to better understand this strategy.

                Background The significance of household transmission of hepatitis B virus infection has been identified in different studies. Higher disease related knowledge among Hepatitis B patients improves the practice of transmission prevention and screening of household contacts. This study aims to assess the knowledge and practice of household transmission prevention among people with chronic hepatitis B attending a liver clinic at Tikur Anbessa Specialized Hospital (TASH), Ethiopia. Methods A single center cross-sectional study among 229 hepatitis B patients visiting liver clinic for follow up service was undertaken in 2021. Data were collected using a structured interviewer guided questionnaires and analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistical methods in SPSS 26. Results Mean age of respondents was 40 years, 68% were male, 65% of respondents scored ≥75 (defined as a high knowledge). In adjusted linear regression, age <40 years, presence of additional infected household members and disease duration >3 years were associated with higher knowledge score (R2= 0.106, F=8.936, P<0.001). Only 38.6% of participants scoring ≥6 (defined as good prevention practice). In Adjusted logistic regression, factors associated with poor practice were; low level of education (OR: 5.218; 95%CI: 1.34-20.23; p=0.017), being on anti HBV treatment (OR: 3.582; 95%CI: 1.04-12.33; p=0.043) and duration of follow up at TASH <2 years (OR: 2.93; 95%CI: 1.14-7.55; p=0.025). Conclusion In contrast to overall good knowledge, largely poor implementation of prevention practices and misunderstandings about transmission through air, kissing, and eating utensils were seen in a significant proportion of participants. Based on the results, any educational programs planned for this population should give special attention to the implementation of recommended prevention practices than simple awareness creation, with priority given to those with low education, <2 years on follow-up, and those on anti-hepatitis B treatment.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>In sleep apnea, repeated hypovolemic ventilation or apnea in sleep leads to intermittent hypoxia (IH) of the brain. Thus, the impacts of sleep apnea on the brain need to be investigated. In this study, a mouse model with sleep-associated chronic IH and behavior tests was used to evaluate how IH impacts brain function and the expression of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-containing neurons in the substantia nigra, ventral tegmental area (VTA), and locus coeruleus. In an open-field test, mice subjected to chronic IH (5%–21% oxygen) for 10 and 20 days exhibited a significant decrease in spontaneous locomotor activity compared to the room air (RA, 21% oxygen) control mice. In the Y-maze test, the ability to recognize novel and familiar arms was similar between groups. In immunostaining of the brains of IH mice, TH-positive neurons in the substantia nigra, VTA, and locus coeruleus were significantly reduced compared to RA mice. Furthermore, in the brains of mice with decreased TH-positive neurons induced by IH, the expression of hippocampal neurons has not been affected. In the analysis of glial cells, in IH group mice, a significant increase of microglia was found in the substantia nigra, VTA, locus coeruleus, and hippocampus compared to the RA mice. These findings suggest that there is a loss of TH-containing neurons and neuronal inflammation in the substantia nigra, VTA, and locus coeruleus under chronic IH. Our findings provide precise evidence for the loss of TH-containing neurons in the setting of chronic IH mouse models, which can provide relevant empirical observations for clinicians.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To determine whether a machine learning model of voxel level [<sup>18</sup>f]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (PET) data could predict progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) pathology, as well as outperform currently available biomarkers.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>One hundred and thirty-seven autopsied patients with PSP (n = 42) and other neurodegenerative diseases (n = 95) who underwent antemortem [<sup>18</sup>f]fluorodeoxyglucose PET and 3.0 Tesla magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were analyzed. A linear support vector machine was applied to differentiate pathological groups with sensitivity analyses performed to assess the influence of voxel size and region removal. A radial basis function was also prepared to create a secondary model using the most important voxels. The models were optimized on the main dataset (n = 104), and their performance was compared with the magnetic resonance parkinsonism index measured on MRI in the independent test dataset (n = 33).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The model had the highest accuracy (0.91) and F-score (0.86) when voxel size was 6mm. In this optimized model, important voxels for differentiating the groups were observed in the thalamus, midbrain, and cerebellar dentate. The secondary models found the combination of thalamus and dentate to have the highest accuracy (0.89) and F-score (0.81). The optimized secondary model showed the highest accuracy (0.91) and F-scores (0.86) in the test dataset and outperformed the magnetic resonance parkinsonism index (0.81 and 0.70, respectively).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The results suggest that glucose hypometabolism in the thalamus and cerebellar dentate have the highest potential for predicting PSP pathology. Our optimized machine learning model outperformed the best currently available biomarker to predict PSP pathology. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The neurobiology of human stress-related disorders remains poorly understood, necessitating novel models and new model organisms to advance translational research in this field. Complementing rodent studies, the zebrafish (<i>Danio rerio</i>) is a useful model species for stress-related disorders. Here, we develop two novel experimental models of stress-related brain disorders, based on repeated prolonged exposure to predators or on chronic unpredictable stress in adult zebrafish. The ability of both models to recapitulate human stress in these fish was assessed behaviorally, in the novel tank and the plus maze (anxiety, locomotor, and cognitive tests), as well as by analyzing the baseline levels of cortisol, a common neuroendocrine biomarker of stress. Overall, anxiety-like behavior in the novel tank test was seen in both stressed groups, whereas poor learning and higher anxiety were observed in the plus maze test in predator-exposed fish, paralleling clinical cognitive and affective symptoms. Elevated cortisol in both stressed zebrafish further resembled neuroendocrine deficits seen in stress-related disorders clinically. Finally, the evoked behavioral and endocrine stress symptoms were rescued by treatment with two popular, clinically active antidepressant drugs, fluoxetine and paroxetine. Collectively, these models successfully recapitulated in zebrafish several key aspects of clinical stress-related disorders, further supporting the utility of these fish for translational stress research and anti-stress drug development.</p>

                Hirani et al. show how androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT)-induced crosstalk between oncogenic cell signaling pathways, driven by BCL2, contributes to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). This finding underscores the potential of BCL2-targeted combination therapeutics to block or delay the transition from castration-sensitive prostate cancer to CRPC induced by ADT.

                Loss-of-function MDA5 variants increase the risk of chronic inflammation but protect against autoimmune disease. Singh et al. show that autoimmune-protective variants impair MDA5 signaling via different mechanisms, including loss of RNA binding and increased ATPase activity. By tuning MDA5 signaling, variants offer a trade-off between antiviral activity and autoimmune disease protection.
