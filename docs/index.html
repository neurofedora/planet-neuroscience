<p>The renaissance of neural architecture search (NAS) has seen classical
methods such as genetic algorithms (GA) and genetic programming (GP) being
exploited for convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures. While recent
work have achieved promising performance on visual perception tasks, the direct
encoding scheme of both GA and GP has functional complexity deficiency and does
not scale well on large architectures like CNN. To address this, we present a
new generative encoding scheme -- $symbolic\ linear\ generative\ encoding$
(SLGE) -- simple, yet powerful scheme which embeds local graph transformations
in chromosomes of linear fixed-length string to develop CNN architectures of
variant shapes and sizes via evolutionary process of gene expression
programming. In experiments, the effectiveness of SLGE is shown in discovering
architectures that improve the performance of the state-of-the-art handcrafted
CNN architectures on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 image classification tasks; and
achieves a competitive classification error rate with the existing NAS methods
using less GPU resources.

<p>Genetic algorithms are modeled after the biological evolutionary processes
that use natural selection to select the best species to survive. They are
heuristics based and low cost to compute. Genetic algorithms use selection,
crossover, and mutation to obtain a feasible solution to computational
problems. In this paper, we describe our genetic optimization algorithms to a

<p>In this paper we propose a novel methodology to assist in identifying
vulnerabilities in a real-world complex heterogeneous industrial control
systems (ICS) using two evolutionary multiobjective optimisation (EMO)
algorithms, NSGA-II and SPEA2. Our approach is evaluated on a well known
benchmark chemical plant simulator, the Tennessee Eastman (TE) process model.
We identified vulnerabilities in individual components of the TE model and then
made use of these to generate combinatorial attacks to damage the safety of the
system, and to cause economic loss. Results were compared against random
attacks, and the performance of the EMO algorithms were evaluated using
hypervolume, spread and inverted generational distance (IGD) metrics. A defence
against these attacks in the form of a novel intrusion detection system was
developed, using a number of machine learning algorithms. Designed approach was
further tested against the developed detection methods. Results demonstrate
that EMO algorithms are a promising tool in the identification of the most
vulnerable components of ICS, and weaknesses of any existing detection systems
in place to protect the system. The proposed approach can be used by control
and security engineers to design security aware control, and test the
effectiveness of security mechanisms, both during design, and later during
system operation.

<p>Different areas of the brain such as the cortex and the prefrontal cortex
show a great recurrence in their connections, even in early sensory areas.
Several approaches and methods based on trained networks have been proposed to
model and describe these systems. It is essential to understand the dynamics
behind the models because they are used to build different hypotheses about the
functioning of the areas and also to explain experimental results. Present work
focuses on the study of the dynamics of recurrent neural networks trained to
perform Boolean-type operations with temporal stimuli that emulate being
sensory signals. The contribution here is a classification and interpretation
carried out with a set of numerical simulations corresponding to networks
trained for AND, OR, XOR tasks, and a Flip Flop, by doing the description of
the dynamics.

<p>Classification of whole-brain functional connectivity MRI data with
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) has shown promise, but the complexity of
these models impedes understanding of which aspects of brain activity
contribute to classification. While visualization techniques have been
developed to interpret CNNs, bias inherent in the method of encoding abstract
input data, as well as the natural variance of deep learning models, detract
from the accuracy of these techniques. We introduce a stochastic encoding
method in an ensemble of CNNs to classify functional connectomes by gender. We
applied our method to resting-state and task data from the UK BioBank, using
two visualization techniques to measure the salience of three brain networks
involved in task- and resting-states, and their interaction. To regress
confounding factors such as head motion, age, and intracranial volume, we
introduced a multivariate balancing algorithm to ensure equal distributions of
such covariates between classes in our data. We achieved a final AUROC of
0.8459. We found that resting-state data classifies more accurately than task
data, with the inner salience network playing the most important role of the
three networks overall in classification of resting-state data and connections
to the central executive network in task data.

<p>Deep learning models for MRI classification face two recurring problems: they
are typically limited by low sample size, and are abstracted by their own
complexity (the "black box problem"). In this paper, we train a convolutional
neural network (CNN) with the largest multi-source, functional MRI (fMRI)
connectomic dataset ever compiled, consisting of 43,858 datapoints. We apply
this model to a cross-sectional comparison of autism (ASD) vs typically
developing (TD) controls that has proved difficult to characterise with
inferential statistics. To contextualise these findings, we additionally
perform classifications of gender and task vs rest. Employing class-balancing
to build a training set, we trained 3$\times$300 modified CNNs in an ensemble
model to classify fMRI connectivity matrices with overall AUROCs of 0.6774,
0.7680, and 0.9222 for ASD vs TD, gender, and task vs rest, respectively.
Additionally, we aim to address the black box problem in this context using two
visualization methods. First, class activation maps show which functional
connections of the brain our models focus on when performing classification.
Second, by analyzing maximal activations of the hidden layers, we were also
able to explore how the model organizes a large and mixed-centre dataset,
finding that it dedicates specific areas of its hidden layers to processing
different covariates of data (depending on the independent variable analyzed),
and other areas to mix data from different sources. Our study finds that deep
learning models that distinguish ASD from TD controls focus broadly on temporal
and cerebellar connections, with a particularly high focus on the right caudate
nucleus and paracentral sulcus.

<p>Designing rewards for Reinforcement Learning (RL) is challenging because it
needs to convey the desired task, be efficient to optimize, and be easy to
compute. The latter is particularly problematic when applying RL to robotics,
where detecting whether the desired configuration is reached might require
considerable supervision and instrumentation. Furthermore, we are often
interested in being able to reach a wide range of configurations, hence setting
up a different reward every time might be unpractical. Methods like Hindsight
Experience Replay (HER) have recently shown promise to learn policies able to
reach many goals, without the need of a reward. Unfortunately, without tricks
like resetting to points along the trajectory, HER might require many samples
to discover how to reach certain areas of the state-space. In this work we
investigate different approaches to incorporate demonstrations to drastically
speed up the convergence to a policy able to reach any goal, also surpassing
the performance of an agent trained with other Imitation Learning algorithms.
Furthermore, we show our method can also be used when the available expert
trajectories do not contain the actions, which can leverage kinesthetic or
third person demonstration. The code is available at

directly extending architectures devised for image understanding to include the
time dimension, using modules such as 3D convolutions, or by using two-stream
design to capture both appearance and motion in videos. We interpret a video
CNN as a collection of multi-stream convolutional blocks connected to each
other, and propose the approach of automatically finding neural architectures
with better connectivity and spatio-temporal interactions for video
understanding. This is done by evolving a population of overly-connected
architectures guided by connection weight learning. Architectures combining
representations that abstract different input types (i.e., RGB and optical
flow) at multiple temporal resolutions are searched for, allowing different
types or sources of information to interact with each other. Our method,
referred to as AssembleNet, outperforms prior approaches on public video
datasets, in some cases by a great margin. We obtain 58.6% mAP on Charades and
34.27% accuracy on Moments-in-Time.

<p>Objective: Tai chi (TC), a contemplative practice combining slow movements and deep breathing, has been shown to be clinically effective in alleviating depressive symptoms. Feelings of fatigue or low vitality often accompany major depressive disorder (MDD) though they are commonly overlooked and not well understood neurologically. By using resting state functional connectivity (rs-FC) using the insula as the seed, this study examines the relationship between mood and vitality symptoms in MDD and how they are impacted by TC training.</p><p>Methods: Patients (N = 16) with MDD participated in a 10-week TC intervention. Self-report scores of vitality (using the SF-36 scale) and depressed mood (using the Beck Depression Inventory) as well as rs-fMRI were collected pre- and post-intervention. A seed-to-voxel approach was used to test whether changes in insular rs-FC were related to therapeutic improvement in MDD-related symptoms resulting from TC practice.</p><p>Results: We found decreased self-reported depressed mood and increased vitality following the TC intervention. Furthermore, decreases in depressed mood were associated with increased rs-FC between the right anterior insula (AIC) and superior temporal gyrus and caudate (cluster-corrected p &lt; 0.05). Increased vitality was associated with increased rs-FC between the right posterior insula (PIC) and regions associated with sensorimotor processes (cluster-corrected p &lt; 0.05).</p><p>Conclusion: These results provide support for differential changes in insula connectivity as neural correlates of symptom improvement in MDD.</p>

<p>In schizophrenia and related disorders, a deeper mechanistic understanding of neocortical dysfunction will be essential to developing new diagnostic and therapeutic techniques. To this end, combined transcranial magnetic stimulation and electroencephalography (TMS/EEG) provides a non-invasive tool to simultaneously perturb and measure neurophysiological correlates of cortical function, including oscillatory activity, cortical inhibition, connectivity, and synchronization. In this review, we summarize the findings from a variety of studies that apply TMS/EEG to understand the fundamental features of cortical dysfunction in schizophrenia. These results lend to future applications of TMS/EEG in understanding the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying cognitive deficits in schizophrenia.</p>

Purpose<p>The study is conducted to identify the best corpus callosum (CC) sub-region that corresponds to highest callosal tissue alteration occurred due to Parkinsonism. In this regard the efficacy of local binary pattern (LBP) based texture analysis (TA) of CC is performed to quantify the changes in topographical distribution of callosal fiber connected to different regions of cortex. The extent of highest texture alteration in CC is used for differential diagnosis.</p>Materials and Methods<p>Study included subjects with Parkinson’s disease (PD) (n = 20), and atypical Parkinsonian disorders – multiple system atrophy (MSA) (n = 20), Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) (n = 20), and healthy controls (n = 20). For each subject, we have automated the ROI extraction within mid-sagittal CC, followed by LBP TA. Two-class support vector machine (SVM) classification for each disorder as against HC is performed using extracted LBP features like energy and entropy. Correct classification ratio (CCR) is computed as the fraction of correctly classified ROIs at each of the CC sub-regions based on well-known Witelson and Hofer schemes. Based on CCR values, the “Scatter Index (SI)” is proposed to capture how localized (closer to 0) or scattered (closer to 1) the textural changes are among the CC sub-regions, across all subjects per class. The CCR values are further utilized to classify the disease groups.</p>Results<p>Highest alteration of texture is observed in mid-body of CC. The consistency of this finding is quantified using SI for all subjects in a specific class that results more localized textural changes in PSP (15%) and MSA (25%), in comparison to PD (47%). Classification among disease groups results maximum classification accuracy of 90% in classifying PSP from PD-NC.</p>Conclusion<p>Our result demonstrates the efficacy of proposed methodology in analyzing tissue alteration in MRI of Parkinsonian disorders and thus has potential to become valuable tool in computer aided differential diagnosis.</p>

<p>Besides several endogenous elements, exogenous factors, including exposure to pesticides, have been recognized as putative factors contributing to the onset and development of neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson’s disease (PD). Considering the availability, success rate, and limitations associated with the current arsenals to fight PD, there is an unmet need for novel therapeutic interventions. Therefore, based on the previously reported beneficial functions of the L1 cell adhesion molecule, we hypothesized that L1 mimetic compounds may serve to neutralize neurotoxicity triggered by the pesticide paraquat (PQ). In this study, we attempt to use PQ for inducing PD-like pathology and the L1 mimetic compounds phenelzine sulfate (PS) and tacrine (TC) as potential candidates for the amelioration of PD symptoms using zebrafish as a model system. Administration of PQ together with the L1 mimetic compounds PS or TC (250 nM) improved survival of zebrafish larvae, protected them from locomotor deficits, and increased their sensorimotor reflexes. Moreover, application of PQ together with PS (500 nM) or TC (1000 nM) in adult zebrafish counteracted PQ-induced toxicity, maintaining normal locomotor functions and spatial memory in an open field and T-maze task, respectively. Both L1 mimetic compounds prevented reduction in tyrosine hydroxylase and dopamine levels, reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, protected against impairment of mitochondrial viability, improved the antioxidant enzyme system, and prevented a decrease in ATP levels. Altogether, our findings highlight the beneficial functions of the agonistic L1 mimetics PS and TC by improving several vital cell functions against PQ-triggered neurotoxicity.</p>

<p>Theta-nested gamma oscillations have been reported in many areas of the brain and are believed to represent a fundamental mechanism to transfer information across spatial and temporal scales. In a series of recent experiments in vitro it has been possible to replicate with an optogenetic theta frequency stimulation several features of cross-frequency coupling (CFC) among theta and gamma rhythms observed in behaving animals. In order to reproduce the main findings of these experiments we have considered a new class of neural mass models able to reproduce exactly the macroscopic dynamics of spiking neural networks. In this framework, we have examined two set-ups able to support collective gamma oscillations: namely, the pyramidal interneuronal network gamma (PING) and the interneuronal network gamma (ING). In both set-ups we observe the emergence of theta-nested gamma oscillations by driving the system with a sinusoidal theta-forcing in proximity of a Hopf bifurcation. These mixed rhythms always display phase amplitude coupling. However, two different types of nested oscillations can be identified: one characterized by a perfect phase locking between theta and gamma rhythms, corresponding to an overall periodic behavior; another one where the locking is imperfect and the dynamics is quasi-periodic or even chaotic. From our analysis it emerges that the locked states are more frequent in the ING set-up. In agreement with the experiments, we find theta-nested gamma oscillations for forcing frequencies in the range [1:10] Hz, whose amplitudes grow proportionally to the forcing intensity and which are clearly modulated by the theta phase. Furthermore, analogously to the experiments, the gamma power and the frequency of the gamma-power peak increase with the forcing amplitude. At variance with experimental findings, the gamma-power peak does not shift to higher frequencies by increasing the theta frequency. This effect can be obtained, in our model, only by incrementing, at the same time, also the stimulation power. An effect achieved by increasing the amplitude either of the noise or of the forcing term proportionally to the theta frequency. On the basis of our analysis both the PING and the ING mechanism give rise to theta-nested gamma oscillations with almost identical features.</p>

<p>To understand functional neuronal circuits for emotion in the basal forebrain, patterns of neuronal activation were examined in mice by immunohistochemistry of immediate-early gene products (Zif268/Egr1 and c-Fos). In all mice examined, clusters of 30–50 neurons expressing Zif268 were found on both sides in the area between the extended amygdala (EA) and globus pallidus (GP), generally designated as sublenticular extended amygdala (SLEA). The clusters consisted of 79.9 ± 3.0% of GABAergic neurons in GAD65-mCherry mice. The expression of the cholinergic marker choline acetyltransferase and the GP markers parvalbumin, proenkephalin, and FoxP2 indicated that these neurons were different from known types of neurons in the EA and GP; therefore, we named them the sublenticular extended amygdalar Zif268/Egr1-expressing neuronal cluster (SLEA-zNC). Sublenticular extended amygdalar Zif268/Egr1-expressing neuronal clusters participated in stress processing because increasing numbers of cells were observed in SLEA-zNCs after exposure to restraint stress (RS), the induction of which was suppressed by diazepam treatment. Mapping SLEA-zNCs showed that their positions and arrangement varied individually; SLEA-zNCs were distributed asymmetrically and tended to be situated mainly in the middle region between the anterior commissure (AC) and posterior end of the GP. However, the total cell number in SLEA-zNCs was compatible between the right and left hemispheres after activation by RS. Therefore, SLEA-zNCs were distributed asymmetrically but were not lateralized. Because time courses of activation differed between the Zif268 and c-Fos, the sequential dual treatment of RSs enabled us to differentiate SLEA-zNCs activated by the first and second RS. The results supported that the same SLEA-zNCs responded to both the first and second RS, and this also applied for all SLEA-zNCs. Thus, we concluded that the cluster positions were invariable under RS in each mouse but were distributed differently between individual mice. We name these newly identified neuronal clusters as stress-related neuronal clusters, SLEA-zNCs, which are considered to be novel functional units of “islands of activation.” Moreover, SLEA-zNCs were situated at different positions in all mice examined, showing individual differences in their positions.</p>

<p>Animal survival relies on environmental information gathered by their sensory systems. We found that contrast information of a looming stimulus biases the type of defensive behavior that goldfish (Carassius auratus) perform. Low-contrast looms only evoke subtle alarm reactions whose probability is independent of contrast. As looming contrast increases, the probability of eliciting a fast escape maneuver, the C-start response, increases dramatically. Contrast information also modulates the decision of when to escape. Although response latency is known to depend on looming retinal size, we found that contrast acts as an additional parameter influencing this decision. When presenting progressively higher contrast stimuli, animals need shorter periods of stimulus processing to initiate the response. Our results comply with the notion that the decision to escape is a flexible process initiated with stimulus detection and followed by assessment of the perceived risk posed by the stimulus. Highly disruptive behaviors as the C-start are only observed when a multifactorial threshold that includes stimulus contrast is surpassed.</p>

<p>Emerging genetically-encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup>-indicators (GECIs) are intensiometric reporters that increase in fluorescence when bound to Ca<sup>2+</sup>; highly suited for studying calcium-signaling in many cell types, notably neurons. Today, major efforts are devoted toward optimizing red-emitting [red fluorescent protein (RFP)-based] GECIs (R-GECI), as these provide several advantages over GFP-based reporters, for instance, increased imaging depth, reduced photodamage by longer imaging wavelengths and, in principle, are better suited for use with prevalent blue-absorbing optogenetic tools (e.g., channelrhodopsin). However, excessive fluorescence from intersecting neighboring cells in very dense tissues, notably the brain, hinders the ability to collect signals from single cells and their processes. This challenge can be addressed by photoactivatable (PA) fluorescent proteins that can be rendered fluorescent on demand by user-defined targeted light. This allows activation and, thereby, collection of fluorescent signals exclusively from desired cells and their processes, while leaving all neighboring cells in the dark (i.e., non-fluorescent). Nevertheless, there are no PA R-GECIs. Here, we sought to develop PA-R-GECIs. To do so, we initially explored a recently discovered phenomenon of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent increases in fluorescence (i.e., artifacts) in an emerging R-GECI, which has led us to rationally engineer several functional PA-R-GECIs. We also take advantage of our findings to quickly engineer a novel PA-RFP, namely, PA-mRuby3.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/58925">Integrative analysis of large-scale loss-of-function screens identifies robust cancer-associated genetic interactions</a></h4>

Genetic interactions, including synthetic lethal effects, can now be systematically identified in cancer cell lines using high-throughput genetic perturbation screens. Despite this advance, few genetic interactions have been reproduced across multiple studies and many appear highly context-specific. Here, by developing a new computational approach, we identified 220 robust driver-gene associated genetic interactions that can be reproduced across independent experiments and across non-overlapping cell line panels. Analysis of these interactions demonstrated that: (i) oncogene addiction effects are more robust than oncogene-related synthetic lethal effects; and (ii) robust genetic interactions are enriched among gene pairs whose protein products physically interact. Exploiting the latter observation, we used a protein-protein interaction network to identify robust synthetic lethal effects associated with passenger gene alterations and validated two new synthetic lethal effects. Our results suggest that protein-protein interaction networks can be used to prioritise therapeutic targets that will be more robust to tumour heterogeneity.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/58499">Phagocytic glia are obligatory intermediates in transmission of mutant huntingtin aggregates across neuronal synapses</a></h4>

Emerging evidence supports the hypothesis that pathogenic protein aggregates associated with neurodegenerative diseases spread from cell to cell through the brain in a manner akin to infectious prions. Here, we show that mutant huntingtin (mHtt) aggregates associated with Huntington disease transfer anterogradely from presynaptic to postsynaptic neurons in the adult <i>Drosophila</i> olfactory system. Trans-synaptic transmission of mHtt aggregates is inversely correlated with neuronal activity and blocked by inhibiting caspases in presynaptic neurons, implicating synaptic dysfunction and cell death in aggregate spreading. Remarkably, mHtt aggregate transmission across synapses requires the glial scavenger receptor Draper and involves a transient visit to the glial cytoplasm, indicating that phagocytic glia act as obligatory intermediates in aggregate spreading between synaptically-connected neurons. These findings expand our understanding of phagocytic glia as double-edged players in neurodegeneration—by clearing neurotoxic protein aggregates, but also providing an opportunity for prion-like seeds to evade phagolysosomal degradation and propagate further in the brain.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/58118">Genomic innovation of ATD alleviates mistranslation associated with multicellularity in Animalia</a></h4>

The emergence of multicellularity in Animalia is associated with increase in ROS and expansion of tRNA-isodecoders. tRNA expansion leads to misselection resulting in a critical error of L-Ala mischarged onto tRNA<sup>Thr</sup>, which is proofread by Animalia-specific-tRNA Deacylase (ATD) <i>in vitro</i>. Here we show that in addition to ATD, threonyl-tRNA synthetase (ThrRS) can clear the error in cellular scenario. This two-tier functional redundancy for translation quality control breaks down during oxidative stress, wherein ThrRS is rendered inactive. Therefore, ATD knockout cells display pronounced sensitivity through increased mistranslation of threonine codons leading to cell death. Strikingly, we identify the emergence of ATD along with the error inducing tRNA species starting from Choanoflagellates thus uncovering an important genomic innovation required for multicellularity that occurred in unicellular ancestors of animals. The study further provides a plausible regulatory mechanism wherein the cellular fate of tRNAs can be switched from protein biosynthesis to non-canonical functions.

The COVID-19 pandemic demands assimilation of all biomedical knowledge to decode mechanisms of pathogenesis. Despite the recent renaissance in neural networks, a platform for the real-time synthesis of the exponentially growing biomedical literature and deep omics insights is unavailable. Here, we present the nferX platform for dynamic inference from 45 quadrillion+ possible conceptual associations from unstructured text and triangulation with insights from Single Cell RNA-sequencing, bulk RNAseq and proteomics from diverse tissue types. A hypothesis-free profiling of ACE2 suggests tongue keratinocytes, olfactory epithelial cells, airway club cells and respiratory ciliated cells as potential reservoirs of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor. We find the gut as the putative hotspot of COVID-19, where a maturation correlated transcriptional signature is shared in small intestine enterocytes among coronavirus receptors(ACE2, DPP4, ANPEP). A holistic data science platform triangulating insights from structured and unstructured data holds potential for accelerating the generation of impactful biological insights and hypotheses.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/56840">True S-cones are concentrated in the ventral mouse retina and wired for color detection in the upper visual field</a></h4>

Color, an important visual cue for survival, is encoded by comparing signals from photoreceptors with different spectral sensitivities. The mouse retina expresses a short wavelength-sensitive and a middle/long wavelength-sensitive opsin (S- and M-opsin), forming opposing, overlapping gradients along the dorsal-ventral axis. Here, we analyzed the distribution of all cone types across the entire retina for two commonly used mouse strains. We found, unexpectedly, that 'true S-cones' (S-opsin only) are highly concentrated (up to 30% of cones) in ventral retina. Moreover, S-cone bipolar cells (SCBCs) are also skewed towards ventral retina, with wiring patterns matching the distribution of true S-cones. In addition, true S-cones in the ventral retina form clusters, which may augment synaptic input to SCBCs. Such a unique true S-cone and SCBC connecting pattern forms a basis for mouse color vision, likely reflecting evolutionary adaption to enhance color coding for the upper visual field suitable for mice's habitat and behavior.

Sucrose-non-fermenting-1-related protein kinase-2s (SnRK2s) are critical for plant abiotic stress responses, including abscisic acid (ABA) signaling. Here, we develop a genetically encoded reporter for SnRK2 kinase activity. This sensor, named SNACS, shows an increase in the ratio of yellow to cyan fluorescence emission by OST1/SnRK2.6-mediated phosphorylation of a defined serine residue in SNACS. ABA rapidly increases FRET efficiency in <i>N. benthamiana</i> leaf cells and <i>Arabidopsis</i> guard cells. Interestingly, protein kinase inhibition decreases FRET efficiency in guard cells, providing direct experimental evidence that basal SnRK2 activity prevails in guard cells. Moreover, in contrast to ABA, the stomatal closing stimuli, elevated CO<sub>2</sub> and MeJA, did not increase SNACS FRET ratios. These findings and gas exchange analyses of quintuple/sextuple ABA receptor mutants show that stomatal CO<sub>2</sub> signaling requires basal ABA and SnRK2 signaling, but not SnRK2 activation. A recent model that CO<sub>2</sub> signaling is mediated by PYL4/PYL5 ABA-receptors could not be supported here in two independent labs. We report a potent approach for real-time live-cell investigations of stress signaling.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/55761">Apical length governs computational diversity of layer 5 pyramidal neurons</a></h4>

Anatomical similarity across the neocortex has led to the common assumption that the circuitry is modular and performs stereotyped computations. Layer 5 pyramidal neurons (L5PNs) in particular are thought to be central to cortical computation because of their extensive arborisation and nonlinear dendritic operations. Here, we demonstrate that computations associated with dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> plateaus in mouse L5PNs vary substantially between the primary and secondary visual cortices. L5PNs in the secondary visual cortex show reduced dendritic excitability and smaller propensity for burst firing. This reduced excitability is correlated with shorter apical dendrites. Using numerical modelling, we uncover a universal principle underlying the influence of apical length on dendritic backpropagation and excitability, based on a Na<sup>+</sup> channel-dependent broadening of backpropagating action potentials. In summary, we provide new insights into the modulation of dendritic excitability by apical dendrite length and show that the operational repertoire of L5PNs is not universal throughout the brain.

Mutations in <i>TUBB4A</i> result in a spectrum of leukodystrophy including Hypomyelination with Atrophy of Basal Ganglia and Cerebellum (H-ABC), a rare hypomyelinating leukodystrophy, often associated with a recurring variant p.Asp249Asn (D249N). We have developed a novel knock-in mouse model harboring heterozygous (<i>Tubb4a<sup>D249N/+</sup></i>) and the homozygous (<i>Tubb4a<sup>D249N/D249N</sup></i>) mutation that recapitulate the progressive motor dysfunction with tremor, dystonia and ataxia seen in H-ABC. <i>Tubb4a<sup>D249N/D249N</sup></i> mice have myelination deficits along with dramatic decrease in mature oligodendrocytes and their progenitor cells. Additionally, a significant loss occurs in the cerebellar granular neurons and striatal neurons in <i>Tubb4a<sup>D249N/D249N</sup></i> mice. In vitro studies show decreased survival and dysfunction in microtubule dynamics in neurons from <i>Tubb4a<sup>D249N/D249N</sup></i> mice. Thus <i>Tubb4a<sup>D249N/D249N</sup></i> mice demonstrate the complex cellular physiology of H-ABC, likely due to independent effects on oligodendrocytes, striatal neurons, and cerebellar granule cells in the context of altered microtubule dynamics, with profound neurodevelopmental deficits.

<p>Recent transcranial magnetic stimulation research indicated that the ability of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) to disinhibit the contralateral primary motor cortex (M1) during motor preparation is an important predictor for bimanual motor performance in both young and older healthy adults. However, this DLPFC-M1 disinhibition is reduced in older adults. Here, we transiently suppressed left DLPFC using repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) during a cyclical bimanual task and investigated the effect of left DLPFC suppression (1) on the projection from left DLPFC to the contralateral M1 and (2) on motor performance in 21 young (mean age ± SD = 21.57 ± 1.83) and 20 older (mean age ± SD = 69.05 ± 4.48) healthy adults. As predicted, without rTMS, older adults showed a compromised DLPFC-M1 disinhibition as compared to younger adults and less preparatory DLPFC-M1 disinhibition was related to less accurate performance, irrespective of age. Notably, rTMS-induced DLPFC suppression restored DLPFC-M1 disinhibition in older adults and improved performance accuracy right after the local suppression in both age groups. However, the rTMS-induced gain in disinhibition was not correlated with the gain in performance. In sum, this novel rTMS approach advanced our mechanistic understanding of how left DLPFC regulates right M1 and allowed us to establish the causal role of left DLPFC in bimanual coordination.</p>

<p>Individual-based models are complex and they have usually an elevated number
of input parameters which must be tuned for reproducing the observed population
data or the experimental results as accurately as possible. Thus, one of the
weakest points of this modelling approach lies on the fact that rarely the
modeler has the enough information about the correct values or even the
acceptable range for the input parameters. Consequently, several parameter
combinations must be tried to find an acceptable set of input factors
minimizing the deviations of simulated and the reference dataset. In practice,
most of times, it is computationally unfeasible to traverse the complete search
space trying all every possible combination to find the best of set of
parameters. That is precisely an instance of a combinatorial problem which is
suitable for being solved by metaheuristics and evolutionary computation
techniques. In this work, we introduce EvoPER, an R package for simplifying the
parameter estimation using evolutionary computation methods.

<p>Deep learning (DL) based predictive models from electronic health records
(EHR) deliver impressive performance in many clinical tasks. Large training
cohorts, however, are often required to achieve high accuracy, hindering the
adoption of DL-based models in scenarios with limited training data size.
Recently, bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) and
related models have achieved tremendous successes in the natural language
processing domain. The pre-training of BERT on a very large training corpus
generates contextualized embeddings that can boost the performance of models
trained on smaller datasets. We propose Med-BERT, which adapts the BERT
framework for pre-training contextualized embedding models on structured
diagnosis data from 28,490,650 patients EHR dataset. Fine-tuning experiments
are conducted on two disease-prediction tasks: (1) prediction of heart failure
in patients with diabetes and (2) prediction of pancreatic cancer from two
clinical databases. Med-BERT substantially improves prediction accuracy,
boosting the area under receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) by
2.02-7.12%. In particular, pre-trained Med-BERT substantially improves the
performance of tasks with very small fine-tuning training sets (300-500
samples) boosting the AUC by more than 20% or equivalent to the AUC of 10 times
larger training set. We believe that Med-BERT will benefit disease-prediction
studies with small local training datasets, reduce data collection expenses,
and accelerate the pace of artificial intelligence aided healthcare.

<p>The human brain works in an unsupervised way, and more than one brain region
is essential for lighting up intelligence. Inspired by this, we propose a
brain-like heterogeneous network(BHN) which can cooperatively learn distributed
representations, like the cortex, and a global contextual representation, like
the medial temporal lobe(MTL). By optimizing a distributed, self-supervised and
gradient-isolated contrastive loss function in a discriminative adversarial
fashion, our model successfully learns to extract useful representations from
video data. Methods developed in this work may help to solve some key problems
in pursuit of human-level intelligence.

<p>As a test of general applicability, we use the recently proposed spin-wave

recognition task. On this, classification accuracies of up to 93% are achieved.
The tested device prototype employs improved spin wave transducers (antennas).
Therefore, in addition, we also let the computer complete the short-term memory

nonlinearity are essential to reservoir computing performance. The resulting
STM and PC capacities reach maximum values of 4.77 and 1.47 respectively.

<p>In Markov games, playing against non-stationary opponents with learning
ability is still challenging for reinforcement learning (RL) agents, because
the opponents can evolve their policies concurrently. This increases the
complexity of the learning task and slows down the learning speed of the RL
agents. This paper proposes efficient use of rough heuristics to speed up
policy learning when playing against concurrent learners. Specifically, we
propose an algorithm that can efficiently learn explainable and generalized
action selection rules by taking advantages of the representation of
quantitative heuristics and an opponent model with an eXtended classifier
system (XCS) in zero-sum Markov games. A neural network is used to model the
opponent from their behaviors and the corresponding policy is inferred for
action selection and rule evolution. In cases of multiple heuristic policies,
we introduce the concept of Pareto optimality for action selection. Besides,
taking advantages of the condition representation and matching mechanism of
XCS, the heuristic policies and the opponent model can provide guidance for
situations with similar feature representation. Furthermore, we introduce an
accuracy-based eligibility trace mechanism to speed up rule evolution, i.e.,
classifiers that can match the historical traces are reinforced according to
their accuracy. We demonstrate the advantages of the proposed algorithm over
several benchmark algorithms in a soccer and a thief-and-hunter scenarios.

only able to predict the functional organization of human visual cortex from
anatomical properties alone, but it was also able to predict nuanced variations

<p>Characterizing the relation between weight structure and input/output
statistics is fundamental for understanding the computational capabilities of
neural circuits. In this work, I study the problem of storing associations
between analog signals in the presence of correlations, using methods from
statistical mechanics. I characterize the typical learning performance in terms
of the power spectrum of random input and output processes. I show that optimal
synaptic weight configurations reach a capacity of 0.5 for any fraction of
excitatory to inhibitory weights and have a peculiar synaptic distribution with
a finite fraction of silent synapses. I further provide a link between typical
learning performance and principal components analysis in single cases. These
results may shed light on the synaptic profile of brain circuits, such as
cerebellar structures, that are thought to engage in processing time-dependent

<p>To accurately predict the regional spread of Covid-19 infection, this study
proposes a novel hybrid model which combines a Long short-term memory (LSTM)
artificial recurrent neural network with dynamic behavioral models. Several
factors and control strategies affect the virus spread, and the uncertainty
arisen from confounding variables underlying the spread of the Covid-19
infection is substantial. The proposed model considers the effect of multiple
factors to enhance the accuracy in predicting the number of cases and deaths
across the top ten most-affected countries and Australia. The results show that
the proposed model closely replicates test data. It not only provides accurate
predictions but also estimates the daily behavior of the system under
uncertainty. The hybrid model outperforms the LSTM model accounting for limited
available data. The parameters of the hybrid models were optimized using a
genetic algorithm for each country to improve the prediction power while
considering regional properties. Since the proposed model can accurately
predict Covid-19 spread under consideration of containment policies, is capable
of being used for policy assessment, planning and decision-making.

<p>Recurrent neural network (RNN) has been widely studied in sequence learning
tasks, while the mainstream models (e.g., LSTM and GRU) rely on the gating
mechanism (in control of how information flows between hidden states). However,
the vanilla gates in RNN (e.g., the input gate in LSTM) suffer from the problem
of gate undertraining, which can be caused by various factors, such as the
saturating activation functions, the gate layouts (e.g., the gate number and
gating functions), or even the suboptimal memory state etc.. Those may result
in failures of learning gating switch roles and thus the weak performance. In
this paper, we propose a new gating mechanism within general gated recurrent
neural networks to handle this issue. Specifically, the proposed gates directly
short connect the extracted input features to the outputs of vanilla gates,
denoted as refined gates. The refining mechanism allows enhancing gradient
back-propagation as well as extending the gating activation scope, which can
guide RNN to reach possibly deeper minima. We verify the proposed gating
mechanism on three popular types of gated RNNs including LSTM, GRU and MGU.
Extensive experiments on 3 synthetic tasks, 3 language modeling tasks and 5
scene text recognition benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

<p>A fast and efficient stochastic opposition-based learning (OBL) variant is
proposed in this paper. OBL is a machine learning concept to accelerate the
convergence of soft computing algorithms, which consists of simultaneously
calculating an original solution and its opposite. Recently, a stochastic OBL
variant called BetaCOBL was proposed, which is capable of controlling the
degree of opposite solutions, preserving useful information held by original
solutions, and preventing the waste of fitness evaluations. While it has shown
outstanding performance compared to several state-of-the-art OBL variants, the
high computational cost of BetaCOBL may hinder it from cost-sensitive
optimization problems. Also, as it assumes that the decision variables of a
given problem are independent, BetaCOBL may be ineffective for optimizing
inseparable problems. In this paper, we propose an improved BetaCOBL that
mitigates all the limitations. The proposed algorithm called iBetaCOBL reduces
the computational cost from $O(NP^{2} \cdot D)$ to $O(NP \cdot D)$ ($NP$ and
$D$ stand for population size and a dimension, respectively) using a linear
time diversity measure. Also, the proposed algorithm preserves strongly
dependent variables that are adjacent to each other using multiple exponential
crossover. We used differential evolution (DE) variants to evaluate the
performance of the proposed algorithm. The results of the performance
evaluations on a set of 58 test functions show the excellent performance of
iBetaCOBL compared to ten state-of-the-art OBL variants, including BetaCOBL.

<p>Among many evolutionary algorithms, differential evolution (DE) has received
much attention over the last two decades. DE is a simple yet powerful
evolutionary algorithm that has been used successfully to optimize various
real-world problems. Since it was introduced, many researchers have developed
new methods for DE, and one of them makes use of a mutation based on the Cauchy
distribution to increase the convergence speed of DE. The method monitors the
results of each individual in the selection operator and performs the Cauchy
mutation on consecutively failed individuals, which generates mutant vectors by
perturbing the best individual with the Cauchy distribution. Therefore, the
method can locate the consecutively failed individuals to new positions close
to the best individual. Although this approach is interesting, it fails to take
into account establishing a balance between exploration and exploitation. In
this paper, we propose a sigmoid based parameter control that alters the
failure threshold for performing the Cauchy mutation in a time-varying
schedule, which can establish a good ratio between exploration and
exploitation. Experiments and comparisons have been done with six conventional
and six advanced DE variants on a set of 30 benchmark problems, which indicate
that the DE variants assisted by the proposed algorithm are highly competitive,
especially for multimodal functions.

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.06684">Formal derivation of Mesh Neural Networks with their Forward-Only gradient Propagation. (arXiv:1905.06684v4 [cs.LG] UPDATED)</a></h4>

<p>This paper proposes the Mesh Neural Network (MNN), a novel architecture which
allows neurons to be connected in any topology, to efficiently route
information. In MNNs, information is propagated between neurons throughout a
state transition function. State and error gradients are then directly computed
from state updates without backward computation. The MNN architecture and the
error propagation schema is formalized and derived in tensor algebra. The
proposed computational model can fully supply a gradient descent process, and
is suitable for very large scale NNs, due to its expressivity and training
efficiency, with respect to NNs based on back-propagation and computational
graphs.

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.10658">Constraining Implicit Space with MDL: Regularity Normalization as Unsupervised Attention. (arXiv:1902.10658v10 [cs.LG] UPDATED)</a></h4>

<p>Inspired by the adaptation phenomenon of neuronal firing, we propose the
regularity normalization (RN) as an unsupervised attention mechanism (UAM)
which computes the statistical regularity in the implicit space of neural
networks under the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle. Treating the
neural network optimization process as a partially observable model selection
problem, UAM constrained the implicit space by a normalization factor, the
universal code length. We compute this universal code incrementally across
neural network layers and demonstrated the flexibility to include data priors
such as top-down attention and other oracle information. Empirically, our
approach outperforms existing normalization methods in tackling limited,
imbalanced and non-stationary input distribution in computer vision and
reinforcement learning tasks. Lastly, UAM tracks dependency and critical
learning stages across layers and recurrent time steps of deep networks.

<p>Lifestyle factors have been shown to increase the risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease (AD) later in life. Specifically, an unfavorable cholesterol profile, and insulin resistance are associated with increased risk of developing AD. One way to non-pharmacologically affect the levels of plasma lipids is by exercise, which has been shown to be beneficial in cognitively healthy individuals. In this randomized controlled trial y, we therefore aimed to clarify the effect of physical exercise on the lipid profile, insulin and glucose in patients with AD. In addition, we investigated the effect of apolipoproteinE genotype on total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein–cholesterol (LDL-C), and triglycerides (TG) in plasma from patients with AD. Plasma samples from 172 patients who underwent 16 weeks of moderate-to-high intensity exercise (n = 90) or treatment as usual (n = 82) were analyzed change from baseline for the levels of total cholesterol, LDL-C, HDL-C, TG, glucose, and insulin. In addition, we analyzed those from the exercise group who adhered to the protocol with an attendance of 2/3 or more of the exercise session and who followed the protocol of an intensity of 70% of the maximum heart rate. We found a significant increase in plasma HDL-C levels between the “high exercise sub-group” compared to control group. After intervention HDL-C was increased by 4.3% in the high-exercise group, and decreased by 0.7% in the control group, after adjustment for statin use. In conclusion, short term physical activity may be beneficial on the cholesterol profile in patients with AD.</p>

<p>Traditionally, the visual motion area (MT) is considered as a brain region specialized for visual motion perception. However, accumulating evidence showed that MT is also related to various functions, suggesting that it is a complex functional area and different functional subregions might exist in this area. To delineate functional subregions of this area, left and right masks of MT were defined using meta-analysis in the BrainMap database, and coactivation-based parcellation was then performed on these two masks. Two dorsal subregions (Cl1 and Cl2) and one ventral subregion (Cl3) of left MT, as well as two dorsal-anterior subregions (Cl1 and Cl2), one ventral-anterior subregion (Cl3), and an additional posterior subregion (Cl4) of right MT were identified. In addition to vision motion, distinct and specific functions were identified in different subregions characterized by task-dependent functional connectivity mapping and forward/reverse inference on associated functions. These results not only were in accordance with the previous findings of a hemispheric asymmetry of MT, but also strongly confirmed the existence of subregions in this region with distinct and specific functions. Furthermore, our results extend the special role of visual motion perception on this area and might facilitate future cognitive study.</p>

<p>In the last decades, several electrophysiological markers have been investigated to better understand how humans precede a signaled event. Among others, the pre-stimulus microstates’ topography, representing the whole brain activity, has been proposed as a promising index of the anticipatory period in several cognitive tasks. However, to date, a clear relationship between the metrics of the pre-stimulus microstates [i.e., the global explained variance (GEV) and the frequency of occurrence (FOO)] and well-known electroencephalography marker of the anticipation (i.e., the alpha power reduction) has not been investigated. Here, after extracting the microstates during the expectancy of the semantic memory task, we investigate the correlations between the microstate features and the anticipatory alpha (8–12 Hz) power reduction (i.e., the event-related de-synchronization of the alpha rhythms; ERD) that is widely interpreted as a functional correlate of brain activation. We report a positive correlation between the occurrence of the dominant, but not non-dominant, microstate and both the mean amplitude of high-alpha ERD and the magnitude of the alpha ERD peak so that the stronger the decrease (percentage) in the alpha power, the higher the FOO of the dominant microstate. Moreover, we find a positive correlation between the occurrence of the dominant microstate and the latency of the alpha ERD peak, suggesting that subjects with higher FOO present the stronger alpha ERD closely to the target. These correlations are not significant between the GEV and all anticipatory alpha ERD indices. Our results suggest that only the occurrence of the dominant, but not non-dominant, microstate should be considered as a useful electrophysiological correlate of the cortical activation.</p>

<p>Previous studies suggest locomotion training could be an effective non-invasive therapy after spinal cord injury (SCI) using primarily acute thoracic injuries. However, the majority of SCI patients have chronic cervical injuries. Regaining hand function could significantly increase their quality of life. In this study, we used a clinically relevant chronic cervical contusion to study the therapeutic efficacy of rehabilitation in forelimb functional recovery. Nude rats received a moderate C5 unilateral contusive injury and were then divided into two groups with or without Modified Montoya Staircase (MMS) rehabilitation. For the rehabilitation group, rats were trained 5 days a week starting at 8 weeks post-injury (PI) for 6 weeks. All rats were assessed for skilled forelimb functions with MMS test weekly and for untrained gross forelimb locomotion with grooming and horizontal ladder (HL) tests biweekly. Our results showed that MMS rehabilitation significantly increased the number of pellets taken at 13 and 14 weeks PI and the accuracy rates at 12 to 14 weeks PI. However, there were no significant differences in the grooming scores or the percentage of HL missteps at any time point. Histological analyses revealed that MMS rehabilitation significantly increased the number of serotonergic fibers and the amount of presynaptic terminals around motor neurons in the cervical ventral horns caudal to the injury and reduced glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-immunoreactive astrogliosis in spinal cords caudal to the lesion. This study shows that MMS rehabilitation can modify the injury environment, promote axonal sprouting and synaptic plasticity, and importantly, improve reaching and grasping functions in the forelimb, supporting the therapeutic potential of task-specific rehabilitation for functional recovery after chronic SCI.</p>

<p>Reduced pain tolerance may be one of the possible explanations for high prevalence of chronic pain among older people. We hypothesized that age-related alterations in pain tolerance are associated with functioning deterioration of the frontal cortex during normal aging. Twenty-one young and 41 elderly healthy participants underwent a tonic heat pain test, during which cerebral activity was recorded using electroencephalography (EEG). Elderly participants were divided into two subgroups according to their scores on executive tests, high performers (HPs; n = 21) and low performers (LPs; n = 20). Pain measures [exposure times (ETs) and perceived pain ratings] and cerebral activity were compared among the three groups. ETs were significantly lower in elderly LPs than in young participants and elderly HPs. Electroencephalographic analyses showed that gamma-band oscillations (GBOs) were significantly increased in pain state for all subjects, especially in the frontal sites. Source analysis showed that GBO increase in elderly LPs was contributed not only by frontal but also by central, parietal, and occipital regions. These findings suggest that better preservation of frontal functions may result in better pain tolerance by elderly subjects.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/57887">The architecture of EMC reveals a path for membrane protein insertion</a></h4>

Approximately 25% of eukaryotic genes code for integral membrane proteins that are assembled at the endoplasmic reticulum. An abundant and widely conserved multi-protein complex termed EMC has been implicated in membrane protein biogenesis, but its mechanism of action is poorly understood. Here, we define the composition and architecture of human EMC using biochemical assays, crystallography of individual subunits, site-specific photocrosslinking, and cryo-EM reconstruction. Our results suggest that EMC's cytosolic domain contains a large, moderately hydrophobic vestibule that can bind a substrate's transmembrane domain (TMD). The cytosolic vestibule leads into a lumenally-sealed, lipid-exposed intramembrane groove large enough to accommodate a single substrate TMD. A gap between the cytosolic vestibule and intramembrane groove provides a potential path for substrate egress from EMC. These findings suggest how EMC facilitates energy-independent membrane insertion of TMDs, explain why only short lumenal domains are translocated by EMC, and constrain models of EMC's proposed chaperone function.

Bone strength is determined by its dense cortical shell, generated by unknown mechanisms. Here we use the <i>Dmp1<sup>Cre</sup>:Socs3<sup>f/f</sup></i> mouse, with delayed cortical bone consolidation, to characterise cortical maturation and identify control signals. We show that cortical maturation requires a reduction in cortical porosity, and a transition from low to high density bone, which continues even after cortical shape is established. Both processes were delayed in <i>Dmp1<sup>Cre</sup>:Socs3<sup>f/f</sup></i> mice. SOCS3 (suppressor of cytokine signalling 3) inhibits signalling by leptin, G-CSF, and IL-6 family cytokines (gp130). In <i>Dmp1<sup>Cre</sup>:Socs3<sup>f/f</sup></i> bone, STAT3 phosphorylation was prolonged in response to gp130-signalling cytokines, but not G-CSF or leptin. Deletion of gp130 in <i>Dmp1<sup>Cre</sup>:Socs3<sup>f/f</sup></i> mice suppressed STAT3 phosphorylation in osteocytes and osteoclastic resorption within cortical bone, leading to rescue of the corticalisation defect, and restoration of compromised bone strength. We conclude that cortical bone development includes both pore closure and accumulation of high density bone, and that these processes require suppression of gp130-STAT3 signalling in osteocytes.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/56621">Remyelination alters the pattern of myelin in the cerebral cortex</a></h4>

Destruction of oligodendrocytes and myelin sheaths in cortical gray matter profoundly alters neural activity and is associated with cognitive disability in multiple sclerosis (MS). Myelin can be restored by regenerating oligodendrocytes from resident progenitors; however, it is not known whether regeneration restores the complex myelination patterns in cortical circuits. Here we performed time lapse <i>in vivo</i> two photon imaging in somatosensory cortex of adult mice to define the kinetics and specificity of myelin regeneration after acute oligodendrocyte ablation. These longitudinal studies revealed that the pattern of myelination in cortex changed dramatically after regeneration, as new oligodendrocytes were formed in different locations and new sheaths were often established along axon segments previously lacking myelin. Despite the dramatic increase in axonal territory available, oligodendrogenesis was persistently impaired in deeper cortical layers that experienced higher gliosis. Repeated reorganization of myelin patterns in MS may alter circuit function and contribute to cognitive decline.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/56451">Characterization of the kinetic cycle of an ABC transporter by single-molecule and cryo-EM analyses</a></h4>

ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters are molecular pumps ubiquitous across all kingdoms of life. While their structures have been widely reported, the kinetics governing their transport cycles remain largely unexplored. Multidrug resistance protein 1 (MRP1) is an ABC exporter that extrudes a variety of chemotherapeutic agents and native substrates. Previously, the structures of MRP1 were determined in an inward-facing (IF) or outward-facing (OF) conformation. Here, we used single-molecule fluorescence spectroscopy to track the conformational changes of bovine MRP1 (bMRP1) in real time. We also determined the structure of bMRP1 under active turnover conditions. Our results show that substrate stimulates ATP hydrolysis by accelerating the IF-to-OF transition. The rate-limiting step of the transport cycle is the dissociation of the nucleotide-binding-domain dimer, while ATP hydrolysis per se does not reset MRP1 to the resting state. The combination of structural and kinetic data illustrates how different conformations of MRP1 are temporally linked and how substrate and ATP alter protein dynamics to achieve active transport.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/56312">Transgenesis and web resources in quail</a></h4>

Due to its amenability to manipulations, to live observation and its striking similarities to mammals, the chicken embryo has been one of the major animal models in biomedical research. Although it is technically possible to genome-edit the chicken, its long generation time (6 months to sexual maturity) makes it an impractical lab model and has prevented it widespread use in research. The Japanese quail (<i>Coturnix coturnix japonica</i>) is an attractive alternative, very similar to the chicken, but with the decisive asset of a much shorter generation time (1.5 months). In recent years, transgenic quail lines have been described. Most of them were generated using replication-deficient lentiviruses, a technique that presents diverse limitations. Here, we introduce a novel technology to perform transgenesis in quail, based on the <i>in vivo</i> transfection of plasmids in circulating Primordial Germ Cells (PGCs). This technique is simple, efficient and allows using the infinite variety of genome engineering approaches developed in other models. Furthermore, we present a website centralizing quail genomic and technological information to facilitate the design of genome-editing strategies, showcase the past and future transgenic quail lines and foster collaborative work within the avian community.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/54264">Distinct spatiotemporal mechanisms underlie extra-classical receptive field modulation in macaque V1 microcircuits</a></h4>

Complex scene perception depends upon the interaction between signals from the classical receptive field (CRF) and the extra-classical receptive field (eCRF) in primary visual cortex (V1) neurons. Although much is known about V1 eCRF properties, we do not yet know how the underlying mechanisms map onto the cortical microcircuit. We probed the spatio-temporal dynamics of eCRF modulation using a reverse correlation paradigm, and found three principal eCRF mechanisms: tuned-facilitation, untuned-suppression, and tuned-suppression. Each mechanism had a distinct timing and spatial profile. Laminar analysis showed that the timing, orientation-tuning, and strength of eCRF mechanisms had distinct signatures within magnocellular and parvocellular processing streams in the V1 microcircuit. The existence of multiple eCRF mechanisms provides new insights into how V1 responds to spatial context. Modeling revealed that the differences in timing and scale of these mechanisms predicted distinct patterns of net modulation, reconciling many previous disparate physiological and psychophysical findings.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/54186">Epigenetic inheritance of circadian period in clonal cells</a></h4>

Circadian oscillations are generated via transcriptional-translational negative feedback loops. However, individual cells from fibroblast cell lines have heterogeneous rhythms, oscillating independently and with different period lengths. Here we showed that heterogeneity in circadian period is heritable and used a multi-omics approach to investigate underlying mechanisms. By examining large-scale phenotype-associated gene expression profiles in hundreds of mouse clonal cell lines, we identified and validated multiple novel candidate genes involved in circadian period determination in the absence of significant genomic variants. We also discovered differentially co-expressed gene networks that were functionally associated with period length. We further demonstrated that global differential DNA methylation bidirectionally regulated these same gene networks. Interestingly, we found that depletion of DNMT1 and DNMT3A had opposite effects on circadian period, suggesting non-redundant roles in circadian gene regulation. Together, our findings identify novel gene candidates involved in periodicity, and reveal DNA methylation as an important regulator of circadian periodicity.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/53853">Structural insights into sodium transport by the oxaloacetate decarboxylase sodium pump</a></h4>

The oxaloacetate decarboxylase sodium pump (OAD) is a unique primary-active transporter that utilizes the free energy derived from oxaloacetate decarboxylation for sodium transport across the cell membrane. It is composed of 3 subunits: the a subunit catalyzes carboxyl-transfer from oxaloacetate to biotin, the membrane integrated β subunit catalyzes the subsequent carboxyl-biotin decarboxylation and the coupled sodium transport, the γ subunit interacts with the a and β subunits and stabilizes the OAD complex. We present here structure of the <i>Salmonella</i><i> typhimurium</i> OAD βγ sub-complex. The structure revealed that the β and γ subunits form a β<sub>3</sub>γ<sub>3</sub> hetero-hexamer with extensive interactions between the subunits and shed light on the OAD holo-enzyme assembly. Structure-guided functional studies provided insights into the sodium binding sites in the β subunit and the coupling between carboxyl-biotin decarboxylation and sodium transport by the OAD β subunit.

Integrating differential RNA and miRNA expression during neuronal lineage induction of human embryonic stem cells we identified miR-934, a primate-specific miRNA that displays a stage-specific expression pattern during progenitor expansion and early neuron generation. We demonstrate the biological relevance of this finding by comparison with data from early to mid-gestation human cortical tissue. Further we find that miR-934 directly controls progenitor to neuroblast transition and impacts on neurite growth of newborn neurons. In agreement, miR-934 targets are involved in progenitor proliferation and neuronal differentiation whilst miR-934 inhibition results in profound global transcriptome changes associated with neurogenesis, axonogenesis, neuronal migration and neurotransmission. Interestingly, miR-934 inhibition affects the expression of genes associated with the subplate zone, a transient compartment most prominent in primates that emerges during early corticogenesis. Our data suggest that mir-934 is a novel regulator of early human neurogenesis with potential implications for a species-specific evolutionary role in brain function.

Social interactions motivate behavior in many species, facilitating learning, foraging and cooperative behavior. However, how the brain encodes the reinforcing properties of social interactions remains elusive. Here using in vivo recording in freely moving mice, we show that Dopamine (DA) neurons of the Ventral Tegmental Area (VTA) increase their activity during active interactions with unfamiliar conspecific. Using a social instrumental task, we then show that VTA DA neuron activity signals social reward prediction error and drives social reinforcement learning. Thereby, our findings propose that VTA DA neurons are a neural substrate for a social learning signal driving motivated behavior.

While both sexes exhibit aggression, its neuronal underpinnings are understudied in females. Here, we describe a set of connected neurons in the adult Drosophila melanogaster central brain that drive female aggression. We identified a population of sexually dimorphic aIPg neurons whose optogenetic activation increased, and genetic inactivation reduced, female aggression. Analysis of GAL4 lines identified in an unbiased screen for increased female chasing behavior revealed the involvement of another sexually dimorphic neuron, pC1d, and implicated pC1d and aIPg neurons as core nodes regulating female aggression. pC1d activation increased female aggression and electron microscopy (EM) connectomic analysis demonstrated that aIPg neurons and pC1d have strong reciprocal connections. Our work reveals important regulatory components of the neuronal circuitry that underlies female aggressive social interactions and provides tools for their manipulation.

When faced with predatorial threats, escaping towards shelter is an adaptive action that offers long-term protection against the attacker. From crustaceans to mammals, animals rely on knowledge of safe locations in the environment to rapidly execute shelter-directed escape actions. While previous work has identified neural mechanisms of instinctive escape, it is not known how the escape circuit incorporates spatial information to execute rapid and accurate flights to safety. Here we show that mouse retrosplenial cortex (RSP) and superior colliculus (SC) form a monosynaptic circuit that continuously encodes the shelter direction. Inactivation of SC-projecting RSP neurons decreases SC shelter-direction tuning while preserving SC motor function. Moreover, specific inactivation of RSP input onto SC neurons disrupts orientation and subsequent escapes to shelter, but not orientation accuracy to a sensory cue. We conclude that the RSC-SC circuit supports an egocentric representation of shelter direction and is necessary for optimal shelter-directed escapes. This cortical-subcortical interface may be a general blueprint for increasing the sophistication and flexibility of instinctive behaviours.

The expression of genetic material governs brain development, differentiation, and function, and targeted manipulation of gene expression is required to understand contributions of gene function to health and disease states. Although recent improvements in CRISPR/dCas9 interference (CRISPRi) technology have enabled targeted transcriptional repression at selected genomic sites, integrating these techniques for use in non-dividing neuronal systems remains challenging. Previously, we optimized a dual lentivirus expression system to express CRISPR-based activation machinery in post-mitotic neurons. Here we used a similar strategy to adapt an improved dCas9-KRAB-MeCP2 repression system for robust transcriptional inhibition in neurons. We find that lentiviral delivery of a dCas9-KRAB-MeCP2 construct driven by the neuron-selective promoter human synapsin 1 enabled transgene expression in primary rat neurons. Next, we demonstrate transcriptional repression using CRISPR sgRNAs targeting diverse gene promoters, and show superiority of this system in neurons compared to existing RNA interference methods for robust transcript specific manipulation at the complex Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (Bdnf) gene. Our findings advance this improved CRISPRi technology for use in neuronal systems for the first time, potentially enabling improved ability to manipulate gene expression states in the nervous system.

Visual perception emerges as the result of neural systems actively organizing intrinsically noisy visual signals. It is commonly assumed that selection processes of competing neurons underlie this emergence of perceptual organization. While the neural competition, realized by such a "mutual inhibition" circuit has been examined in many theoretical studies, its dynamic properties have not been investigated in real neurons. We have developed a "hybrid" system where two real-life pyramidal neurons in a mouse brain slice interact through a computer simulated mutual inhibition circuit. We found that simultaneous activation of the mutually inhibiting pyramidal neurons leads to bi-stable activity. We investigated the effects of noise and the effect of changes in the activation strength on the dynamics. We observed that the circuit exhibits dynamics strikingly similar to the known properties of bi-stable visual perception.

Arrest of oligodendrocyte (OL) differentiation and remyelination following myelin damage in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) are associated with disease progression but the underlying mechanism are elusive. We show that Glutathione S-transferase 4 (Gsta4) is highly expressed during adult OL differentiation and that its loss prevents differentiation into myelinating OLs. Also, Gsta4 appeared to be a novel target for Clemastine, in clinical trial for MS. Over-expression of Gsta4 reduced the expression of Fas and activity along the mitochondria-associated Casp8/Bid-axis in adult pre-OLs from the corpus callosum, together promoting enhanced pre-OL survival during differentiation. The Gsta4-mediated input on apoptosis during adult OL differentiation was further verified in the LPC and EAE model, where Casp8 were reduced in pre-OLs with high Gsta4 expression in an immune response-independent fashion. Our results place Gsta4 as a key regulator of intrinsic mechanisms beneficial for OL differentiation and remyelination, and as a possible target for future MS therapies.

Neurite formation is the earliest stage of neuronal morphogenesis, where primitive dendrites and the primitive axon emerge from a spherical neuron and begin to elongate. Defective neuritogenesis is a contributing pathogenic mechanism behind a variety of neurodevelopmental disorders. Activity-dependent neuroprotective protein (Adnp) is essential to embryonic and postnatal brain development, and mutations in ADNP are among the most frequent underlying autism spectrum disorder (ASD). We found that knockdown of Adnp in vitro and in vivo in mouse layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons leads to increased neurite initiation and defective neurite elongation, suggesting that Adnp has distinct roles in each. In vivo analysis revealed that deficits begin at P0 and are sustained throughout development, the most notable of which include increased neurite stabilization, disrupted angle of the apical dendrite, increased basal dendrite number, and increased axon length. Because small changes in neuronal morphology can have large-scale effects on neuronal function and connectivity, we performed ex vivo calcium imaging to assess spontaneous function of layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons deficient in Adnp. This revealed that Adnp deficient neurons had a greater spontaneous calcium influx and a higher proportion of cells firing action potentials. Next, we utilized GRAPHIC, a novel synaptic tracing technology, to assess interhemispheric cortical connectivity. We found increased interhemispheric excitatory connectivity between Adnp deficient layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons. Because Adnp is a multifunctional protein with both transcription factor and cytoskeletal activity, we performed localization analysis of Adnp as neurons underwent neurite formation to probe the mechanism of our morphological defects. We found that Adnp is shuttled from the nucleus to the cytoplasm upon differentiation and this shuttling can be blocked via application of a global 14-3-3 inhibitor, difopein. Furthermore, we found that Adnp binds nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttle 14-3-3{varepsilon}. We conclude that Adnp is shuttled from the nucleus to the cytoplasm by 14-3-3{varepsilon}, where it regulates neuronal morphology, maturation, cortical connectivity, and calcium signaling.

Pictorial balance modulates the effects of salience and top-down direction on eye movements. When a perfectly balanced picture, a picture where balance has no effect on eye movements is viewed by someone who can disregard saliency and is innately disposed, the gaze is attentive to the entire picture without being directed to any one place and peripheral vision is facilitated. A study using balanced framed LED pictures showed that they are visually different to painters from identical pictures render unbalanced with a slightly different frame. The balanced pictures have bilateral quadrant luminance symmetry and a slightly more luminous lower half. A formula is presented for the calculation of pictorial balance that is confirmed by the study. The more a picture is balanced, the more it will appear unified and harmonious. The name given by the author to this effect is pictorial coherency.

In case of deafness, cochlear implants bypass dysfunctional or lost hair cells by direct electrical stimulation (eCIs) of the auditory nerve. However, spectral selectivity of eCI sound coding is low as the wide current spread from each electrode activates large sets of neurons that align to a place-frequency (tonotopic) map in the cochlea. As light can be better confined in space, optical cochlear implants (oCIs) promise to overcome this shortcoming of eCIs. This requires fine-grained, fast, and power-efficient real-time sound analysis and control of multiple microscale emitters. Here, we describe the development, characterisation, and application for hearing restoration of a preclinical low-weight and wireless LED-based multichannel oCI system and its companion eCI system. The head-worn oCI system enabled deaf rats to perform a locomotion task in response to acoustic stimulation proofing of concept of multichannel optogenetic hearing restoration in rodents.

Animal nervous system organization is crucial for all body functions and its disruption can manifest in severe cognitive and behavioral impairment. This organization relies on features across scales, from nano-level localization of synapses, through multiplicities of neuronal morphologies and their contribution to circuit organization, to the high level stereotyped connections between different regions of the brain. The sheer complexity of this organ means that to date, we have yet to reconstruct and model the structure of a complete nervous system that is integrated across all these scales. Here, we present a complete structure-function model of the nematode C. elegans main neuropil, the nerve ring, which we derive by integrating the volumetric reconstruction from two animals with corresponding synaptic and gap junctional connectomes. Whereas previously the nerve ring was considered a densely packed tract of axons, we uncover internal organization into 5 functional bundles and show how they spatially constrain and support the synaptic connectome. We find that the C. elegans connectome is not invariant, but that a precisely wired core circuit is embedded in a background of variable connectivity, and propose a corresponding reference connectome for the core circuit. Using this reference, we show that the architecture of the C. elegans brain can be viewed as a modular Residual Network that supports sensory computation and integration, sensory-motor convergence, and brain-wide coordination. These findings point to scalable and robust features of brain organization that are likely universal across phyla.

<p>by Clare I. Abreu, Vilhelm L. Andersen Woltz, Jonathan Friedman, Jeff Gore</p>

The effect of environmental fluctuations is a major question in ecology. While it is widely accepted that fluctuations and other types of disturbances can increase biodiversity, there are fewer examples of other types of outcomes in a fluctuating environment. Here we explore this question with laboratory microcosms, using cocultures of two bacterial species, <i>P</i>. <i>putida</i> and <i>P</i>. <i>veronii</i>. At low dilution rates we observe competitive exclusion of <i>P</i>. <i>veronii</i>, whereas at high dilution rates we observe competitive exclusion of <i>P</i>. <i>putida</i>. When the dilution rate alternates between high and low, we do not observe coexistence between the species, but rather alternative stable states, in which only one species survives and initial species’ fractions determine the identity of the surviving species. The Lotka-Volterra model with a fluctuating mortality rate predicts that this outcome is independent of the timing of the fluctuations, and that the time-averaged mortality would also lead to alternative stable states, a prediction that we confirm experimentally. Other pairs of species can coexist in a fluctuating environment, and again consistent with the model we observe coexistence in the time-averaged dilution rate. We find a similar time-averaging result holds in a three-species community, highlighting that simple linear models can in some cases provide powerful insight into how communities will respond to environmental fluctuations.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/TMfn7BB66D0" width="1" />

<p>by Christopher B. Currin, Andrew J. Trevelyan, Colin J. Akerman, Joseph V. Raimondo</p>

Fast synaptic inhibition is a critical determinant of neuronal output, with subcellular targeting of synaptic inhibition able to exert different transformations of the neuronal input-output function. At the receptor level, synaptic inhibition is primarily mediated by chloride-permeable Type A GABA receptors. Consequently, dynamics in the neuronal chloride concentration can alter the functional properties of inhibitory synapses. How differences in the spatial targeting of inhibitory synapses interact with intracellular chloride dynamics to modulate the input-output function of neurons is not well understood. To address this, we developed computational models of multi-compartment neurons that incorporate experimentally parametrised mechanisms to account for neuronal chloride influx, diffusion, and extrusion. We found that synaptic input (either excitatory, inhibitory, or both) can lead to subcellular variations in chloride concentration, despite a uniform distribution of chloride extrusion mechanisms. Accounting for chloride changes resulted in substantial alterations in the neuronal input-output function. This was particularly the case for peripherally targeted dendritic inhibition where dynamic chloride compromised the ability of inhibition to offset neuronal input-output curves. Our simulations revealed that progressive changes in chloride concentration mean that the neuronal input-output function is not static but varies significantly as a function of the duration of synaptic drive. Finally, we found that the observed effects of dynamic chloride on neuronal output were mediated by changes in the dendritic reversal potential for GABA. Our findings provide a framework for understanding the computational effects of chloride dynamics on dendritically targeted synaptic inhibition.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Xy9ZofIHwmU" width="1" />

S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) is one of the most important enzyme substrates. It is vital for the function of various proteins, including large group of methyltransferases (MTs). Intriguingly, some bacterial and eukaryotic MTs, while catalysing the same reaction, possess significantly different topologies, with the former being a knotted one. Here, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of SAM conformational space and factors that affect its vastness. We investigated SAM in two forms: free in water (via NMR studies and explicit solvent simulations) and bound to proteins (based on all data available in the PDB and on all-atom molecular dynamics simulations in water). We identified structural descriptors—angles which show the major differences in SAM conformation between unknotted and knotted methyltransferases. Moreover, we report that this is caused mainly by a characteristic for knotted MTs compact binding site formed by the knot and the presence of adenine-binding loop. Additionally, we elucidate conformational restrictions imposed on SAM molecules by other protein groups in comparison to conformational space in water.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/m35Km0cNHrc" width="1" />

<p>by Francesca Young, Simon Rogers, David L. Robertson</p>

The rise in metagenomics has led to an exponential growth in virus discovery. However, the majority of these new virus sequences have no assigned host. Current machine learning approaches to predicting virus host interactions have a tendency to focus on nucleotide features, ignoring other representations of genomic information. Here we investigate the predictive potential of features generated from four different ‘levels’ of viral genome representation: nucleotide, amino acid, amino acid properties and protein domains. This more fully exploits the biological information present in the virus genomes. Over a hundred and eighty binary datasets for infecting versus non-infecting viruses at all taxonomic ranks of both eukaryote and prokaryote hosts were compiled. The viral genomes were converted into the four different levels of genome representation and twenty feature sets were generated by extracting k-mer compositions and predicted protein domains. We trained and tested Support Vector Machine, SVM, classifiers to compare the predictive capacity of each of these feature sets for each dataset. Our results show that all levels of genome representation are consistently predictive of host taxonomy and that prediction k-mer composition improves with increasing k-mer length for all k-mer based features. Using a phylogenetically aware holdout method, we demonstrate that the predictive feature sets contain signals reflecting both the evolutionary relationship between the viruses infecting related hosts, and host-mimicry. Our results demonstrate that incorporating a range of complementary features, generated purely from virus genome sequences, leads to improved accuracy for a range of virus host prediction tasks enabling computational assignment of host taxonomic information.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/A8a_FLHiaZs" width="1" />

<p>by Haleh Alimohamadi, Alyson S. Smith, Roberta B. Nowak, Velia M. Fowler, Padmini Rangamani</p>

The biconcave disk shape of the mammalian red blood cell (RBC) is unique to the RBC and is vital for its circulatory function. Due to the absence of a transcellular cytoskeleton, RBC shape is determined by the membrane skeleton, a network of actin filaments cross-linked by spectrin and attached to membrane proteins. While the physical properties of a uniformly distributed actin network interacting with the lipid bilayer membrane have been assumed to control RBC shape, recent experiments reveal that RBC biconcave shape also depends on the contractile activity of nonmuscle myosin IIA (NMIIA) motor proteins. Here, we use the classical Helfrich-Canham model for the RBC membrane to test the role of heterogeneous force distributions along the membrane and mimic the contractile activity of sparsely distributed NMIIA filaments. By incorporating this additional contribution to the Helfrich-Canham energy, we find that the RBC biconcave shape depends on the ratio of forces per unit volume in the dimple and rim regions of the RBC. Experimental measurements of NMIIA densities at the dimple and rim validate our prediction that (a) membrane forces must be non-uniform along the RBC membrane and (b) the force density must be larger in the dimple than the rim to produce the observed membrane curvatures. Furthermore, we predict that RBC membrane tension and the orientation of the applied forces play important roles in regulating this force-shape landscape. Our findings of heterogeneous force distributions on the plasma membrane for RBC shape maintenance may also have implications for shape maintenance in different cell types.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/tdtlqFxkPn4" width="1" />

<p>by Arumay Pal, Yaakov Levy</p>

DNA sequences are often recognized by multi-domain proteins that may have higher affinity and specificity than single-domain proteins. However, the higher affinity to DNA might be coupled with slower recognition kinetics. In this study, we address this balance between stability and kinetics for multi-domain Cys<sub>2</sub>His<sub>2</sub>- (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>-) type zinc-finger (ZF) proteins. These proteins are the most prevalent DNA-binding domain in eukaryotes and C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> type zinc-finger proteins (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>-ZFPs) constitute nearly one-half of all known and predicted transcription factors in human. Extensive contact with DNA via tandem ZF domains confers high stability on the sequence-specific complexes. However, this can limit target search efficiency, especially for low abundance ZFPs. Earlier, we found that asymmetrical distribution of electrostatic charge among the three ZF domains of the low abundance transcription factor Egr-1 facilitates its DNA search process. Here, on a diverse set of 273 human C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>-ZFP comprised of 3–15 tandem ZF domains, we find that, in many cases, electrostatic charge and binding specificity are asymmetrically distributed among the ZF domains so that neighbouring domains have different DNA-binding properties. For proteins containing 3–6 ZF domains, we show that the low abundance proteins possess a higher degree of non-specific asymmetry and vice versa. Our findings suggest that where the electrostatics of tandem ZF domains are similar (i.e., symmetrical), the ZFPs are more abundant to optimize their DNA search efficiency. This study reveals new insights into the fundamental determinants of recognition by C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>-ZFPs of their DNA binding sites in the cellular landscape. The importance of electrostatic asymmetry with respect to binding site recognition by C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>-ZFPs suggests the possibility that it may also be important in other ZFP systems and reveals a new design feature for zinc finger engineering.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/RUxYdMJWctY" width="1" />

<p>by Attila Horvath, Marton Miskei, Viktor Ambrus, Michele Vendruscolo, Monika Fuxreiter</p>

Interactions between disordered proteins involve a wide range of changes in the structure and dynamics of the partners involved. These changes can be classified in terms of binding modes, which include disorder-to-order (DO) transitions, when proteins fold upon binding, as well as disorder-to-disorder (DD) transitions, when the conformational heterogeneity is maintained in the bound states. Furthermore, systematic studies of these interactions are revealing that proteins may exhibit different binding modes with different partners. Proteins that exhibit this context-dependent binding can be referred to as fuzzy proteins. Here we investigate amino acid code for fuzzy binding in terms of the Shannon entropy of the probabilities of transitions towards increasing or decreasing order (<i>p</i><sub>DO</sub> and <i>p</i><sub>DD</sub>). We implement these entropy calculations into the FuzPred (http://protdyn-fuzpred.org) algorithm to predict the range of context-dependent binding modes of proteins from their amino acid sequences. As we illustrate through a variety of examples, this method identifies those binding sites that are sensitive to the cellular context or post-translational modifications, and may serve as regulatory points of cellular pathways.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/e5M5a9eOI4g" width="1" />

Neurons form complex networks that evolve over multiple time scales. In order to thoroughly characterize these networks, time dependencies must be explicitly modeled. Here, we present a statistical model that captures both the underlying structural and temporal dynamics of neuronal networks. Our model combines the class of Stochastic Block Models for community formation with Gaussian processes to model changes in the community structure as a smooth function of time. We validate our model on synthetic data and demonstrate its utility on three different studies using <i>in vitro</i> cultures of dissociated neurons.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/fyZwCKmAdv4" width="1" />

T cell epitope candidates are commonly identified using computational prediction tools in order to enable applications such as vaccine design, cancer neoantigen identification, development of diagnostics and removal of unwanted immune responses against protein therapeutics. Most T cell epitope prediction tools are based on machine learning algorithms trained on MHC binding or naturally processed MHC ligand elution data. The ability of currently available tools to predict T cell epitopes has not been comprehensively evaluated. In this study, we used a recently published dataset that systematically defined T cell epitopes recognized in vaccinia virus (VACV) infected C57BL/6 mice (expressing H-2D<sup>b</sup> and H-2K<sup>b</sup>), considering both peptides predicted to bind MHC or experimentally eluted from infected cells, making this the most comprehensive dataset of T cell epitopes mapped in a complex pathogen. We evaluated the performance of all currently publicly available computational T cell epitope prediction tools to identify these major epitopes from all peptides encoded in the VACV proteome. We found that all methods were able to improve epitope identification above random, with the best performance achieved by neural network-based predictions trained on both MHC binding and MHC ligand elution data (NetMHCPan-4.0 and MHCFlurry). Impressively, these methods were able to capture more than half of the major epitopes in the top N = 277 predictions within the N = 767,788 predictions made for distinct peptides of relevant lengths that can theoretically be encoded in the VACV proteome. These performance metrics provide guidance for immunologists as to which prediction methods to use, and what success rates are possible for epitope predictions when considering a highly controlled system of administered immunizations to inbred mice. In addition, this benchmark was implemented in an open and easy to reproduce format, providing developers with a framework for future comparisons against new tools.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/rmObXkJxGX4" width="1" />

<p>by Paul Lemarre, Laurent Pujo-Menjouet, Suzanne S. Sindi</p>

The use of yeast systems to study the propagation of prions and amyloids has emerged as a crucial aspect of the global endeavor to understand those mechanisms. Yeast prion systems are intrinsically multi-scale: the molecular chemical processes are indeed coupled to the cellular processes of cell growth and division to influence phenotypical traits, observable at the scale of colonies. We introduce a novel modeling framework to tackle this difficulty using impulsive differential equations. We apply this approach to the [<i>PSI</i><sup>+</sup>] yeast prion, which is associated with the misconformation and aggregation of Sup35. We build a model that reproduces and unifies previously conflicting experimental observations on [<i>PSI</i><sup>+</sup>] and thus sheds light onto characteristics of the intracellular molecular processes driving aggregate replication. In particular our model uncovers a kinetic barrier for aggregate replication at low densities, meaning the change between prion or prion-free phenotype is a bi-stable transition. This result is based on the study of prion curing experiments, as well as the phenomenon of colony sectoring, a phenotype which is often ignored in experimental assays and has never been modeled. Furthermore, our results provide further insight into the effect of guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl) on Sup35 aggregates. To qualitatively reproduce the GdnHCl curing experiment, aggregate replication must not be completely inhibited, which suggests the existence of a mechanism different than Hsp104-mediated fragmentation. Those results are promising for further development of the [<i>PSI</i><sup>+</sup>] model, but also for extending the use of this novel framework to other yeast prion or amyloid systems.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/OH_VNX7H_U8" width="1" />

<p>by Maaike M. H. van Swieten, Rafal Bogacz</p>

Decision making relies on adequately evaluating the consequences of actions on the basis of past experience and the current physiological state. A key role in this process is played by the basal ganglia, where neural activity and plasticity are modulated by dopaminergic input from the midbrain. Internal physiological factors, such as hunger, scale signals encoded by dopaminergic neurons and thus they alter the motivation for taking actions and learning. However, to our knowledge, no formal mathematical formulation exists for how a physiological state affects learning and action selection in the basal ganglia. We developed a framework for modelling the effect of motivation on choice and learning. The framework defines the motivation to obtain a particular resource as the difference between the desired and the current level of this resource, and proposes how the utility of reinforcements depends on the motivation. To account for dopaminergic activity previously recorded in different physiological states, the paper argues that the prediction error encoded in the dopaminergic activity needs to be redefined as the difference between utility and expected utility, which depends on both the objective reinforcement and the motivation. We also demonstrate a possible mechanism by which the evaluation and learning of utility of actions can be implemented in the basal ganglia network. The presented theory brings together models of learning in the basal ganglia with the incentive salience theory in a single simple framework, and it provides a mechanistic insight into how decision processes and learning in the basal ganglia are modulated by the motivation. Moreover, this theory is also consistent with data on neural underpinnings of overeating and obesity, and makes further experimental predictions.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ANuMWUesgU0" width="1" />

Members of the Tre2-Bub2-Cdc16 (TBC) family often function to regulate membrane trafficking and to control signaling transductions pathways. As a member of the TBC family, TBC1D23 is critical for endosome-to-Golgi cargo trafficking by serving as a bridge between Golgi-bound golgin-97/245 and the WASH/FAM21 complex on endosomal vesicles. However, the exact mechanisms by which TBC1D23 regulates cargo transport are poorly understood. Here, we present the crystal structure of the N-terminus of TBC1D23 (D23<sup>N</sup>), which consists of both the TBC and rhodanese domains. We show that the rhodanese domain is unlikely to be an active sulfurtransferase or phosphatase, despite containing a putative catalytic site. Instead, it packs against the TBC domain and forms part of the platform to interact with golgin-97/245. Using the zebrafish model, we show that impacting golgin-97/245-binding, but not the putative catalytic site, impairs neuronal growth and brain development. Altogether, our studies provide structural and functional insights into an essential protein that is required for organelle-specific trafficking and brain development.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/qu44YOJC4Bw" width="1" />

Anticipating an odor improves detection and perception, yet the underlying neural mechanisms of olfactory anticipation are not well understood. In this study, we used human intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) to show that anticipation resets the phase of delta oscillations in piriform cortex prior to odor arrival. Anticipatory phase reset correlates with ensuing odor-evoked theta power and improvements in perceptual accuracy. These effects were consistently present in each individual subject and were not driven by potential confounds of pre-inhale motor preparation or power changes. Together, these findings suggest that states of anticipation enhance olfactory perception through phase resetting of delta oscillations in piriform cortex.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/iuOKvySs354" width="1" />

The type VI secretion system (T6SS) is a nanomachine used by many bacteria to drive a toxin-laden needle into other bacterial cells. Although the potential to influence bacterial competition is clear, the fitness impacts of wielding a T6SS are not well understood. Here we present a new agent-based model that enables detailed study of the evolutionary costs and benefits of T6SS weaponry during competition with other bacteria. Our model identifies a key problem with the T6SS. Because of its short range, T6SS activity becomes self-limiting, as dead cells accumulate in its way, forming “corpse barriers” that block further attacks. However, further exploration with the model presented a solution to this problem: if injected toxins can quickly lyse target cells in addition to killing them, the T6SS becomes a more effective weapon. We tested this prediction with single-cell analysis of combat between T6SS-wielding <i>Acinetobacter baylyi</i> and T6SS-sensitive <i>Escherichia coli</i>. As predicted, delivery of lytic toxins is highly effective, whereas nonlytic toxins leave large patches of <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> alive. We then analyzed hundreds of bacterial species using published genomic data, which suggest that the great majority of T6SS-wielding species do indeed use lytic toxins, indicative of a general principle underlying weapon evolution. Our work suggests that, in the T6SS, bacteria have evolved a disintegration weapon whose effectiveness often rests upon the ability to break up competitors. Understanding the evolutionary function of bacterial weapons can help in the design of probiotics that can both establish well and eliminate problem species.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/5_LHdCAMXds" width="1" />

Increased life expectancy of patients diagnosed with HIV in the current era of antiretroviral therapy is unfortunately accompanied with the prevalence of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HANDs) and risk of comorbidities such as Alzheimer-like pathology. HIV-1 transactivator of transcription (Tat) protein has been shown to induce the production of toxic neuronal amyloid protein and also enhance neurotoxicity. The contribution of astrocytes in Tat-mediated amyloidosis remains an enigma. We report here, in simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)+ rhesus macaques and patients diagnosed with HIV, brain region–specific up-regulation of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and Aβ (40 and 42) in astrocytes. In addition, we find increased expression of β-site cleaving enzyme (BACE1), APP, and Aβ in human primary astrocytes (HPAs) exposed to Tat. Mechanisms involved up-regulation of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF-1α), its translocation and binding to the long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) BACE1‐antisense transcript (BACE1-AS), resulting, in turn, in the formation of the BACE1-AS/BACE1 RNA complex, subsequently leading to increased BACE1 protein, and activity and generation of Aβ-42. Gene silencing approaches confirmed the regulatory role of HIF-1α in BACE1-AS/BACE1 in Tat-mediated amyloidosis. This is the first report implicating the role of the HIF-1α/lncRNABACE1-AS/BACE1 axis in Tat-mediated induction of astrocytic amyloidosis, which could be targeted as adjunctive therapies for HAND-associated Alzheimer-like comorbidity.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/xNuaoBeFtwk" width="1" />

One of the most influential accounts of central orbitofrontal cortex—that it mediates behavioral flexibility—has been challenged by the finding that discrimination reversal in macaques, the classic test of behavioral flexibility, is unaffected when lesions are made by excitotoxin injection rather than aspiration. This suggests that the critical brain circuit mediating behavioral flexibility in reversal tasks lies beyond the central orbitofrontal cortex. To determine its identity, a group of nine macaques were taught discrimination reversal learning tasks, and its impact on gray matter was measured. Magnetic resonance imaging scans were taken before and after learning and compared with scans from two control groups, each comprising 10 animals. One control group learned discrimination tasks that were similar but lacked any reversal component, and the other control group engaged in no learning. Gray matter changes were prominent in posterior orbitofrontal cortex/anterior insula but were also found in three other frontal cortical regions: lateral orbitofrontal cortex (orbital part of area 12 [12o]), cingulate cortex, and lateral prefrontal cortex. In a second analysis, neural activity in posterior orbitofrontal cortex/anterior insula was measured at rest, and its pattern of coupling with the other frontal cortical regions was assessed. Activity coupling increased significantly in the reversal learning group in comparison with controls. In a final set of experiments, we used similar structural imaging procedures and analyses to demonstrate that aspiration lesion of central orbitofrontal cortex, of the type known to affect discrimination learning, affected structure and activity in the same frontal cortical circuit. The results identify a distributed frontal cortical circuit associated with behavioral flexibility.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/7bLSqR7cW90" width="1" />

<p>by Avner Wallach, David Deutsch, Tess Baker Oram, Ehud Ahissar</p>

Animals actively move their sensory organs in order to acquire sensory information. Some rodents, such as mice and rats, employ cyclic scanning motions of their facial whiskers to explore their proximal surrounding, a behavior known as whisking. Here, we investigated the contingency of whisking kinematics on the animal’s behavioral context that arises from both internal processes (attention and expectations) and external constraints (available sensory and motor degrees of freedom). We recorded rat whisking at high temporal resolution in 2 experimental contexts—freely moving or head-fixed—and 2 spatial sensory configurations—a single row or 3 caudal whiskers on each side of the snout. We found that rapid sensorimotor twitches, called pumps, occurring during free-air whisking carry information about the rat’s upcoming exploratory direction, as demonstrated by the ability of these pumps to predict consequent head and body locomotion. Specifically, pump behavior during both voluntary motionlessness and imposed head fixation exposed a backward redistribution of sensorimotor exploratory resources. Further, head-fixed rats employed a wide range of whisking profiles to compensate for the loss of head- and body-motor degrees of freedom. Finally, changing the number of intact vibrissae available to a rat resulted in an alteration of whisking strategy consistent with the rat actively reallocating its remaining resources. In sum, this work shows that rats adapt their active exploratory behavior in a “homeostatic” attempt to preserve sensorimotor coverage under changing environmental conditions and changing sensory capacities, including those imposed by various laboratory conditions.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/oarD9EsnT5I" width="1" />

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To investigate whether intensive blood pressure treatment is associated with less hematoma growth and better outcome in ICH patients who received intravenous nicardipine treatment within 2 hrs after onset of symptoms.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>A post‐hoc exploratory analysis of the Antihypertensive Treatment of Acute Cerebral Hemorrhage 2 (ATACH‐2) trial was performed. This was a multicenter, international, open‐label randomized clinical trial in which patients with primary ICH were allocated to intensive versus standard blood pressure treatment with nicardipine within 4.5 hours of symptom onset. We have included 913 patients with complete imaging and follow‐up data in the present analysis.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Among the 913 included patients, 354 (38.7%) had intravenous nicardipine treatment initiated within 2 hours. In this subgroup of patients treated within 2 hours, the frequency of ICH expansion was significantly lower in the intensive blood pressure reduction group as compared with standard treatment group (P = 0.02). Multivariable analysis showed that ultra‐early intensive blood pressure treatment was associated with a decreased risk of hematoma growth (odds ratio, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.34–0.92; P = 0.02), higher rate of functional independence (odds ratio, 2.17; 95% CI, 1.28–3.68; P = 0.004) and good outcome (OR, 1.68; 95% CI, 1.01–2.83; P = 0.048) at 90 days. Ultra‐early intensive blood pressure reduction was associated with a favorable shift in modified Rankin Scale score distribution at 3 months (p = 0.04).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>In a subgroup of ICH patients with elevated blood pressure given intravenous nicardipine within 2 hours of symptom onset, intensive blood pressure reduction was associated with reduced hematoma growth and improved functional outcome.</p>

This study investigated whether there are local (regional) differences in these effects. 19‐day old White‐Leghorn chicks wore monocular +10 or − 10 D lenses, or diffusers (FD) for 2 or 48 h, after which RPE samples were collected from both eyes, from a central circular zone (3 mm radius), and 3 mm wide annular mid‐peripheral and peripheral zones in all cases. <i>BMP2, 4, </i> and <i>7 </i> gene expression levels in RPE from treated and fellow control eyes were compared as well as differences across zones. With the +10 D lens, increased expression of both <i>BMP2 </i> and <i>BMP4 </i> genes was observed in central and mid‐peripheral zones but not the peripheral zone after 2 and 48 h. In contrast, with the −10 D lens <i>BMP2 </i> gene expression was significantly decreased in all three zones after 2 and 48 h. Similar patterns of <i>BMP2 </i> gene expression were observed in all three zones after 48 h of FD. Smaller changes were recorded for <i>BMP4 </i> and <i>BMP7 </i> gene expression for both myopia‐inducing treatments. That optical defocus‐ and FD‐induced changes in <i>BMP </i> gene expression in chick RPE show treatment‐dependent local (regional) differences suggest important differences in the nature and contributions of local retinal and underlying RPE regions to eye growth regulation.</p>

<p>Nectin‐2α, prominently expressed in the medial habenula (MHb), was localized at cholinergic neuron dendrites in synaptic regions of the MHb (clustered filled dots) in addition to the boundary between the adjacent somata of the clustered cholinergic neurons (edges of clustered open hexagons). This dendritic nectin‐2α formed puncta adherentia junctions cooperatively with afadin, cadherin‐8, p120‐catenin, β‐catenin, and αN‐catenin and regulated synapse formation.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The medial habenula (MHb) receives afferents from the triangular septum and the medial septal complex, projects efferents to the interpeduncular nucleus (IPN) in the midbrain to regulate dopamine and serotonin levels, and is implicated in stress, depression, memory, and nicotine withdrawal syndrome. We previously showed that the cell adhesion molecule nectin‐2α is localized at the boundary between adjacent somata of clustered cholinergic neurons and regulates the voltage‐gated A‐type K<sup>+</sup> channel Kv4.2 localization at membrane specializations in the MHb. This adhesion apparatus, named nectin‐2α spots, is not associated with the nectin‐binding protein afadin or any classic cadherins and their binding proteins p120‐catenin and β‐catenin. We showed here that nectin‐2α was additionally localized at cholinergic neuron dendrites in synaptic regions of the MHb. The genetic ablation of <i>nectin‐2 </i> reduced the number of synapses in the MHb without affecting their morphology. Nectin‐2α was associated with afadin, cadherin‐8, p120‐catenin, β‐catenin, and αN‐catenin, forming puncta adherentia junctions (PAJs). Nectin‐2α was observed in the IPN, but not in the triangular septum or the medial septal complex. The genetic ablation of <i>nectin‐2 </i> did not affect synapse formation in the IPN. These results indicate that nectin‐2α forms two types of adhesion apparatus in the MHb, namely nectin‐2α spots at neighboring somata and PAJs at neighboring dendrites, and that dendritic PAJs regulate synapse formation in the MHb.</p>

<p>Cognitive states are involving in our daily life, which motivates us to
explore them and understand them by a vast variety of perspectives. Among these
perspectives, brain connectivity is increasingly receiving attention in recent
years. It is the right time to summarize the past achievements, serving as a
cornerstone for the upcoming progress in the field. In this chapter, the
definition of the cognitive state is first given and the cognitive states that
are frequently investigated are then outlined. The introduction of approaches
for estimating connectivity strength is followed. Subsequently, each cognitive
state is separately described and the progress in cognitive state investigation
is summarized, including analysis, understanding, and decoding. We concentrate
on the literature ascertaining macro-scale representations of cognitive states
from the perspective of brain connectivity and give an overview of achievements
related to cognitive states to date, especially within the past ten years. The
discussions and future prospects are stated at the end of the chapter.

<p>The mapping between the visual input on the retina to the cortical surface,
i.e., retinotopic mapping, is an important topic in vision science and
neuroscience. Human retinotopic mapping can be revealed by analyzing cortex
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signals when the subject is under
specific visual stimuli. Conventional methods process, smooth, and analyze the
retinotopic mapping based on the parametrization of the (partial) cortical
surface. However, the retinotopic maps generated by this approach frequently
contradict neuropsychology results. To address this problem, we propose an
integrated approach that parameterizes the cortical surface, such that the
parametric coordinates linearly relates the visual coordinate. The proposed
method helps the smoothing of noisy retinotopic maps and obtains
neurophysiological insights in human vision systems. One key element of the
approach is the Error-Tolerant Teichmuller Map, which uniforms the angle
distortion and maximizes the alignments to self-contradicting landmarks. We
validated our overall approach with synthetic and real retinotopic mapping
datasets. The experimental results show the proposed approach is superior in
accuracy and compatibility. Although we focus on retinotopic mapping, the
proposed framework is general and can be applied to process other human sensory
maps.

<p>This paper discusses an approach for incorporating prior physical knowledge
into the neural network to improve data efficiency and the generalization of
predictive models. If the dynamics of a system approximately follows a given
differential equation, the Taylor mapping method can be used to initialize the
weights of a polynomial neural network. This allows the fine-tuning of the
model from one training sample of real system dynamics. The paper describes
practical results on real experiments with both a simple pendulum and one of
the largest worldwide X-ray source. It is demonstrated in practice that the
proposed approach allows recovering complex physics from noisy, limited, and
partial observations and provides meaningful predictions for previously unseen
inputs. The approach mainly targets the learning of physical systems when
state-of-the-art models are difficult to apply given the lack of training data.

<p>Neural learning rules for principal component / subspace analysis (PCA / PSA)
can be derived by maximizing an objective function (summed variance of the
projection on the subspace axes) under an orthonormality constraint. For a
subspace with a single axis, the optimization produces the principal
eigenvector of the data covariance matrix. Hierarchical learning rules with
deflation procedures can then be used to extract multiple eigenvectors.
However, for a subspace with multiple axes, the optimization leads to PSA
learning rules which only converge to axes spanning the principal subspace but
not to the principal eigenvectors. A modified objective function with distinct
weight factors had to be introduced produce PCA learning rules. Optimization of
the objective function for multiple axes leads to symmetric learning rules
which do not require deflation procedures. For the PCA case, the estimated
principal eigenvectors are ordered (w.r.t. the corresponding eigenvalues)
depending on the order of the weight factors.
</p>
<p>Here we introduce an alternative objective function where it is not necessary
to introduce fixed weight factors; instead, the alternative objective function
uses squared summands. Optimization leads to symmetric PCA learning rules which
converge to the principal eigenvectors, but without imposing an order. In place
of the diagonal matrices with fixed weight factors, variable diagonal matrices
appear in the learning rules. We analyze this alternative approach by
determining the fixed points of the constrained optimization. The behavior of
the constrained objective function at the fixed points is analyzed which
confirms both the PCA behavior and the fact that no order is imposed. Different
ways to derive learning rules from the optimization of the objective function
are presented. The role of the terms in the learning rules obtained from these
derivations is explored.

<p>The emergence of brain-inspired neuromorphic computing as a paradigm for edge
AI is motivating the search for high-performance and efficient spiking neural
networks to run on this hardware. However, compared to classical neural
networks in deep learning, current spiking neural networks lack competitive
performance in compelling areas. Here, for sequential and streaming tasks, we
demonstrate how a novel type of adaptive spiking recurrent neural network
(SRNN) is able to achieve state-of-the-art performance compared to other
spiking neural networks and almost reach or exceed the performance of classical
recurrent neural networks (RNNs) while exhibiting sparse activity. From this,
we calculate a $&gt;$100x energy improvement for our SRNNs over classical RNNs on
the harder tasks. To achieve this, we model standard and adaptive
multiple-timescale spiking neurons as self-recurrent neural units, and leverage
surrogate gradients and auto-differentiation in the PyTorch Deep Learning
framework to efficiently implement backpropagation-through-time, including
learning of the important spiking neuron parameters to adapt our spiking
neurons to the tasks.

<p>Biological neural networks have evolved to maintain performance despite
significant circuit damage. To survive damage, biological network architectures
have both intrinsic resilience to component loss and also activate recovery
programs that adjust network weights through plasticity to stabilize
performance. Despite the importance of resilience in technology applications,
the resilience of artificial neural networks is poorly understood, and
autonomous recovery algorithms have yet to be developed. In this paper, we
establish a mathematical framework to analyze the resilience of artificial
neural networks through the lens of differential geometry. Our geometric
language provides natural algorithms that identify local vulnerabilities in
trained networks as well as recovery algorithms that dynamically adjust
networks to compensate for damage. We reveal striking vulnerabilities in
commonly used image analysis networks, like MLP's and CNN's trained on MNIST
and CIFAR10 respectively. We also uncover high-performance recovery paths that
enable the same networks to dynamically re-adjust their parameters to
compensate for damage. Broadly, our work provides procedures that endow
artificial systems with resilience and rapid-recovery routines to enhance their
integration with IoT devices as well as enable their deployment for critical
applications.

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.11600">Knee Point Identification Based on Trade-Off Utility. (arXiv:2005.11600v1 [math.OC])</a></h4>

<p>Knee points, characterised as their smallest trade-off loss at all
objectives, are attractive to decision makers in multi-criterion
decision-making. In contrast, other Pareto-optimal solutions are less
attractive since a small improvement on one objective can lead to a significant
degradation on at least one of the other objectives. In this paper, we propose
a simple and effective knee point identification method based on trade-off
utility, dubbed KPITU, to help decision makers identify knee points from a
given set of trade-off solutions. The basic idea of KPITU is to sequentially
validate whether a solution is a knee point or not by comparing its trade-off
utility with others within its neighbourhood. In particular, a solution is a
knee point if and only if it has the best trade-off utility among its
neighbours. Moreover, we implement a GPU version of KPITU that carries out the
knee point identification in a parallel manner. This GPU version reduces the
worst-case complexity from quadratic to linear. To validate the effectiveness
of KPITU, we compare its performance with five state-of-the-art knee point
identification methods on 134 test problem instances. Empirical results fully
demonstrate the outstanding performance of KPITU especially on problems with
many local knee points. At the end, we further validate the usefulness of KPITU
for guiding EMO algorithms to search for knee points on the fly during the
evolutionary process.

<p>Exposure to sedative/hypnotic and anesthetic drugs, such as ketamine, during the critical period of synaptogenesis, causes profound neurotoxicity in the developing rodent and primate brains and is associated with poor cognitive outcomes later in life. The subiculum is especially vulnerable to acute neurotoxicity after neonatal exposure to sedative/hypnotic and anesthetic drugs. The subiculum acts as a relay center between the hippocampal complex and various cortical and subcortical brain regions and is also an independent generator of gamma oscillations. Gamma oscillations are vital in neuronal synchronization and play a role in learning and memory during wake and sleep. However, there has been little research examining long-term changes in subicular neurophysiology after neonatal exposure to ketamine. Here we explore the lasting effects of neonatal ketamine exposure on sleep macrostructure as well as subicular neuronal oscillations and synaptic plasticity in rats. During the peak of rodent synaptogenesis at postnatal day 7, rat pups were exposed to either 40 mg/kg of ketamine over 12 h or to volume matched saline vehicle. At weaning age, a subset of rats were implanted with a cortical and subicular electroencephalogram electrode, and at postnatal day 31, we performed in vivo experiments that included sleep macrostructure (divided into the wake, non-rapid eye movement, and rapid eye movement sleep) and electroencephalogram power spectra in cortex and subiculum. In a second subset of ketamine exposed animals, we conducted ex vivo studies of long-term potentiation (LTP) experiments in adolescent rats. Overall, we found that neonatal exposure to ketamine increased subicular gamma oscillations during non-rapid eye movement sleep but it did not alter sleep macrostructure. Also, we observed a significant decrease in subicular LTP. Gamma oscillations during non-rapid eye movement sleep are implicated in memory formation and consolidation, while LTP serves as a surrogate for learning and memory. Together these results suggest that lasting functional changes in subiculum circuitry may underlie neurocognitive impairments associated with neonatal exposure to anesthetic agents.</p>

<p>Changes in excitation and inhibition are associated with the pathobiology of neurodevelopmental disorders of intellectual disability and autism and are widely described in Fragile X syndrome (FXS). In the prefrontal cortex (PFC), essential for cognitive processing, excitatory connectivity and plasticity are found altered in the FXS mouse model, however, little is known about the state of inhibition. To that end, we investigated GABAergic signaling in the Fragile X Mental Retardation 1 (FMR1) knock out (Fmr1-KO) mouse medial PFC (mPFC). We report changes at the molecular, and functional levels of inhibition at three (prepubescence) and six (adolescence) postnatal weeks. Functional changes were most prominent during early postnatal development, resulting in stronger inhibition, through increased synaptic inhibitory drive and amplitude, and reduction of inhibitory short-term synaptic depression. Noise analysis of prepubescent post-synaptic currents demonstrated an increased number of receptors opening during peak current in Fmr1-KO inhibitory synapses. During adolescence amplitudes and plasticity changes normalized, however, the inhibitory drive was now reduced in Fmr1-KO, while synaptic kinetics were prolonged. Finally, adolescent GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor subunit α2 and GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor subtype B1 expression levels were different in Fmr1-KOs than WT littermate controls. Together these results extend the degree of synaptic GABAergic alterations in FXS, now to the mPFC of Fmr1-KO mice, a behaviourally relevant brain region in neurodevelopmental disorder pathology.</p>

<p>Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) allowed the spatial characterization of the resting-state verbal language network (vLN). While other resting-state networks (RSNs) were matched with their electrophysiological equivalents at rest and could be spectrally defined, such correspondence is lacking for the vLN. This magnetoencephalography (MEG) study aimed at defining the spatio-spectral characteristics of the neuromagnetic intrinsic functional architecture of the vLN. Neuromagnetic activity was recorded at rest in 100 right-handed healthy adults (age range: 18–41 years). Band-limited power envelope correlations were performed within and across frequency bands (θ, α, β, and low γ) from a seed region placed in the left Broca’s area, using static orthogonalization as leakage correction. K-means clustering was used to segregate spatio-spectral clusters of resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC). Remarkably, unlike other RSNs, within-frequency long-range rsFC from the left Broca’s area was not driven by one main carrying frequency but was characterized by a specific spatio-spectral pattern segregated along the ventral (predominantly θ and α) and dorsal (β and low-γ bands) vLN streams. In contrast, spatial patterns of cross-frequency vLN functional integration were spectrally more widespread and involved multiple frequency bands. Moreover, the static intrinsic functional architecture of the neuromagnetic human vLN involved clearly left-hemisphere-dominant vLN interactions as well as cross-network interactions with the executive control network and postero-medial nodes of the DMN. Overall, this study highlighted the involvement of multiple modes of within and cross-frequency power envelope couplings at the basis of long-range electrophysiological vLN functional integration. As such, it lays the foundation for future works aimed at understanding the pathophysiology of language-related disorders.</p>

<p>It may seem useless to propose preventive measures for a disease without established pathogenesis and successful therapy, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). However, we will show that ALS shares essential molecular mechanisms with aging and that established anti-aging strategies, such as healthy diet or individually adjusted exercise, may be successfully applied to ameliorate the condition of ALS patients. These strategies might be applied for prevention if persons at ALS risk could be identified early enough. Recent research advances indicate that this may happen soon.</p>

<p>The human masticatory system is a complex functional unit characterized by a multitude of skeletal components, muscles, soft tissues, and teeth. Muscle activation dynamics cannot be directly measured on live human subjects due to ethical, safety, and accessibility limitations. Therefore, estimation of muscle activations and their resultant forces is a longstanding and active area of research. Reinforcement learning (RL) is an adaptive learning strategy which is inspired by the behavioral psychology and enables an agent to learn the dynamics of an unknown system via policy-driven explorations. The RL framework is a well-formulated closed-loop system where high capacity neural networks are trained with the feedback mechanism of rewards to learn relatively complex actuation patterns. In this work, we are building on a deep RL algorithm, known as the Soft Actor-Critic, to learn the inverse dynamics of a simulated masticatory system, i.e., learn the activation patterns that drive the jaw to its desired location. The outcome of the proposed training procedure is a parametric neural model which acts as the brain of the biomechanical system. We demonstrate the model's ability to navigate the feasible three-dimensional (3D) envelope of motion with sub-millimeter accuracies. We also introduce a performance analysis platform consisting of a set of quantitative metrics to assess the functionalities of a given simulated masticatory system. This platform assesses the range of motion, metabolic efficiency, the agility of motion, the symmetry of activations, and the accuracy of reaching the desired target positions. We demonstrate how the model learns more metabolically efficient policies by integrating a force regularization term in the RL reward. We also demonstrate the inverse correlation between the metabolic efficiency of the models and their agility and range of motion. The presented masticatory model and the proposed RL training mechanism are valuable tools for the analysis of mastication and other biomechanical systems. We see this framework's potential in facilitating the functional analyses aspects of surgical treatment planning and predicting the rehabilitation performance in post-operative subjects.</p>

<p>Background: Achieving clear visibility through a windshield is one of the crucial factors in manufacturing a safe and comfortable vehicle. The optic flow (OF) through the windshield has been reported to divert attention and could impair visibility. Although a growing number of behavioral and neuroimaging studies have assessed drivers’ attention in various driving scenarios, there is still little evidence of a relationship between OF, windshield shape, and driver’s attentional efficacy. The purpose of this research was to examine this relationship.</p><p>Methods: First, we quantified the OF across the windshield in a simulated driving scenario with either of two types of the windshield (a tilted or vertical pillar) at different speeds (60 km/h or 160 km/h) and found more upward OF along the tilted pillar than along the vertical pillar. Therefore, we hypothesized that the predominance of upward OF around the windshield along a tilted pillar could distract a driver and that we could observe the corresponding neural activity. Magnetic resonance scans were then obtained while the subjects performed a visual detection task while watching the driving scene used in the OF analysis. The subjects were required to press a button as rapidly as possible when a target appeared at one of five positions (leftmost, left, center, right, and rightmost).</p><p>Results: We found that the reaction time (RT) on exposure to a tilted pillar was longer than that on exposure to a vertical pillar in the leftmost and rightmost conditions. Furthermore, there was more brain activity in the precuneus when the pillar was tilted than when it was vertical in the rightmost condition near the pillar. In a separate analysis, activation in the precuneus was found to reflect relative changes in the amount of upward OF when the target was at the rightmost position.</p><p>Conclusions: Overall, these observations suggest that activation in the precuneus may reflect extraneous cognitive load driven by upward OF along the pillar and could distract visual attention. The findings of this study highlight the value of a cognitive neuroscientific approach to research and development in the motor vehicle manufacturing industry.</p>

<p>Sensorimotor communication is a form of communication instantiated through body movements that are guided by both instrumental, goal-directed intentions and communicative, social intentions. Depending on the social interaction context, sensorimotor communication can serve different functions. This article aims to disentangle three of these functions: (a) an informing function of body movements, to highlight action intentions for an observer; (b) a coordinating function of body movements, to facilitate real-time action prediction in joint action; and (c) a performing function of body movements, to elicit emotional or aesthetic experiences in an audience. We provide examples of research addressing these different functions as well as some influencing factors, relating to individual differences, task characteristics, and situational demands. The article concludes by discussing the benefits of a closer dialog between separate lines of research on sensorimotor communication across different social contexts.</p>

<p>There is debate in the literature regarding how single-digit arithmetic fluency is achieved over development. While the Fact-retrieval hypothesis suggests that with practice, children shift from quantity-based procedures to verbally retrieving arithmetic problems from long-term memory, the Schema-based hypothesis claims that problems are solved through quantity-based procedures and that practice leads to these procedures becoming more automatic. To test these hypotheses, a sample of 46 typically developing children underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) when they were 11 years old (time 1), and 2 years later (time 2). We independently defined regions of interest (ROIs) involved in verbal and quantity processing using rhyming and numerosity judgment localizer tasks, respectively. The verbal ROIs consisted of left middle/superior temporal gyri (MTG/STG) and left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), whereas the quantity ROIs consisted of bilateral inferior/superior parietal lobules (IPL/SPL) and bilateral middle frontal gyri (MFG)/right IFG. Participants also solved a single-digit subtraction task in the scanner. We defined the extent to which children relied on verbal vs. quantity mechanisms by selecting the 100 voxels showing maximal activation at time 1 from each ROI, separately for small and large subtractions. We studied the brain mechanisms at time 1 that predicted gains in subtraction fluency and how these mechanisms changed over time with improvement. When looking at brain activation at time 1, we found that improvers showed a larger neural problem size effect in bilateral parietal cortex, whereas no effects were found in verbal regions. Results also revealed that children who showed improvement in behavioral fluency for large subtraction problems showed decreased activation over time for large subtractions in both parietal and frontal regions implicated in quantity, whereas non-improvers maintained similar levels of activation. All children, regardless of improvement, showed decreased activation over time for large subtraction problems in verbal regions. The greater parietal problem size effect at time 1 and the reduction in activation over time for the improvers in parietal and frontal regions implicated in quantity processing is consistent with the Schema-based hypothesis arguing for more automatic procedures with increasing skill. The lack of a problem size effect at time 1 and the overall decrease in verbal regions, regardless of improvement, is inconsistent with the Fact-retrieval hypothesis.</p>

<p>Comprehending how the brain functions requires an understanding of the dynamics of neuronal assemblies. Previous work used a mean-field reduction method to determine the collective dynamics of a large heterogeneous network of uniformly and globally coupled theta neurons, which are a canonical formulation of Type I neurons. However, in modeling neuronal networks, it is unreasonable to assume that the coupling strength between every pair of neurons is identical. The goal in the present work is to analytically examine the collective macroscopic behavior of a network of theta neurons that is more realistic in that it includes heterogeneity in the coupling strength as well as in neuronal excitability. We consider the occurrence of dynamical structures that give rise to complicated dynamics via bifurcations of macroscopic collective quantities, concentrating on two biophysically relevant cases: (1) predominantly excitable neurons with mostly excitatory connections, and (2) predominantly spiking neurons with inhibitory connections. We find that increasing the synaptic diversity moves these dynamical structures to distant extremes of parameter space, leaving simple collective equilibrium states in the physiologically relevant region. We also study the node vs. focus nature of stable macroscopic equilibrium solutions and discuss our results in the context of recent literature.</p>

<p>The responses of many cortical neurons to visual stimuli are modulated by the position of the eye. This form of gain modulation by eye position does not change the retinotopic selectivity of the responses, but only changes the amplitude of the responses. Particularly in the case of cortical responses, this form of eye position gain modulation has been observed to be multiplicative. Multiplicative gain modulated responses are crucial to encode information that is relevant to high-level visual functions, such as stable spatial awareness, eye movement planning, visual-motor behaviors, and coordinate transformation. Here we first present a hardwired model of different functional forms of gain modulation, including peaked and monotonic modulation by eye position. We use a biologically realistic Gaussian function to model the influence of the position of the eye on the internal activation of visual neurons. Next we show how different functional forms of gain modulation by eye position may develop in a self-organizing neural network model of visual neurons. A further contribution of our work is the investigation of the influence of the width of the eye position tuning curve on the development of a variety of forms of eye position gain modulation. Our simulation results show how the width of the eye position tuning curve affects the development of different forms of gain modulation of visual responses by the position of the eye.</p>

<p>The search for drugs that can facilitate axonal regeneration and elongation following peripheral nerve injury has been an area of increasing interest in recent years. Epothilone B (EpoB) is an FDA-approved antineoplastic agent, which shows the capacity to induce α-tubulin polymerization and to improve the stability of microtubules. Recently, it has been increasingly recognized that EpoB has a regenerative effect in the central nervous system. However, the information currently available regarding the potential therapeutic effect of EpoB on peripheral nerve regeneration is limited. Here, we used a rat sciatic crush injury model system to determine that EpoB strikingly improved axonal regeneration and recovery of function. Also, EpoB (1 nM) did not result in significant apoptosis in Schwann cells (SCs) and showed little effect on their viability either. Interestingly, EpoB (1 nM) significantly enhanced migration in SCs, which was inhibited by autophagy inhibitors 3-methyladenine (3-MA). Since PI3K/Akt signaling has been implicated in regulating autophagy, we further examined the involvement of PI3K/Akt in the process of EpoB-induced SC migration. We found that EpoB (1 nM) significantly inhibited phosphorylation of PI3K and Akt in SCs. Further studies showed that both EpoB-enhanced migration and autophagy were increased/inhibited by inhibition/activation of PI3K/Akt signaling with LY294002 or IGF-1. In conclusion, EpoB can promote axonal regeneration following peripheral nerve injury by enhancing the migration of SCs, with this activity being controlled by PI3K/Akt signaling-mediated autophagy in SCs. This underscores the potential therapeutic value of EpoB in enhancing regeneration and functional recovery in cases of peripheral nerve injury.</p>

<p>Embryonic exposure to the teratogen nicotine results in brain defects, by disrupting endogenous spatial pre patterns necessary for normal brain size and patterning. Extending prior work in Xenopus laevis that showed that misexpression of ion channels can rescue morphogenesis, we demonstrate and characterize a novel aspect of developmental bioelectricity: channel-dependent repair signals propagate long-range across the embryo. We show that distal HCN2 channel misexpression and distal transplants of HCN2-expressing tissue, non-cell-autonomously reverse profound defects, rescuing brain anatomy, gene expression, and learning. Moreover, such rescue can be induced by small-molecule HCN2 channel activators, even with delayed treatment initiation. We present a simple, versatile computational model of bioelectrical signaling upstream of key patterning genes such as OTX2 and XBF1, which predicts long-range repair induced by ion channel activity, and experimentally validate the predictions of this model. Our results and quantitative model identify a powerful morphogenetic control mechanism that could be targeted by future regenerative medicine exploiting ion channel modulating drugs approved for human use.</p>

<p>The aim of this study is to explore functional and structural properties of abnormal brain networks associated with Parkinson’s disease (PD). <sup>18</sup>F-Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (<sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET) and T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging from 20 patients with moderate-stage PD and 20 age-matched healthy controls were acquired to identify disease-related patterns in functional and structural networks. Dual-modal images from another prospective subject of 15 PD patients were used as the validation group. Scaled Subprofile Modeling based on principal component analysis method was applied to determine disease-related patterns in both modalities, and brain connectome analysis based on graph theory was applied to verify these patterns. The results showed that the expressions of the metabolic and structural patterns in PD patients were significantly higher than healthy controls (PD1-HC, p = 0.0039, p = 0.0058; PD2-HC, p &lt; 0.001, p = 0.044). The metabolic pattern was characterized by relative increased metabolic activity in pallidothalamic, pons, putamen, and cerebellum, associated with metabolic decreased in parietal–occipital areas. The structural pattern was characterized by relative decreased gray matter (GM) volume in pons, transverse temporal gyrus, left cuneus, right superior occipital gyrus, and right superior parietal lobule, associated with preservation in GM volume in pallidum and putamen. In addition, both patterns were verified in the connectome analysis. The findings suggest that significant overlaps between metabolic and structural patterns provide new evidence for elucidating the neuropathological mechanisms of PD.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/58603">SARS-CoV-2 strategically mimics proteolytic activation of human ENaC</a></h4>

Molecular mimicry is an evolutionary strategy adopted by viruses to exploit the host cellular machinery. We report that SARS-CoV-2 has evolved a unique S1/S2 cleavage site, absent in any previous coronavirus sequenced, resulting in striking mimicry of an identical FURIN-cleavable peptide on the human epithelial sodium channel α-subunit (ENaC-α). Genetic alteration of ENaC-α causes aldosterone dysregulation in patients, highlighting that the FURIN site is critical for activation of ENaC. Single cell RNA-seq from 65 studies shows significant overlap between expression of ENaC-α and the viral receptor ACE2 in cell types linked to the cardiovascular-renal-pulmonary pathophysiology of COVID-19. Triangulating this cellular characterization with cleavage signatures of 178 proteases highlights proteolytic degeneracy wired into the SARS-CoV-2 lifecycle. Evolution of SARS-CoV-2 into a global pandemic may be driven in part by its targeted mimicry of ENaC-α, a protein critical for the homeostasis of airway surface liquid, whose misregulation is associated with respiratory conditions.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/57822">TANGO1 membrane helices create a lipid diffusion barrier at curved membranes</a></h4>

We have previously shown TANGO1 organises membranes at the interface of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and ERGIC/Golgi (Raote et al., 2018). TANGO1 corrals retrograde membranes at ER exit sites to create an export conduit. Here the retrograde membrane is, in itself, an anterograde carrier. This mode of forward transport necessitates a mechanism to prevent membrane mixing between ER and the retrograde membrane. TANGO1 has an unusual membrane helix organisation, composed of one membrane-spanning helix (TM) and another that penetrates the inner leaflet (IM). We have reconstituted these membrane helices in model membranes and shown that TM and IM together reduce the flow of lipids at a region of defined shape. We have also shown that the helices align TANGO1 around an ER exit site. We suggest this is a mechanism to prevent membrane mixing during TANGO1-mediated transfer of bulky secretory cargos from the ER to the ERGIC/Golgi via a tunnel.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/57578">A molecular filter for the cnidarian stinging response</a></h4>

All animals detect and integrate diverse environmental signals to mediate behavior. Cnidarians, including jellyfish and sea anemones, both detect and capture prey using stinging cells called nematocytes which fire a venom-covered barb via an unknown triggering mechanism. Here, we show that nematocytes from <i>Nematostella vectensis</i> use a specialized voltage-gated calcium channel (nCa<sub>V</sub>) to distinguish salient sensory cues and control the explosive discharge response. Adaptations in nCa<sub>V</sub> confer unusually sensitive, voltage-dependent inactivation to inhibit responses to non-prey signals, such as mechanical water turbulence. Prey-derived chemosensory signals are synaptically transmitted to acutely relieve nCa<sub>V</sub> inactivation, enabling mechanosensitive-triggered predatory attack. These findings reveal a molecular basis for the cnidarian stinging response and highlight general principles by which single proteins integrate diverse signals to elicit discrete animal behaviors.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/57410">Signaling diversity enabled by Rap1-regulated plasma membrane ERK with distinct temporal dynamics</a></h4>

A variety of different signals induce specific responses through a common, Extracellular-signal regulated kinase (ERK)-dependent cascade. It has been suggested that signaling specificity can be achieved through precise temporal regulation of ERK activity. Given the wide distrubtion of ERK susbtrates across different subcellular compartments, it is important to understand how ERK activity is temporally regulated at specific subcellular locations. To address this question, we have expanded the toolbox of Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET)-based ERK biosensors by creating a series of improved biosensors targeted to various subcellular regions via sequence specific motifs to measure spatiotemporal changes in ERK activity. Using these sensors, we showed that EGF induces sustained ERK activity near the plasma membrane in sharp contrast to the transient activity observed in the cytoplasm and nucleus. Furthermore, EGF-induced plasma membrane ERK activity involves Rap1, a noncanonical activator, and controls cell morphology and EGF-induced membrane protrusion dynamics. Our work strongly supports that spatial and temporal regulation of ERK activity is integrated to control signaling specificity from a single extracellular signal to multiple cellular processes.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/56817">Wnt/β-catenin signaling is an evolutionarily conserved determinant of chordate dorsal organizer</a></h4>

Deciphering the mechanisms of axis formation in amphioxus is a key step to understanding the evolution of chordate body plan. The current view is that Nodal signaling is the only factor promoting the dorsal axis specification in the amphioxus whereas Wnt/β-catenin signaling plays no role in this process. Here, we re-examined the role of Wnt/βcatenin signaling in the dorsal/ventral patterning of amphioxus embryo. We demonstrated that the spatial activity of Wnt/β-catenin signaling is located in presumptive dorsal cells from cleavage to gastrula stage, and provided functional evidence that Wnt/β-catenin signaling is necessary for the specification of dorsal cell fate in a stage-dependent manner. Microinjection of <i>Wnt8</i> and <i>Wnt11</i> mRNA induced ectopic dorsal axis in neurulae and larvae. Finally, we demonstrated that Nodal and Wnt/β-catenin signaling cooperate to promote the dorsal-specific gene expression in amphioxus gastrula. Our study reveals high evolutionary conservation of dorsal organizer formation in the chordate lineage.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/56371">Presynaptic APP levels and synaptic homeostasis are regulated by Akt phosphorylation of Huntingtin</a></h4>

Studies have suggested that amyloid precursor protein (APP) regulates synaptic homeostasis, but the evidence has not been consistent. In particular, signaling pathways controlling APP transport to the synapse in axons and dendrites remain to be identified. Having previously shown that Huntingtin (HTT), the scaffolding protein involved in Huntington's disease, regulates neuritic transport of APP, we used a microfluidic corticocortical neuronal network-on-a-chip to examine APP transport and localization to the pre- and post-synaptic compartments. We found that HTT, upon phosphorylation by the Ser/Thr kinase Akt, regulates APP transport in axons but not dendrites. Expression of an unphosphorylatable HTT decreased axonal anterograde transport of APP, reduced presynaptic APP levels, and increased synaptic density. Ablating <i>in vivo</i> HTT phosphorylation in APPPS1 mice, which overexpress APP, reduced presynaptic APP levels, restored synapse number and improved learning and memory. The Akt-HTT pathway and axonal transport of APP thus regulate APP presynaptic levels and synapse homeostasis.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/56345">Paranoia as a deficit in non-social belief updating</a></h4>

Paranoia is the belief that harm is intended by others. It may arise from selective pressures to infer and avoid social threats, particularly in ambiguous or changing circumstances. We propose that uncertainty may be sufficient to elicit learning differences in paranoid individuals, without social threat. We used reversal learning behavior and computational modeling to estimate belief updating across individuals with and without mental illness, online participants, and rats chronically exposed to methamphetamine, an elicitor of paranoia in humans. Paranoia is associated with a stronger prior on volatility, accompanied by elevated sensitivity to perceived changes in the task environment. Methamphetamine exposure in rats recapitulates this impaired uncertainty-driven belief updating and rigid anticipation of a volatile environment. Our work provides evidence of fundamental, domain-general learning differences in paranoid individuals. This paradigm enables further assessment of the interplay between uncertainty and belief-updating across individuals and species.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/55487">HIV efficiently infects T cells from the endometrium and remodels them to promote systemic viral spread</a></h4>

The female reproductive tract (FRT) is the most common site of infection during HIV transmission to women, but viral remodeling complicates characterization of cells targeted for infection. Here, we report extensive phenotypic analyses of HIV-infected endometrial cells by CyTOF, and use a ‘nearest neighbor’ bioinformatics approach to trace cells to their original pre-infection phenotypes. Like in blood, HIV preferentially targets memory CD4+ T cells in the endometrium, but these cells exhibit unique phenotypes and sustain much higher levels of infection. Genital cell remodeling by HIV includes downregulating TCR complex components and modulating chemokine receptor expression to promote dissemination of infected cells to lymphoid follicles. HIV also upregulates the anti-apoptotic protein BIRC5, which when blocked promotes death of infected endometrial cells. These results suggest that HIV remodels genital T cells to prolong viability and promote viral dissemination and that interfering with these processes might reduce the likelihood of systemic viral spread.

Junín virus (JUNV) is one of five New World mammarenaviruses (NWMs) that cause fatal hemorrhagic disease in humans and is the etiological agent of Argentine hemorrhagic fever (AHF). The pathogenesis underlying AHF is poorly understood; however, a prolonged, elevated interferon-a (IFN-a) response is associated with a negative disease outcome. A feature of all NWMs that cause viral hemorrhagic fever is the use of human transferrin receptor 1 (hTfR1) for cellular entry. Here, we show that mice expressing hTfR1 develop a lethal disease course marked by an increase in serum IFN-a concentration when challenged with JUNV. Further, we provide evidence that the type I IFN response is central to the development of severe JUNV disease in hTfR1 mice. Our findings identify TfR1-mediated entry and the type I IFN response as key factors in the pathogenesis of JUNV infection in mice.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/55252">Differences in reward biased spatial representations in the lateral septum and hippocampus</a></h4>

The lateral septum (LS), which is innervated by the hippocampus, is known to represent spatial information. However, the details of place representation in the LS, and whether this place information is combined with reward signaling, remains unknown. We simultaneously recorded from rat CA1 and caudodorsal lateral septum in rat during a rewarded navigation task and compared spatial firing in the two areas. While LS place cells are less numerous than in hippocampus, they are similar to the hippocampus in field size and number of fields per cell, but with field shape and center distributions that are more skewed towards reward. Spike cross-correlations between the hippocampus and LS are greatest for cells that have reward-proximate place fields, suggesting a role for the LS in relaying task-relevant hippocampal spatial information to downstream areas, such as the VTA.

Jacomin et al. show that Atg8a interacts with transcription factor Sequoia. Depletion of Sequoia induces autophagy through enhanced expression of autophagy genes. Atg8a also interacts with YL-1, a component of a nuclear acetyltransferase complex, and deacetylase Sir2. Sir2 deacetylates Atg8a during starvation to activate autophagy.

Through the use of Drosophila genetics and the excellent in vivo imaging possible in the fly embryo, Davidson and Wood demonstrate that macrophages switch from engulfing debris via sheet-like lamellipods (lamellipodial phagocytosis) to extending phagocytic filopods (filopodial phagocytosis) when spatially confined, thus maintaining their critical clearance function in vivo.

This study uses human-embryonic-stem-cell-derived definitive human blood progenitors to gain insight into the earliest events following leukemic oncogene expression. Nafria et al. show that induction of RUNX1-ETO expression rapidly reprograms chromatin, disrupts global RUNX1 binding, and arrests growth and/or differentiation specifically in early myeloid progenitor cells.

Jin et al. show that PKM2, a critical enzyme in glycolysis, regulates DC activation by integrating metabolic reprograming with essential gene expression. During DC activation, PKM2 tetramers are disrupted into monomers, leading to decreased enzymatic activity coupled with metabolic rewiring in glycolysis and increased nuclear translocation for Il12p35 expression.

Weisheit et al. show that deleterious on-target effects, such as large, mono-allelic deletions or loss of heterozygosity, are widespread in human iPSCs after CRISPR/Cas9 editing both via HDR and NHEJ. They describe simple, low-cost, and broadly applicable quantitative genomic PCR (qgPCR) and SNP genotyping-based tools to reliably identify such on-target effects.

Velazco-Cruz et al. characterize the role of SIX2 in stem cell differentiation to β cells. SIX2 expression is restricted to late-stage endocrine cells. Generation of β cells does not require SIX2, but lack of SIX2 impairs maturation, as assessed by glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, calcium flux, mitochondrial respiration, and gene expression.

Meiotic recombination is critical for genetic exchange and chiasmata generation. For this process, recombinases must localize to DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). Takemoto et al. identify 4930432K21Rik/BRME1 as a loader of recombinases (RAD51 and DMC1) onto DSB sites through the interaction with single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) binding proteins, BRCA2 and MEILB2/HSF2BP, during meiotic recombination.

In an in vivo CRISPR screen, Ramakrishnan et al. identify CXCR4 as a critical regulator of AML stem cells. Although the CXCR4 ligand CXCL12 is dispensable for leukemia development, CXCR4 signaling is essential for AML cells because it protects them from differentiation.

Flasse et al. show that the PCP protein VANGL is polarized both along the apico-basal and planar axis in pancreatic ductal cells. VANGL apical restriction rather than its planar polarization is required for progenitor survival. This discriminates the importance of apical tethering of a PCP protein from its planar polarization.

Local field potentials (LFPs) recorded intracranially display a range of location specific oscillatory spectra which have been related to cognitive processes. Although the exact mechanisms producing LFPs are not completely understood, it is likely that voltage-gated ion channels which produce action potentials and patterned discharges play a significant role. It is also known that antipsychotic drugs (APDs) affect LFPs spectra and a direct inhibitory effect on voltage-gated potassium (K_v) channels has been reported. Additionally, K_v channels have been implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, a disorder for which APDs are primary therapies. In this study we sought to: i) better characterise the effects of two APDs on LFPs and connectivity measures and ii) examine the effects of potassium channel modulators on LFPs and potential overlap of effects with APDs. Intracranial electrodes were implanted in the hippocampus (HIP) and pre-frontal cortex (PFC) of C57BL/6 mice; power spectra, coherence and phase-amplitude cross frequency coupling were measured. Drugs tested were the APDs haloperidol and clozapine as well as voltage-gated potassium channel modulators (KVMs) 4-aminopyridine(4AP), tetraethylammonium (TEA), E-4031 and retigabine. All drugs and vehicle controls were administered intraperitoneally. Both APDs and KVMs significantly reduced gamma power with the exception of 4AP, which conversely increased slow-gamma power. Clozapine and retigabine additionally reduced coherence between HIP and PFC. Phase-amplitude coupling between theta and gamma oscillations in HIP was significantly reduced by the administration of haloperidol and retigabine. These results provide previously undescribed effects of APDs on LFP properties and demonstrate novel modulation of LFP characteristics by KVMs that intriguingly overlaps with the effects of APDs. The possibility of a common mechanism of action deserves further study.

Acute caffeine intake can delay sleep initiation and reduce sleep intensity, particularly when consumed in the evening. However, it is not clear whether these sleep disturbances disappear when caffeine is continuously consumed during daytime, which is common for most coffee drinkers. To address this question, we investigated the sleep of twenty male young habitual caffeine consumers during a double-blind, randomized, crossover study including three 10-day conditions: caffeine (3 x 150 mg caffeine daily), withdrawal (3 x 150 mg caffeine for eight days, then switch to placebo), and placebo (3 x placebo daily). After nine days of continuous treatment, electroencephalographically (EEG)-derived sleep structure and intensity were recorded during a scheduled 8-h nighttime sleep episode starting 8 (caffeine condition) and 15 h (withdrawal condition) after the last caffeine intake. Upon scheduled wake up time, subjective sleep quality and caffeine withdrawal symptoms were assessed. Unexpectedly, neither polysomnography-derived total sleep time, sleep latency, sleep architecture, nor subjective sleep quality differed among placebo, caffeine, and withdrawal conditions. Nevertheless, EEG power density in the sigma frequencies (12-16 Hz) during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep was reduced in both caffeine and withdrawal conditions when compared to placebo. These results indicate that daily caffeine intake in the morning and afternoon hours does not strongly impair nighttime sleep structure or subjective sleep quality in healthy good sleepers who regularly consume caffeine. The reduced EEG power density in the sigma range might represent early signs of overnight withdrawal from the continuous presence of the stimulant during the day.

Recent studies provided novel insights into the meso-scale organization of the brain, highlighting the co-occurrence of different structures: classic assortative (modular), disassortative and core-periphery. However, the spectral properties of the brain meso-scale remain unexplored. To fill this knowledge gap, we investigated how this meso-scale structure is organized across the frequency domain. We analyzed the resting state activity of healthy participants with source-localized high-density electroencephalography signals. Then, we inferred the community structure using weighted stochastic block-modelling to capture the landscape of meso-scale structures across the frequency domain. Despite meso-scale modalities were mixed over the entire spectrum, we found a selective increase of disassortativity in the delta/theta bands, and of core-peripheriness in the low/high gamma bands. We observed, for the first time, that the brain at rest shows frequency-specific meso-scale organizations supporting spatially distributed and local information processing, shedding new light on how the brain coordinates information flow.

Serotonin (5-HT) affects multiple physiological processes in the brain and is involved in a number of psychiatric disorders. 5-HT axons reach all cortical areas; however, the precise mechanism by which 5-HT modulates cortical network activity is not yet fully understood. We investigated the effects of 5-HT on slow oscillations (SO), a synchronized cortical network activity universally present across species. SO are observed during slow-wave sleep and anesthesia and are considered the default cortical activity pattern. Combining opto- and pharmacogenetic manipulations with electrophysiological recordings, we discovered that 5-HT inhibits SO within the entorhinal cortex (EC) by activating somatostatin-expressing (Som) interneurons via the 5-HT2A receptor (5-HT2AR). This receptor is involved in the etiology of different psychiatric disorders and mediates the psychological effects of many psychoactive serotonergic drugs, suggesting that 5-HT targeting of Som interneurons may play an important role in these processes.

As animals carry out behaviors, particularly costly ones, they must constantly assess whether or not to persist in the behavior or quit. The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) has been shown to assess the value of behaviors and to be especially sensitive to physical effort costs. Complimentary to these functions, the insula is thought to represent the internal state of the animal including factors such as hunger, thirst, and fatigue. Utilizing a novel weight lifting task for rats, we characterized the local field potential (LFP) activity of the ACC and anterior insula (AI) during effort expenditure. In the task male rats are challenged to work for sucrose reward, which costs progressively more effort over time to obtain. Rats are able to quit the task at any point. We found modest shifts in LFP theta (7-9 Hz) activity as the task got progressively more difficult in terms of absolute effort expenditure. However, when the LFP data were analyzed based on the rat's relative progress towards quitting the task, or performance state, substantial shifts in LFP power in the theta and gamma (55-100 Hz) frequency bands were observed in ACC and AI. Both ACC and AI theta power decreased as the rats got closer to quitting, while ACC and AI gamma power increased. Furthermore, coherency between ACC and AI in the delta (2-4 Hz) range shifted alongside the rat's performance state. Overall we show that ACC and AI LFP activity changes are reflective of the rats' relative performance state in an effort-based task.

Complex cognitive functions such as working memory and decision-making require the maintenance of information over many timescales, from transient sensory stimuli to long-term contextual cues1. However, while theoretical accounts predict that a corresponding hierarchy of neuronal timescales likely emerges as a result of graded variations in recurrent synaptic excitation2-4, direct evidence in the human cortex is lacking. This limits our ability to study how other cytoarchitectural and cell-intrinsic features shape the temporal patterns of cortical activity5-7, and whether neuronal timescales are dynamic and relevant for human cognition. Here, we use a novel computational approach to infer neuronal timescales from intracranial recordings and construct a continuous gradient across the human cortex. We find that timescales increase along the principal sensorimotor-to-association axis7-9, where higher-order association areas have longer neuronal timescales. These measurements reflect transmembrane current fluctuations and scale with single-unit spiking timescales across the macaque cortex10. Cortex-wide transcriptomic analysis11-13 in humans confirms direct alignment between timescales and expression of excitation- and inhibition-related genes, but further identifies genes specifically related to voltage-gated transmembrane ion transporters. Finally, neuronal timescales are functionally dynamic: prefrontal cortex timescales expand during working memory maintenance and predict individual performance, while cortex-wide timescales compress with aging. Thus, neuronal timescales follow cytoarchitectonic gradients across the human cortex, and are relevant for cognition in both short- and long-terms, bridging microcircuit physiology with macroscale dynamics and behavior.

Although practicing a task generally benefits later performance on that same task (practice effect), there are large, and mostly unexplained, individual differences in reaping the benefits from practice. One promising avenue to model and predict such differences comes from recent research showing that brain networks can extract functional advantages from operating in the vicinity of criticality, a state in which brain network activity is more scale-free. As such, we hypothesized that individuals with more scale-free fMRI activity, indicated by BOLD time series with a higher Hurst exponent (H), gain more benefits from practice. In this study, participants practiced a test of working memory and attention, the dual n-back task (DNB), watched a video clip as a break, and then performed the DNB again, during MRI. To isolate the practice effect, we divided the participants into two groups based on improvement in performance from the first to second DNB task run. We identified regions and connections in which H and functional connectivity related to practice effects in the last run. More scale-free brain activity in these regions during the preceding runs (either first DNB or video) distinguished individuals who showed greater DNB performance improvements over time. In comparison, functional connectivity (r2) in the identified connections did not reliably classify the two groups in the preceding runs. Finally, we replicated both H and r2 results from study 1 in an independent fMRI dataset of participants performing multiple runs of another working memory and attention task (word completion). We conclude that the brain networks can accommodate further practice effects in individuals with higher scale-free BOLD activity.

The uptake of glutamate by astrocytes actively shapes synaptic transmission, however its role in the development and plasticity of neuronal circuits remains poorly understood. The astrocytic glutamate transporter, GLT1 is the predominant source of glutamate clearance in the adult mouse cortex. Here, we examined the structural and functional development of the visual cortex in GLT1 heterozygous (HET) mice using two-photon microscopy, immunohistochemistry and slice electrophysiology. We find that though eye-specific thalamic axonal segregation is intact, binocular refinement in the primary visual cortex is disrupted. Eye-specific responses to visual stimuli in GLT1 HET mice show a failure of binocular matching and abnormally high responses to ipsilateral stimuli resulting in a decreased ocular dominance index and a greater mismatch between preferred orientation to ipsilateral and contralateral eye stimulation. Furthermore, the balance of excitation and inhibition is dysregulated with an increase in somatostatin positive interneurons, decrease in parvalbumin positive interneurons, and increase in dendritic spine density in the basal dendrites of layer 2/3 excitatory neurons. Monocular deprivation induces atypical ocular dominance plasticity in GLT1 HET mice, with an unusual depression of ipsilateral open eye responses; however, this change in ipsilateral responses correlates well with an upregulation of GLT1 protein following monocular deprivation. These results demonstrate that a key function of astrocytic GLT1 function during development is the experience-dependent refinement of ipsilateral eye inputs relative to contralateral eye inputs in visual cortex.

It is debated whether training with a working memory (WM) task, particularly n-back, can improve general WM and reasoning skills. Most training studies found substantial improvement in the trained task, with little to no transfer to untrained tasks. We hypothesized that training does not increase WM capacity, but instead provides opportunities to develop an efficient task-specific strategy. We derived a strategy for the task that optimizes WM resources and taught it to participants. In two sessions, 14 participants who were taught this strategy performed as well as 14 participants who had trained for forty sessions without strategy instructions. To understand the mechanisms underlying the improvement of the no-instruction group, participants answered questionnaires during their training period. Their replies show that successful learners discovered the same strategy and improvement was associated with this discovery. We conclude that n-back training allows the discovery of strategies that enable better performance with the same WM resources.

We are constantly exposed to multiple visual scenes, and without intentional effort to memorize or encode them, only some are remembered. It has been suggested that such non-intentional memory is influenced by the depth of processing, but it is unclear whether this applies to visual images. Here we reasoned that bigger images may entail deeper level of processing and will thus be remembered better. In a series of image-viewing experiments we found that larger images were better remembered, image memorability was proportional to image size, faces were better remembered, and outdoors the least. While multiple factors affect image memorability, here we show that under incidental exposure without an encoding task, a basic physical image dimension plays an important role. These results could have significant implications to multiple domains as learning, education, aging, medical care and policies, transport and others.

Single-units were recorded in hippocampus, septum, and striatum while freely behaving rats (n=3) ran trials in a T-maze task, and rested in a holding bucket between trials. During periods of motor inactivity, SWRs triggered excitatory responses from 28% (64/226) and inhibitory responses from 14% (31/226) of septal neurons. By contrast, only 4% (14/378) of striatal neurons were excited and 6% (24/378) were inhibited during SWRs. In both structures, SWR-responsive neurons exhibited greater spike coherence with hippocampal theta rhythm than neurons that did not respond to SWRs. In septum, neurons that were excited by SWRs fired at late phases of the theta cycle, whereas neurons that were inhibited by SWRs fired at early phases of the theta cycle. By contrast, SWR-responsive striatal neurons did not show consistent phase preferences during the theta cycle. A subset of SWR-responsive neurons in septum (55/95) and striatum (26/38) behaved as speed cells, with firing rates that were positively or negatively modulated by the rat's running speed. In both structures, firing rates of most SWR-excited speed cells were positively modulated by running speed, whereas firing rates of most SWR-inhibited speed cells were negatively modulated by running speed. These findings are consistent with a growing body of evidence that SWRs can activate subcortical representations of motor actions in conjunction with hippocampal representations of places and states, which may be important for storing and retrieving values of state-action pairs during reinforcement learning and memory consolidation.

The issue of how perception and motor planning interact to generate a given choice between actions is a fundamental question in both psychology and neuroscience. Salinas and colleagues have developed a behavioral paradigm, the compelled-response task, where the signal that instructs the subject to make an eye movement is given before the cue that indicates which of two possible target choices is the correct one. When the cue is given rather late, the participant must guess and make an uninformed random choice. Perceptual performance can be tracked as a function of the amount of time during which sensory information is available. In Salina's accelerated race-to-threshold model, two variables race against each other to a threshold, at which a saccade is initiated. The source of random variability is in the initial state of information buildup across trials. This implies that incorrect decisions are due to the inertia of the racing variables that have, at the start, sampled a constant buildup in the "wrong" direction. Here we suggest an alternative, non-time-homogeneous two-stage-diffusion model that is able to predict both response time distributions and choice probabilities with a few easy-to-interpret parameters and without assuming cross-trial parameter variability. It is falsifiable at the level of qualitative features already, e.g. predicting bimodal RT distributions for particular gap times. It connects the compelled-response paradigm with an approach to decision making that has been uniquely successful in describing both behavioral and neural data in a variety of experimental settings for the last 40 years.

To understand how cells communicate in the nervous system, it is essential to define their secretome, which is challenging for primary cells because of large cell numbers being required. Here, we miniaturized secretome analysis by developing the high-performance secretome-protein-enrichment-with-click-sugars method (hiSPECS). To demonstrate its broad utility, hiSPECS was used to identify the secretory response of brain slices upon LPS-induced neuroinflammation and to establish the cell type-resolved mouse brain secretome resource using primary astrocytes, microglia, neurons and oligodendrocytes. This resource allowed mapping the cellular origin of CSF proteins and revealed that an unexpectedly high number of secreted proteins in vitro and in vivo are proteolytically-cleaved membrane protein ectodomains. Two examples are neuronally secreted ADAM22 and CD200, which we identified as substrates of the Alzheimer-linked protease BACE1. hiSPECS and the brain secretome resource can be widely exploited to systematically study protein secretion, brain function and to identify cell type-specific biomarkers for CNS diseases.

<p>Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) regulates cellular and synaptic properties in an activity‐dependent manner. Using unilateral cochlea removal as a method to deprive afferent input to the chicken cochlear neurons, we identified a persistent FMRP aggregation in a subset of neurons that undergo cell death.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Afferent activity dynamically regulates neuronal properties and connectivity in the central nervous system. The Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) is an RNA‐binding protein that regulates cellular and synaptic properties in an activity‐dependent manner. Whether and how FMRP level and localization are regulated by afferent input remains sparsely examined and how such regulation is associated with neuronal response to changes in sensory input is unknown. We characterized changes in FMRP level and localization in the chicken nucleus magnocellularis (NM), a primary cochlear nucleus, following afferent deprivation by unilateral cochlea removal. We observed rapid (within 2 hours) aggregation of FMRP immunoreactivity into large granular structures in a subset of deafferented NM neurons. Neurons that exhibited persistent FMRP aggregation at 12–24 hours eventually lost cytoplasmic Nissl substance, indicating cell death. A week later, FMRP expression in surviving neurons regained its homeostasis, with a slightly reduced immunostaining intensity and enhanced heterogeneity. Correlation analyses under the homeostatic status (7–14 days) revealed that neurons expressing relatively more FMRP had a higher capability of maintaining cell body size and ribosomal activity, as well as a better ability to detach inactive presynaptic terminals. Additionally, the intensity of an inhibitory postsynaptic protein, gephyrin, was reduced following deafferentation and was positively correlated with FMRP intensity, implicating an involvement of FMRP in synaptic dynamics in response to reduced afferent inputs. Collectively, this study demonstrates that afferent input regulates FMRP expression and localization in ways associated with multiple types of neuronal responses and synaptic rearrangements.</p>

<p>The central complex in the insect brain is a higher order integration center and plays an important role in spatial orientation. Honeybees are excellent models to study the neuronal basis of orientation, due to their excellent homing skills. Here we present a catalogue of neurons in the honeybee central complex.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The central complex (CX) in the insect brain is a higher order integration center that controls a number of behaviors, most prominently goal directed locomotion. The CX comprises the protocerebral bridge (PB), the upper division of the central body (CBU), the lower division of the central body (CBL), and the paired noduli (NO). Although spatial orientation has been extensively studied in honeybees at the behavioral level, most electrophysiological and anatomical analyses have been carried out in other insect species, leaving the morphology and physiology of neurons that constitute the CX in the honeybee mostly enigmatic. The goal of this study was to morphologically identify neuronal cell types of the CX in the honeybee <i>Apis mellifera </i>. By performing iontophoretic dye injections into the CX, we traced 16 subtypes of neuron that connect a subdivision of the CX with other regions in the bee's central brain, and eight subtypes that mainly interconnect different subdivisions of the CX. They establish extensive connections between the CX and the lateral complex, the superior protocerebrum and the posterior protocerebrum. Characterized neuron classes and subtypes are morphologically similar to those described in other insects, suggesting considerable conservation in the neural network relevant for orientation.</p>

<p>The accumulation of extracellular amyloid-beta (Aβ), denoted as senile plaques, and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (formed by hyperphosphorylated Tau protein) in the brain are two major neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The current and most accepted hypothesis proposes that the oligomerization of Aβ peptides triggers the polymerization and accumulation of amyloid, which leads to the senile plaques. Several strategies have been reported to target Aβ oligomerization/polymerization. Since it is thought that Aβ levels in the brain and peripheral blood maintain equilibrium, it has been hypothesized that enhancing peripheral clearance (by shifting this equilibrium towards the blood) might reduce Aβ levels in the brain, known as the sink effect. This process has been reported to be effective, showing a reduction in Aβ burden in the brain as a consequence of the peripheral reduction of Aβ levels. Nanoparticles (NPs) may have difficulty crossing the blood-brain barrier (BBB), initially due to their size. It is not clear whether particles in the range of 50–100 nm should be able to cross the BBB without being specifically modified for it. Despite the size limitation of crossing the BBB, several NP derivatives may be proposed as therapeutic tools. The purpose of this review is to summarize some therapeutic approaches based on nanoliposomes using two complementary examples: First, unilamellar nanoliposomes containing Aβ generic ligands, such as sphingolipids, gangliosides or curcumin, or some sphingolipid bound to the binding domain of ApoE; and second, nanoliposomes containing monoclonal antibodies against Aβ. Following similar rationale NPs of poly(lactide-co-glycolide)-poly (ethylene glycol) conjugated with curcumin-derivate (PLGA-PEG-B6/Cur) were reported to improve the spatial learning and memory capability of APP/PS1 mice, compared with native curcumin treatment. Also, some new nanostructures such as exosomes have been proposed as a putative therapeutic and prevention strategies of AD. Although the unquestionable interest of this issue is beyond the scope of this review article. The potential mechanisms and significance of nanoliposome therapies for AD, which are still are in clinical trials, will be discussed.</p>

<p>In the mature cochlea, each inner hair cell (IHC) is innervated by multiple spiral ganglion neurons of type I (SGNI). SGNIs are morphologically and electro-physiologically diverse. Also, they differ in their susceptibility to noise insult. However, the molecular underpinnings of their identity and physiological differences remain poorly understood. In this study, we developed a novel triple transgenic mouse, which enabled the isolation of pure populations of SGNIs and the analysis of a 96-gene panel via single-cell qPCR. We found three distinct populations of Type I SGNs, which were marked by their exclusive expression of Lmx1a, Slc4a4, or Mfap4/Fzd2, respectively, at postnatal days P3, P8, and P12. Our data suggest that afferent SGN subtypes are established genetically before the onset of hearing and that the expression of key physiological markers, such as ion channels, is heterogeneous and may be underlying the heterogeneous firing proprieties of SGNIs.</p>

<p>The most evident phenotype of degenerative motoneuron disease is the loss of motor function which accompanies motoneuron death. In both amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), it is now clear that dysfunction is not restricted to motoneurons but is manifest in the spinal circuits in which motoneurons are embedded. As mounting evidence shows that motoneurons possess more elaborate and extensive connections within the spinal cord than previously realized, it is necessary to consider the role of this circuitry and its dysfunction in the disease process. In this review article, we ask if the selective vulnerability of the different motoneuron types and the relative disease resistance of distinct motoneuron groups can be understood in terms of their intraspinal connections.</p>

<p>Muscle stem cells (MuSCs), known as satellite cells (SCs) have an incredible ability to regenerate, which enables the maintenance and growth of muscle tissue. In response to damaging stimuli, SCs are activated, proliferate, differentiate, and fuse to repair or generate a new muscle fiber. However, dystrophic muscles are characterized by poor muscle regeneration along with chronic inflammation and fibrosis. Indications for SC involvement in muscular dystrophy pathologies are accumulating, but their contribution to muscle pathophysiology is not precisely understood. In congenital muscular dystrophy type 1A (LAMA2-CMD), mutations in Lama2 gene cause either complete or partial absence in laminin-211 protein. Laminin-211 functions as a link between muscle extracellular matrix (ECM) and two adhesion systems in the sarcolemma; one is the well-known dystrophin–glycoprotein complex (DGC), and the second is the integrin complex. Because of its protein interactions and location, laminin-211 has a crucial role in muscle function and survival by maintaining sarcolemma integrity. In addition, laminin-211 is expressed in SCs and suggested to have a role in SC proliferation and differentiation. Downstream to the primary defect in laminin-211, several secondary genes and pathways accelerate disease mechanism, while at the same time there are unsuccessful attempts to regenerate as compensation for the dystrophic process. Lately, next-generation sequencing platforms have advanced our knowledge about the secondary events occurring in various diseases, elucidate the pathophysiology, and characterize new essential targets for development of new treatment strategies. This review will mainly focus on SC contribution to impaired regeneration in muscular dystrophies and specifically new findings suggesting SC involvement in LAMA2-CMD pathology.</p>

<p>Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) mutations are among the most significant genetic risk factors for developing late onset Parkinson’s disease (PD). To understand whether a therapeutic can modulate LRRK2 levels as a potential disease modifying strategy, it is important to have methods in place to measure the protein with high sensitivity and specificity. To date, LRRK2 measurements in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) have used extracellular vesicle enrichment via differential ultracentrifugation and western blot detection. Our goal was to develop a methodology which could be deployed in a clinical trial, therefore throughput, robustness and sensitivity were critical. To this end, we developed a Stable Isotope Standard Capture by Anti-peptide Antibody (SISCAPA) assay which is capable of detecting LRRK2 from 1 ml of human CSF. The assay uses a commercially available LRRK2 monoclonal antibody (N241A/34) and does not require extracellular vesicle enrichment steps. The assay includes stable isotope peptide addition which allows for absolute quantitation of LRRK2 protein. We determined that the assay performed adequately for CSF measurements and that blood contamination from traumatic lumbar puncture does not pose a serious analytical challenge. We then applied this technique to 106 CSF samples from the MJFF LRRK2 Cohort Consortium which includes healthy controls, sporadic PD patients and LRRK2 mutation carriers with and without PD. Of the 105 samples that had detectable LRRK2 signal, we found that the PD group with the G2019S LRRK2 mutation had significantly higher CSF LRRK2 levels compared to all other groups. We also found that CSF LRRK2 increased with the age of the participant. Taken together, this work represents a step forward in our ability to measure LRRK2 in a challenging matrix like CSF which has implications for current and future LRRK2 therapeutic clinical trials.</p>

<p>Background: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a rapidly progressive fatal neurodegenerative condition. There are no effective treatments. The only globally licensed medication, that prolongs life by 2–3 months, was approved by the FDA in 1995. One reason for the absence of effective treatments is disease heterogeneity noting that ALS is clinically heterogeneous and can be considered to exist on a neuropathological spectrum with frontotemporal dementia. Despite this significant clinical heterogeneity, protein misfolding has been identified as a unifying pathological feature in these cases. Based on this shared pathophysiology, we carried out a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the therapeutic efficacy of compounds that specifically target protein misfolding in preclinical studies of both ALS and FTD.</p><p>Methods: Three databases: (i) PubMed, (ii) MEDLINE, and (iii) EMBASE were searched. All studies comparing the effect of treatments targeting protein misfolding in pre-clinical ALS or FTD models to a control group were retrieved.</p><p>Results: Systematic review identified 70 pre-clinical studies investigating the effects of therapies targeting protein misfolding on survival. Meta-analysis revealed that targeting protein misfolding did significantly improve survival compared to untreated controls (p &lt; 0.001, df = 68, α = 0.05, CI 1.05–1.16), with no evidence of heterogeneity between studies (I<sup>2</sup> = 0%). Further subgroup analyses, evaluating the effect of timing of these interventions, showed that, only treating prior to symptom onset (n = 33), significantly improved survival (p &lt; 0.001, df = 31, α = 0.05, CI 1.08–1.29), although this likely reflects the inadequate sample size of later time points. Furthermore, arimoclomol was found to significantly reduce secondary outcome measures including: (i) histological outcomes, (ii) behavioral outcomes, and (iii) biochemical outcomes (p &lt; 0.005).</p><p>Conclusions: This analysis supports the hypothesis that protein misfolding plays an important role in the pathogenesis of ALS and FTD and that targeting protein misfolding, at least in pre-clinical models, can significantly improve survival, especially if such an intervention is administered prior to symptom onset.</p>

<p>It has been 15 years since the Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) gene was identified as the most common genetic cause for Parkinson’s disease (PD). The two most common mutations are the LRRK2-G2019S, located in the kinase domain, and the LRRK2-R1441C, located in the ROC-COR domain. While the LRRK2-G2019S mutation is associated with increased kinase activity, the LRRK2-R1441C exhibits a decreased GTPase activity and altered kinase activity. Multiple lines of evidence have linked the LRRK2 protein with a role in the autophagy pathway and with lysosomal activity in neurons. Neurons rely heavily on autophagy to recycle proteins and process cellular waste due to their post-mitotic state. Additionally, lysosomal activity decreases with age which can potentiate the accumulation of α-synuclein, the pathological hallmark of PD, and subsequently lead to the build-up of Lewy bodies (LBs) observed in this disorder. This review provides an up to date summary of the LRRK2 field to understand its physiological role in the autophagy pathway in neurons and related cells. Careful assessment of how LRRK2 participates in the regulation of phagophore and autophagosome formation, autophagosome and lysosome fusion, lysosomal maturation, maintenance of lysosomal pH and calcium levels, and lysosomal protein degradation are addressed. The autophagy pathway is a complex cellular process and due to the variety of LRRK2 models studied in the field, associated phenotypes have been reported to be seemingly conflicting. This review provides an in-depth discussion of different models to assess the normal and disease-associated role of the LRRK2 protein on autophagic function. Given the importance of the autophagy pathway in Parkinson’s pathogenesis it is particularly relevant to focus on the role of LRRK2 to discover novel therapeutic approaches that restore lysosomal protein degradation homeostasis.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00462">A Novel Quantitative Spasticity Evaluation Method Based on Surface Electromyogram Signals and Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System</a></h4>

<p>Stroke patients often suffer from spasticity. Before treatment of spasticity, there are often practical demands for objective and quantitative assessment of muscle spasticity. However, the common quantitative spasticity assessment method, the tonic stretch reflex threshold (TSRT), is time-consuming and complicated to implement due to the requirement of multiple passive stretches. To evaluate spasticity conveniently, a novel spasticity evaluation method based on surface electromyogram (sEMG) signals and adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system (i.e., the sEMG-ANFIS method) was presented in this paper. Eleven stroke patients with spasticity and four healthy subjects were recruited to participate in the experiment. During the experiment, the Modified Ashworth scale (MAS) scores of each subject was obtained and sEMG signals from four elbow flexors or extensors were collected from several times (4–5) repetitions of passive stretching. Four time-domain features (root mean square, the zero-cross rate, the wavelength and a 4th-order autoregressive model coefficient) and one frequency-domain feature (the mean power frequency) were extracted from the collected sEMG signals to reflect the spasticity information. Using the ANFIS classifier, excellent regression performance was achieved [mean accuracy = 0.96, mean root-mean-square error (RMSE) = 0.13], outperforming the classical TSRT method (accuracy = 0.88, RMSE = 0.28). The results showed that the sEMG-ANFIS method not only has higher accuracy but also is convenient to implement by requiring fewer repetitions (4–5) of passive stretches. The sEMG-ANFIS method can help stroke patients develop proper rehabilitation training programs and can potentially be used to provide therapeutic feedback for some new spasticity interventions, such as shockwave therapy and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00459">Estimation of Involuntary Components of Human Arm Impedance in Multi-Joint Movements via Feedback Jerk Isolation</a></h4>

<p>Stable and efficient coordination in physical human-robot interaction requires consideration of human feedback behavior. In unpredictable tasks, where voluntary cognitive feedback is too slow to guarantee desired task execution, the human must rely on involuntary intrinsic and reflexive feedback. The combined effects of these two feedback mechanisms and the inertial characteristics can be summarized in the involuntary impedance components. In this work, we present a method for the estimation of the involuntary impedance components of the human arm in multi-joint movements. We apply force perturbations to evoke feedback jerks that can be isolated using a high pass filter and limit the duration of the estimation interval to guarantee exclusion of voluntary cognitive feedback. Dynamic regressor representation of the rigid body dynamics of the arm and first order Taylor series expansion of the feedback behavior yield a model that is linear in the involuntary impedance components. The constant values of the inertial parameters are estimated in a static posture maintenance task and subsequently inserted to estimate the remaining components in a dynamic movement task. The method is validated with simulated data of a neuromechanical model of the human arm and its performance is compared to established methods from the literature. The results of the validation demonstrate superior estimation performance for moderate movement velocities, and less influence of the variability of the movements. The applicability to real data and the plausibility of the limited estimation interval are successfully demonstrated in an experiment with human participants.</p>

<p>Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) measures the functional activity of the cerebral cortex. The concentration changes of oxygenated (oxy-Hb) and deoxygenated hemoglobin (deoxy-Hb) can be detected and associated with activation of the cortex in the investigated area (neurovascular coupling). Recorded signals of hemodynamic responses may contain influences from physiological signals (systemic influences, physiological artifacts) which do not originate from the cerebral cortex activity. The physiological artifacts contain the blood pressure (BP), respiratory patterns, and the pulsation of the heart. In order to perform a comprehensive analysis of recorded fNIRS data, a proper correction of these physiological artifacts is necessary. This article introduces NICA – a novel toolbox for near-infrared spectroscopy calculations and analyses based on MATLAB. With NICA it is possible to process and visualize fNIRS data, including different signal processing methods for physiological artifact correction. The artifact correction methods used in this toolbox are common average reference (CAR), independent component analysis (ICA), and transfer function (TF) models. A practical example provides results from a study, where NICA was used for analyzing the measurement data, in order to demonstrate the signal processing steps and the physiological artifact correction. The toolbox was developed for fNIRS data recorded with the NIRScout 1624 measurement device and the corresponding recording software NIRStar.</p>

<p>Knowing the difference between left and right is generally assumed throughout the brain MRI research community. However, we note widespread occurrences of left-right orientation errors in MRI open database repositories where volumes have contained systematic left-right flips between subject EPIs and anatomicals, due to having incorrect or missing file header information. Here we present a simple method in AFNI for determining the consistency of left and right within a pair of acquired volumes for a particular subject; the presence of EPI-anatomical inconsistency, for example, is a sign that dataset header information likely requires correction. The method contains both a quantitative evaluation as well as a visualizable verification. We test the functionality using publicly available datasets. Left-right flipping is not immediately obvious in most cases, so we also present visualization methods for looking at this problem (and other potential problems), using examples from both FMRI and DTI datasets.</p>

<p>Every joint collaborative physical activity performed by a group of people, e.g., carrying a table, typically leads to the emergence of spatiotemporal coordination of individual motor behavior. Such interpersonal coordination can arise solely based on the observation of the partners' and/or the object's movements, without the presence of verbal communication. In this paper, we investigate how the social coupling between two individuals in a collaborative task translates into measured objective and subjective performance indicators recorded in two different studies. We analyse the trends in the dyadic interrelationship based on the information-theoretic measure of transfer entropy and identify emerging leader-follower roles. In our experimental paradigm, the actions of the pair of subjects are continuously and seamlessly fused, resulting in a joint control of an object simulated on a tablet computer. Subjects need to synchronize their movements with a 90° phase difference in order to keep the object (a ball) rotating precisely on a predefined circular or elliptic trajectory on a tablet device. Results demonstrate how the identification of causal dependencies in this social interaction task could reveal specific trends in human behavior and provide insights into the emergence of social sensorimotor contingencies.</p>

<p>Objective: This study evaluated cortical encoding of voice onset time (VOT) in quiet and noise, and their potential associations with the behavioral categorical perception of VOT in children with auditory neuropathy spectrum disorder (ANSD).</p><p>Design: Subjects were 11 children with ANSD ranging in age between 6.4 and 16.2 years. The stimulus was an /aba/-/apa/ vowel-consonant-vowel continuum comprising eight tokens with VOTs ranging from 0 ms (voiced endpoint) to 88 ms (voiceless endpoint). For speech in noise, speech tokens were mixed with the speech-shaped noise from the Hearing In Noise Test at a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of +5 dB. Speech-evoked auditory event-related potentials (ERPs) and behavioral categorization perception of VOT were measured in quiet in all subjects, and at an SNR of +5 dB in seven subjects. The stimuli were presented at 35 dB SL (re: pure tone average) or 115 dB SPL if this limit was less than 35 dB SL. In addition to the onset response, the auditory change complex (ACC) elicited by VOT was recorded in eight subjects.</p><p>Results: Speech evoked ERPs recorded in all subjects consisted of a vertex positive peak (i.e., P1), followed by a trough occurring approximately 100 ms later (i.e., N2). For results measured in quiet, there was no significant difference in categorical boundaries estimated using ERP measures and behavioral procedures. Categorical boundaries estimated in quiet using both ERP and behavioral measures closely correlated with the most-recently measured Phonetically Balanced Kindergarten (PBK) scores. Adding a competing background noise did not affect categorical boundaries estimated using either behavioral or ERP procedures in three subjects. For the other four subjects, categorical boundaries estimated in noise using behavioral measures were prolonged. However, adding background noise only increased categorical boundaries measured using ERPs in three out of these four subjects.</p><p>Conclusions: VCV continuum can be used to evaluate behavioral identification and the neural encoding of VOT in children with ANSD. In quiet, categorical boundaries of VOT estimated using behavioral measures and ERP recordings are closely associated with speech recognition performance in children with ANSD. Underlying mechanisms for excessive speech perception deficits in noise may vary for individual patients with ANSD.</p>

<p>Background: Unilateral spatial neglectis an attention disorder frequently occurring after a right-hemispheric stroke. Neglect results in a reduction in qualityof life and performance in activities of daily living. With current technical improvements in virtual reality (VR) technology, trainingwith stereoscopic head-mounted displays (HMD) has become a promising new approach for the assessment and the rehabilitation of neglect. The focus of this pilot study was to develop and evaluate a simple visual search task in VR for HMD. The VR system was tested regarding feasibility, acceptance, and potential adverse effects in healthy controls and right-hemispheric stroke patients with and without neglect.</p><p>Methods: The VR system consisted of two main components, a head-mounted display to present the virtual environment, and a hand-held controller for the interaction with the latter. The task followed the rationale of diagnostic paper-pencil cancellation tasks; i.e., the participants were asked to search targets among distractors. However, instead of a two-dimensional setup, the targets and distractors were arranged in three dimensions, in a sphere around the subject inside its field of view. Usability and acceptance of the task, as well as the performance in the latter, were tested in 15 right-hemispheric subacute stroke patients (10 of whom with and five of whom without unilateral spatial neglect; mean age: 67.1 ± 10.5 years) and 35 age-matched healthy controls.</p><p>Results: System usability and acceptance were rated as high both in stroke patients and healthy controls, close to the maximum score of the questionnaire scale. No relevant adverse effects occurred. There was a high correlation (r = 0.854, p = 0.002) between the Center of Cancellation [an objective neglect measure) calculated from a paper-pencil cancellation task (Sensitive Neglect Test (SNT)] and the newly developed VR cancellation task.</p><p>Conclusion: Overall, the developed visual search task in the tested VR system is feasible, well-accepted, enjoyable, and does not evoke any significant negative effects, both for healthy controls and for stroke patients. Findings for task performance show that the ability of the VR cancellation to detect neglect in stroke patients is similar to paper-pencil cancellation tasks.</p>

<p>Background: Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) have been proposed as a new therapeutic way to enhance the cognition of patients with dementia. However, serious methodological limitations appear to affect the estimates of their efficacy. We reviewed the stimulation parameters and methods of studies that used TMS or tDCS to alleviate the cognitive symptoms of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Moreover, we evaluated the risk of bias in these studies. Our aim was to highlight the current vulnerabilities of the field and to formulate recommendations on how to manage these issues when designing studies.</p><p>Methods: Electronic databases and citation searching were used to identify studies administering TMS or tDCS on patients with AD or MCI to enhance cognitive function. Data were extracted by one review author into summary tables with the supervision of the authors. The risk of bias analysis of randomized-controlled trials was conducted by two independent assessors with version 2 of the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomized trials.</p><p>Results: Overall, 36 trials were identified of which 23 randomized-controlled trials underwent a risk of bias assessment. More than 75% of randomized-controlled trials involved some levels of bias in at least one domain. Stimulation parameters were highly variable with some ranges of effectiveness emerging. Studies with low risk of bias indicated TMS to be potentially effective for patients with AD or MCI while questioned the efficacy of tDCS.</p><p>Conclusions: The presence and extent of methodical issues affecting TMS and tDCS research involving patients with AD and MCI were examined for the first time. The risk of bias frequently affected the domains of the randomization process and selection of the reported data while missing outcome was rare. Unclear reporting was present involving randomization, allocation concealment, and blinding. Methodological awareness can potentially reduce the high variability of the estimates regarding the effectiveness of TMS and tDCS. Studies with low risk of bias delineate a range within TMS parameters seem to be effective but question the efficacy of tDCS.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00177">A Mechanical Stimulation Glove to Induce Hebbian Plasticity at the Fingertip</a></h4>

<p>Repetitive sensory stimulation of the fingertip induces Hebbian plasticity in the sensorimotor cortex that benefits the tactile and motor behavior of the hand in healthy younger adults, older adults, and patients. To use this method outside the laboratory, robust and portable stimulation systems are needed that allow prolonged stimulation phases over several hours without compromising on signal intensity or personal mobility. Here, we introduce two stimulation gloves that apply finger- and frequency-specific mechanical stimulation to individual fingertips over prolonged periods. The stimulators are built into commercially available cotton gloves and apply stimulation either via loudspeaker membranes or via linear resonant actuators (LRAs). We tested the efficiency of both gloves to induce Hebbian plasticity in younger adults by using two established measures of tactile performance, the grating orientation task (GOT), and the two-point discrimination task (2PDT). Both tests were performed before and after 3 h of sensory finger stimulation using one of either glove system. As a control condition, a non-stimulated finger was tested in both tasks before and after stimulation. The results show no significant effect of sensory stimulation on GOT thresholds, but a significant decrease in the 2PDT thresholds after compared to before the training at the stimulated finger only. The loudspeaker membrane improved performance in the 2PDT in 10/16 participants, whereas the LRA improved performance in the 2PDT in 13/16 participants. Stimulation gloves with built-in modules may be used in future larger-scale cohort studies on sensorimotor plasticity, rehabilitation, and learning.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00159">Brain Metabolism During A Lower Extremity Voluntary Movement Task in Children With Spastic Cerebral Palsy</a></h4>

<p>Reduced selective voluntary motor control (SVMC) is a primary impairment due to corticospinal tract (CST) injury in spastic cerebral palsy (CP). There are few studies of brain metabolism in CP and none have examined brain metabolism during a motor task. Nine children with bilateral spastic CP [Age: 6-11 years, Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) Levels II–V] completed this study. SVMC was evaluated using Selective Control Assessment of the Lower Extremity (SCALE) ranging from 0 (absent) to 10 (normal). Brain metabolism was measured using positron emission tomography (PET) scanning in association with a selective ankle motor task. Whole brain activation maps as well as ROI averaged metabolic activity were correlated with SCALE scores. The contralateral sensorimotor and superior parietal cortex were positively correlated with SCALE scores (p &lt; 0.0005). In contrast, a negative correlation of metabolic activity with SCALE was found in the cerebellum (p &lt; 0.0005). Subsequent ROI analysis showed that both ipsilateral and contralateral cerebellar metabolism correlated with SCALE but the relationship for the ipsilateral cerebellum was stronger (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.80, p &lt; 0.001 vs. R<sup>2</sup> = 0.46, p = 0.045). Decreased cortical and increased cerebellar activation in children with less SVMC may be related to task difficulty, activation of new motor learning paradigms in the cerebellum and potential engagement of alternative motor systems when CSTs are focally damaged. These results support SCALE as a clinical correlate of neurological impairment.</p>

<p>Neuroendocrine circuits are orchestrated by the pituitary gland in response to hypothalamic hormone-releasing and inhibiting factors to generate an ultradian and/or circadian rhythm of hormone secretion. However, mechanisms that govern this rhythmicity are not fully understood. It has been shown that synaptic transmission in the rodent hypothalamus undergoes cyclical changes in parallel with rhythmic hormone secretion and a growing body of evidence suggests that rapid rewiring of hypothalamic neurons may be the source of these changes. For decades, structural synaptic studies have been utilizing electron microscopy, which provides the resolution suitable for visualizing synapses. However, the small field of view, limited specificity and manual analysis susceptible to bias fuel the search for a more quantitative approach. Here, we apply the fluorescence super-resolution microscopy approach direct Stochastic Optical Reconstruction Microscopy (dSTORM) to quantify and structurally characterize excitatory and inhibitory synapses that contact growth hormone-releasing-hormone (GHRH) neurons during peak and trough values of growth hormone (GH) concentration in mice. This approach relies on a three-color immunofluorescence staining of GHRH and pre- and post-synaptic markers, and a quantitative analysis with a Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) algorithm. With this method we confirm our previous findings, using electron microscopy, of increased excitatory synaptic input to GHRH neurons during peak levels of GH. Additionally, we find a shift in synapse numbers during low GH levels, where more inhibitory synaptic inputs are detected. Lastly, we utilize dSTORM to study novel aspects of synaptic structure. We show that more excitatory (but not inhibitory) pre-synaptic clusters associate with excitatory post-synaptic clusters during peaks of GH secretion and that the numbers of post-synaptic clusters increase during high hormone levels. The results presented here provide an opportunity to highlight dSTORM as a valuable quantitative approach to study synaptic structure in the neuroendocrine circuit. Importantly, our analysis of GH circuitry sheds light on the potential mechanism that drives ultradian changes in synaptic transmission and possibly aids in GH pulse generation in mice.</p>

Serum vitamin 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D], folate and cobalamin concentrations were measured at visits 1 (v<sub>1</sub>: 2004–2009) and 2 (v<sub>2</sub>: 2009–2013), while structural and diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging (sMRI/dMRI) outcomes were measured at v<sub>scan</sub>: 2011–2015.

<p>As a component of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), acupuncture has the potential to lower blood pressure (BP) in patients with hypertension. Emerging evidence indicates that the acupuncture-induced inhibition of high BP occurs through the activation of the pathway in the afferent, central, and efferent pathways. An increasing number of studies have demonstrated that acupuncture not only activates distinct brain regions under conditions of hypertension caused by an imbalance between the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems but also modulates neurotransmitters in related brain regions to alleviate the autonomic response. The activity of these pathways can be assessed by injecting agonists or inhibitors or by performing neurotomy. This review focuses on the clinical and mechanistic studies of acupuncture in modulating BP, which might provide a neurobiological foundation for the effects of acupuncture. Although many mechanisms underlying the effects of acupuncture on cardiovascular function have been identified, further investigation is warranted.</p>

<p>Biological aging is a complex process involving multiple biological processes. These can be understood theoretically though considering them as individual networks—e.g., epigenetic networks, cell-cell networks (such as astroglial networks), and population genetics. Mathematical modeling allows the combination of such networks so that they may be studied in unison, to better understand how the so-called “seven pillars of aging” combine and to generate hypothesis for treating aging as a condition at relatively early biological ages. In this review, we consider how recent progression in mathematical modeling can be utilized to investigate aging, particularly in, but not exclusive to, the context of degenerative neuronal disease. We also consider how the latest techniques for generating biomarker models for disease prediction, such as longitudinal analysis and parenclitic analysis can be applied to as both biomarker platforms for aging, as well as to better understand the inescapable condition. This review is written by a highly diverse and multi-disciplinary team of scientists from across the globe and calls for greater collaboration between diverse fields of research.</p>

Here, we report a new link between the spatial-memory and scene-perception systems of the human brain. Using fine-grained individual-subject fMRI, we describe three cortical areas, each lying immediately anterior to a region of the scene perception network, that are selectively activated when recalling familiar places. Network analyses show that these regions constitute a distinct functional network and interface with memory systems during naturalistic scene understanding. These regions may bridge perception and memory, supporting visually-guided navigation.

Disparity between current and desired information, known as information gap, is an important driver of information-seeking and curiosity. To gain insight into its neural basis, we recorded responses of single neurons in dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) while rhesus macaques performed a task that induces and quantifies demand for information. We find that enhanced firing rates in dACC before the start of a trial predict a stronger bias towards information-seeking choices. Following choices of uninformative options, firing rates are tonically enhanced until information is delivered. The level of enhancement observed is correlated on a trial-by-trial basis with the value assigned to the prospective information. Finally, variation in this tone is positively correlated with receptiveness to new information, as inferred by preference changes on subsequent trials. These patterns are not observed in a complementary dataset collected in orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), suggesting these effects reflect at least somewhat anatomically localized processing.

Sudoku is a popular leisure time activity that involves no math, but is based on logic based combinatorial number placement in a matrix. Many studies have been dedicated towards finding an algorithm to solve Sudoku but investigation of the neural substrates involved in Sudoku has been challenging. It is difficult to measure the brain activity during 9x9 Sudoku using traditional fMRI technique due to the procedural constraints. 16 optodes fNIRS (functional near infrared spectroscopy) forms an excellent alternative to study the activity of prefrontal cortex (PFC) during Sudoku task. Sudoku task was divided into two steps to understand the differential function of the PFC while applying heuristic rules. Classical two-way ANOVA as well as General Linear Model based approach was used to analyze the data. 28-noise free recording from right-handed participants revealed increased activity in all 16 optode locations during step 1 (3 x 3 subgrids) and step 2 (easy level 9x9 Sudoku) as compared to rest. Contrasting the step2-step1 revealed that medial regions of PFC were preferentially activated. These findings suggest the role of these regions, while applying multiple heuristic rules to solve 9x9 Sudoku puzzle.

The consolidation of motor memory is a non-linear temporal dynamic. There are critical time points at which post-training performance can improve (e.g., 30 min and 24 h) or merely stabilize (e.g., 4 h). Besides, neuronal plasticity is supported by synchronized oscillatory activity in and between brain areas at play during the acquisition and consolidation of motor skills. Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) can entrain cortical oscillatory activity, which may eventually modulate brain plasticity-related processes. Previous reports suggest that 20 Hz electrical stimulation over the primary motor cortex (M1) following training facilitates the consolidation of motor memories. To the best of our knowledge, the effect of tACS was not investigated when applied at critical post-training time points, nor its impact at longer time scales. In the present study, we investigated the effect of 20 Hz tACS applied over M1 within critical time periods (25min vs. 4h) on motor memory consolidation at immediate and delayed (24h) retrieval. Performance similarly evolved over time in all conditions, independently from the stimulation type (20 Hz tACS vs. Sham tACS) or the stimulation time point. As it stands, our results do not support the proposal that 20 Hz tACS exerts a positive, specific effect on the consolidation of motor memories.

BACKGROUND: Patients suffering from schizophrenia demonstrate abnormal brain activity, as well as alterations in patterns of functional connectivity assessed by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Previous studies in healthy participants suggest a strong association between resting-state functional connectivity and task-evoked brain activity that could be detected at an individual level, and show that brain activation in various tasks could be predicted from task-free fMRI scans. In the current study we aimed to predict brain activity in patients diagnosed with schizophrenia, using a prediction model based on healthy individuals exclusively. This offers novel insights regarding the interrelations between brain connectivity and activity in schizophrenia. METHODS: We generated a prediction model using a group of 80 healthy controls that performed the well-validated N-back task, and used it to predict individual variability in task-evoked brain activation in 20 patients diagnosed with schizophrenia. RESULTS: We demonstrated a successful prediction of individual variability in the task-evoked brain activation based on resting-state functional connectivity. The predictions were highly sensitive, reflected by high correlations between predicted and actual activation maps (Median=0.589,SD=0.193) and specific, evaluated by a Kolomogrov-Smirnov test (D=0.25,p&lt;0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: A Successful prediction of brain activity from resting-state functional connectivity highlights the strong coupling between the two. Moreover, our results support the notion that even though resting-state functional connectivity and task-evoked brain activity are frequently reported to be altered in schizophrenia, the relations between them remains unaffected. This may allow to generate task activity maps for clinical populations without the need the actually perform the task.

Neuropeptide melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) plays important roles in the brain including control of energy homeostasis, sleep, learning and memory. However, the synaptic and circuitry mechanisms underlying MCH-mediated regulations remain largely unknown. Here, we uncover that MCH modulates the hippocampo (HP)-dorsal lateral septum (dLS)-lateral hypothalamus neural circuit to facilitate spatial learning and memory. MCH achieves this function by enhancing both excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission via presynaptic mechanisms. The dLS neuronal spiking activity in response to HP CA3 excitatory inputs is strongly controlled by feed-forward inhibition (FFI) mediated by both GABAA and GABAB receptors. Endogenous MCH signaling enhances Signal/Noise (S/N) ratio of dLS neurons by increase the excitatory strengths, meanwhile decrease the overall dLS excitability by enhance inhibition which reduces dLS FFI, and consequentially enables dLS neurons to fire with high fidelity with HP synaptic inputs. Our data unravel the multifaceted synaptic mechanisms of MCH in the defined HP-dLS circuitry which may contribute to learning and memory.

Structure-function analyses of the mammalian brain have historically relied on anatomically-based approaches. In these investigations, physical, chemical, or electrolytic lesions of anatomical structures are applied, and the resulting behavioral or physiological responses assayed. An alternative approach is to focus on the expression pattern of a molecule whose function has been characterized and then use genetic intersectional methods to optogenetically or chemogenetically manipulate distinct circuits. We previously identified WIDE AWAKE (WAKE) in Drosophila, a clock output molecule that mediates the temporal regulation of sleep onset and sleep maintenance. More recently, we have studied the mouse homolog, mWAKE/ANKFN1, and found that its role in the circadian regulation of arousal is conserved. Here, we perform a systematic analysis of the expression pattern of mWake mRNA, protein, and cells throughout the adult mouse brain. We find that mWAKE labels neurons in a restricted, but distributed manner, in multiple regions of the hypothalamus (including the suprachiasmatic nucleus), the limbic system, sensory processing nuclei, and additional specific brainstem, subcortical, and cortical areas. Interestingly, mWAKE is also observed in non-neuronal ependymal cells. In addition, to describe the molecular identities and clustering of mWake+ cells, we provide detailed analyses of single cell RNA sequencing data from the hypothalamus, a region with particularly significant mWAKE expression. These findings lay the groundwork for future studies into the potential role of mWake+ cells in the rhythmic control of diverse behaviors and physiological processes.

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Compared to the upper limb, lower limb distal nerve transfer (DNT) outcomes are poor, likely due to the longer length of regeneration required. DNT surgery to treat foot drop entails rerouting a tibial nerve branch to the denervated common fibular nerve stump to reinnervate the tibialis anterior muscle to ankle dorsiflexion. Conditioning electrical stimulation (CES) prior to a nerve repair surgery accelerates nerve regeneration and promotes sensorimotor recovery. We hypothesize that CES prior to DNT will promote nerve regeneration to restore ankle dorsiflexion.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>One week following common fibular nerve crush, CES was delivered to the tibial nerve in half the animals and at two weeks, all animals received a DNT. To investigate the effects of CES on nerve regeneration, a series of kinetic, kinematic, skilled locomotion, electrophysiologic, and immunohistochemical outcomes were assessed. The effects of CES on the nerve were investigated.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>CES treated animals had significantly accelerated nerve regeneration (p&lt;0.001) and they had accelerated walking speed with improved skilled locomotion. The injured limb had greater vertical peak forces, with improved duty factor, near‐complete recovery of braking, propulsive forces and dorsiflexion (p&lt;0.01). Reinnervation of the tibialis anterior muscle was confirmed with nerve conduction studies and immunohistochemical analysis of the neuromuscular junction. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated that CES does not induce Wallerian degeneration nor does it cause macrophage infiltration of the distal tibial nerve.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Tibial nerve CES prior to DNT significantly improved functional recovery of the common fibular nerve and its muscle targets without inducing injury to the donor nerve.</p>

<p>Phosphatidylinositol‐4,5‐bisphosphate (PI‐4,5‐P2) is critical for synaptic vesicle docking and fusion and is generated by either the type 1 phosphatidylinositol‐4‐phosphate 5‐kinases (PI4P5Ks) or the type 2 phosphatidylinositol‐5‐phosphate 4‐kinases (PI5P4Ks). In this study, we describe the neuro‐anatomical localization of PI5P4Kα and PI5P4Kβ in the normal brain.  PI5P4Kβ is expressed in both oligodendrocytes and some neurons, while PI5P4Kα is expressed solely in neurons. By electron microscopy, both kinases are located in a peri‐synaptic distribution in axon terminals and dendritic spines, suggesting a role in neuro‐transmission, possibly through synaptic vesicle docking, recycling, and/or fusion.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Phosphatidylinositol‐4,5‐bisphosphate (PI‐4,5‐P<sub>2</sub>) is critical for synaptic vesicle docking and fusion and generation of the second messengers, diacylglycerol and inositol‐1,4,5‐trisphosphate. PI‐4,5‐P<sub>2</sub> can be generated by two families of kinases: type 1 phosphatidylinositol‐4‐phosphate 5‐kinases, encoded by PIP5K1A, PIP5K1B and PIP5K1C, and type 2 phosphatidylinositol‐5‐phosphate 4‐kinases, encoded by PIP4K2A, PIP4K2B, and PIP4K2C. While the roles of the type 1 enzymes in brain function have been extensively studied, the roles of the type 2 enzymes are poorly understood. Using selective antibodies validated by genetic deletion of pip4k2a or pip4k2b in mouse brain, we characterized the location of the enzymes, PI5P4Kα and PI5P4Kß, encoded by these genes. In mice, we demonstrate that PI5P4Kα is expressed in adulthood, whereas PI5P4Kß is expressed early in development. PI5P4Kα localizes to white matter tracts, especially the corpus callosum, and at a low level in neurons, while PI5P4Kß is expressed in neuronal populations, especially hippocampus and cortex. Dual labeling studies demonstrate that PI5P4Kα co‐localizes with the oligodendrocyte marker, Olig2, whereas PI5P4Kß co‐localizes with the neuronal marker, NeuN. Ultrastructural analysis demonstrates that both kinases are contained in axon terminals and dendritic spines adjacent to the synaptic membrane, which support a potential role in synaptic transmission. Immunoperoxidase analysis of macaque and human brain tissue demonstrate a conserved pattern for PI5P4Kα and PI5P4Kß. These results highlight the diverse cell‐autonomous expression of PI5P4Kα and PI5P4Kß and support further exploration into their role in synaptic function in the brain.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Combination of ischemia and β‐amyloid (Aβ) toxicity has been shown to simultaneously increase neuro‐inflammation, endogenous Aβ deposition, and neurodegeneration. However, studies on the evolution of infarct and panorama of cellular degeneration as a synergistic or overlapping mechanism between ischemia and Aβ toxicity are lacking. Here, we compared fluorojade B (FJB) and hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) stains primarily to examine the chronology of infarct, and the viability and morphological changes in neuroglia and neurons located in different brain regions on d1, d7 and d28 post Aβ toxicity and endothelin‐1 induced ischemia (ET1) in rats. We demonstrated a regional difference in cellular degeneration between cortex, corpus callosum, striatum, globus pallidus and thalamus after cerebral injury. Glial cells in the cortex and corpus callosum underwent delayed FJB staining from d7 to d28, but neurons in cortex disappeared within the first week of cerebral injury. Striatal lesion core and globus pallidus of Aβ+ET1 rats showed extensive degeneration of neuronal cells compared to ET1 rats alone starting from d1. Differential and exacerbated expressions of cyclooxygenase‐2 might be the cause of excessive neuronal demise in the striatum of Aβ+ET1 rats. Such an investigation may improve our understanding to identify and manipulate a critical therapeutic window post comorbid injury.</p>

Abstract
<p>Membrane voltage oscillations in layer 1 (L1) of primary sensory cortices might be important indicators of cortical gain control, attentional focusing, and signal integration. However, electric field recordings are hampered by the low seal resistance of electrodes close to the brain surface. To study L1 membrane voltage oscillations, we synthesized a new voltage-sensitive dye, di1-ANNINE (anellated hemicyanine)-6plus, that can diffuse into tissue. We applied it with a new surgery, leaving the dura intact but allowing injection of large quantities of staining solution, and imaged cortical membrane potential oscillations with two-photon microscopy depth-resolved (25–100 μm below dura) in anesthetized and awake mice. We found delta (0.5–4 Hz), theta (4–10 Hz), low beta (10–20 Hz), and low gamma (30–40 Hz) oscillations. All oscillations were stronger in awake animals. While the power of delta, theta, and low beta oscillations increased with depth, the power of low gamma was more constant throughout L1. These findings identify L1 as an important coordination hub for the dynamic binding process of neurons mediated by oscillations.</p>

Abstract
<p>Rett syndrome (RTT) is a severe, progressive X-linked neurodevelopmental disorder caused by mutations in the transcriptional regulator <i>MECP2</i>. We previously identified aberrant NF-B pathway upregulation in brains of <i>Mecp2</i>-null mice and demonstrated that genetically attenuating NF-B rescues some characteristic neuronal RTT phenotypes. These results raised the intriguing question of whether NF-B pathway inhibitors might provide a therapeutic avenue in RTT. Here, we investigate whether the known NF-B pathway inhibitor vitamin D ameliorates neuronal phenotypes in <i>Mecp2</i>-mutant mice. Vitamin D deficiency is prevalent among RTT patients, and we find that <i>Mecp2</i>-null mice similarly have significantly reduced 25(OH)D serum levels compared with wild-type littermates. We identify that vitamin D rescues aberrant NF-B pathway activation and reduced neurite outgrowth of <i>Mecp2</i> knock-down cortical neurons <i>in vitro</i>. Further, dietary supplementation with vitamin D in early symptomatic male <i>Mecp2</i> hemizygous null and female <i>Mecp2</i> heterozygous mice ameliorates reduced neocortical dendritic morphology and soma size phenotypes and modestly improves reduced lifespan of <i>Mecp2</i>-nulls. These results elucidate fundamental neurobiology of RTT and provide foundation that NF-B pathway inhibition might be a therapeutic target for RTT.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23213?af=R">The history of long‐term potentiation as a memory mechanism: Controversies, confirmation, and some lessons to remember</a></h4>

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The discovery of long‐term potentiation (LTP) provided the first, direct evidence for long‐lasting synaptic plasticity in the living brain. Consequently, LTP was proposed to serve as a mechanism for information storage among neurons, thus providing the basis for the behavioral and psychological phenomena of learning and long‐term memory formation. However, for several decades, the LTP‐memory hypothesis remained highly controversial, with inconsistent and contradictory evidence providing a barrier to its general acceptance. This review summarizes the history of these early debates, challenges, and experimental strategies (successful and unsuccessful) to establish a link between LTP and memory. Together, the empirical evidence, gathered over a period of about four decades, strongly suggests that LTP serves as one of the mechanisms affording learning and memory storage in neuronal circuits. Notably, this body of work also offers some important lessons that apply to the broader fields of behavioral and cognitive neuroscience. As such, the history of LTP as a learning mechanism provides valuable insights to neuroscientists exploring the relations between brain and psychological states.</p>

<p>The neurodiagnostic criteria of Leigh syndrome have not yet been clearly redefined based on the expanding of molecular etiologies. We aimed to analyze twenty years of clinical, genetic, and magnetic resonance studies from our Leigh syndrome cohort to provide a detailed description of central nervous system lesions in Leigh syndrome and their biological evolution in view of their genetic and clinical findings. Our study adds new neurodiagnostic insights to the current knowledge of Leigh syndrome, including association with overlapping syndromes, and the correlation of pathogenic genetic variants with neuroimaging phenotypes.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25788?af=R">Gut microbiome signatures of risk and prodromal markers of Parkinson's disease</a></h4>

<h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>Alterations of the gut microbiome in Parkinson's disease (PD) have been repeatedly demonstrated. However, little is known about whether such alterations precede disease onset and how they relate to risk and prodromal markers of PD. We investigated associations of these features with gut microbiome composition.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Established risk and prodromal markers of PD as well as factors related to diet/lifestyle, bowel function and medication were studied in relation to bacterial α−/β‐diversity, enterotypes, and differential abundance in stool samples of 666 elderly TREND study participants.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Among risk and prodromal markers, physical activity, occupational solvent exposure, and constipation showed associations with α‐diversity. Physical activity, sex, constipation, possible REM‐sleep behavior disorder (RBD), and smoking were associated with β‐diversity. Subthreshold parkinsonism and physical activity showed an interaction effect. Amongst other factors, age and urate‐lowering medication were associated with α‐ and β‐diversity. Physical inactivity and constipation were highest in individuals with the <i>Firmicutes </i>‐enriched enterotype. Constipation was lowest and subthreshold parkinsonism least frequent in individuals with the <i>Prevotella </i>‐enriched enterotype. Differentially abundant taxa were linked to constipation, physical activity, possible RBD, smoking, and subthreshold parkinsonism. Substantia nigra hyperechogenicity, olfactory loss, depression, orthostatic hypotension, urinary/erectile dysfunction, PD family history and the prodromal PD probability showed no significant microbiome associations.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Several risk and prodromal markers of PD are associated with gut microbiome composition. However, the impact of the gut microbiome on PD risk and potential microbiome‐dependent subtypes in the prodrome of PD need further investigation based on prospective clinical and (multi)omics data in incident PD cases.</p>

<p>Background: Patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD) show eye movement abnormalities and frequently complain about difficulties in reading. So far, it is unclear whether basal ganglia dysfunction or cognitive impairment has a greater impact on eye movements during reading.</p><p>Objective: To analyze eye movement behavior during a natural reading task with respect to cognitive state and dopaminergic therapy in PD and healthy controls.</p><p>Methods: Eye movements of 59 PD patients and 29 age- and education-matched healthy controls were recorded during mute, self-paced reading of a text. 25 cognitively normal PD patients performed the task additionally in off medication state. Clinical assessment included a comprehensive neuropsychological test battery and the motor section of MDS—Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS).</p><p>Results: PD-mild cognitive impairment (MCI) was diagnosed in 21 patients. Reading speed was significantly reduced in PD-MCI compared to healthy controls and PD patients without MCI due to higher numbers of progressive saccades. Cognitively intact PD patients showed no significant alterations of reading speed or eye movement pattern during reading. The fixation duration tended to be prolonged in PD compared to healthy controls and decreased significantly after levodopa intake. Scores for executive functions, attention, and language correlated with reading speed in the PD group.</p><p>Conclusion: The present study is the first to reveal (1) reduced reading speed with altered reading pattern in PD with MCI and (2) a relevant impact of levodopa on fixation duration during reading in PD. Further research is needed to determine whether therapeutic interventions, e.g., levodopa or neuropsychological training, improve the subjective reading experience for patients with PD.</p>

Author summary: Everything we do today is becoming more and more reliant on the use of computers. The field of biology is no exception; but most biologists receive little or no formal preparation for the increasingly computational aspects of their discipline. In consequence, informal training courses are often needed to plug the gaps; and the demand for such training is growing worldwide. To meet this demand, some training programs are being expanded, and new ones are being developed. Key to both scenarios is the creation of new course materials. Rather than starting from scratch, however, it’s sometimes possible to repurpose materials that already exist. Yet finding suitable materials online can be difficult: They’re often widely scattered across the internet or hidden in their home institutions, with no systematic way to find them. This is a common problem for all digital objects. The scientific community has attempted to address this issue by developing a set of rules (which have been called the Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable [FAIR] principles) to make such objects more findable and reusable. Here, we show how to apply these rules to help make training materials easier to find, (re)use, and adapt, for the benefit of all.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/XKbc_sdLRPQ" width="1" />

Abstract
<p>The aging brain is characterized by neural dedifferentiation, an apparent decrease in the functional selectivity of category-selective cortical regions. Age-related reductions in neural differentiation have been proposed to play a causal role in cognitive aging. Recent findings suggest, however, that age-related dedifferentiation is not equally evident for all stimulus categories and, additionally, that the relationship between neural differentiation and cognitive performance is not moderated by age. In light of these findings, in the present experiment, younger and older human adults (males and females) underwent fMRI as they studied words paired with images of scenes or faces before a subsequent memory task. Neural selectivity was measured in two scene-selective (parahippocampal place area (PPA) and retrosplenial cortex (RSC)] and two face-selective [fusiform face area (FFA) and occipital face area (OFA)] regions using both a univariate differentiation index and multivoxel pattern similarity analysis. Both methods provided highly convergent results, which revealed evidence of age-related reductions in neural dedifferentiation in scene-selective but not face-selective cortical regions. Additionally, neural differentiation in the PPA demonstrated a positive, age-invariant relationship with subsequent source memory performance (recall of the image category paired with each recognized test word). These findings extend prior findings suggesting that age-related neural dedifferentiation is not a ubiquitous phenomenon, and that the specificity of neural responses to scenes is predictive of subsequent memory performance independently of age.</p>

<p>Rhodopsin is mislocalized to the inner segment plasma membrane (IS PM) in various blinding disorders including autosomal-dominant retinitis pigmentosa caused by class I rhodopsin mutations. In these disorders, rhodopsin-laden microvesicles are secreted into the extracellular milieu by afflicted photoreceptor cells. Using a <i>Xenopus laevis</i> model expressing class I mutant rhodopsin or Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase (NKA) fused to Dendra2, we fluorescently labeled the microvesicles and found retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells are capable of engulfing microvesicles containing rhodopsin. A unique sorting mechanism allows class I mutant rhodopsin, but not NKA, to be packaged into the microvesicles. Under normal physiological conditions, NKA is not shed as microvesicles to the extracellular space, but is degraded intracellularly. Those studies provide novel insights into protein homeostasis in the photoreceptor IS PM.</p>

Abstract
<p>Glutamate transporters, particularly glutamate transporter 1 (GLT-1), help to prevent the adverse effects associated with glutamate toxicity by rapidly clearing glutamate from the extracellular space. Since GLT-1 expression and/or function are reduced in many neurodegenerative diseases, upregulation of GLT-1 is a favorable approach to treat the symptoms of these diseases. Ceftriaxone, a β-lactam antibiotic reported to increase GLT-1 expression, can exert neuroprotective effects in a variety of neurodegenerative diseases; however, many of these diseases do not exhibit uniform brain pathology. In contrast, as a drug that readily crosses the blood–brain barrier, ceftriaxone administration is likely to increase GLT-1 levels globally throughout the neuroaxis. In Huntington disease (HD), low GLT-1 expression is observed in the striatum in postmortem tissue and animal models. While ceftriaxone was reported to increase striatal GLT-1 and ameliorate the motor symptoms in a mouse model of HD, the extrastriatal effects of ceftriaxone in HD are unknown. Using electrophysiology and high-speed imaging of the glutamate biosensor iGluSnFR, we quantified real-time glutamate dynamics and synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus of the Q175FDN mouse model of HD, following intraperitoneal injections of either saline or ceftriaxone. We observed an activity-dependent increase in extracellular glutamate accumulation within the HD hippocampus, which was not the result of reduced GLT-1 expression. Surprisingly, ceftriaxone had little effect on glutamate clearance rates and negatively impacted synaptic plasticity. These data provide evidence for glutamate dysregulation in the HD hippocampus but also caution the use of ceftriaxone as a treatment for HD.</p>

Abstract
<p>Natural genetic variants of Neuregulin1 (NRG1) and its cognate receptor ErbB4 are associated with a risk for schizophrenia. Whereas most studies on NRG1-ErbB4 signaling have focused on GABAergic interneurons, ErbB4 is also expressed by midbrain dopaminergic neurons where it modulates extracellular dopamine (DA) levels. Here, we report that extracellular steady-state levels of DA are reduced in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC; –65%), hippocampus (–53%) and nucleus accumbens (NAc; –35%), but are elevated in the dorsal striatum (+25%) of ErbB4 knock-out mice (ErbB4 KOs) relative to wild-type controls. This pattern of DA imbalance recapitulates the reported prefrontal cortical reduction and striatal increase of DA levels in schizophrenia patients. Next, we report on a battery of behavioral tasks used to evaluate locomotor, cognitive and motivational behaviors in ErbB4 KOs relative to controls. We found that ErbB4 KOs are hyperactive in a novel open field but not in their familiar home cage, are more sensitive to amphetamine, perform poorly in the T-maze and novel object recognition (NOR) tasks, exhibit reduced spatial learning and memory on the Barnes maze, and perform markedly worse in conditioned place preference (CPP) tasks when associating cued-reward palatable food with location. However, we found that the poor performance of ErbB4 KOs in CPP are likely due to deficits in spatial memory, instead of reward seeking, as ErbB4 KOs are more motivated to work for palatable food rewards. Our findings indicate that ErbB4 signaling affects tonic DA levels and modulates a wide array of behavioral deficits relevant to psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia.</p>

Abstract
<p>Substance use disorders have a complex etiology. Genetics, the environment, and behavior all play a role in the initiation, escalation, and relapse of drug use. Recently, opioid use disorder has become a national health crisis. One aspect of opioid addiction that has yet to be fully examined is the effects of alterations of the microbiome and gut-brain axis signaling on central nervous system activity during opioid intoxication and withdrawal. The effect of microbiome depletion on the activation of neuronal ensembles was measured by detecting Fos-positive (Fos+) neuron activation during intoxication and withdrawal using a rat model of oxycodone dependence. Daily oxycodone administration (2 mg/kg) increased pain thresholds and increased Fos+ neurons in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) during intoxication, with a decrease in pain thresholds and increase in Fos+ neurons in the periaqueductal gray (PAG), central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA), locus coeruleus (LC), paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (PVT), agranular insular cortex (AI), bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), and lateral habenula medial parvocellular region during withdrawal. Microbiome depletion produced widespread but region- and state-specific changes in neuronal ensemble activation. Oxycodone intoxication and withdrawal also increased functional connectivity among brain regions. Microbiome depletion resulted in a decorrelation of this functional network. These data indicate that microbiome depletion by antibiotics produces widespread changes in the recruitment of neuronal ensembles that are activated by oxycodone intoxication and withdrawal, suggesting that the gut microbiome may play a role in opioid use and dependence. Future studies are needed to better understand the molecular, neurobiological, and behavioral effects of microbiome depletion on addiction-like behaviors.</p>

Abstract
<p>As they interact with their environment and encounter challenges, animals adjust their behavior on a moment-to-moment basis to maintain task fitness. This dynamic process of adaptive motor control occurs in the nervous system, but an understanding of the biomechanics of the body is essential to properly interpret the behavioral outcomes. To study how animals respond to changing task conditions, we used a model system in which the functional roles of identified neurons and the relevant biomechanics are well understood and can be studied in intact behaving animals: feeding in the marine mollusc <i>Aplysia</i>. We monitored the motor neuronal output of the feeding circuitry as intact animals fed on uniform food stimuli under unloaded and loaded conditions, and we measured the force of retraction during loaded swallows. We observed a previously undescribed pattern of force generation, which can be explained within the appropriate biomechanical context by the activity of just a few key, identified motor neurons. We show that, when encountering load, animals recruit identified retractor muscle motor neurons for longer and at higher frequency to increase retraction force duration. Our results identify a mode by which animals robustly adjust behavior to their environment, which is experimentally tractable to further mechanistic investigation.</p>

Abstract
<p>Action video gaming can promote neural plasticity. Short-term monocular patching drives neural plasticity in the visual system of human adults. For instance, short-term monocular patching of 0.5–5 h briefly enhances the patched eye’s contribution in binocular vision (i.e., short-term ocular dominance plasticity). In this study, we investigate whether action video gaming can influence this plasticity in adults with normal vision. We measured participants’ eye dominance using a binocular phase combination task before and after 2.5 h of monocular patching. Participants were asked to play action video games, watch action video game movies, or play non-action video games during the period of monocular patching. We found that participants’ change of ocular dominance after monocular patching was not significantly different either for playing action video games versus watching action video game movies (Comparison 1) or for playing action video games versus playing non-action video games (Comparison 2). These results suggest that action video gaming does not either boost or eliminate short-term ocular dominance plasticity, and that the neural site for this type of plasticity might be in the early visual pathway.</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Non‐rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep is supposed to play a key role in long‐term memory consolidation transferring information from hippocampus to neocortex. However, sleep also activates epileptic activities in medial temporal regions. This study investigated whether interictal hippocampal spikes during sleep would impair long‐term memory consolidation.</p>


<h2>Method</h2>
<p>We prospectively measured visual and verbal memory performance in 20 patients with epilepsy investigated with stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) at immediate, 30‐minute, and 1‐week delays, and studied the correlations between interictal hippocampal spike frequency during waking and the first cycle of NREM sleep and memory performance, taking into account the number of seizures occurring during the consolidation period and other possible confounding factors, such as age and epilepsy duration.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Retention of verbal memory over 1 week was negatively correlated with hippocampal spike frequency during sleep, whereas no significant correlation was found with hippocampal interictal spikes during waking. No significant result was found for visual memory. Regression tree analysis showed that the number of seizures was the first factor that impaired the verbal memory retention between 30 minutes and 1 week. When the number of seizures was below 5, spike frequency during sleep higher than 13 minutes was associated with impaired memory retention over 1 week.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our results show that activation of interictal spikes in the hippocampus during sleep and seizures specifically impair long‐term memory consolidation. We hypothesize that hippocampal interictal spikes during sleep interrupt hippocampal‐neocortical transfer of information. <b>ANN NEUROL 2020;87:976–987 </b></p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The pathology of frontotemporal dementia, termed frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), is characterized by distinct molecular classes of aggregated proteins, the most common being TAR DNA‐binding protein‐43 (TDP‐43), tau, and fused in sarcoma (FUS). With a few exceptions, it is currently not possible to predict the underlying pathology based on the clinical syndrome. In this study, we set out to investigate the relationship between pathological and clinical presentation at single symptom level, including neuropsychiatric features.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>The presence or absence of symptoms from the current clinical guidelines, together with neuropsychiatric features, such as hallucinations and delusions, were scored and compared across pathological groups in a cohort of 150 brain donors.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Our cohort consisted of 68.6% FTLD donors (35.3% TDP‐43, 28% tau, and 5.3% FUS) and 31.3% non‐FTLD donors with a clinical diagnosis of frontotemporal dementia and a different pathological substrate, such as Alzheimer's disease (23%). The presence of hyperorality points to FTLD rather than non‐FTLD pathology (<i>p </i> &lt; 0.001). Within the FTLD group, hallucinations in the initial years of the disease were related to TDP‐43 pathology (<i>p </i> = 0.02), including but not limited to chromosome 9 open reading frame 72 (<i>C9orf72 </i>) repeat expansion carriers. The presence of perseverative or compulsive behavior was more common in the TDP‐B and TDP‐C histotypes (<i>p </i> = 0.002).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our findings indicate that neuropsychiatric features are common in FTLD and form an important indicator of underlying pathology. In order to allow better inclusion of patients in targeted molecular trials, the routine evaluation of patients with frontotemporal dementia should include the presence and nature of neuropsychiatric symptoms. <b>ANN NEUROL 2020;87:950–961 </b></p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Therapeutic development in progressive multiple sclerosis (PMS) has been hampered by a lack of reliable biomarkers to monitor neurodegeneration. Optical coherence tomography (OCT)‐derived retinal measures have been proposed as promising biomarkers to fulfill this role. However, it is unclear whether retinal atrophy persists in PMS, exceeds normal aging, or can be distinguished from relapsing–remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS).</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>178 RRMS, 186 PMS, and 66 control participants were followed with serial OCT for a median follow‐up of 3.7 years.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The estimated proportion of peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (pRNFL) and macular ganglion cell + inner plexiform layer (GCIPL) thinning in multiple sclerosis (MS) attributable to normal aging increased from 42.7% and 16.7% respectively at age 25 years, to 83.7% and 81.1% at age 65 years. However, independent of age, PMS was associated with faster pRNFL (−0.34 ± 0.09%/yr, <i>p </i> &lt; 0.001) and GCIPL (−0.27 ± 0.07%/yr, <i>p </i> &lt; 0.001) thinning, as compared to RRMS. In both MS and controls, higher baseline age was associated with faster inner nuclear layer (INL) and outer nuclear layer (ONL) thinning. INL and ONL thinning were independently faster in PMS, as compared to controls (INL:−0.09 ± 0.04%/yr, <i>p </i> = 0.03; ONL:−0.12 ± 0.06%/yr, <i>p </i> = 0.04), and RRMS (INL:−0.10 ± 0.04%/yr, <i>p </i> = 0.01; ONL:−0.13 ± 0.05%/yr, <i>p </i> = 0.01), whereas they were similar in RRMS and controls. Unlike RRMS, disease‐modifying therapies (DMTs) did not impact rates of retinal layer atrophy in PMS.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>PMS is associated with faster retinal atrophy independent of age. INL and ONL measures may be novel biomarkers of neurodegeneration in PMS that appear to be unaffected by conventional DMTs. The effects of aging on rates of retinal layer atrophy should be considered in clinical trials incorporating OCT outcomes. <b>ANN NEUROL 2020;87:885–896 </b></p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN‐DBS) in Parkinson's disease (PD) not only stimulates focal target structures but also affects distributed brain networks. The impact this network modulation has on non‐motor DBS effects is not well‐characterized. By focusing on the affective domain, we systematically investigate the impact of electrode placement and associated structural connectivity on changes in depressive symptoms following STN‐DBS, which have been reported to improve, worsen, or remain unchanged.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Depressive symptoms before and after STN‐DBS surgery were documented in 116 patients with PD from 3 DBS centers (Berlin, Queensland, and Cologne). Based on individual electrode reconstructions, the volumes of tissue activated (VTAs) were estimated and combined with normative connectome data to identify structural connections passing through VTAs. Berlin and Queensland cohorts formed a training and cross‐validation dataset used to identify structural connectivity explaining change in depressive symptoms. The Cologne data served as the test‐set for which depressive symptom change was predicted.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Structural connectivity was linked to depressive symptom change under STN‐DBS. An optimal connectivity map trained on the Berlin cohort could predict changes in depressive symptoms in Queensland patients and vice versa. Furthermore, the joint training‐set map predicted changes in depressive symptoms in the independent test‐set. Worsening of depressive symptoms was associated with left prefrontal connectivity.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Fibers connecting the electrode with left prefrontal areas were associated with worsening of depressive symptoms. Our results suggest that for the left STN‐DBS lead, placement impacting fibers to left prefrontal areas should be avoided to maximize improvement of depressive symptoms. <b>ANN NEUROL 2020;87:962–975 </b></p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Cortical spreading depression (CSD) underlies the neurobiology of migraine with aura (MWA).</p>
<p>Animal studies reveal networks of microvessels linking brain–meninges–bone marrow. CSD activates the trigeminovascular system, evoking a meningeal inflammatory response. Accordingly, this study examines the upregulation of an inflammatory marker in extra‐axial tissues in migraine with visual aura.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We used simultaneously acquired <sup>11</sup>C‐PBR28 positron emission tomography/magnetic resonance imaging data of 18kDa translocator protein (an inflammatory marker) in MWA patients (n = 11) who experienced headaches and visual aura in the preceding month. We measured mean tracer uptake (standardized uptake value ratio [SUVR]) in 4 regions of interest comprising the meninges plus the adjacent overlying skull bone (parameningeal tissues [PMT]). These data were compared to healthy controls and patients with pain (chronic low back pain).</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>MWA had significantly higher mean SUVR in PMT overlying occipital cortex than both other groups, although not in the PMT overlying 3 other cortical areas. A positive correlation was also found between the number of visual auras and tracer uptake in occipital PMT.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>A strong persistent extra‐axial inflammatory signal was found in meninges and calvarial bone overlying the occipital lobe in migraine with visual auras. Our findings are reminiscent of CSD‐induced meningeal inflammation and provide the first imaging evidence implicating inflammation in the pathophysiology of migraine meningeal symptoms. We suspect that this inflammatory focus results from a signal that migrates from underlying brain and if so, may implicate newly discovered bridging vessels that crosstalk between brain and skull marrow, a finding of potential relevance to migraine and other neuroinflammatory brain disorders. <b>ANN NEUROL 2020;87:939–949 </b></p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To explore the prevalence of the perfusion‐weighted imaging (PWI)–diffusion‐weighted imaging (DWI) mismatch and response to intravenous thrombolysis in the WAKE‐UP trial.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We performed a prespecified post hoc analysis of ischemic stroke patients screened for DWI–fluid‐attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) mismatch in WAKE‐UP who underwent PWI. We defined PWI‐DWI mismatch as ischemic core volume &lt; 70ml, mismatch volume &gt; 10ml, and mismatch ratio &gt; 1.2. Primary efficacy end point was a modified Rankin Scale score of 0–1 at 90 days, adjusted for age and symptom severity.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Of 1,362 magnetic resonance imaging–screened patients, 431 underwent PWI. Of these, 57 (13%) had a double mismatch, 151 (35%) only a DWI‐FLAIR mismatch, and 54 (13%) only a PWI‐DWI mismatch. DWI‐FLAIR mismatch was more prevalent than PWI‐DWI mismatch (48%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 43–53% vs 26%, 95% CI = 22–30%; <i>p </i> &lt; 0.0001). Screening for either one of the mismatch profiles resulted in a yield of 61% (95% CI = 56–65%). Prevalence of PWI‐DWI mismatch was similar in patients with (27%) or without (24%) DWI‐FLAIR mismatch (<i>p </i> = 0.52). In an exploratory analysis in the small subgroup of 208 randomized patients with PWI, PWI‐DWI mismatch status did not modify the treatment response (<i>p </i> for interaction = 0.73).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Evaluating both the DWI‐FLAIR and PWI‐DWI mismatch patterns in patients with unknown time of stroke onset will result in the highest yield of thrombolysis treatment. The treatment benefit of alteplase in patients with a DWI‐FLAIR mismatch seems to be driven not merely by the presence of a PWI‐DWI mismatch, although this analysis was underpowered. <b>ANN NEUROL 2020;87:931–938 </b></p>

<p>Increasing evidence from animal and human studies indicate that exposure to nicotine during development, separated from the effects of smoking tobacco, can contribute to dysregulation of brain development including behavioral deficits. An RNAseq study of human fetal cerebral cortex demonstrated that 9 out of 16 genes for human nicotinic acetylcholine (ACh) receptor subunits are selectively expressed between 7.5 and 12 post-conceptional weeks (PCW). The most highly expressed subunit genes were CHNRA4 and CHNRB2, whose protein products combine to form the most ubiquitous functional receptor isoform expressed in the adult brain. They exhibited correlated expression in both RNAseq samples, and in tissue sections by in situ hybridization. Co-localization studies with other cortical markers suggest they are pre-dominantly expressed by post-mitotic glutamatergic neuron pre-cursors in both cortical plate and pre-subplate, rather than cortical progenitor cells or GABAergic interneuron pre-cursors. However, GABAergic interneuron progenitor cells in the ganglionic eminences do express these sub-units. CHNRA5 also showed moderate levels of expression and again favored post-mitotic neurons. Other subunits, e.g., CHRNA7, exhibited low but detectable levels of expression. CHRN genes found not to be expressed included genes for subunits usually considered muscle specific, e.g., CHNRA1, although some muscle specific gene expression was detected, for instance CHNRB1. Although there is little or no synthesis of acetylcholine by intrinsic cortical neurons, cholinergic fibers from basal forebrain innervate the cerebral cortex from 12 PCW at the latest. Acetylcholine may have a paracrine effect on radially migrating cortical neurons and GABAergic interneuron progenitors.</p>

<p>Background: We aimed to identify the functional brain networks involved in the regulation of visual accommodation by contrasting the cortical functional areas evoked by foveal fixation to an “E” target, which were subservient to the accommodation responses to a -3/-6 diopter stimulus.</p><p>Methods: Neural activity was assessed in healthy volunteers by changes in blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signals measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Twenty-five right-handed subjects viewed the “E” target presented in a hierarchical block design. They participated in two monocular tasks: (i) sustained foveal fixation upon an “E” target on a white background at 33 cm (-3.03D accommodative demand); and (ii) sustained fixation through an attached -3D concave lens (-6D accommodative demand) in front of the fixated eye; each condition cycled through a standard alternating 30-s eye open/30-s eye closed design to provide the BOLD contrast. The total sustained period was 480 s.</p><p>Results: The contrast between the -3D and the rest condition revealed activation in the occipital lobe (Lingual gyrus, Cuneus, Calcarine_L, and Calcarine_R); cerebellum (Cerebellum_Crus1_L and Cerebellum_6_L); precentral lobe (Precentral_R); frontal lobe (Frontal_Inf_Oper_R and Frontal_Mid_R); and cingulate cortex (Cingulum_Ant_L). With the -3D concave lenses (-6D accommodative demand) in front of the fixated eye, the voxel size and peak intensity of activation in the occipital lobe and cerebellum were greater than with the -3D accommodative demand; emergent activated brain areas included the parietal lobe (bilateral precuneus gyrus and right supramarginal gyrus); the precentral lobe and cingulate cortex failed to reach the threshold in the -6D vs. rest contrast. In the -3D and -6D contrast comparison, the frontal lobe (Frontal_Sup_Medial_L) and parietal lobe (Precuneus_L and Precuneus_R) passed the significance threshold of cluster-level family-wise error (FWE) correction. The mean activation in the -3D and -6D contrast revealed an incremental summation of the activations than that found in the previous -3D vs. rest and -6D vs. rest comparisons.</p><p>Conclusions: Neural circuits were selectively activated during the -3D/-6D accommodative response to blur cues. Cognitive-perceptual processing is involved in signal regulation of ocular accommodative functions.</p>

<p>Young neurons in the adult brain are key to some types of learning and memory. They integrate in the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus contributing to such cognitive processes following timely developmental events. While experimentally impairing GABAergic transmission through the blockade or elimination of the ionic cotransporter NKCC1 leads to alterations in the proper maturation of young neurons, it is still unknown if the in vivo administration of common use diuretic drugs that block the cotransporter, alters the development of young hippocampal neurons and affects DG-related functions. In this study, we delivered chronically and intracerebroventricularly the NKCC1 blocker bumetanide to young-adult rats. We analyzed doublecortin density and development parameters (apical dendrite length and angle and dendritic arbor length) in doublecortin positive neurons from different subregions in the DG and evaluated the performance of animals in contextual fear learning and memory. Our results show that in bumetanide-treated subjects, doublecortin density is diminished in the infra and suprapyramidal blades of the DG; the length of primary dendrites is shortened in the infrapyramidal blade and; the growth angle of primary dendrites in the infrapyramidal blade is different from control animals. Behaviorally, treated animals showed the typical learning curve in a contextual fear task, and freezing-time displayed during contextual fear memory was not different from controls. Thus, in vivo icv delivery of bumetanide negatively alters DCX density associated to young neurons and its proper development but not to the extent of affecting a DG dependent task as aversive context learning and memory.</p>

<p>Myasthenia gravis (MG) is a rare acquired autoimmune neuromuscular disease. Autoantibodies, cellular immunity, complement, and cytokines are involved in the pathogenesis of MG. It is characterized by the dysfunction of neuromuscular junction transmission and skeletal muscle weakness. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are non-coding small molecule ribonucleic acids that regulate various biological processes (e.g., development, differentiation, and immunity) at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels of gene expression. miRNAs play an important regulatory role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases, including MG. In recent studies, the functional mechanisms underlying the role of miRNAs in the pathogenesis of MG have received increasing attention. miRNAs are highly stable and have high specificity in peripheral body fluids. Therefore, the miRNAs in body fluids may represent promising biomarkers for determining the prognosis of MG and the efficacy of treatment. This article reviews the role of miRNAs in the pathogenesis of MG, highlights the potential of miRNAs as new biomarkers for the diagnosis of MG, and deepens our understanding of disease processes.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00443">LRRK2 at the Interface Between Peripheral and Central Immune Function in Parkinson’s</a></h4>

<p>It is becoming increasingly accepted that there is an interplay between the peripheral immune response and neuroinflammation in the pathophysiology of Parkinson’s disease (PD). Mutations in the leucine-rich-repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) gene are associated with familial and sporadic cases of PD but are also found in immune-related disorders, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and leprosy. Furthermore, LRRK2 has been associated with bacterial infections such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Salmonella typhimurium. Recent evidence suggests a role of LRRK2 in the regulation of the immune system and modulation of inflammatory responses, at a systemic level, with LRRK2 functionally implicated in both the immune system of the central nervous system (CNS) and the periphery. It has therefore been suggested that peripheral immune signaling may play an important role in the regulation of neurodegeneration in LRRK2 as well as non-LRRK2-associated PD. This review will discuss the current evidence for this hypothesis and will provide compelling rationale for placing LRRK2 at the interface between peripheral immune responses and neuroinflammation.</p>

<p>Recent advances in deep learning have improved the segmentation accuracy of subcortical brain structures, which would be useful in neuroimaging studies of many neurological disorders. However, most existing deep learning based approaches in neuroimaging do not investigate the specific difficulties that exist in segmenting extremely small but important brain regions such as the subnuclei of the amygdala. To tackle this challenging task, we developed a dual-branch dilated residual 3D fully convolutional network with parallel convolutions to extract more global context and alleviate the class imbalance issue by maintaining a small receptive field that is just the size of the regions of interest (ROIs). We also conduct multi-scale feature fusion in both parallel and series to compensate the potential information loss during convolutions, which has been shown to be important for small objects. The serial feature fusion enabled by residual connections is further enhanced by a proposed top-down attention-guided refinement unit, where the high-resolution low-level spatial details are selectively integrated to complement the high-level but coarse semantic information, enriching the final feature representations. As a result, the segmentations resulting from our method are more accurate both volumetrically and morphologically, compared with other deep learning based approaches. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first deep learning-based approach that targets the subregions of the amygdala. We also demonstrated the feasibility of using a cycle-consistent generative adversarial network (CycleGAN) to harmonize multi-site MRI data, and show that our method generalizes well to challenging traumatic brain injury (TBI) datasets collected from multiple centers. This appears to be a promising strategy for image segmentation for multiple site studies and increased morphological variability from significant brain pathology.</p>

Background and Purpose<p>Freezing of gait (FOG) is a debilitating gait disorder in people with Parkinson’s disease (PD). While various neuroimaging techniques have been used to investigate the pathophysiology of FOG, changes in corticomotor excitability associated with FOG have yet to be determined. Research to date has not concluded if changes in corticomotor excitability are associated with gait disturbances in this patient population. This study aimed to use transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to investigate corticomotor excitability changes associated with FOG. Furthermore, the relationship between corticomotor excitability and gait performances would be determined.</p>Methods<p>Eighteen participants with PD and FOG (PD + FOG), 15 without FOG (PD − FOG), and 15 non-disabled adults (Control) were recruited for this study. Single and paired-pulse TMS paradigms were used to assess corticospinal and intracortical excitability, respectively. Gait performance was measured by the 10-Meter-Walk test. Correlation analysis was performed to evaluate relationships between TMS outcomes and gait parameters.</p>Results<p>Compared with the Control group, the PD + FOG group showed a significantly lower resting motor threshold and reduced short intracortical inhibition (SICI). Correlation analysis revealed a relationship between resting motor evoked potential and step length, and between SICI and walking velocity in the Control group. While the silent period correlated with step length in the PD − FOG group, no significant relationship was observed in the PD + FOG group.</p>Discussion and Conclusion<p>Compared to the Control group, the PD + FOG group exhibited reduced corticomotor inhibition. Distinct correlations observed among the three groups suggest that the function of the corticomotor system plays an important role in mediating walking ability in non-disabled adults and people with PD − FOG, while people with PD + FOG may rely on neural networks other than the corticomotor system to control gait.</p>

<p>Empathy influences how we perceive, understand, and interact with our social environment. Previous studies suggested a network of different brain regions as a neural substrate for empathy, including, in particular, insula and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). In addition, a contribution of the somatosensory cortices for this empathy related network has been suggested. This is remarkable, given that other recent studies have revealed a role for the somatosensory cortex in various social tasks. For example, in experiments using tactile priming, incidental haptic sensations are found to influence judgment recommendations. Here, we aimed to test if this engagement of the somatosensory cortices during tactile priming can be predicted by the participant’s empathy personality traits. We assessed participant’s empathy and personality traits by means of the Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI) and NEO-FFI and tested whether trait empathy is associated with the tactile priming effect in social judgments. Results revealed that empathy predicted the tactile priming effect negatively. This was accompanied by a reduced engagement of the somatosensory cortex, which has been shown to be associated with the priming effect. We conclude that empathy seems to protect people from tactile priming effects.</p>

<p>In humans and experimental animals, the administration of ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) reduces food intake and body weight. To gain further insights into the mechanism(s) underlying its satiety effect, we: (i) evaluated the CNTF-dependent activation of the Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) pathway in mouse models where neuropeptide Y (NPY) and pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons can be identified by green fluorescent protein (GFP); and (ii) assessed whether CNTF promotes leptin signaling in hypothalamic feeding centers. Immunohistochemical experiments enabled us to establish that intraperitoneal injection of mouse recombinant CNTF activated the JAK2-STAT3 pathway in a substantial proportion of arcuate nucleus (ARC) NPY neurons (18.68% ± 0.60 in 24-h fasted mice and 25.50% ± 1.17 in fed mice) but exerted a limited effect on POMC neurons (4.15% ± 0.33 in 24-h fasted mice and 2.84% ± 0.45 in fed mice). CNTF-responsive NPY neurons resided in the ventromedial ARC, facing the median eminence (ME), and were surrounded by albumin immunoreactivity, suggesting that they are located outside the blood-brain barrier (BBB). In both normally fed and high-fat diet (HFD) obese animals, CNTF activated extracellular signal-regulated kinase signaling in ME β1- and β2-tanycytes, an effect that has been linked to the promotion of leptin entry into the brain. Accordingly, compared to the animals treated with leptin, mice treated with leptin/CNTF showed: (i) a significantly greater leptin content in hypothalamic protein extracts; (ii) a significant increase in phospho-STAT3 (P-STAT3)-positive neurons in the ARC and the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus of normally fed mice; and (iii) a significantly increased number of P-STAT3-positive neurons in the ARC and dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus of HFD obese mice. Collectively, these data suggest that exogenously administered CNTF reduces food intake by exerting a leptin-like action on distinctive NPY ARC neurons and by promoting leptin signaling in hypothalamic feeding centers.</p>

<p>Microglia, the innate immune effector cells of the mammalian central nervous system (CNS), are involved in the development, homeostasis, and pathology of CNS. Microglia become activated in response to various insults and injuries and protect the CNS by phagocytosing the invading pathogens, dead neurons, and other cellular debris. Recent studies have demonstrated that the epigenetic mechanisms ensure the coordinated regulation of genes involved in microglial activation. In this study, we performed a microRNA (miRNA) microarray in activated primary microglia derived from rat pup’s brain and identified differentially expressed miRNAs targeting key genes involved in cell survival, apoptosis, and inflammatory responses. Interestingly, miR-142-3p, one of the highly up-regulated miRNAs in microglia upon lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-mediated activation, compared to untreated primary microglia cells was predicted to target Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin dependent kinase 2a (CAMK2A). Further, luciferase reporter assay confirmed that miR-142-3p targets the 3′UTR of Camk2a. CAMK2A has been implicated in regulating the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and long-term potentiation (LTP), a cellular mechanism underlying memory and learning. Given this, this study further focused on understanding the miR-142-3p mediated regulation of the CAMK2A-BDNF pathway via Cyclic AMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB) in activated microglia. The results revealed that CAMK2A was downregulated in activated microglia, suggesting an inverse relationship between miR-142-3p and Camk2a in activated microglia. Overexpression of miR-142-3p in microglia was found to decrease the expression of CAMK2A and subsequently BDNF through regulation of CREB phosphorylation. Functional analysis through shRNA-mediated stable knockdown of CAMK2A in microglia confirmed that the regulation of BDNF by miR-142-3p is via CAMK2A. Overall, this study provides a database of differentially expressed miRNAs in activated primary microglia and reveals that microglial miR-142-3p regulates the CAMK2A-CREB-BDNF pathway which is involved in synaptic plasticity.</p>

<p>The mammalian central nervous system (CNS) is characterized by a severely limited regeneration capacity. Comparison with lower species like amphibians, which are able to restore even complex tissues after damage, indicates the presence of an inhibitory environment that restricts the cellular response in mammals. In this context, signals provided by the extracellular matrix (ECM) are important regulators of events like cell survival, proliferation, migration, differentiation or neurite outgrowth. Therefore, knowledge of the post-lesional ECM and of cells that produce these factors might support development of new treatment strategies for patients suffering from traumatic brain injury and other types of CNS damage. In the present study, we analyzed the surround of focal infrared laser lesions of the adult mouse visual cortex. This lesion paradigm avoids direct contact with the brain, as the laser beam passes the intact bone. Cell type-specific markers revealed a distinct spatial distribution of different astroglial subtypes in the penumbra after injury. Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) as marker for reactive astrocytes was found broadly up-regulated, whereas the more immature markers vimentin and nestin were only expressed by a subset of cells. Dividing astrocytes could be identified via the proliferation marker Ki-67. Different ECM molecules, among others the neural stem cell-associated glycoprotein tenascin-C and the DSD-1 chondroitin sulfate epitope, were found on astrocytes in the penumbra. Wisteria floribunda agglutinin (WFA) and aggrecan as markers for perineuronal nets, a specialized ECM limiting synaptic plasticity, appeared normal in the vicinity of the necrotic lesion core. In sum, expression of progenitor markers by astrocyte subpopulations and the identification of proliferating astrocytes in combination with an ECM that contains components typically associated with neural stem/progenitor cells suggest that an immature cell fate is facilitated as response to the injury.</p>

<p>Introduction: Studies have shown that excess formaldehyde accumulation in the brain accelerates cognitive decline in people with Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Recently, reports from our research team revealed that red light treatment (RLT) improved memory in AD mice by activating formaldehyde dehydrogenase (FDH) and thus reducing formaldehyde levels.

<p>Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is the clinical precursor of Alzheimer's disease (AD), which is considered the most common neurodegenerative disease in the elderly. Some MCI patients tend to remain stable over time and do not evolve to AD. It is essential to diagnose MCI in its early stages and provide timely treatment to the patient. In this study, we propose a neuroimaging approach to identify MCI using a deep learning method and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). For this purpose, fifteen MCI subjects and nine healthy controls (HCs) were asked to perform three mental tasks: N-back, Stroop, and verbal fluency (VF) tasks. Besides examining the oxygenated hemoglobin changes (ΔHbO) in the region of interest, ΔHbO maps at 13 specific time points (i.e., 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, and 65 s) during the tasks and seven temporal feature maps (i.e., two types of mean, three types of slope, kurtosis, and skewness) in the prefrontal cortex were investigated. A four-layer convolutional neural network (CNN) was applied to identify the subjects into either MCI or HC, individually, after training the CNN model with ΔHbO maps and temporal feature maps above. Finally, we used the 5-fold cross-validation approach to evaluate the performance of the CNN. The results of temporal feature maps exhibited high classification accuracies: The average accuracies for the N-back task, Stroop task, and VFT, respectively, were 89.46, 87.80, and 90.37%. Notably, the highest accuracy of 98.61% was achieved from the ΔHbO slope map during 20–60 s interval of N-back tasks. Our results indicate that the fNIRS imaging approach based on temporal feature maps is a promising diagnostic method for early detection of MCI and can be used as a tool for clinical doctors to identify MCI from their patients.</p>

Innate defensive behaviors are unlearned responses, evolutionarily selected to increase chances of survival. Here, Barbano et al. report that ventral tegmental area glutamatergic neurons are activated by and required for innate defensive responses and that information on threatening stimuli to these glutamate neurons is relayed by hypothalamic excitatory neurons.

Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease that still causes more than 1.5 million deaths annually. The World Health Organization estimates that around 30% of the world’s population is latently infected. However, the mechanisms responsible for 10% of this reserve (i.e., of the latently infected population) developing an active disease are not fully understood, yet. The dynamic hypothesis suggests that endogenous reinfection has an important role in maintaining latent infection. In order to examine this hypothesis for falsifiability, an agent-based model of growth, merging, and proliferation of TB lesions was implemented in a computational bronchial tree, built with an iterative algorithm for the generation of bronchial bifurcations and tubes applied inside a virtual 3D pulmonary surface. The computational model was fed and parameterized with computed tomography (CT) experimental data from 5 latently infected minipigs. First, we used CT images to reconstruct the virtual pulmonary surfaces where bronchial trees are built. Then, CT data about TB lesion’ size and location to each minipig were used in the parameterization process. The model’s outcome provides spatial and size distributions of TB lesions that successfully reproduced experimental data, thus reinforcing the role of the bronchial tree as the spatial structure triggering endogenous reinfection. A sensitivity analysis of the model shows that the final number of lesions is strongly related with the endogenous reinfection frequency and maximum growth rate of the lesions, while their mean diameter mainly depends on the spatial spreading of new lesions and the maximum radius. Finally, the model was used as an <i>in silico</i> experimental platform to explore the transition from latent infection to active disease, identifying two main triggering factors: a high inflammatory response and the combination of a moderate inflammatory response with a small breathing amplitude.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/48zZq2xcYt8" width="1" />

<p>by Lei Wang, Zhu-Hong You, Yang-Ming Li, Kai Zheng, Yu-An Huang</p>

Numerous evidences indicate that Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are widely involved in the occurrence and development of diseases. Identifying the association between circRNAs and diseases plays a crucial role in exploring the pathogenesis of complex diseases and improving the diagnosis and treatment of diseases. However, due to the complex mechanisms between circRNAs and diseases, it is expensive and time-consuming to discover the new circRNA-disease associations by biological experiment. Therefore, there is increasingly urgent need for utilizing the computational methods to predict novel circRNA-disease associations. In this study, we propose a computational method called GCNCDA based on the deep learning Fast learning with Graph Convolutional Networks (FastGCN) algorithm to predict the potential disease-associated circRNAs. Specifically, the method first forms the unified descriptor by fusing disease semantic similarity information, disease and circRNA Gaussian Interaction Profile (GIP) kernel similarity information based on known circRNA-disease associations. The FastGCN algorithm is then used to objectively extract the high-level features contained in the fusion descriptor. Finally, the new circRNA-disease associations are accurately predicted by the Forest by Penalizing Attributes (Forest PA) classifier. The 5-fold cross-validation experiment of GCNCDA achieved 91.2% accuracy with 92.78% sensitivity at the AUC of 90.90% on circR2Disease benchmark dataset. In comparison with different classifier models, feature extraction models and other state-of-the-art methods, GCNCDA shows strong competitiveness. Furthermore, we conducted case study experiments on diseases including breast cancer, glioma and colorectal cancer. The results showed that 16, 15 and 17 of the top 20 candidate circRNAs with the highest prediction scores were respectively confirmed by relevant literature and databases. These results suggest that GCNCDA can effectively predict potential circRNA-disease associations and provide highly credible candidates for biological experiments.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/sxyqcAr41hA" width="1" />

<i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> (Mtb), the causative infectious agent of tuberculosis (TB), kills more individuals per year than any other infectious agent. Granulomas, the hallmark of Mtb infection, are complex structures that form in lungs, composed of immune cells surrounding bacteria, infected cells, and a caseous necrotic core. While granulomas serve to physically contain and immunologically restrain bacteria growth, some granulomas are unable to control Mtb growth, leading to bacteria and infected cells leaving the granuloma and disseminating, either resulting in additional granuloma formation (local or non-local) or spread to airways or lymph nodes. Dissemination is associated with development of active TB. It is challenging to experimentally address specific mechanisms driving dissemination from TB lung granulomas. Herein, we develop a novel hybrid multi-scale computational model, <i>MultiGran</i>, that tracks Mtb infection within multiple granulomas in an entire lung. <i>MultiGran</i> follows cells, cytokines, and bacterial populations within each lung granuloma throughout the course of infection and is calibrated to multiple non-human primate (NHP) cellular, granuloma, and whole-lung datasets. We show that <i>MultiGran</i> can recapitulate patterns of <i>in vivo</i> local and non-local dissemination, predict likelihood of dissemination, and predict a crucial role for multifunctional CD8+ T cells and macrophage dynamics for preventing dissemination.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/s01vVoOJjxc" width="1" />

<p>by Tobias S. Brett, Pejman Rohani</p>

Developing methods for anticipating the emergence or reemergence of infectious diseases is both important and timely; however, traditional model-based approaches are stymied by uncertainty surrounding the underlying drivers. Here, we demonstrate an operational, mechanism-agnostic detection algorithm for disease (re-)emergence based on early warning signals (EWSs) derived from the theory of critical slowing down. Specifically, we used computer simulations to train a supervised learning algorithm to detect the dynamical footprints of (re-)emergence present in epidemiological data. Our algorithm was then challenged to forecast the slowly manifesting, spatially replicated reemergence of mumps in England in the mid-2000s and pertussis post-1980 in the United States. Our method successfully anticipated mumps reemergence 4 years in advance, during which time mitigation efforts could have been implemented. From 1980 onwards, our model identified resurgent states with increasing accuracy, leading to reliable classification starting in 1992. Additionally, we successfully applied the detection algorithm to 2 vector-transmitted case studies, namely, outbreaks of dengue serotypes in Puerto Rico and a rapidly unfolding outbreak of plague in 2017 in Madagascar. Taken together, these findings illustrate the power of theoretically informed machine learning techniques to develop early warning systems for the (re-)emergence of infectious diseases.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/MMgEqDRtzdE" width="1" />

Abstract
<p>The lateral habenula (LHb) sends complex projections to several areas of the mesopontine tegmentum, the raphe, and the hypothalamus. However, few markers have been available to distinguish subsets of LHb neurons that may serve these pathways. In order to address this complexity, we examined the mouse and rat LHb for neurons that express the GABA biosynthesis enzymes glutamate decarboxylase 1 (GAD1) and GAD2, and the vesicular GABA transporter (VGAT). The mouse LHb contains a population of neurons that express GAD2, while the rat LHb contains discrete populations of neurons that express GAD1 and VGAT. However, we could not detect single neurons in either species that co-express a GABA synthetic enzyme and VGAT, suggesting that these LHb neurons do not use GABA for conventional synaptic transmission. Instead, all of the neuronal types expressing a GABAergic marker in both species showed co-expression of the glutamate transporter VGluT2. Anterograde tract-tracing of the projections of GAD2-expressing LHb neurons in <i>Gad2<sup>Cre</sup></i> mice, combined with retrograde tracing from selected downstream nuclei, show that LHb-GAD2 neurons project selectively to the midline structures in the mesopontine tegmentum, including the median raphe (MnR) and nucleus incertus (NI), and only sparsely innervate the hypothalamus, rostromedial tegmental nucleus (RMTg), and ventral tegmental area (VTA). Postsynaptic recording of LHb-GAD2 neuronal input to tegmental neurons confirms that glutamate, not GABA, is the fast neurotransmitter in this circuit. Thus, GAD2 expression can serve as a marker for functional studies of excitatory neurons serving specific LHb output pathways in mice.</p>

Abstract
<p>Confidence judgments are a central tool in metacognition research. In a typical task, participants first perform perceptual (first-order) decisions and then rate their confidence in these decisions. The relationship between confidence and first-order accuracy is taken as a measure of metacognitive performance. Confidence is often assumed to stem from decision-monitoring processes alone, but processes that co-occur with the first-order decision may also play a role in confidence formation. In fact, some recent studies have revealed that directly manipulating motor regions in the brain, or the time of first-order decisions relative to second-order decisions, affects confidence judgments. This finding suggests that confidence could be informed by a readout of reaction times in addition to decision-monitoring processes. To test this possibility, we assessed the contribution of response-related signals to confidence and, in particular, to metacognitive performance (i.e., a measure of the adequacy of these confidence judgments). In human volunteers, we measured the effect of making an overt (vs covert) decision, as well as the effect of pairing an action to the stimulus about which the first-order decision is made. Against our expectations, we found no differences in overall confidence or metacognitive performance when first-order responses were covert as opposed to overt. Further, actions paired to visual stimuli presented led to higher confidence ratings, but did not affect metacognitive performance. These results suggest that confidence ratings do not always incorporate motor information.</p>

Abstract
<p>Local brain signal variability [SD of the BOLD signal (SD<sub>BOLD</sub>]] correlates with age and cognitive performance, and recently differentiated Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients from healthy controls. However, it is unknown whether changes to SD<sub>BOLD</sub> precede diagnosis of AD or mild cognitive impairment. We compared ostensibly healthy older adult humans who scored below the recommended threshold on the Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA) and who showed reduced medial temporal lobe (MTL) volume in a previous study ("at-risk" group, <i>n</i> = 20), with healthy older adults who scored within the normal range on the MoCA ("control" group, <i>n</i> = 20). Using multivariate partial least-squares analysis we assessed the correlations between SD<sub>BOLD</sub> and age, MoCA score, global fractional anisotropy, global mean diffusivity, and four cognitive factors. Greater SD<sub>BOLD</sub> in the MTL and occipital cortex positively correlated with performance on cognitive control/speed tasks but negatively correlated with memory scores in the control group. These relations were weaker in the at-risk group. A <i>post hoc</i> analysis assessed associations between MTL volumes and SD<sub>BOLD</sub> in both groups. This revealed a negative correlation, most robust in the at-risk group, between MTL SD<sub>BOLD</sub> and MTL subregion volumetry, particularly the entorhinal and parahippocampal regions. Together, these results suggest that the association between SD<sub>BOLD</sub> and cognition differs between the at-risk and control groups, which may be because of lower MTL volumes in the at-risk group. Our data indicate relations between MTL SD<sub>BOLD</sub> and cognition may be helpful in understanding brain differences in individuals who may be at risk for further cognitive decline.</p>

Abstract
<p>Social aggression, such as domestic violence, has been associated with a reduced ability to take on others’ perspectives. In this naturalistic imaging study, we investigated whether training human participants to take on a first-person embodied perspective during the experience of domestic violence enhances the identification with the victim and elicits brain activity associated with the monitoring of the body and surrounding space and the experience of threat. We combined fMRI measurements with preceding virtual reality exposure from either first-person perspective (1PP) or third-person perspective (3PP) to manipulate whether the domestic abuse stimulus was perceived as directed to oneself or another. We found that 1PP exposure increased body ownership and identification with the virtual victim. Furthermore, when the stimulus was perceived as directed toward oneself, the brain network that encodes the bodily self and its surrounding space was more strongly synchronized across participants and connectivity increased from premotor cortex (PM) and intraparietal sulcus towards superior parietal lobe. Additionally, when the stimulus came near the body, brain activity in the amygdala (AMG) strongly synchronized across participants. Exposure to 3PP reduced synchronization of brain activity in the personal space network, increased modulation of visual areas and strengthened functional connectivity between PM, supramarginal gyrus and primary visual cortex. In conclusion, our results suggest that 1PP embodiment training enhances experience from the viewpoint of the virtual victim, which is accompanied by synchronization in the fronto-parietal network to predict actions toward the body and in the AMG to signal the proximity of the stimulus.</p>

Abstract
<p>Dopamine (DA) plays a crucial role in the control of motor and higher cognitive functions such as learning, working memory, and decision making. The primary motor cortex (M1), which is essential for motor control and the acquisition of motor skills, receives dopaminergic inputs in its superficial and deep layers from the midbrain. However, the precise action of DA and DA receptor subtypes on the cortical microcircuits of M1 remains poorly understood. The aim of this work was to investigate in mice how DA, through the activation of D2-like receptors (D2Rs), modulates the cellular and synaptic activity of M1 parvalbumin-expressing interneurons (PVINs) which are crucial to regulate the spike output of pyramidal neurons (PNs). By combining immunofluorescence, <i>ex vivo</i> electrophysiology, pharmacology and optogenetics approaches, we show that D2R activation increases neuronal excitability of PVINs and GABAergic synaptic transmission between PVINs and PNs in Layer V of M1. Our data reveal how cortical DA modulates M1 microcircuitry, which could be important in the acquisition of motor skills.</p>

Abstract
<p>Mouse hippocampus retains the capacity for neurogenesis throughout lifetime, but such plasticity decreases with age. Adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN) involves the birth, maturation, and synaptic integration of newborn granule cells (GCs) into preexisting hippocampal circuitry. While functional integration onto adult-born GCs has been extensively studied, maturation of efferent projections onto CA3 pyramidal cells is less understood, particularly in aged brain. Here, using combined light and reconstructive electron microscopy (EM), we describe the maturation of mossy fiber bouton (MFB) connectivity with CA3 pyramidal cells in young adult and aged mouse brain. We found mature synaptic contacts of newborn GCs were formed in both young and aged brains. However, the dynamics of their spatiotemporal development and the cellular process by which these cells functionally integrated over time were different. In young brain newborn GCs either formed independent nascent MFB synaptic contacts or replaced preexisting MFBs, but these contacts were pruned over time to a mature state. In aged brain only replacement of preexisting MFBs was observed and new contacts were without evidence of pruning. These data illustrate that functional synaptic integration of AHN occurs in young adult and aged brain, but with distinct dynamics. They suggest elimination of preexisting connectivity is required for the integration of adult-born GCs in aged brain.</p>

<p>A faulty radial glia scaffold and an abnormal cell layering were observed in the hippocampus of male, but not female, biogenesis of lysosome‐related organelles complex‐1‐deficient mice, early postnatally.</p>
<br />
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The function(s) of the Biogenesis of Lysosome‐related Organelles Complex‐1 (BLOC‐1) during brain development is to date largely unknown. Here, we investigated how its absence alters the trajectory of postnatal brain development using as model the pallid mouse. Most of the defects observed early postnatally in the mutant mice were more prominent in males than in females and in the hippocampus. Male mutant mice, but not females, had smaller brains as compared to sex‐matching wild types at postnatal day 1 (P1), this deficit was largely recovered by P14 and P45. An abnormal cytoarchitecture of the pyramidal cell layer of the hippocampus was observed in P1 pallid male, but not female, or juvenile mice (P45), along with severely decreased expression levels of the radial glial marker Glutamate‐Aspartate Transporter. Transcriptomic analyses showed that the overall response to the lack of functional BLOC‐1 was more pronounced in hippocampi at P1 than at P45 or in the cerebral cortex. These observations suggest that absence of BLOC‐1 renders males more susceptible to perinatal brain maldevelopment and although most abnormalities appear to have been resolved in juvenile animals, still permanent defects may be present, resulting in faulty neuronal circuits, and contribute to previously reported cognitive and behavioral phenotypes in adult BLOC‐1‐deficient mice.</p>

<p>In utero electroporation (IUE) is a powerful tool for testing the role of genes in neuronal migration and function, but this technique suffers from high degrees of variability. Such variability can result from inconsistent surgery, developmental gradients along both rostral-caudal and medial-lateral axes, differences within littermates and from one litter to another. Comparisons between control and experimental electroporations rely on section matching, which is inherently subjective. These sources of variability are cumulative, leading to difficult to interpret data and an increased risk of both false positives and false negatives. To address these limitations, we developed two tools: (1) a new plasmid, termed Double UP, which combines LoxP-flanked reporters and limiting Cre dosages to generate internal controls, and (2) an automated program for unbiased and precise quantification of migration. In concert, these tools allow for more rigorous and objective experiments, while decreasing the mice, time, and reagents required to complete studies.</p>

<p>Objective: Malformations of cortical development (MCDs) are major causes of intractable epilepsies. To characterize the early neuroimaging findings of MCDs, we tried to identify the MRI features consistent with pathological findings in an infant rat MCD model, prenatally exposed to methylazoxymethanol (MAM), by using newly developed MRI techniques.</p><p>Methods: At gestational day 15, two doses of MAM (15 mg/kg intraperitoneally) or normal saline were injected into pregnant rats. The offspring underwent in vivo MRI, including glutamate chemical exchange saturation transfer (GluCEST), <sup>1</sup>H-MR spectroscopy, and diffusion tensor imaging, at postnatal day (P) 15 using a 7T small-animal imaging system. Another set of prenatally MAM-exposed rats were sacrificed for histological staining.</p><p>Results: At P15, the retrosplenial cortex (RSC) of rats with MCDs showed decreased neuronal nuclei, parvalbumin, and reelin expressions. Moreover, dendritic arborization of pyramidal cells in the RSC significantly decreased in infant rats with MCDs. In vivo MRI showed significantly decreased GluCEST (%) in the RSC of rats with MCDs (p = 0.000) and a significant correlation between GluCEST (%) and RSC thickness (r = 0.685, p = 0.003). The rats with MCDs showed reduced glutamate (p = 0.002), N-acetylaspartate (p = 0.002), and macromolecule and lipid levels (p = 0.027) and significantly reduced fractional anisotropy values in the RSC.</p><p>Conclusion:In vivo MRI revealed reduced neuronal population and dendritic arborization in the RSC of infant rats with MCDs during the early postnatal period. These pathological changes of the cortex could serve as clinical imaging biomarkers of MCDs in infants.</p>

<p>In previous reports, we developed a method to apply Brownian optogenetic noise-photostimulation (BONP, 470 nm) up to 0.67 mW on the barrel cortex of in vivo ChR2 transgenic mice. In such studies, we found that the BONP produces an increase in the evoked field potentials and the neuronal responses of pyramidal neurons induced by somatosensory mechanical stimulation. Here we extended such findings by examining whether the same type of BONP augments the Na<sup>+</sup> current amplitude elicited by voltage-clamp ramps of dissociated pyramidal neurons from the somatosensory cortex of ChR2 transgenic and wild type mice. We found that in all neurons from the ChR2 transgenic mice, but none of the wild type mice, the peak amplitude of a TTX-sensitive Na<sup>+</sup> current and its inverse of latency exhibited inverted U-like graphs as a function of the BONP level. It means that an intermediate level of BONP increases both the peak amplitude of the Na<sup>+</sup> current and its inverse of latency. Our research suggests that the impact of BONP on the Na<sup>+</sup> channels of pyramidal neurons could be associated with the observed augmentation-effects in our previous in vivo preparation. Moreover, it provides caution information for the use of an appropriate range of light intensity, &lt;0.67 mW, which could avoid opto non-genetics (also termed “optonongenetic”) related responses due to light-induced temperature changes.</p>

Background<p>The reactivity enhancement of pain sensitive neurons in the nervous system is a feature of the pathogenesis for neuropathic pain (NP), yet the underlying mechanisms need to be fully understood. In this study, we made an attempt to clarify the NP-related hub genes and signaling pathways so as to provide effective diagnostic and therapeutic methods toward NP.</p>Methods<p>Microarray expression profile GSE30691 including the mRNA-seq data of the spared nerve injury (SNI)-induced NP rats was accessed from the GEO database. Then, genes associated with NP development were screened using differential analysis along with random walk with restart (RWR). GO annotation and KEGG pathway analyses were performed to explore the biological functions and signaling pathways where the genes were activated. Afterward, protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis and GO analysis were conducted to further identify the hub genes which showed an intimate correlation with NP development.</p>Results<p>Totally 94 genes associated with NP development were screened by differential analysis and RWR analysis, and they were observed to be predominantly enriched in hormone secretion and transport, cAMP signaling pathway and other NP occurrence associated functions and pathways. Thereafter, the 94 genes were subjected to PPI analysis to find the genes much more associated with NP and a functional module composed of 48 genes were obtained. 8 hub genes including C3, C1qb, Ccl2, Cxcl13, Timp1, Fcgr2b, Gal, and Lyz2 were eventually identified after further association and functional enrichment analyses, and the expression of these 8 genes were all higher in SNI rats by comparison with those in Sham rats.</p>Conclusion<p>Based on the data collected from GEO database, this study discovered 8 hub genes that were closely related to NP occurrence and development, which help to provide potent theoretical basis for NP treatment.</p>

<p>The Parkinson’s disease-associated Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) is a complex multi-domain protein belonging to the Roco protein family, a unique group of G-proteins. Variants of this gene are associated with an increased risk of Parkinson’s disease. Besides its well-characterized enzymatic activities, conferred by its GTPase and kinase domains, and a central dimerization domain, it contains four predicted repeat domains, which are, based on their structure, commonly involved in protein-protein interactions (PPIs). In the past decades, tremendous progress has been made in determining comprehensive interactome maps for the human proteome. Knowledge of PPIs has been instrumental in assigning functions to proteins involved in human disease and helped to understand the connectivity between different disease pathways and also significantly contributed to the functional understanding of LRRK2. In addition to an increased kinase activity observed for proteins containing PD-associated variants, various studies helped to establish LRRK2 as a large scaffold protein in the interface between cytoskeletal dynamics and the vesicular transport. This review first discusses a number of specific LRRK2-associated PPIs for which a functional consequence can at least be speculated upon, and then considers the representation of LRRK2 protein interactions in public repositories, providing an outlook on open research questions and challenges in this field.</p>

<p>The increasing incidence of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s or Parkinson’s disease represents a significant burden for patients and national health systems. The conditions are primarily caused by the death of neurons and other neural cell types. One important aim of current stem cell research is to find a way to replace the lost cells. In this perspective, neural stem cells (NSCs) have been considered as a promising tool in the field of regenerative medicine. The behavior of NSCs is modulated by environmental influences, for example hormones, growth factors, cytokines, and extracellular matrix molecules or biomechanics. These factors can be studied by using well-defined hydrogels, which are polymeric networks of synthetic or natural origin with the ability to swell in water. These gels can be modified with a variety of molecules and optimized with regard to their mechanical properties to mimic the natural extracellular environment. In particular modifications applying distinct units such as functional domains and peptides can modulate the development of NSCs with regard to proliferation, differentiation and migration. One well-known peptide sequence that affects the behavior of NSCs is the integrin recognition sequence RGD that has originally been derived from fibronectin. In the present review we provide an overview concerning the applications of modified hydrogels with an emphasis on synthetic hydrogels based on poly(acrylamides), as modified with either cationic moieties or the peptide sequence RGD. This knowledge might be used in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine for the therapy of spinal cord injuries, neurodegenerative diseases and traumata.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00470">Investigating the Effects of Brainstem Neuronal Adaptation on Cardiovascular Homeostasis</a></h4>

<p>Central coordination of cardiovascular function is accomplished, in part, by the baroreceptor reflex, a multi-input multi-output physiological control system that regulates the activity of the parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous systems via interactions among multiple brainstem nuclei. Recent single-cell analyses within the brain revealed that individual neurons within and across brain nuclei exhibit distinct transcriptional states contributing to neuronal function. Such transcriptional heterogeneity complicates the task of understanding how neurons within and across brain nuclei organize and function to process multiple inputs and coordinate cardiovascular functions within the larger context of the baroreceptor reflex. However, prior analysis of brainstem neurons revealed that single-neuron transcriptional heterogeneity reflects an adaptive response to synaptic inputs and that neurons organize into distinct subtypes with respect to synaptic inputs received. Based on these results, we hypothesize that adaptation of neuronal subtypes support robust biological function through graded cellular responses. We test this hypothesis by examining the functional impact of neuronal adaptation on parasympathetic activity within the context of short-term baroreceptor reflex regulation. In this work, we extend existing quantitative closed-loop models of the baroreceptor reflex by incorporating into the model distinct input-driven neuronal subtypes and neuroanatomical groups that modulate parasympathetic activity. We then use this extended model to investigate, via simulation, the functional role of neuronal adaptation under conditions of health and systolic heart failure. Simulation results suggest that parasympathetic activity can be modulated appropriately by the coordination of distinct neuronal subtypes to maintain normal cardiovascular functions under systolic heart failure conditions. Moreover, differing degrees of adaptation of these neuronal subtypes contribute to cardiovascular behaviors corresponding to distinct clinical phenotypes of heart failure, such as exercise intolerance. Further, our results suggest that an imbalance between sympathetic and parasympathetic activity regulating ventricular contractility contributes to exercise intolerance in systolic heart failure patients, and restoring this balance can improve the short-term cardiovascular performance of these patients.</p>

<p>Accumulating evidence has indicated that activation of microglia and neuroinflammation reaction play a prominent role in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Inhibition of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) has been shown to be associated with immune responses and brain damage, but its effects on AD remain unclear. This study mainly aimed to investigate the protective effect of TAK-242 (TLR4-specific inhibitor) on microglial polarization and neuroprotection in an AD mouse model and the underlying mechanisms. We found that APP/PS1 transgenic AD mice exhibited a dramatic increase in TLR4 levels concomitant with a significantly higher expression of inflammatory microglia compared to C57BL/6 wild-type mice. Furthermore, inhibition of TLR4 by TAK-242 administration significantly improved neurological function, decreased the level of Bax, and caused a significant reduction in the levels of M1-markers (iNOS and TNFα), while the expressions of M2-phenotype markers (Trem-2 and Arg-1) were increased both in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, TAK-242 treatment enhanced BV2 microglial phagocytosis. Moreover, Aβ<sub>25</sub><sub>–</sub><sub>35</sub> caused the upregulation of inflammatory cytokine production, MyD88, NF-kappaB-p65, and NLRP3, which could be ameliorated by NLRP3-siRNA or TAK-242. These findings indicated that TLR4 inhibition provided neuroprotection and promoted a microglial switch from the inflammatory M1 phenotype to the protective M2 phenotype in AD. The mechanism involved may be related to modulation of the MyD88/NF-kappaB/NLRP3 signaling pathway.</p>

<p>Single cell electrophysiology remains one of the most widely used approaches of systems neuroscience. Decisions made by the experimenter during electrophysiology recording largely determine recording quality, duration of the project and value of the collected data. Therefore, online feedback aiding these decisions can lower monetary and time investment, and substantially speed up projects as well as allow novel studies otherwise not possible due to prohibitively low throughput. Real-time feedback is especially important in studies that involve optogenetic cell type identification by enabling a systematic search for neurons of interest. However, such tools are scarce and limited to costly commercial systems with high degree of specialization, which hitherto prevented wide-ranging benefits for the community. To address this, we present an open-source tool that enables online feedback during electrophysiology experiments and provides a Python interface for the widely used Open Ephys open source data acquisition system. Specifically, our software allows flexible online visualization of spike alignment to external events, called the online peri-event time histogram (OPETH). These external events, conveyed by digital logic signals, may indicate photostimulation time stamps for in vivo optogenetic cell type identification or the times of behaviorally relevant events during in vivo behavioral neurophysiology experiments. Therefore, OPETH allows real-time identification of genetically defined neuron types or behaviorally responsive populations. By allowing “hunting” for neurons of interest, OPETH significantly reduces experiment time and thus increases the efficiency of experiments that combine in vivo electrophysiology with behavior or optogenetic tagging of neurons.</p>

<p>Chronic cerebral hypoperfusion in neurocognitive disorders diminishes cytochrome oxidase activity leading to neurodegenerative effects and impairment of learning and memory. Methylene blue at low doses stimulates cytochrome oxidase activity and may thus counteract the adverse effects of cerebral hypoperfusion. However, the effects of methylene blue on cytochrome oxidase activity during chronic cerebral hypoperfusion have not been described before. To test this hypothesis, rats underwent bilateral carotid artery occlusion or sham surgery, received daily 4 mg/kg methylene blue or saline injections, and learned a visual water task. Brain mapping of cytochrome oxidase activity was done by quantitative enzyme histochemistry. Permanent carotid occlusion for 1 month resulted in decreased cytochrome oxidase activity in visual cortex, prefrontal cortex, perirhinal cortex, hippocampus and amygdala, and weaker interregional correlation of cytochrome oxidase activity between these regions. Methylene blue preserved cytochrome oxidase activity in regions affected by carotid occlusion and strengthened their interregional correlations of cytochrome oxidase activity, which prevented neurodegenerative effects and facilitated task-specific learning and memory. Brain-behavior correlations revealed positive correlations between performance and brain regions in which cytochrome oxidase activity was preserved by methylene blue. These results are the first to demonstrate that methylene blue prevents neurodegeneration and memory impairment by preserving cytochrome oxidase activity and interregional correlation of cytochrome oxidase activity in brain regions susceptible to chronic hypoperfusion. This demonstration provides further support for the hypothesis that lower cerebral blood flow results in an Alzheimer’s-like syndrome and that stimulating cytochrome oxidase activity with low-dose methylene blue is neuroprotective.</p>

<p>Traditionally, in vitro generation of donor cells for brain repair has been dominated by the application of extrinsic growth factors and morphogens. Recent advances in cell engineering strategies such as reprogramming of somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem cells and direct cell fate conversion have impressively demonstrated the feasibility to manipulate cell identities by the overexpression of cell fate-determining transcription factors. These strategies are now increasingly implemented for transcription factor-guided differentiation of neural precursors and forward programming of pluripotent stem cells toward specific neural subtypes. This review covers major achievements, pros and cons, as well as future prospects of transcription factor-based cell fate specification and the applicability of these approaches for the generation of donor cells for brain repair.</p>

Non-coding RNAs are fundamental to the competing endogenous RNA (CeRNA) hypothesis in oncology. Previous work focused on static CeRNA networks. We construct and analyze CeRNA networks for four sequential stages of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) based on multi-omics data of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), microRNAs and mRNAs. We find that the networks possess a two-level bipartite structure: common competing endogenous network (CCEN) composed of an invariant set of microRNAs over all the stages and stage-dependent, unique competing endogenous networks (UCENs). A systematic enrichment analysis of the pathways of the mRNAs in CCEN reveals that they are strongly associated with cancer development. We also find that the microRNA-linked mRNAs from UCENs have a higher enrichment efficiency. A key finding is six microRNAs from CCEN that impact patient survival at all stages, and four microRNAs that affect the survival from a specific stage. The ten microRNAs can then serve as potential biomarkers and prognostic tools for LUAD.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/1pKXGg7bnUY" width="1" />

<p>by Lisa C. Simonsen, Tony C. Slaba, Peter Guida, Adam Rusek</p>

With exciting new NASA plans for a sustainable return to the moon, astronauts will once again leave Earth’s protective magnetosphere only to endure higher levels of radiation from galactic cosmic radiation (GCR) and the possibility of a large solar particle event (SPE). Gateway, lunar landers, and surface habitats will be designed to protect crew against SPEs with vehicle optimization, storm shelter concepts, and/or active dosimetry; however, the ever penetrating GCR will continue to pose the most significant health risks especially as lunar missions increase in duration and as NASA sets its aspirations on Mars. The primary risks of concern include carcinogenesis, central nervous system (CNS) effects resulting in potential in-mission cognitive or behavioral impairment and/or late neurological disorders, degenerative tissue effects including circulatory and heart disease, as well as potential immune system decrements impacting multiple aspects of crew health. Characterization and mitigation of these risks requires a significant reduction in the large biological uncertainties of chronic (low-dose rate) heavy-ion exposures and the validation of countermeasures in a relevant space environment. Historically, most research on understanding space radiation-induced health risks has been performed using acute exposures of monoenergetic single-ion beams. However, the space radiation environment consists of a wide variety of ion species over a broad energy range. Using the fast beam switching and controls systems technology recently developed at the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory (NSRL) at Brookhaven National Laboratory, a new era in radiobiological research is possible. NASA has developed the “GCR Simulator” to generate a spectrum of ion beams that approximates the primary and secondary GCR field experienced at human organ locations within a deep-space vehicle. The majority of the dose is delivered from protons (approximately 65%–75%) and helium ions (approximately 10%–20%) with heavier ions (Z ≥ 3) contributing the remainder. The GCR simulator exposes state-of-the art cellular and animal model systems to 33 sequential beams including 4 proton energies plus degrader, 4 helium energies plus degrader, and the 5 heavy ions of C, O, Si, Ti, and Fe. A polyethylene degrader system is used with the 100 MeV/n H and He beams to provide a nearly continuous distribution of low-energy particles. A 500 mGy exposure, delivering doses from each of the 33 beams, requires approximately 75 minutes. To more closely simulate the low-dose rates found in space, sequential field exposures can be divided into daily fractions over 2 to 6 weeks, with individual beam fractions as low as 0.1 to 0.2 mGy. In the large beam configuration (60 × 60 cm<sup>2</sup>), 54 special housing cages can accommodate 2 to 3 mice each for an approximately 75 min duration or 15 individually housed rats. On June 15, 2018, the NSRL made a significant achievement by completing the first operational run using the new GCR simulator. This paper discusses NASA’s innovative technology solution for a ground-based GCR simulator at the NSRL to accelerate our understanding and mitigation of health risks faced by astronauts. Ultimately, the GCR simulator will require validation across multiple radiogenic risks, endpoints, doses, and dose rates.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/QTWrG0NjKNI" width="1" />

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Sex hormone transition may trigger severe depressive episodes in some women. In order to map mechanisms related to such phenomena we developed a pharmacological preclinical human model using sex hormone manipulation with gonadotropin releasing hormone agonist (GnRHa) in a placebo‐controlled design. Here the findings from this model is synthesized and discussed in the context of related literature on hormonal contributions to reproductive mental health disorders. The GnRha model work points to an estradiol‐dependent depressive response in healthy women undergoing short‐term sex hormone manipulation with GnRHa, which is linked to serotonin transporter changes (a key regulator of synaptic serotonin), a disengagement of hippocampus, and overengagement of brain networks recruited when processing emotional salient information. Further, the GnRHa model suggest that key brain regions in the reward circuit are less engaged in positive stimuli when undergoing sex hormone manipulation, which may underlie anhedonia. Also, the work supports that enhanced sensitivity to estrogen signaling at the level of gene expression may drive increased risk for depressive symptoms when exposed to sex steroid hormone fluctuations. In conclusion, the GnRHa model work highlights the brain signatures of rapid and profound changes in sex steroid hormone milieu, which reflect plausible mechanisms by which risk for mood disorders works. This model points to the role of estrogen dynamics and sensitivity, and offers a rationale for personalized prevention in hormonal transition phases, for example pregnancy to postpartum transition, perimenopause, and hormone treatments, which now can move into clinical translation and ideally pave the way for protecting mental and cognitive health.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>There is a strong correlation between aging and onset of idiopathic Parkinson's disease, but little is known about whether cellular changes occur during normal aging that may explain this association. Here, proteomic and bioinformatic analysis was conducted on the substantia nigra (SN) of rats at four stages of life to identify and quantify protein changes throughout aging. This analysis revealed that proteins associated with cell adhesion, protein aggregation and oxidation‐reduction are dysregulated as early as middle age in rats. Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) was identified as a network hub connecting the greatest number of proteins altered during aging. Furthermore, the isoform of GFAP expressed in the SN varied throughout life. However, the expression levels of the rate‐limiting enzyme for dopamine production, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), were maintained even in the oldest animals, despite a reduction in the number of dopamine neurons in the SN pars compact(SNc) as aging progressed. This age‐related increase in TH expression per neuron would likely to increase the vulnerability of neurons, since increased dopamine production would be an additional source of oxidative stress. This, in turn, would place a high demand on support systems from local astrocytes, which themselves show protein changes that could affect their functionality. Taken together, this study highlights key processes that are altered with age in the rat SN, each of which converges upon GFAP. These findings offer insight into the relationship between aging and increased challenges to neuronal viability, and indicate an important role for glial cells in the aging process.</p>

<p>In the inner retina (from GCL to IPL), ganglion cells express high levels of CD200, CD47, and CX3CL1, followed by amacrine cells. Vascular endothelial cells express CD200 and CD47. They also express complement factor H and CD59a. In the outer retina (from INL to ONL), horizontal cells, on the one hand, express high levels of CD200 and CD47, whereas bipolar cells express only low levels of TGFβ2 and CD47. Photoreceptors, on the other hand, express CD59a and CD47 and the expression is increased in disease conditions such as retinal detachment and uveoretinitis. Immune activation (including microglial and complement activation) in the inner retina may be regulated predominately by ganglion cells and vascular endothelial cells with the support from amacrine cells, whereas immune activation in the outer retina may be regulated by horizontal cell and photoreceptors. Müller cells, which span throughout the neuroretina, express TGFβ2 and CD47 and may participate in the regulation of all types of retinal immune activation.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The neuroretina is protected by its own defense system, that is microglia and the complement system. Under normal physiological conditions, microglial activation is tightly regulated by the neurons although the underlying mechanism remains elusive. Using published single‐cell RNA sequencing data sets, we found that immune regulatory molecules including CD200, CD47, CX3CL1, TGFβ, and complement inhibitor CD59a are expressed by various retinal neurons. Importantly, we found that photoreceptors express higher levels of CD47 and CD59a, which was further confirmed in cultured 661W cells, WERI‐Rb1 cells, and microdissected photoreceptors from human eyes. The expression of CD59a mRNA in 661W cells was upregulated by TNFα and hypoxia, whereas LPS, hypoxia, and IL‐4 upregulated CD47 mRNA expression in 661W cells. Immunofluorescence staining detected strong CD59a immunoreactivity in the outer nuclear layer, inner/outer segments, and discrete staining in ganglion cell layer (GCL), inner plexiform layer (IPL), and outer plexiform layer. The expression of CD59a in photoreceptors was increased in the detached retina, but decreased in retinas from experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis (EAU) mice. In EAU retina, CD59a was highly expressed by active immune cells. CD47 was detected in GCL, IPL, and inner nuclear layer and some photoreceptors. The expression of CD47 in photoreceptors was also increased in the detached retina but decreased in EAU retina. In a coculture system, 661W enhanced arginase‐1 and reduced IL‐6 mRNA expression in BV2 microglial cells. Our results suggest that photoreceptors express immune regulatory molecules and may have the potential to regulate immune activation in the outer retina/subretinal space under pathophysiological conditions.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Compensation is described as normal or near to normal performance in Parkinson's disease (PD), despite the ongoing neural loss. Functional compensation typically proceeds in an inverse U‐shaped manner: compensation initiates in the prodromal phase, followed by an increasing episode until plateauing and diminishes in the advanced stages of the disease. The first evidence of the structural compensation was reported by functional magnetic resonance imaging studies. Recent studies, which have used diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) as the basis for their investigation, have shown improved white matter diffusional properties both in motor‐ and non‐motor‐related structures in association with improved clinical scores in patients with PD. The majority of DTI studies have demonstrated microstructural compensation in the prodromal/early stages of PD at the regional scale. However, there have been reports of compensation in later stages of the disease and the whole‐brain/network scale that are probably due to the heterogeneous nature of PD. Although serving as a promising beginning to characterize compensation, lots remain to be clarified in understanding the underlying mechanisms of compensation and its structural pattern in PD. The existing knowledge gap necessitates studies that their main research questions are focused on structural compensation. This requirement becomes more apparent because structural compensation evidence has mostly emerged from the post hoc analysis of data and incidental findings of studies. Thus, future studies are required to investigate compensatory microstructural changes in PD to clarify the exact underlying mechanisms. These studies would also provide a basis to develop clinical improvements in the early diagnosis and management of PD.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The prenatal and early postnatal stages represent a critical time window for human brain development. Interestingly, this window partly overlaps with the maturation of the intestinal flora (microbiota) that play a critical role in the bidirectional communication between the central and the enteric nervous systems (microbiota‐gut‐brain axis). The microbial composition has important influences on general health and the development of several organ systems, such as the gastrointestinal tract, the immune system, and also the brain. Clinical studies have shown that microbiota alterations are associated with a wide range of neuropsychiatric disorders including autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder. In this review, we dissect the link between these neuropsychiatric disorders and the intestinal microbiota by focusing on their effect on synaptic pruning, a vital process in the maturation and establishing efficient functioning of the brain. We discuss in detail how synaptic pruning is dysregulated differently in the aforementioned neuropsychiatric disorders and how it can be influenced by dysbiosis and/or changes in the intestinal microbiota composition. We also review that the improvement in the intestinal microbiota composition by a change in diet, probiotics, prebiotics, or fecal microbiota transplantation may play a role in improving neuropsychiatric functioning, which can be at least partly explained <i>via </i> the optimization of synaptic pruning and neuronal connections. Altogether, the demonstration of the microbiota's influence on brain function <i>via </i> microglial‐induced synaptic pruning addresses the possibility that the manipulation of microbiota‐immune crosstalk represents a promising strategy for treating neuropsychiatric disorders.</p>

<p>Maternal deprivation, a model of child neglect, increases VTA dopamine (DA) neuronal excitability through impaired interaction between AKAP150 and PKA resulting in GABAergic dysfunction. This neuroadaptation may be affected through HDAC2 and is reversible by in vivo HDAC inhibition suggesting the potential therapeutic efficacy of HDAC inhibitors in reversal of VTA DA dysfunction.</p>
<br />
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Traumatic early life stress (ELS) is linked to dopamine (DA) dysregulation which increases the probability of developing psychiatric disorders in adolescence and adulthood. Our prior studies demonstrated that a severe early life stressor, a 24‐hr maternal deprivation (MD) in juvenile male rats, could lead to altered DA signaling from the ventral tegmental area (VTA) due to impairment of GABAergic synaptic plasticity (promoting GABAergic long‐term depression, LTD) with concomitant changes in the abundance of synaptic regulators including A‐kinase anchoring protein (AKAP150). Importantly, these MD‐induced synaptic changes in the VTA were accompanied by upregulation of histone deacetylase 2, histone hypoacetylation, and were reversible by HDAC inhibition. Using cell‐attached and whole‐cell patch clamp recordings, we found that MD stress also increased spontaneous VTA DA neuronal activity and excitability in juvenile male rats without affecting intrinsic excitability. Postsynaptic chemical disruption of AKAP150 and protein kinase A interaction increased VTA DA neuronal excitability in control non‐MD rats mimicking the effects of MD on DA cell excitability with similar changes in membrane properties. Interestingly, this disruption decreased MD‐induced VTA DA hyperexcitability. This MD‐induced DA neuronal hyperexcitability could also be normalized at 24 hr after injection of the class 1 HDAC inhibitor, CI‐994. Altogether, our data suggest that AKAP150 plays a critical role in the regulation of VTA DA neuronal excitability and that HDAC‐mediated targeting of AKAP150 signaling could normalize VTA DA dysfunction following ELS thereby providing novel therapeutic targets for prevention of later life psychopathology.</p>

<p>Perivascular astrocyte processes (PAP, astrocyte endfeet) produce growth/differentiation factor 15 (GDF15), which is released and modulates the astrocyte morphological changes and tight junction strengthening. Astrocytes and tight junctions are disrupted in diseased conditions and can be restored by pharmacologically driven increased GDF15 production at PAP.</p>
<br />
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Perivascular astrocyte processes (PAP) surround cerebral endothelial cells (ECs) and modulate the strengthening of tight junctions to influence blood–brain barrier (BBB) permeability. Morphologically altered astrocytes may affect barrier properties and trigger the onset of brain pathologies. However, astrocyte‐dependent mediators of these events remain poorly studied. Here, we show a pharmacologically driven elevated expression and release of growth/differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) in rat primary astrocytes and cerebral PAP. GDF15 has been shown to possess trophic properties for motor neurons, prompting us to hypothesize similar effects on astrocytes. Indeed, its increased expression and release occurred simultaneously to morphological changes of astrocytes <i>in vitro </i> and PAP, suggesting modulatory effects of GDF15 on these cells, but also neighboring EC. Administration of recombinant GDF15 was sufficient to promote astrocyte remodeling and enhance barrier properties between ECs <i>in vitro </i>, whereas its pharmacogenetic abrogation prevented these effects. We validated our findings in male high anxiety‐related behavior rats, an animal model of depressive‐like behavior, with shrunk PAP associated with reduced expression of the junctional protein claudin‐5, which were both restored by a pharmacologically induced increase in GDF15 expression. Thus, we identified GDF15 as an astrocyte‐derived trigger of astrocyte process remodeling linked to enhanced tight junction strengthening at the BBB.</p>

<br />
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Individuals diagnosed with major depressive disorder not responding to at least two adequate treatments are defined as treatment‐refractory major depressive disorder (TR‐MDD). Some TR‐MDD patients have altered metabolic phenotypes that may be pharmacologically reversed. The characterization of these phenotypes and their underlying etiologies is paramount, particularly their genetic components. In this study, TR‐MDD patients (<i>n </i> = 124) were recruited and metabolites were quantified in their cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and peripheral blood. Three sub‐categories of deficiencies were examined, namely 5‐methyltetrahydrofolte (in CSF; <i>n </i> = 13), tetrahydrobiopterin (in CSF; <i>n </i> = 11), and abnormal acylcarnitine profiles (in peripheral blood; <i>n </i> = 8). Whole exome sequencing was performed on genomic DNA from the entire TR‐MDD cohort and exonic variant allele frequencies for cases were compared to a control cohort (1:5 matching on ancestry). Low frequency, damaging alleles were identified and used for <i>in silico </i> pathway analyses. Three association signals for TR‐MDD approached genome‐wide significance on chromosomes 22, 7, and 3. Three risk‐associated variants from a prior depression study were replicated. Relevant biological pathways were identified that contained an enrichment of rare, damaging variants in central nervous system (CNS)‐specific pathways, including neurotransmitter receptors, potassium channels, and synapse transmission. Some TR‐MDD patients had rare variants in genes that were previously associated with other psychiatric disorders, psychiatric endophenotypes, CNS structural defects, and CNS‐related cellular and molecular functions. Exome analysis of metabolically phenotyped TR‐MDD patients has identified potentially functional gene pathways and low frequency, deleterious gene variants for further investigation. Further studies in larger cohorts of biochemically phenotyped TR‐MDD patients are desirable to extend and confirm these findings.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>With high morbidity and mortality worldwide, injuries to the central nervous system (CNS) usually result in devastating consequences. However, the underlying mechanisms have not been fully understood and current therapies are still limited. Circular RNA (circRNA) is a novel type of endogenous noncoding RNAs, characterized by covalently closed annular structure. It is gradually recognized that circRNAs are involved in multiple biological processes, such as acting as microRNA sponges or scaffolds during the assembly of protein complex and modulating the transcription of certain genes. Interestingly, circRNAs have been found to be highly expressed in the CNS, which indicates their neurospecificity. Several circRNAs have already been discovered to be associated with multiple pathophysiological processes following neurological diseases. Currently, the molecular roles of circRNAs in CNS injuries have gained increasing attention, leading to uninterrupted relevant researches. Herein, we presented a review of current studies on the role of circRNAs in CNS injuries. The therapeutic potency of circRNAs in CNS injuries was also analyzed.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Perinatal hypoxic‐ischemic (HI)‐related brain injury is an important cause of morbidity and long‐standing disability in newborns. The only currently approved therapeutic strategy available to reduce brain injury in the newborn is hypothermia. Therapeutic hypothermia can only be used to treat HI encephalopathy in full‐term infants and survivors remain at high risk for a wide spectrum of neurodevelopmental abnormalities as a result of residual brain injury. Therefore, there is an urgent need for adjunctive therapeutic strategies. Inflammation and neurovascular damage are important factors that contribute to the pathophysiology of HI‐related brain injury and represent exciting potential targets for therapeutic intervention. In this review, we address the role of each component of the neurovascular unit (NVU) in the pathophysiology of HI‐related injury in the neonatal brain. Disruption of the blood–brain barrier (BBB) observed in the early hours after an HI‐related event is associated with a response at the basal lamina level, which comprises astrocytes, pericytes, and immune cells, all of which could affect BBB function to further exacerbate parenchymal injury. Future research is required to determine potential drugs that could prevent or attenuate neurovascular damage and/or augment repair. However, some studies have reported beneficial effects of hypothermia, erythropoietin, stem cell therapy, anti‐cytokine therapy and metformin in ameliorating several different facets of damage to the NVU after HI‐related brain injury in the perinatal period.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The extracellular matrix (ECM) provides protection, rigidity, and structure toward cells. It consists, among others, of a wide variety of glycoproteins and proteoglycans, which act together to produce a complex and dynamic environment, most relevant in transmembrane events. In the brain, the ECM occupies a notable proportion of its volume and maintains the homeostasis of central nervous system (CNS). In addition, remodeling of the ECM, that is transient changes in ECM proteins regulated by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), is an important process that modulates cell behavior upon injury, thereby facilitating recovery. Failure of ECM remodeling plays an important role in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis (MS), a neurodegenerative demyelinating disease of the CNS with an inflammatory response against protective myelin sheaths that surround axons. Remyelination of denuded axons improves the neuropathological conditions of MS, but this regeneration process fails over time, leading to chronic disease progression. In this review, we uncover abnormal ECM remodeling in MS lesions by discussing ECM remodeling in experimental demyelination models, that is when remyelination is successful, and compare alterations in ECM components to the ECM composition and MMP expression in the parenchyma of demyelinated MS lesions, that is when remyelination fails. Inter‐ and intralesional differences in ECM remodeling in the distinct white matter MS lesions are discussed in terms of consequences for oligodendrocyte behavior and remyelination (failure). Hence, the review will aid to understand how abnormal ECM remodeling contributes to remyelination failure in MS lesions and assists in developing therapeutic strategies to promote remyelination.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>This review article highlights the current state of perinatal depression (PND) research including established standards of care and innovative research in progress. PND can have a significant adverse impact on mother, child, and family; however, to date, wide‐scale identification, prevention, and treatment have been limited. PND is heterogenous in presentation with likely multifactorial etiologies for each woman. Challenges in PND research are discussed including a need for universal tools, standardized measures, benchmarks, and best practices. Current examples are reviewed that highlight approaches to novel treatment paradigms and interventions. This includes reviewing epidemiologic studies in PND research, examining the biological underpinnings of PND, and discussing examples from this field and other fields currently developing translational research that spans from bench to bedside. Current and future challenges and opportunities in developing best practices for the treatment of PND are outlined. We also discuss the use of the NIMH Research Domain Criteria approach for PND research and provide recommendations for future directions in PND research collaboration. In conclusion, greater precision in perinatal psychiatry can be possible in the future with the development of guidelines and best practices that build on current work and apply innovative and collaborative approaches of scientists, providers, patients, community members, and government officials.</p>

<p>Depressive symptoms during and after pregnancy were assessed with the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. Based on symptoms above clinical cut‐offs for depression, five distinct groups could be distinguished with different levels of depressive symptoms from during pregnancy through six months after childbirth. The associations were then tested between a number of background‐ and lifestyle‐, pregnancy‐, delivery‐, and postpartum‐related characteristics and these trajectory groups.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Maternal perinatal depression (PND), a common mental disorder with a prevalence of over 10%, is associated with long‐term health risks for both mothers and offspring. This study aimed at describing characteristics related to background and lifestyle, pregnancy, delivery, and postpartum of different PND trajectories defined according to the onset of depressive symptoms. Participants were drawn from a large population‐based cohort study in Uppsala, Sweden (<i>n </i> = 2,466). Five trajectory groups of depressive symptom onset were created using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale ≥13 (pregnancy) or ≥12 points (postpartum): (a) <i>healthy </i> (60.6%), (b) <i>pregnancy depression </i> (8.5%), (c) <i>early postpartum onset </i> (10.9%), (d) <i>late postpartum onset </i> (5.4%), and (e) <i>chronic depression </i> (14.6%). In multinomial logistic regressions, the associations between trajectories and the included characteristics were tested using the healthy trajectory as reference. Background characteristics (younger age, lower education, unemployment) were primarily associated with <i>pregnancy depression </i> and <i>chronic depression </i>. Characteristics associated with all PND trajectories were smoking prior to pregnancy, migraine, premenstrual mood symptoms, intimate partner violence, interpersonal trauma, negative delivery expectations, pregnancy nausea, and symphysiolysis. Nulliparity, instrumental delivery, or a negative delivery experience was associated with <i>early postpartum onset </i>. Postpartum factors (e.g., infantile colic, lack of sleep, low partner support, and bonding difficulties) were associated with <i>early  </i>and <i>late postpartum onset </i> together with <i>chronic depression </i>. The findings suggest that different PND trajectories have divergent characteristics, which could be used to create individualized treatment options. To find the most predictive characteristics for different PND trajectories, studies with even larger and more diverse samples are warranted.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Postpartum depression (PPD) is a devastating disorder affecting not only more than 10% of all women giving birth, but also the baby, the family, and the society. Compiling evidence suggests the involvement of the immune system in the pathophysiology of major depression; yet, the immune response in perinatal depression is not as well studied. The aim of this study was to investigate the alterations in peripheral levels of inflammatory biomarkers in 169 Swedish women with and without depressive symptoms according to the Edinburgh postnatal depression scale or the M.I.N.I neuropsychiatric interview at eight weeks postpartum. Among the 70 markers analyzed with multiplex proximity extension assay, five were significantly elevated in women with postpartum depressive symptoms in the adjusted LASSO logistic regression analysis: Tumor necrosis factor ligand superfamily member (TRANCE) (OR‐per 1 <i>SD </i> increase = 1.20), Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) (OR = 1.17) Interleukin (IL)‐18 (OR = 1.06), Fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF‐23) (OR = 1.25), and C‐X‐C motif chemokine 1 (CXCL1) (OR 1.11). These results indicate that women with PPD have elevated levels of some inflammatory biomarkers. It is, therefore, plausible that PPD is associated with a compromised adaptability of the immune system.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The transition to motherhood encompasses physiological and behavioral adaptations essential for the initiation and maintenance of offspring care and feeding and includes widespread changes throughout the brain. The growth of new neurons occurs across the lifespan in distinct regions of mammalian brains and changes dynamically across reproductive events in female mammals. The subventricular zone (SVZ) and dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus undergo high rates of neurogenesis in adulthood and are sensitive to hormonal fluctuations. Pregnancy and the postpartum period are associated with increased cell proliferation in the SVZ and interneuron survival in the olfactory bulb. In mice, peripartum prolactin signaling mediates SVZ neurogenesis and is important for enhanced olfactory recognition of offspring and maternal care. In contrast, cell proliferation and immature neuron survival decrease in the DG during the postpartum period. High baseline glucocorticoid concentrations suppress hippocampal neurogenesis, potentially representing an energetic trade‐off accompanying a reduced need for spatial navigation early postpartum. In women, hippocampal volume decline during pregnancy and partial recovery during the postpartum period could contribute to the risk of psychiatric illness. New evidence indicates that the dorsal raphe nucleus (DR) is an additional site for adult neurogenesis sensitive to reproductive experience and offspring contact. In this review, we discuss the initial and lasting impact of maternal experience on adult neurogenesis. Because neurogenesis has been implicated in a variety of psychiatric and neurodegenerative illnesses, understanding how reproductive experience alters new neuron production in maternal mammals has far‐reaching implications for women's health and wellness across the lifespan.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Pigment epithelium‐derived factor (PEDF) is a multifunctional protein which was initially described in the retina, although it is also present in other tissues. It functions as an antioxidant agent promoting neuronal survival. Recently, a PEDF receptor has shown an elevated binding affinity for PEDF. There are no relevant data regarding the distribution of both proteins in the brain, therefore the main goal of this work was to investigate the spatiotemporal presence of PEDF and PEDFR in the adult mouse brain, and to determine the PEDF blood level in mouse and human. The localization of both proteins was analyzed by different experimental methods such as immunohistochemistry, western‐blotting, and also by enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay. Differential expression was found in some telencephalic structures and positive signals for both proteins were detected in the cerebellum. The magnitude of the PEDFR labeling pattern was higher than PEDF and included some cortical and subventricular areas. Age‐dependent changes in intensity of both protein immunoreactions were found in the cortical and hippocampal areas with greater reactivity between 4 and 8 months of age, whilst others, like the subventricular zones, these differences were more evident for PEDFR. Although ubiquitous presence was not found in the brain for these two proteins, their relevant functions must not be underestimated. It has been described that PEDF plays an important role in neuroprotection and data provided in the present work represents the first extensive study to understand the relevance of these two proteins in specific brain areas.</p>

<p>Intersectional viral genetics allows for targeted expression in astrocytes. Olfactory bulb astrocyte calcium activity spatially matches neuronal activity patterns with odor stimulation. Manipulating astrocyte calcium activity alters neuronal activity and impacts olfactory behavior.</p>
<br />
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Astrocytes are the most abundant glial cell in the central nervous system. They modulate synaptic function through a variety of mechanisms, and yet remain relatively understudied with respect to overall neuronal circuit function. Exploiting the tractability of the mouse olfactory system, we manipulated astrocyte activity and examined how astrocytes modulate olfactory bulb responses. Toward this, we genetically targeted both astrocytes and neurons for <i>in vivo </i> widefield imaging of Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses to odor stimuli. We found that astrocytes exhibited odor response maps that overlap with excitatory neuronal activity. By manipulating Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity in astrocytes using chemical genetics we found that odor‐evoked neuronal activity was reciprocally affected, suggesting that astrocyte activation inhibits neuronal odor responses. Subsequently, behavioral experiments revealed that astrocyte manipulations affect both odor detection threshold and discrimination, suggesting that astrocytes play an active role in olfactory sensory processing circuits. Together, these studies show that astrocyte calcium signaling contributes to olfactory behavior through modulation of sensory circuits.</p>

<p>Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a complex sensorimotor disorder in which the role of the endogenous opioid system is not clear. This study suggests that the anemia of inflammation and loss of circadian variations in dopaminergic or serotonergic systems could underlie the pathogenesis of RLS.</p>
<br />
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is characterized by an irresistible need to move the legs while sitting or lying at night with insomnia as a frequent consequence. Human RLS has been associated with abnormalities in the endogenous opioid system, the dopaminergic system, the iron regulatory system, anemia, and inflammatory and auto‐immune disorders. Our previous work indicates that mice lacking all three subtypes of opioid receptors have a phenotype similar to that of human RLS. To study the roles of each opioid receptor subtype in RLS, we first used mu opioid receptor knockout (MOR KO) mice based on our earlier studies using postmortem brain and cell culture. The KO mice showed decreased hemoglobin, hematocrit, and red blood cells (RBCs), with an appearance of microcytic RBCs indicating anemia. Together with decreased serum iron and transferrin, but increased ferritin levels, the anemia is similar to that seen with chronic inflammation in humans. A decreased serum iron level was also observed in the wildtype mice treated with an MOR antagonist. Iron was increased in the liver and spleen of the KO mice. Normal circadian variations in the dopaminergic and serotoninergic systems were absent in the KO mice. The KO mice showed hyperactivity and increased thermal sensitivity in wakefulness primarily during what would normally be the sleep phase similar to that seen in human RLS. Deficits in endogenous opioid system transmission could predispose to anemia of inflammation and loss of circadian variations in dopaminergic or serotonergic systems, thereby contributing to an RLS‐like phenotype.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2020.00008">The (Un)Conscious Mouse as a Model for Human Brain Functions: Key Principles of Anesthesia and Their Impact on Translational Neuroimaging</a></h4>

<p>In recent years, technical and procedural advances have brought functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to the field of murine neuroscience. Due to its unique capacity to measure functional activity non-invasively, across the entire brain, fMRI allows for the direct comparison of large-scale murine and human brain functions. This opens an avenue for bidirectional translational strategies to address fundamental questions ranging from neurological disorders to the nature of consciousness. The key challenges of murine fMRI are: (1) to generate and maintain functional brain states that approximate those of calm and relaxed human volunteers, while (2) preserving neurovascular coupling and physiological baseline conditions. Low-dose anesthetic protocols are commonly applied in murine functional brain studies to prevent stress and facilitate a calm and relaxed condition among animals. Yet, current mono-anesthesia has been shown to impair neural transmission and hemodynamic integrity. By linking the current state of murine electrophysiology, Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging and fMRI of anesthetic effects to findings from human studies, this systematic review proposes general principles to design, apply and monitor anesthetic protocols in a more sophisticated way. The further development of balanced multimodal anesthesia, combining two or more drugs with complementary modes of action helps to shape and maintain specific brain states and relevant aspects of murine physiology. Functional connectivity and its dynamic repertoire as assessed by fMRI can be used to make inferences about cortical states and provide additional information about whole-brain functional dynamics. Based on this, a simple and comprehensive functional neurosignature pattern can be determined for use in defining brain states and anesthetic depth in rest and in response to stimuli. Such a signature can be evaluated and shared between labs to indicate the brain state of a mouse during experiments, an important step toward translating findings across species.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.00073">The Electrophysiological Determinants of Corticospinal Motor Neuron Vulnerability in ALS</a></h4>

<p>The brain is complex and heterogeneous. Even though numerous independent studies indicate cortical hyperexcitability as a potential contributor to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) pathology, the mechanisms that are responsible for upper motor neuron (UMN) vulnerability remain elusive. To reveal the electrophysiological determinants of corticospinal motor neuron (CSMN, a.k.a UMN in mice) vulnerability, we investigated the motor cortex of hSOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice at P30 (postnatal day 30), a presymptomatic time point. Glutamate uncaging by laser scanning photostimulation (LSPS) revealed altered dynamics especially within the inhibitory circuitry and more specifically in L2/3 of the motor cortex, whereas the excitatory microcircuits were unchanged. Observed microcircuitry changes were specific to CSMN in the motor column. Electrophysiological evaluation of the intrinsic properties in response to the microcircuit changes, as well as the exon microarray expression profiles of CSMN isolated from hSOD1<sup>G93A</sup> and healthy mice at P30, revealed the presence of a very dynamic set of events, ultimately directed to establish, maintain and retain the balance at this early stage. Also, the expression profile of key voltage-gated potassium and sodium channel subunits as well as of the inhibitory GABA receptor subunits and modulatory proteins began to suggest the challenges CSMN face at this early age. Since neurodegeneration is initiated when neurons can no longer maintain balance, the complex cellular events that occur at this critical time point help reveal how CSMN try to cope with the challenges of disease manifestation. This information is critically important for the proper modulation of UMNs and for developing effective treatment strategies.</p>

<p>Intramembrane-cleaving proteases (I-CLiPs) catalyze the hydrolysis of peptide bonds within the transmembrane regions of membrane protein substrates, releasing bioactive fragments that play roles in many physiological and pathological processes. Based on their catalytic mechanism and nucleophile, I-CLiPs are classified into metallo, serine, aspartyl, and glutamyl proteases. Presenilin is the most prominent among I-CLiPs, as the catalytic subunit of γ-secretase (GS) complex responsible for cleaving the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and Notch, as well as many other membrane substrates. Recent cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of GS provide new details on how presenilin recognizes and cleaves APP and Notch. First, presenilin transmembrane helix (TM) 2 and 6 are dynamic. Second, upon binding to GS, the substrate TM helix is unwound from the C-terminus, resulting in an intermolecular β-sheet between the substrate and presenilin. The transition of the substrate C-terminus from α-helix to β-sheet is proposed to expose the scissile peptide bond in an extended conformation, leaving it susceptible to protease cleavage. Despite the astounding new insights in recent years, many crucial questions remain unanswered regarding the inner workings of γ-secretase, however. Key unanswered questions include how the enzyme recognizes and recruits substrates, how substrates are translocated from an initial docking site to the active site, how active site aspartates recruit and coordinate catalytic water, and the nature of the mechanisms of processive trimming of the substrate and product release. Answering these questions will have important implications for drug discovery aimed at selectively reducing the amyloid load in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) with minimal side effects.</p>

Objective<p>Melatonin is the major hormone produced and secreted at night by the pineal gland into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and circulation. The relationship between plasma melatonin levels and Parkinson’s disease is not clear. The aim of the current study was to assess plasma melatonin levels in Parkinson’s disease (PD) patients and to analysis the relationship between plasma melatonin levels and non-motor symptoms.</p>Participants and Methods<p>In this cross-sectional study, we evaluated 61 patients with idiopathic PD [males n = 30 (49.2%), average age 62.4 years (range: 46–73 years)] and a total of 58 healthy volunteers [males n = 30 (51.7%), average age 64.3 years (range: 45–70 years)] who participated in the study. Plasma melatonin levels were measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The severity of disease in PD patients was scored by the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale and the Hoehn and Yahr Staging scale. The quality of life in PD patients was assessed by the 39-item Parkinson’s Disease Questionnaire. The non-motor symptoms were assessed by the 14-item Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale, the 24-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, the Parkinson Disease Sleep Scale, the Epworth Sleepiness Scale and the Non-Motor Symptoms Scale for PD.</p>Results<p>Compared with the healthy controls, the plasma melatonin levels were significantly higher in PD patients (12.82 ± 4.85 vs. 19.40 ± 4.23, P &lt; 0.001). Plasma melatonin levels were significantly associated with the levodopa equivalent daily dose (r = −0.262, P &lt; 0.05, n = 61). Higher plasma melatonin concentrations were detected in the negative cardiovascular symptom group than in the cardiovascular symptom group (20.13 ± 3.74 vs. 16.93 ± 3.74, P &lt; 0.05). Higher plasma melatonin concentrations were detected in the non-sleep-disorders group than in the sleep disorders group (22.12 ± 5.93 vs. 18.86 ± 3.66, P &lt; 0.05). In addition, the plasma melatonin concentration was higher in the group without gastrointestinal dysfunction than in the gastrointestinal dysfunction group (21.71 ± 4.44 vs. 18.35 ± 3.74, P &lt; 0.05).</p>Conclusion<p>This study revealed that the plasma melatonin levels in PD patients were significantly higher than those in healthy controls. Non-motor symptoms that were significantly negatively correlated with plasma melatonin levels were cardiovascular symptoms, sleep disorders, and gastrointestinal dysfunction. Plasma melatonin levels have the closest relationship with sleep disorders. There was a correlation between plasma melatonin levels and sleep quality in patients with PD. The remaining non-motor symptoms were not related to plasma melatonin levels.</p>

<p>The temporal pattern of action potentials can convey rich information in a variety of sensory systems. We describe a new non-invasive technique that enables precise, reliable generation of action potential patterns in tactile peripheral afferent neurons by brief taps on the skin. Using this technique, we demonstrate sophisticated coding of temporal information in the somatosensory system, that shows that perceived vibration frequency is not encoded in peripheral afferents as was expected by either their firing rate or the underlying periodicity of the stimulus. Instead, a burst gap or silent gap between trains of action potentials conveys frequency information. This opens the possibility of new encoding strategies that could be deployed to convey sensory information using mechanical or electrical stimulation in neural prostheses and brain-machine interfaces, and may extend to senses beyond artificial encoding of aspects of touch. We argue that a focus on appropriate use of effective temporal coding offers more prospects for rapid improvement in the function of these interfaces than attempts to scale-up existing devices.</p>

<p>The mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of deep brain stimulation (DBS) for Parkinson's disease (PD) remain poorly understood and are still under debate. This has hindered the development of adaptive DBS (aDBS). For further progress in aDBS, more insight into the dynamics of PD is needed, which can be obtained using machine learning models. This study presents an approach that uses generative and discriminative machine learning models to more accurately estimate the symptom severity of patients and adjust therapy accordingly. A support vector machine is used as the representative algorithm for discriminative machine learning models, and the Gaussian mixture model is used for the generative models. Therapy is effected using the state estimates obtained from the machine learning models together with a fuzzy controller in a critic-actor control approach. Both machine learning model configurations achieve PD suppression to desired state in 7 out of 9 cases; most of which settle in under 2 s.</p>

Background<p>Non-invasive neuromodulation is an emerging therapy for children with early brain injury but is difficult to apply to preschoolers when windows of developmental plasticity are optimal. Transcranial static magnetic field stimulation (tSMS) decreases primary motor cortex (M1) excitability in adults but effects on the developing brain are unstudied.</p>Objective/Hypothesis<p>We aimed to determine the effects of tSMS on cortical excitability and motor learning in healthy children. We hypothesized that tSMS over right M1 would reduce cortical excitability and inhibit contralateral motor learning.</p>Methods<p>This randomized, sham-controlled, double-blinded, three-arm, cross-over trial enrolled 24 healthy children aged 10–18 years. Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) assessed cortical excitability via motor-evoked potential (MEP) amplitude and paired pulse measures. Motor learning was assessed via the Purdue Pegboard Test (PPT). A tSMS magnet (677 Newtons) or sham was held over left or right M1 for 30 min while participants trained the non-dominant hand. A linear mixed effect model was used to examine intervention effects.</p>Results<p>All 72 tSMS sessions were well tolerated without serious adverse effects. Neither cortical excitability as measured by MEPs nor paired-pulse intracortical neurophysiology was altered by tSMS. Possible behavioral effects included contralateral tSMS inhibiting early motor learning (p &lt; 0.01) and ipsilateral tSMS facilitating later stages of motor learning (p &lt; 0.01) in the trained non-dominant hand.</p>Conclusion<p>tSMS is feasible in pediatric populations. Unlike adults, tSMS did not produce measurable changes in MEP amplitude. Possible effects of M1 tSMS on motor learning require further study. Our findings support further exploration of tSMS neuromodulation in young children with cerebral palsy.</p>

In Parkinson’s disease (PD) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD), decreased ability to smell is associated with early disease stages. Thus, olfactory neurons in the nose and olfactory bulb (OB) may provide a window into brain physiology and pathophysiology to address the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. Because nasal olfactory receptor neurons regenerate throughout life, the olfactory system offers a broad variety of cellular mechanisms that could be altered in AD, including odorant receptor expression, neurogenesis and neurodegeneration in the olfactory epithelium, axonal targeting to the OB, and synaptogenesis and neurogenesis in the OB. This review focuses on pathophysiological changes in the periphery of the olfactory system during the progression of AD in mice, highlighting how the olfactory epithelium and the OB are particularly sensitive to changes in proteins and enzymes involved in AD pathogenesis. Evidence reviewed here in the context of the emergence of other typical pathological changes in AD suggests that olfactory impairments could be used to understand the molecular mechanisms involved in the early phases of the pathology.</p>

<p>Static magnetic fields have been shown to induce effects on the human brain. Different experiments seem to support the idea that moderate static magnetic field can exert some influence on the gating processes of the membrane channels. In this article we visit the order of magnitude of the energy magnetic terms associated with moderate applied field (between 10 and 200 milliteslas). It is shown that gradients of the Zeeman energy associated with the inhomogeneous applied fields can induce pressures of the order of 10<sup>–2</sup>Pa. The surface tension generated by the magnetic pressure, on the surface delimiting the brain region subject to relevant field and gradients, is found to range between 10<sup>–1</sup> and 1 mN⋅m<sup>–1</sup>. These pressures seem to be strong enough to interfere with the elastic and electrostatic energies involved in the channel activation-inactivation-deactivation mechanisms of biological membranes. It has been described that small mechanical force can activate voltage gated potassium channels. Moreover, stretch-activated ion channels are widely described in different biological tissues. Virtually, all these channels can modify their activity if stressed by a sufficient pressure delivered for enough time. We propose mechanical stimulation – possibly not exclusively – as a candidate mechanism how static magnetic field can produce effects in biological systems. It must be emphasized, that such field gradients were not previously proposed as a possible source of neural activity modification.</p>

<p>The technology for producing microelectrode arrays (MEAs) has been developing since the 1970s and extracellular electrophysiological recordings have become well established in neuroscience, drug screening and cardiology. MEAs allow monitoring of long-term spiking activity of large ensembles of excitable cells noninvasively with high temporal resolution and mapping its spatial features. However, their inability to register subthreshold potentials, such as intrinsic membrane oscillations and synaptic potentials, has inspired a number of laboratories to search for alternatives to bypass the restrictions and/or increase the sensitivity of microelectrodes. In this study, we present the fabrication and in vitro experimental validation of arrays of PEDOT:PSS-coated 3D ultramicroelectrodes, with the best-reported combination of small size and low electrochemical impedance. We observed that this type of microelectrode does not alter neuronal network biological properties, improves the signal quality of extracellular recordings and exhibits higher selectivity toward single unit recordings. With fabrication processes simpler than those reported in the literature for similar electrodes, our technology is a promising tool for study of neuronal networks.</p>

<p>Protease-activated receptors (PARs) are involved not only in hemostasis but also in the development of ischemic brain injury. In the present work, we examined in vivo effects of a new peptide (AP9) composing Asn<sup>47</sup>-Phen<sup>55</sup> of PAR1 “tethered ligand” generated by activated protein C. We chose a mouse model of photothrombosis (PT)-induced ischemia to assess AP9 effects in vivo. To reveal the molecular mechanism of AP9 action, mice lacking β-arrestin-2 were used. AP9 was injected intravenously once 10 min before PT at doses of 0.2, 2, or 20 mg/kg, or twice, that is, 10 min before and 1 h after PT at a dose of 20 mg/kg. Lesion volume was measured by magnetic resonance imaging and staining of brain sections with tetrazolium salt. Neurologic deficit was estimated using the cylinder and the grid-walk tests. Blood–brain barrier (BBB) disruption was assessed by Evans blue dye extraction. Eosin-hematoxylin staining and immunohistochemical staining were applied to evaluate the number of undamaged neurons and activated glial cells in the penumbra. A single administration of AP9 (20 mg/kg), as well as its two injections (20 mg/kg), decreased brain lesion volume. A double administration of AP9 also reduced BBB disruption and neurological deficit in mice. We did not observe the protective effect of AP9 in mice lacking β-arrestin-2 after PT. Thus, we demonstrated for the first time protective properties of a PAR1 agonist peptide, AP9, in vivo. β-Arrestin-2 was required for the protective action of AP9 in PT-induced brain ischemia.</p>

<p>Similarly to human population imaging, there are several well-founded motivations for animal population imaging, the most notable being the improvement of the validity of statistical results by pooling a sufficient number of animal data provided by different imaging centers. In this paper, we demonstrate the feasibility of such a multicenter animal study, sharing raw data from forty rats and processing pipelines between four imaging centers. As specific use case, we focused on T1 and T2 mapping of the healthy rat brain at 7T. We quantitatively report about the variability observed across two MR data providers and evaluate the influence of image processing steps on the final maps, using three fitting algorithms from three centers. Finally, to derive relaxation times from different brain areas, two multi-atlas segmentation pipelines from different centers were performed on two different platforms. Differences between the two data providers were 2.21% for T1 and 9.52% for T2. Differences between processing pipelines were 1.04% for T1 and 3.33% for T2. These maps, obtained in healthy conditions, may be used in the future as reference when exploring alterations in animal models of pathology.</p>

<p>Clinical multicenter imaging studies are frequent and rely on a wide range of existing tools for sharing data and processing pipelines. This is not the case for preclinical (small animal) studies. Animal population imaging is still in infancy, especially because a complete standardization and control of initial conditions in animal models across labs is still difficult and few studies aim at standardization of acquisition and post-processing techniques. Clearly, there is a need of appropriate tools for the management and sharing of data, post-processing and analysis methods dedicated to small animal imaging. Solutions developed for Human imaging studies cannot be directly applied to this specific domain. In this paper, we present the Small Animal Shanoir (SAS) solution for supporting animal population imaging using tools compatible with open data. The integration of automated workflow tools ensures accessibility and reproducibility of research outputs. By sharing data and imaging processing tools, hosted by SAS, we promote data preparation and tools for reproducibility and reuse, and participation in multicenter or replication “open science” studies contributing to the improvement of quality science in preclinical domain. SAS is a first step for promoting open science for small animal imaging and a contribution to the valorization of data and pipelines of reference.</p>

Background<p>Clinical tests for detecting central and peripheral shoulder fatigue are limited. The discrimination of these two types of fatigue is necessary to better adapt recovery intervention. The Kinematic Theory of Rapid Human Movements describes the neuromotor impulse response using lognormal functions and has many applications in pathology detection. The ideal motor control is modeled and a change in the neuromuscular system is reflected in parameters extracted according to this theory.</p>Objective<p>The objective of this study was to assess whether a shoulder neuromuscular fatigue could be detected through parameters describing the theory, if there is the possibility to discriminate central from peripheral fatigue, and which handwriting test gives the most relevant information on fatigue.</p>Methods<p>Twenty healthy participants performed two sessions of fast stroke handwriting on a tablet, before and after a shoulder fatigue. The fatigue was in internal rotation for one session and in external rotation during the other session. The drawings consisted of simple strokes, triangles, horizontal, and vertical oscillations. Parameters of these strokes were extracted according to the Sigma–Lognormal model of the Kinematic Theory. The evolution of each participant was analyzed through a U-Mann–Whitney test for individual comparisons. A Hotelling’s T<sup>2</sup>-test and a U-Mann–Whitney test were also performed on all participants to assess the group evolution after fatigue. Moreover, a correlation among parameters was calculated through Spearman coefficients to assess intrinsic parameters properties of each handwriting test.</p>Results<p>Central and peripheral parameters were statistically different before and after fatigue with a possibility to discriminate them. Participants had various responses to fatigue. However, when considering the group, parameters related to the motor program execution showed significant increase in the handwriting tests after shoulder fatigue. The test of simple strokes permits to know more specifically where the fatigue comes from, whereas the oscillations tests were the most sensitive to fatigue.</p>Conclusion<p>The results of this study suggest that the Sigma–Lognormal model of the Kinematic Theory is an innovative approach for fatigue detection with discrimination between the central and peripheral systems. Overall, there is a possibility to implement the setting for clinics and sports personalized follow-up.</p>

<p>Much is known about electroencephalograph (EEG) patterns during sleep, but until recently, it was difficult to study EEG patterns during conscious, awake behavior. Technological advances such as powerful wireless EEG systems have led to a renewed interest in EEG as a clinical and research tool for studying real-time changes in the brain. We report here the first normative study of EEG activity while healthy young adults completed a series of cognitive tests recently published by the National Institutes of Health Toolbox Cognitive Battery (NIH-TCB), a commonly-used standardized measure of cognition primarily used in clinical populations. In this preliminary study using a wireless EEG system, we examined power spectral density (PSD) in four EEG frequency bands. During baseline and cognitive testing, PSD activity for the lower frequency bands (theta and alpha) was greater, relative to the higher frequency bands (beta and gamma), suggesting participants were relaxed and mentally alert. Alpha, beta and gamma activity was increased during a memory test compared to two other, less demanding executive function tests. Gamma activity was also inversely correlated with performance on the memory test, consistent with the neural efficiency hypothesis which proposes that better cognitive performance may link with lower cortical energy consumption. In summary, our study suggests that cognitive performance is related to the dynamics of EEG activity in a normative young adult population.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2020.00041">An Active Inference Approach to Modeling Structure Learning: Concept Learning as an Example Case</a></h4>

<p>Within computational neuroscience, the algorithmic and neural basis of structure learning remains poorly understood. Concept learning is one primary example, which requires both a type of internal model expansion process (adding novel hidden states that explain new observations), and a model reduction process (merging different states into one underlying cause and thus reducing model complexity via meta-learning). Although various algorithmic models of concept learning have been proposed within machine learning and cognitive science, many are limited to various degrees by an inability to generalize, the need for very large amounts of training data, and/or insufficiently established biological plausibility. Using concept learning as an example case, we introduce a novel approach for modeling structure learning—and specifically state-space expansion and reduction—within the active inference framework and its accompanying neural process theory. Our aim is to demonstrate its potential to facilitate a novel line of active inference research in this area. The approach we lay out is based on the idea that a generative model can be equipped with extra (hidden state or cause) “slots” that can be engaged when an agent learns about novel concepts. This can be combined with a Bayesian model reduction process, in which any concept learning—associated with these slots—can be reset in favor of a simpler model with higher model evidence. We use simulations to illustrate this model's ability to add new concepts to its state space (with relatively few observations) and increase the granularity of the concepts it currently possesses. We also simulate the predicted neural basis of these processes. We further show that it can accomplish a simple form of “one-shot” generalization to new stimuli. Although deliberately simple, these simulation results highlight ways in which active inference could offer useful resources in developing neurocomputational models of structure learning. They provide a template for how future active inference research could apply this approach to real-world structure learning problems and assess the added utility it may offer.</p>

<p>Conscious awareness plays a major role in human cognition and adaptive behavior, though its function in multisensory integration is not yet fully understood, hence, questions remain: How does the brain integrate the incoming multisensory signals with respect to different external environments? How are the roles of these multisensory signals defined to adhere to the anticipated behavioral-constraint of the environment? This work seeks to articulate a novel theory on conscious multisensory integration (CMI) that addresses the aforementioned research challenges. Specifically, the well-established contextual field (CF) in pyramidal cells and coherent infomax theory (Kay et al., 1998; Kay and Phillips, 2011) is split into two functionally distinctive integrated input fields: local contextual field (LCF) and universal contextual field (UCF). LCF defines the modulatory sensory signal coming from some other parts of the brain (in principle from anywhere in space-time) and UCF defines the outside environment and anticipated behavior (based on past learning and reasoning). Both LCF and UCF are integrated with the receptive field (RF) to develop a new class of contextually-adaptive neuron (CAN), which adapts to changing environments. The proposed theory is evaluated using human contextual audio-visual (AV) speech modeling. Simulation results provide new insights into contextual modulation and selective multisensory information amplification/suppression. The central hypothesis reviewed here suggests that the pyramidal cell, in addition to the classical excitatory and inhibitory signals, receives LCF and UCF inputs. The UCF (as a steering force or tuner) plays a decisive role in precisely selecting whether to amplify/suppress the transmission of relevant/irrelevant feedforward signals, without changing the content e.g., which information is worth paying more attention to? This, as opposed to, unconditional excitatory and inhibitory activity in existing deep neural networks (DNNs), is called conditional amplification/suppression.</p>

<p>Extracellular ATP and serotonin (5-HT) are powerful triggers of nociceptive firing in the meninges, a process supporting headache and whose cellular mechanisms are incompletely understood. The current study aimed to develop, with the neurosimulator NEURON, a novel approach to explore in silico the molecular determinants of the long-lasting, pulsatile nature of migraine attacks. The present model included ATP and 5-HT release, ATP diffusion and hydrolysis, 5-HT uptake, differential activation of ATP P2X or 5-HT3 receptors, and receptor subtype-specific desensitization. The model also tested the role of branched meningeal fibers with multiple release sites. Spike generation and propagation were simulated using variable contribution by potassium and sodium channels in a multi-compartment fiber environment. Multiple factors appeared important to ensure prolonged nociceptive firing potentially relevant to long-lasting pain. Crucial roles were observed in: (i) co-expression of ATP P2X2 and P2X3 receptor subunits; (ii) intrinsic activation/inactivation properties of sodium Nav1.8 channels; and (iii) temporal and spatial distribution of ATP/5-HT release sites along the branches of trigeminal nerve fibers. Based on these factors we could obtain either persistent activation of nociceptive firing or its periodic bursting mimicking the pulsating nature of pain. In summary, our model proposes a novel tool for the exploration of peripheral nociception to test the contribution of clinically relevant factors to headache including migraine pain.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00129">Senescence as an Amyloid Cascade: The Amyloid Senescence Hypothesis</a></h4>

<p>Due to their postmitotic status, the potential for neurons to undergo senescence has historically received little attention. This lack of attention has extended to some non-postmitotic cells as well. Recently, the study of senescence within the central nervous system (CNS) has begun to emerge as a new etiological framework for neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Parkinson’s disease (PD). The presence of senescent cells is known to be deleterious to non-senescent neighboring cells via development of a senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) which includes the release of inflammatory, oxidative, mitogenic, and matrix-degrading factors. Senescence and the SASP have recently been hailed as an alternative to the amyloid cascade hypothesis and the selective killing of senescence cells by senolytic drugs as a substitute for amyloid beta (Aß) targeting antibodies. Here we call for caution in rejecting the amyloid cascade hypothesis and to the dismissal of Aß antibody intervention at least in early disease stages, as Aß oligomers (AßO), and cellular senescence may be inextricably linked. We will review literature that portrays AßO as a stressor capable of inducing senescence. We will discuss research on the potential role of secondary senescence, a process by which senescent cells induce senescence in neighboring cells, in disease progression. Once this seed of senescent cells is present, the elimination of senescence-inducing stressors like Aß would likely be ineffective in abrogating the spread of senescence. This has potential implications for when and why AßO clearance may or may not be effective as a therapeutic for AD. The selective killing of senescent cells by the immune system via immune surveillance naturally curtails the SASP and secondary senescence outside the CNS. Immune privilege restricts the access of peripheral immune cells to the brain parenchyma, making the brain a safe harbor for the spread of senescence and the SASP. However, an increasingly leaky blood brain barrier (BBB) compromises immune privilege in aging AD patients, potentially enabling immune infiltration that could have detrimental consequences in later AD stages. Rather than an alternative etiology, senescence itself may constitute an essential component of the cascade in the amyloid cascade hypothesis.</p>

<p>Injury and inflammation cause tissue acidosis, which is a common feature of various painful conditions. Acid-Sensing Ion channels (ASICs) are amongst the main excitatory channels activated by extracellular protons and expressed in the nervous system. Six transcripts of ASIC subunits including ASIC1a, ASIC1b, ASIC2a, ASIC2b, ASIC3, and ASIC4 are encoded by four genes (Asic1–4) and have been identified in rodents. Most ASIC subunits are present at substantial levels in primary sensory neurons of dorsal root ganglia (DRG) except for ASIC4. However, their expression pattern in DRG neurons remains largely unclear, mainly due to the lack of antibodies with appropriate specificity. In this study, we examined in detail the expression pattern of ASIC1-3 subunits, including splice variants, in different populations of DRG neurons in adult mice using an in situ hybridization technique (RNAscope) with high sensitivity and specificity. We found that in naïve condition, all five subunits examined were expressed in the majority of myelinated, NF200-immunoreactive, DRG neurons (NF200<sup>+</sup>). However, ASIC subunits showed a very different expression pattern among non-myelinated DRG neuronal subpopulations: ASIC1 and ASIC3 were only expressed in CGRP-immunoreactive neurons (CGRP<sup>+</sup>), ASIC2a was mostly expressed in the majority of IB4-binding neurons (IB4<sup>+</sup>), while ASIC2b was expressed in almost all non-myelinated DRG neurons. We also found that at least half of sensory neurons expressed multiple types of ASIC subunits, indicating prevalence of heteromeric channels. In mice with peripheral nerve injury, the expression level of ASIC1a and ASIC1b in L4 DRG and ASIC3 in L5 DRG were altered in CGRP<sup>+</sup> neurons, but not in IB4<sup>+</sup> neurons. Furthermore, the pattern of change varied among DRGs depending on their segmental level, which pointed to differential regulatory mechanisms between afferent types and anatomical location. The distinct expression pattern of ASIC transcripts in naïve condition, and the differential regulation of ASIC subunits after peripheral nerve injury, suggest that ASIC subunits are involved in separate sensory modalities.</p>

<p>Musical training can induce the functional and structural changes of the hippocampus. The hippocampus is not a homogeneous structure which can be divided into anterior and posterior parts along its longitudinal axis, and the whole-brain structural covariances of anterior (aHC) and posterior hippocampus (pHC) show distinct patterns in young adults. However, little is known about whether the anterior and posterior hippocampal structural covariances change after long-term musical training. Here, we investigated the musical training-induced changes of the whole-brain structural covariances of bilateral aHC and pHC in a longitudinal designed experiment with two groups (training group and control group) across three time points [the beginning (TP1) and the end (TP2) of 24 weeks of training, and 12 weeks after training (TP3)]. Using seed partial least square, we identified two significant patterns of structural covariance of the aHC and pHC. The first showed common structural covariance of the aHC and pHC. The second pattern revealed distinct structural covariance of the two regions and reflected the changes of structural covariance of the left pHC in the training group across three time points: the left pHC showed significant structural covariance with bilateral hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus, left calcarine sulcus only at TP1 and TP3. Furthermore, the integrity of distinct structural networks of aHC and pHC in the second pattern significantly increased in the training group. Our findings suggest that musical training could change the organization of structural whole-brain covariance for left pHC and enhance the degree of the structural covariance network differentiation of the aHC and pHC in young adults.</p>

<p>Healthy aging is associated with deterioration of the sensorimotor system, which impairs balance and somatosensation. However, the exact age-related changes in the cortical processing of sensorimotor integration are unclear. This study investigated primary sensorimotor cortex (SM1) oscillations in the 15–30 Hz beta band at rest and following (involuntary) rapid stretches to the triceps surae muscles (i.e., proprioceptive stimulation) of young and older adults. A custom-built, magnetoencephalography (MEG)-compatible device was used to deliver rapid (190°·s<sup>−1</sup>) ankle rotations as subjects sat passively in a magnetically-shielded room while MEG recorded their cortical signals. Eleven young (age 25 ± 3 years) and 12 older (age 70 ± 3 years) adults matched for physical activity level demonstrated clear 15–30 Hz beta band suppression and rebound in response to the stretches. A sub-sample (10 young and nine older) were tested for dynamic balance control on a sliding platform. Older adults had greater cortical beta power pre-stretch (e.g., right leg: 4.0 ± 1.6 fT vs. 5.6 ± 1.7 fT, P = 0.044) and, subsequently, greater normalized movement-related cortical beta suppression post-proprioceptive stimulation (e.g., right leg: −5.8 ± 1.3 vs. −7.6 ± 1.7, P = 0.01) than young adults. Furthermore, poorer balance was associated with stronger cortical beta suppression following proprioceptive stimulation (r = −0.478, P = 0.038, n = 19). These results provide further support that cortical processing of proprioception is hindered in older adults, potentially (adversely) influencing sensorimotor integration. This was demonstrated by the impairment of prompt motor action control, i.e., regaining perturbed balance. Finally, SM1 cortex beta suppression to a proprioceptive stimulus seems to indicate poorer sensorimotor functioning in older adults.</p>

Kauvar, Machado, et al. have developed a new method, COSMOS, to simultaneously record neural dynamics at ∼30 Hz from over a thousand near-cellular resolution neuronal sources spread across the entire dorsal neocortex of awake, behaving mice. With COSMOS, they observe cortex-spanning population encoding of actions during a three-option lick-to-target task.

The human guanylate binding protein (hGBP1) is a mechano-chemical GTPase of the dynamin family that hydrolyzes GTP to GMP in two consecutive cleavage steps. Xavier et al. demonstrate that, although GMP production is dispensable for the restriction of C. trachomatis growth, it is required for NLRP3 inflammasome activation.

Interferon (IFN) signaling within the CNS is critical for synaptic plasticity and processes of learning and memory formation under physiological conditions.

Ménégaut et al. show that liver X receptor (LXR) agonists selectively increase IL1β mRNA levels independently of TLR activation. This effect, restricted to human macrophages, is mediated by an activation of hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) 1α through LXR. Accordingly, LXR agonists also potentiate other HIF-1α-dependent pathways, such as glycolysis.

Agarwal and Shendure show that deep neural networks can strongly predict mRNA abundance solely from promoter sequence. The residuals of these predictions facilitate inferences about the regulatory influence of enhancers, heterochromatic domains, and microRNAs. Model interpretation reveals that CpG dinucleotide content at core promoters is associated with transcriptional activity.

Accumulating evidence indicates that the human brain copes with sensory uncertainty in accordance with Bayes’ rule. However, it is unknown how humans make predictions when the generative model of the task at hand is described by uncertain parameters. Here, we tested whether and how humans take parameter uncertainty into account in a regression task. Participants extrapolated a parabola from a limited number of noisy points, shown on a computer screen. The quadratic parameter was drawn from a bimodal prior distribution. We tested whether human observers take full advantage of the given information, including the likelihood of the quadratic parameter value given the observed points and the quadratic parameter’s prior distribution. We compared human performance with Bayesian regression, which is the (Bayes) optimal solution to this problem, and three sub-optimal models, which are simpler to compute. Our results show that, under our specific experimental conditions, humans behave in a way that is consistent with Bayesian regression. Moreover, our results support the hypothesis that humans generate responses in a manner consistent with probability matching rather than Bayesian decision theory.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/gszthWlCb3w" width="1" />

<p>by Abhishek Varghese, Christopher Drovandi, Antonietta Mira, Kerrie Mengersen</p>

The Banana Bunchy Top Virus (BBTV) is one of the most economically important vector-borne banana diseases throughout the Asia-Pacific Basin and presents a significant challenge to the agricultural sector. Current models of BBTV are largely deterministic, limited by an incomplete understanding of interactions in complex natural systems, and the appropriate identification of parameters. A stochastic network-based Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible model has been created which simulates the spread of BBTV across the subsections of a banana plantation, parameterising nodal recovery, neighbouring and distant infectivity across summer and winter. Findings from posterior results achieved through Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach to approximate Bayesian computation suggest seasonality in all parameters, which are influenced by correlated changes in inspection accuracy, temperatures and aphid activity. This paper demonstrates how the model may be used for monitoring and forecasting of various disease management strategies to support policy-level decision making.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/msPvB3YIBRs" width="1" />

<p>by Kai Zheng, Zhu-Hong You, Jian-Qiang Li, Lei Wang, Zhen-Hao Guo, Yu-An Huang</p>

Found in recent research, tumor cell invasion, proliferation, or other biological processes are controlled by circular RNA. Understanding the association between circRNAs and diseases is an important way to explore the pathogenesis of complex diseases and promote disease-targeted therapy. Most methods, such as <i>k</i>-mer and <i>PSSM</i>, based on the analysis of high-throughput expression data have the tendency to think functionally similar nucleic acid lack direct linear homology regardless of positional information and only quantify nonlinear sequence relationships. However, in many complex diseases, the sequence nonlinear relationship between the pathogenic nucleic acid and ordinary nucleic acid is not much different. Therefore, the analysis of positional information expression can help to predict the complex associations between circRNA and disease. To fill up this gap, we propose a new method, named iCDA-CGR, to predict the circRNA-disease associations. In particular, we introduce circRNA sequence information and quantifies the sequence nonlinear relationship of circRNA by Chaos Game Representation (CGR) technology based on the biological sequence position information for the first time in the circRNA-disease prediction model. In the cross-validation experiment, our method achieved 0.8533 AUC, which was significantly higher than other existing methods. In the validation of independent data sets including circ2Disease, circRNADisease and CRDD, the prediction accuracy of iCDA-CGR reached 95.18%, 90.64% and 95.89%. Moreover, in the case studies, 19 of the top 30 circRNA-disease associations predicted by iCDA-CGR on circRDisease dataset were confirmed by newly published literature. These results demonstrated that iCDA-CGR has outstanding robustness and stability, and can provide highly credible candidates for biological experiments.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/uwMfW5XHIO0" width="1" />

<p>by Joseph Farris, Barbara Calhoun, Suhail Alam, Shaun Lee, Kasturi Haldar</p>

Monogenetic diseases provide unique opportunity for studying complex, clinical states that underlie neurological severity. Loss of glycine decarboxylase (<i>GLDC</i>) can severely impact neurological development as seen in non-ketotic hyperglycinemia (NKH). NKH is a neuro-metabolic disorder lacking quantitative predictors of disease states. It is characterized by elevation of glycine, seizures and failure to thrive, but glycine reduction often fails to confer neurological benefit, suggesting need for alternate tools to distinguish severe from attenuated disease. A major challenge has been that there are 255 unique disease-causing missense mutations in <i>GLDC</i>, of which 206 remain entirely uncharacterized. Here we report a Multiparametric Mutation Score (MMS) developed by combining <i>in silico</i> predictions of stability, evolutionary conservation and protein interaction models and suitable to assess 251 of 255 mutations. In addition, we created a quantitative scale of clinical disease severity comprising of four major disease domains (seizure, cognitive failure, muscular and motor control and brain-malformation) to comprehensively score patient symptoms identified in 131 clinical reports published over the last 15 years. The resulting patient Clinical Outcomes Scores (COS) were used to optimize the MMS for biological and clinical relevance and yield a patient Weighted Multiparametric Mutation Score (WMMS) that separates severe from attenuated neurological disease (p = 1.2 e-5). Our study provides understanding for developing quantitative tools to predict clinical severity of neurological disease and a clinical scale that advances monitoring disease progression needed to evaluate new treatments for NKH.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/WR12eOYB0U8" width="1" />

<p>by Vincent Cabeli, Louis Verny, Nadir Sella, Guido Uguzzoni, Marc Verny, Hervé Isambert</p>

The precise diagnostics of complex diseases require to integrate a large amount of information from heterogeneous clinical and biomedical data, whose direct and indirect interdependences are notoriously difficult to assess. To this end, we propose an efficient computational approach to simultaneously compute and assess the significance of multivariate information between any combination of mixed-type (continuous/categorical) variables. The method is then used to uncover direct, indirect and possibly causal relationships between mixed-type data from medical records, by extending a recent machine learning method to reconstruct graphical models beyond simple categorical datasets. The method is shown to outperform existing tools on benchmark mixed-type datasets, before being applied to analyze the medical records of eldery patients with cognitive disorders from La Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital, Paris. The resulting clinical network visually captures the global interdependences in these medical records and some facets of clinical diagnosis practice, without specific hypothesis nor prior knowledge on any clinically relevant information. In particular, it provides some physiological insights linking the consequence of cerebrovascular accidents to the atrophy of important brain structures associated to cognitive impairment.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/pHhrrFVoAqM" width="1" />

<p>by Yuan Zhao, Jacob L. Yates, Aaron J. Levi, Alexander C. Huk, Il Memming Park</p>

For stimuli near perceptual threshold, the trial-by-trial activity of single neurons in many sensory areas is correlated with the animal’s perceptual report. This phenomenon has often been attributed to feedforward readout of the neural activity by the downstream decision-making circuits. The interpretation of choice-correlated activity is quite ambiguous, but its meaning can be better understood in the light of population-wide correlations among sensory neurons. Using a statistical nonlinear dimensionality reduction technique on single-trial ensemble recordings from the middle temporal (MT) area during perceptual-decision-making, we extracted low-dimensional latent factors that captured the population-wide fluctuations. We dissected the particular contributions of sensory-driven versus choice-correlated activity in the low-dimensional population code. We found that the latent factors strongly encoded the direction of the stimulus in single dimension with a temporal signature similar to that of single MT neurons. If the downstream circuit were optimally utilizing this information, choice-correlated signals should be aligned with this stimulus encoding dimension. Surprisingly, we found that a large component of the choice information resides in the subspace orthogonal to the stimulus representation inconsistent with the optimal readout view. This misaligned choice information allows the feedforward sensory information to coexist with the decision-making process. The time course of these signals suggest that this misaligned contribution likely is feedback from the downstream areas. We hypothesize that this non-corrupting choice-correlated feedback might be related to learning or reinforcing sensory-motor relations in the sensory population.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/i2p-pPqQmFM" width="1" />

<p>by Marie Berenguer, Karolin F. Meyer, Jun Yin, Gregg Duester</p>

Identification of target genes that mediate required functions downstream of transcription factors is hampered by the large number of genes whose expression changes when the factor is removed from a specific tissue and the numerous binding sites for the factor in the genome. Retinoic acid (RA) regulates transcription via RA receptors bound to RA response elements (RAREs) of which there are thousands in vertebrate genomes. Here, we combined chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) for epigenetic marks and RNA-seq on trunk tissue from wild-type and <i>Aldh1a2</i>-/- embryos lacking RA synthesis that exhibit body axis and forelimb defects. We identified a relatively small number of genes with altered expression when RA is missing that also have nearby RA-regulated deposition of histone H3 K27 acetylation (H3K27ac) (gene activation mark) or histone H3 K27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) (gene repression mark) associated with conserved RAREs, suggesting these genes function downstream of RA. RA-regulated epigenetic marks were identified near RA target genes already known to be required for body axis and limb formation, thus validating our approach; plus, many other candidate RA target genes were found. Nuclear receptor 2f1 (<i>Nr2f1</i>) and nuclear receptor 2f2 (<i>Nr2f2</i>) in addition to Meis homeobox 1 (<i>Meis1</i>) and Meis homeobox <i>2</i> (<i>Meis2)</i> gene family members were identified by our approach, and double knockouts of each family demonstrated previously unknown requirements for body axis and/or limb formation. A similar epigenetic approach can be used to determine the target genes for any transcriptional regulator for which a knockout is available.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/IguCTmU-Yjs" width="1" />

<p>by Jon M. Laurent, Riddhiman K. Garge, Ashley I. Teufel, Claus O. Wilke, Aashiq H. Kachroo, Edward M. Marcotte</p>

Despite over a billion years of evolutionary divergence, several thousand human genes possess clearly identifiable orthologs in yeast, and many have undergone lineage-specific duplications in one or both lineages. These duplicated genes may have been free to diverge in function since their expansion, and it is unclear how or at what rate ancestral functions are retained or partitioned among co-orthologs between species and within gene families. Thus, in order to investigate how ancestral functions are retained or lost post-duplication, we systematically replaced hundreds of essential yeast genes with their human orthologs from gene families that have undergone lineage-specific duplications, including those with single duplications (1 yeast gene to 2 human genes, 1:2) or higher-order expansions (1:&gt;2) in the human lineage. We observe a variable pattern of replaceability across different ortholog classes, with an obvious trend toward differential replaceability inside gene families, and rarely observe replaceability by all members of a family. We quantify the ability of various properties of the orthologs to predict replaceability, showing that in the case of 1:2 orthologs, replaceability is predicted largely by the divergence and tissue-specific expression of the human co-orthologs, i.e., the human proteins that are less diverged from their yeast counterpart and more ubiquitously expressed across human tissues more often replace their single yeast ortholog. These trends were consistent with in silico simulations demonstrating that when only one ortholog can replace its corresponding yeast equivalent, it tends to be the least diverged of the pair. Replaceability of yeast genes having more than 2 human co-orthologs was marked by retention of orthologous interactions in functional or protein networks as well as by more ancestral subcellular localization. Overall, we performed &gt;400 human gene replaceability assays, revealing 50 new human–yeast complementation pairs, thus opening up avenues to further functionally characterize these human genes in a simplified organismal context.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/r8aUy1SRxQo" width="1" />

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p><i>Astyanax mexicanus </i> is a teleost fish that is in the process of allopatric speciation. Ancestral <i>Astyanax </i> are found in surface rivers and derived blind forms are found in cave systems. Adaptation to life in nutrient poor caves without predation includes the evolution of enhanced food seeking behaviors and loss of defensive responses. These behavioral adaptations may be mediated by changes in catecholaminergic control systems in the brain. We examined the distribution of tyrosine hydroxylase, a conserved precursor for the synthesis of the catecholamines dopamine and noradrenaline, in the brains of surface and cave <i>Astyanax </i> using immunohistochemistry. We found differences in tyrosine hydroxylase staining in regions that are associated with nonvisual sensory perception, motor control, endocrine release, and attention. These differences included significant increases in the diameters of tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactive soma in cave <i>Astyanax </i> in the olfactory bulb, basal telencephalon, preoptic nuclei, ventral thalamus, posterior tuberculum, and locus coeruleus. These increases in modulation by dopamine and noradrenaline likely indicate changes in behavioral control that underlie adaptations to the cave environment.</p>

Abstract
<p>Vertebrate locomotion is orchestrated by spinal interneurons making up a central pattern generator. Proper coordination of activity, both within and between segments, is required to generate the desired locomotor output. This coordination is altered during acceleration to ensure the correct recruitment of muscles for the chosen speed. The transcription factor <i>Dmrt3</i> has been proposed to shape the patterned output at different gaits in horses and mice. Here, we characterized <i>dmrt3a</i> mutant zebrafish, which showed a strong, transient, locomotor phenotype in developing larvae. During beat-and-glide swimming, mutant larvae showed fewer and shorter movements with decreased velocity and acceleration. Developmental compensation likely occurs as the analyzed behaviors did not differ from wild-type at older larval stages. However, analysis of maximum swim speed in juveniles suggests that some defects persist within the mature locomotor network of <i>dmrt3a</i> mutants. Our results reveal the pivotal role Dmrt3 neurons play in shaping the patterned output during acceleration in vertebrates.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>This mini‐review presents the view that contemporary approaches to stem the tide of opioid overdose deaths are insufficient to make a significant impact. Instead, a focus on the opioid receptor as the ultimate molecular target to directly abolish opioid overdose death is explored. After identifying the key brainstem neurons that control respiration which are inhibited by opioid drugs, genetic techniques targeting the <i>mu </i> opioid receptor are detailed which prevent opioid overdose. This receptor‐centric solution for the opioid overdose epidemic can be realized with existing technology and, with sufficient effort, could enter clinical trials within 5 to 10 years.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>We present here a thorough and complete analysis of mouse P0‐P140 prethalamic histogenetic subdivisions and corresponding nuclear derivatives, in the context of local tract landmarks. The study used as fundamental material brains from a transgenic mouse line that expresses <i>LacZ </i> under the control of an intragenic enhancer of <i>Dlx5 </i> and <i>Dlx6 </i> (<i>Dlx5/6‐LacZ </i>). Subtle shadings of LacZ signal, jointly with pan‐DLX immunoreaction, and several other ancillary protein or RNA markers, including <i>Calb2 </i> and <i>Nkx2.2 </i> ISH (for the prethalamic eminence, and derivatives of the rostral zona limitans shell domain, respectively) were mapped across the prethalamus. The resulting model of the prethalamic region postulates tetrapartite rostrocaudal and dorsoventral subdivisions, as well as a tripartite radial stratification, each cell population showing a characteristic molecular profile. Some novel nuclei are proposed, and some instances of potential tangential cell migration were noted.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) is a disabling neuropsychiatric disorder whose neurobiological basis remains unclear. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies have reported functional and structural alterations of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) in OCD. In this study, we explored the functional activity of subregions of the ACC and effective connectivity (EC) between ACC subregions and the whole brain in OCD. We used a Granger causality analysis (GCA) to identify the direction of information flow and whether the impact of that flow was excitatory or inhibitory. We performed resting‐state functional MRI in 31 patients with OCD and 36 healthy controls, and analyzed the amplitude of low‐frequency fluctuation (ALFF) and coefficient‐based GCA. The left pregenual ACC (pACC) in patients with OCD showed decreased ALFF relative to controls. There was significantly decreased excitatory output from the left pACC to both right dorsal superior frontal gyrus (dSFG) and left precuneus in patients compared with controls. Patients also had decreased inhibitory input to left pACC from left ventral SFG and left thalamus and caudate relative to controls. Results were similar in drug naive patients and those with prior but not current psychopharmacological treatment. In patients, path coefficients of GCA from left pACC to right dSFG showed significant negative correlations with obsession and anxiety ratings. Decreased spontaneous neural activity and altered EC of pACC with widely distributed cortical circuitry, and associations with clinical ratings highlight the importance of pACC functional alteration in OCD.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00127">The Functional Role of Spinal Interneurons Following Traumatic Spinal Cord Injury</a></h4>

<p>Traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) impedes signal transmission by disrupting both the local neurons and their surrounding synaptic connections. Although the majority of SCI patients retain spared neural tissue at the injury site, they predominantly suffer from complete autonomic and sensorimotor dysfunction. While there have been significant advances in the characterization of the spared neural tissue following SCI, the functional role of injury-induced interneuronal plasticity remains elusive. In healthy individuals, spinal interneurons are responsible for relaying signals to coordinate both sympathetic and parasympathetic functions. However, the spontaneous synaptic loss following injury alters these intricate interneuronal networks in the spinal cord. Here, we propose the synaptopathy hypothesis of SCI based on recent findings regarding the maladaptive role of synaptic changes amongst the interneurons. These maladaptive consequences include circuit inactivation, neuropathic pain, spasticity, and autonomic dysreflexia. Recent preclinical advances have uncovered the therapeutic potential of spinal interneurons in activating the dormant relay circuits to restore sensorimotor function. This review will survey the diverse role of spinal interneurons in SCI pathogenesis as well as treatment strategies to target spinal interneurons.</p>

Chang et al. demonstrate that, at eye opening, three distinct representations of orientation exist in the ferret visual cortex: one each for monocular stimulation and a third for binocular stimulation. Through experience-dependent processes, a unified binocularly aligned orientation representation develops, driven by concerted shifts in monocular orientation preferences.
