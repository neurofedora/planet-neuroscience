">Social threat alters the behavioral structure of social motivation and reshapes functional brain connectivity</a></h4>

              
                Traumatic social experiences redefine socially motivated behaviors to enhance safety and survival. Although many brain regions have been implicated in signaling a social threat, the mechanisms by which global neural networks regulate such motivated behaviors remain unclear. To address this issue, we first combined traditional and modern behavioral tracking techniques in mice to assess both approach and avoidance, as well as sub-second behavioral changes, during a social threat learning task. We were able to identify previously undescribed body and tail movements during social threat learning and recognition that demonstrate unique alterations into the behavioral structure of social motivation. We then utilized inter-regional correlation analysis of brain activity after a mouse recognizes a social threat to explore functional communication amongst brain regions implicated in social motivation. Broad brain activity changes were observed within the nucleus accumbens, the paraventricular thalamus, the ventromedial hypothalamus, and the nucleus of reuniens. Inter-regional correlation analysis revealed a reshaping of the functional connectivity across the brain when mice recognize a social threat. Altogether, these findings suggest that reshaping of functional brain connectivity may be necessary to alter the behavioral structure of social motivation when a social threat is encountered.

">Rapid rebalancing of co-tuned ensemble activity in the auditory cortex</a></h4>

              
                Sensory information is represented by small neuronal ensembles in sensory cortices. Neuronal activity shows high trial-by-trial variability in that repeated presentation of the same stimulus, e. g., multiple presentations of the same sound activate differing ensembles in the auditory cortex (AC). How the differing ensembles interact to selectively activate to process incoming sound inputs with reduced energy is unknown. Efficient processing of complex acoustic signals requires that these sparsely distributed neuronal ensembles actively interact in order to provide a constant percept. Here, we probe interactions within and across ensembles by combining in vivo 2-photon Ca2+ imaging and holographic optogenetic stimulation to study how increased activity of single cells level affects the cortical network. We stimulated a small number of neurons sharing the same frequency preference alongside the presentation of a target pure tone, further increasing their tone-evoked activity. We found that other non-stimulated co-tuned neurons decreased their tone-evoked activity while non co-tuned neurons were unaffected. This shows that co-tuned ensembles communicated and balanced their total activity across the network. The rebalanced activity due to external stimulation remained constant. These effects suggest that co-tuned ensembles in AC interact and rapidly rebalance their activity to maintain encoding homeostasis, and that the rebalanced network is persistent.

">Event structure sculpts neural population dynamics in the lateral entorhinal cortex</a></h4>

              
                Our experience of the world is a continuous stream of events which must be segmented and organized simultaneously at multiple timescales. The neural mechanisms underlying this process remain unknown. Here, we simultaneously recorded many hundreds of neurons in the lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) of freely behaving rats as we manipulated event structure at multiple timescales. During foraging as well as during sleep, population activity drifted continuously and unidirectionally along a one-dimensional manifold. Boundaries between events were associated with discrete shifts in state space, suggesting that LEC dynamics directly reflect event segmentation. During tasks with a recurring temporal structure, activity traveled additionally in directions orthogonal to the flow of drift, enabling the LEC population to multiplex event information across different timescales. Taken together, these results identify a hierarchically organized neural coding scheme for segmenting and organizing events in time.

	<p>While recent advancements have been made towards a better understanding of the involvement of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in the context of cognitive control, the exact mechanism is still not fully understood. Successful behavior requires the correct detection of goal-relevant cues and resisting irrelevant distractions. Frontal parietal networks have been implicated as important for maintaining cognitive control in the face of distraction. The present study investigated the role of gamma-band power in distraction resistance and frontoparietal networks, as its increase is linked to cholinergic activity. We examined changes in gamma activity and their relationship to frontoparietal top&amp;amp;ndash;down modulation for distractor challenges and to bottom&amp;amp;ndash;up distractor processing. Healthy young adults were tested using a modified version of the distractor condition sustained attention task (dSAT) while wearing an EEG. The modified distractor was designed so that oscillatory activities could be entrained to it, and the strength of entrainment was used to assess the degree of distraction. Increased top&amp;amp;ndash;down control during the distractor challenge increased gamma power in the left parietal regions rather than the right prefrontal regions predicted from rodent studies. Specifically, left parietal gamma power increased in response to distraction where the amount of this increase was negatively correlated with the neural activity reflecting bottom&amp;amp;ndash;up distractor processing in the visual area. Variability in gamma power in right prefrontal regions was associated with increased response time variability during distraction. This may suggest that the right prefrontal region may contribute to the signaling needed for top&amp;amp;ndash;down control rather than its implementation.</p>

                Background Congenital muscular torticollis (CMT) is a well-known diagnosis among physiotherapists specializing in pediatric care, especially when working with infants. However, knowledge of bilateral torticollis is limited. The purpose of this article was to describe how bilateral torticollis may present itself clinically. Case One infant with CMT with sternocleidomastoid tumor (SMT) on the right side, and some limitation in rotation towards the right side and in lateral flexion towards the left side, i.e, the muscle on the right side was shortened. While sitting with support, he tilted the head to the left and was stronger in the lateral flexors on the left side which fit well with a postural left-sided torticollis (PT). The other infant had bilateral muscular torticollis (MT), the sternocleidomastoid muscle thickened bilaterally, and both active and passive rotations were affected. The head was held in flexion, and active rotation was severely limited to both sides. For both cases the therapeutic interventions were to gain a normal range of motion (ROM) and a good posture of the head. Conclusions CMT can appear in different ways and may be bilateral. Both infants gained good ROM and better head position, however case I still needs some training. To gain more knowledge about bilateral CMT, we should follow these cases over a longer period of time. It is important to communicate and discuss our experiences with each other to understand rare cases of CMT.

                Introduction Treating the early phase of schizophrenia is crucial for preventing further episodes and improving quality of life, functioning, and social inclusion. Pharmacotherapies are first-line treatments, but have limitations. There is consensus on the need for non-pharmacological interventions for individuals in the early phase of schizophrenia. Several psychological interventions have shown promising effects; however, their comparative effectiveness remains largely unknown. To address this issue, a network meta-analysis will be performed. We aim to develop a hierarchy of existing psychological treatments concerning their efficacy and tolerability, which will inform treatment guidelines. Protocol Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating psychological interventions for first-episode psychosis, first-episode schizophrenia, or early phase schizophrenia will be included. The primary outcome will be overall schizophrenia symptoms (measured up to 6 and 12 months, and at the longest follow-up) and relapse as a co-primary outcome. Secondary outcomes are premature discontinuation; change in positive, negative, and depressive symptoms of schizophrenia; response; quality of life; overall functioning; satisfaction with care; adherence; adverse events; and mortality. The study selection and data extraction are performed by two independent reviewers. We will assess the risk of bias of each study using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool 2 and evaluate the confidence in the results using Confidence in Network Meta-Analysis (CINeMA). Subgroup and sensitivity analyses will be conducted to explore heterogeneity and assess the robustness of our findings. Discussion This systematic review and network meta-analysis aims to compare multiple existing psychological interventions, establishing which are best for symptom reduction, relapse prevention, and other important outcomes in early phase schizophrenia. Our results may provide practical guidance concerning the most effective psychological intervention to reduce symptom severity and the societal burden associated with the disorder.

                Background Physical activity is the second largest contributor to our total daily energy expenditure (EE). Uncovering ways to increase EE during activity could yield new approaches to treat obesity. The ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) regulates body weight by modulating muscle metabolism and sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activity. The VMH also mediates behavioral responses to predator threat. While the VMH is a potential mediator of metabolic responses to predator threat, the mechanisms are unknown. Methods and Results Exposing rats to predator odor (PO) exposure causes a rapid increase in skeletal muscle thermogenesis that peaks between 20-30 min and dissipates to baseline by 4 hr. This thermogenic response is associated with weight loss and increased EE even when controlling for physical activity. To probe potential targets of PO-induced metabolic responses in the VMH, we first performed qPCR for genes known to be involved in brain regulation of muscle metabolism using VMH samples from rats exposed to PO or control odor for either 30 min or 4 hr. Next, to uncover novel, relevant genes, we performed RNA-sequencing on VMH samples of rats exposed to either PO or control odor for 20 min. qPCR results show that after 4 hr of PO exposure, Bdnf and Sirt1 expression were increased. RNA-sequencing analyses further identified 245 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) that showed at least 1.5-fold change in expression due to PO exposure. Functional and Gene Ontology annotation showed that pathways related to immune response, oxidative stress, and synaptic plasticity were overrepresented among these DEGs. Discussion Taken together, these findings suggest that acute PO exposure induces both rapid and delayed changes in VMH gene expression that likely have downstream metabolic consequences.

                Background Preterm birth, which is child delivery before 37 weeks of pregnancy, is the primary cause of perinatal mortality worldwide. Preterm birth remains a major public health challenge in Rwanda, affecting approximately 13.8% of birth. The World Health Organization estimates that 15 million babies are born prematurely each year. While the association between periodontitis and preterm deliveries is increasingly recognized, little is known about this link in Rwanda. This policy brief aims to bridge this knowledge gap by presenting the findings of a recent study investigating the prevalence of periodontitis among pregnant women in Rwanda and its association with preterm deliveries. This policy brief also aims to inform and guide decision making towards incorporating periodontal screening into the antenatal care package in Rwanda. This has the potential to improve pregnancy outcomes and contribute to improved oral health in the future. Policy outcome and Implications Contemporary evidence has shown a six-fold increased risk of preterm delivery for women with periodontitis in Rwanda, with a concerningly high prevalence (60%) among pregnant women. Additionally, nurses working in antenatal clinics displayed insufficient knowledge about gum disease. Actionable recommendations The adoption of basic periodontal screening within existing antenatal care packages is recommended. This, coupled with nurse training and public awareness campaigns, can empower women and healthcare professionals to prioritize oral health for better pregnancy outcomes. Conclusions Integrating periodontal screening into antenatal care has the potential to significantly reduce preterm deliveries and contribute to a healthier future generation in Rwanda.

This study aimed to determine the differences in asthma symptoms and bronchodilator effect between oral doxofylline and oral procaterol in adults with asthma. Methods A crossover randomized controlled trial was conducted. Asthmatic patients aged 18 years or older with stable inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting beta2-agonists (ICS/LABA) treatment were included. Each patient received 2 weeks of treatment with either doxofylline or procaterol followed by a 1-week washout period and 2 weeks of treatment with the other drug. Asthma symptoms were assessed using the Asthma Control Questionnaire-5 (ACQ-5) scores, pulmonary function was assessed by spirometry with bronchodilator testing, and adverse events were recorded. Results A total of 21 patients were randomly allocated to either the doxofylline or procaterol groups. The mean age of the patients was 53.0±14.8 years. ACQ-5 scores were 1.4±1.1. After two weeks of treatment, the ACQ-5 scores and all pulmonary function parameters were not significantly different between the two groups (P>0.05). However, significant improvements in ACQ-5 scores were found in both groups (mean change: -0.381± 0.740, P=0.029 and -0.476± 0.873, P=0.021 for the doxofylline and procaterol groups, respectively). None of the patients experienced asthma exacerbations. Conclusions Doxofylline and procaterol can improve asthma symptoms, although they cannot enhance lung function. These oral bronchodilators might be used as an add-on therapy in asthmatic patients with persistent symptoms despite treatment with an ICS/LABA combination.

                Background The prevalence of depression among adolescents is an increasing global problem, including in Bangladesh as well. This cross-sectional data was collected to examine the physiological and psychological risk factors for depression among college-going adolescents in Bangladesh. Methodology Simple random sampling was employed as a sampling technique during the study period from May 2022 to August 2022. In the survey, a total of 1919 college-going adolescents were included through a Google-based questionnaire platform. The survey included socio-demographic characteristics and Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) questions. Before starting the survey, the questionnaire was translated and pre-tested in Bengali. To assess the dataset's feasibility and effectiveness, the pre-testing was done with a total of 43 adolescents. The questionnaire was revised several times before the final study to ensure it satisfied all standards. Conclusion This dataset may be valuable for researchers investigating the relationship between academic performance, psychological well-being, and other socio-demographic characteristics. To get a deeper understanding of the broader framework, policymakers may find it advantageous to enact policies that are specifically tailored to meet the needs and preferences of adolescents

                Abstract* Introduction Colopleural fistulas are rare and generally correspond to thoracic empyema alongside an acute abdomen. Early diagnosis and prompt treatment are essential to prevent recurrence of thoracic empyema. Case presentation An 18-year-old male was admitted to our hospital with dyspnea and abdominal pain. The patient had a history of a left diaphragmatic hernia repair. Physical examination revealed signs of left-sided pleural effusion and abdominal pain. Chest computed tomography (CT) revealed a left lung empyema with a suspected connection to the intra-abdominal cavity through the diaphragm. Colopleural fistula and diverticulosis were confirmed by colonoscopy. Subsequently, primary resection, transverse-descending anastomosis, and fistula suturing were performed, accompanied by empyema evacuation through thoracotomy and diverting colostomy. Clinical Discussion Colopleural fistula is an incredibly rare phenomenon that can result from diaphragmatic injury, malignancies, perforated diverticulosis, or colonic/pulmonary infections. The management of a colopleural fistula depends on anatomical, clinical, and other factors. Diverticulitis is usually treated using antibiotics and other conservative therapies. Diverticular disease usually requires surgery if there is perforation, progressive signs of sepsis or peritonitis, fistula, or failure of conservative treatment. A surgical procedure was performed in this case because of empyema arising from a colopleural fistula formation caused by diverticulosis. Conclusion Primary colon resection, colon anastomosis, fistula suturing, and decortication thoracotomy were shown to effectively treat colopleural fistula.

                Background Traditionally in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), centralised Ebola treatment centres (ETCs) have been set exclusively for Ebola virus disease (EVD) case management during outbreaks. During the 2020 EVD outbreak in DRC’s Equateur Province, existing health centres were equipped as decentralised treatment centres (DTC) to improve access for patients with suspected EVD. Between ETCs and DTCs, we compared the time from symptom onset to admission and diagnosis among patients with suspected EVD. Methods This was a cohort study based on analysis of a line-list containing demographic and clinical information of patients with suspected EVD admitted to any EVD health facility during the outbreak. Results Of 2359 patients with suspected EVD, 363 (15%) were first admitted to a DTC. Of 1996 EVD-suspected patients initially admitted to an ETC, 72 (4%) were confirmed as EVD-positive. Of 363 EVD-suspected patients initially admitted to a DTC, 6 (2%) were confirmed and managed as EVD-positive in the DTC. Among all EVD-suspected patients, the median (interquartile range) duration between symptom onset and admission was 2 (1-4) days in a DTC compared to 4 (2-7) days in an ETC (p<0.001). Similarly, time from symptom onset to admission was significantly shorter among EVD-suspected patients ultimately diagnosed as EVD-negative. Conclusions Since <5% of the EVD-suspected patients admitted were eventually diagnosed with EVD, there is a need for better screening to optimise resource utilization and outbreak control. Only one in seven EVD-suspected patients were admitted to a DTC first, as the DTCs were piloted in a limited and phased manner. However, there is a case to be made for considering decentralized care especially in remote and hard-to-reach areas in places like the DRC to facilitate early access to care, contain viral shedding by patients with EVD and ensure no disrupted provision of non-EVD services.

                Background The nursing workforce is crucial in healthcare systems worldwide and contributes to community well-being. also, Nurses experience numerous psychological, social, emotional, and behavioral shocks and challenges in their work. In Jordan, 43% of doctors and nurses suffer from high levels of burnout, around 55% experience high levels of emotional exhaustion, and 33% of doctors and nurses suffer from high levels of psychological pressure and job stress. Others found that 70% of nurses experience stress. these issues can be reduced by practicing self-care and psychological flow which impact in work-related tasks which are important in effectively addressing occupational stress healthily and soundly. This study aims to determine predictive ability of self-care and psychological flow in occupational stress among nurses Methods This study follows the quantitative technique. sample consisting of 476 nurses in Amman Jordan was chosen. Three scales were developed to meet the study objectives: Occupational stress scale, Self-care scale, and psychological flow scale. Results The study results indicate that self-care and psychological flow levels were low, while the occupational stress level was high. Also, there are a predictive ability of self-care and psychological flow in occupational stress among nurses. Conclusions This study shows that of self-care and psychological flow predict occupational stress among nurses, which helps us to manage the occupational stress among them by giving them self-care and psychological flow practices and healing time.

                <p>Animals use a combination of eye movements to track moving objects. These different eye movements need to be coordinated for successful tracking, requiring interactions between the systems involved. Here, we study the interaction between the saccadic and smooth pursuit eye movement systems in marmosets. Using a single-target pursuit task, we show that saccades cause an enhancement in pursuit following a saccade. Using a two-target pursuit task, we show that this enhancement in pursuit is selective toward the motion of the target selected by the saccade, irrespective of any biases in pursuit prior to the saccade. These experiments highlight the similarities in the functioning of saccadic and smooth pursuit eye movement systems across primates.</p>

                <p>Viruses, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), use respiratory epithelial cells as an entry point for infection. Within the nasal cavity, the olfactory epithelium (OE) is particularly sensitive to infections which may lead to olfactory dysfunction. In patients suffering from coronavirus disease 2019, deficits in olfaction have been characterized as a distinctive symptom. Here, we used the K18hACE2 mice to study the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection and inflammation in the olfactory system (OS) after 7&nbsp;d of infection. In the OE, we found that SARS-CoV-2 selectively targeted the supporting/sustentacular cells (SCs) and macrophages from the lamina propria. In the brain, SARS-CoV-2 infected some microglial cells in the olfactory bulb (OB), and there was a widespread infection of projection neurons in the OB, piriform cortex (PC), and tubular striatum (TuS). Inflammation, indicated by both elevated numbers and morphologically activated IBA1<sup>+</sup> cells (monocyte/macrophage lineages), was preferentially increased in the OE septum, while it was homogeneously distributed throughout the layers of the OB, PC, and TuS. Myelinated OS axonal tracts, the lateral olfactory tract, and the anterior commissure, exhibited decreased levels of 2',3'-cyclic-nucleotide 3'-phosphodiesterase, indicative of myelin defects. Collectively, our work supports the hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2 infected SC and macrophages in the OE and, centrally, microglia and subpopulations of OS neurons. The observed inflammation throughout the OS areas and central myelin defects may account for the long-lasting olfactory deficit.</p>

                Background Building Metagenome–Assembled Genomes (MAGs) from highly complex metagenomics datasets encompasses a series of steps covering from cleaning the sequences, assembling them to finally group them into bins. Along the process, multiple tools aimed to assess the quality and integrity of each MAG are implemented. Nonetheless, even when incorporated within end–to–end pipelines, the outputs of these pieces of software must be visualized and analyzed manually lacking integration in a complete framework. Methods We developed a Nextflow pipeline (MAGFlow) for estimating the quality of MAGs through a wide variety of approaches (BUSCO, CheckM2, GUNC and QUAST), as well as for annotating taxonomically the metagenomes using GTDB-Tk2. MAGFlow is coupled to a Python–Dash application (BIgMAG) that displays the concatenated outcomes from the tools included by MAGFlow, highlighting the most important metrics in a single interactive environment along with a comparison/clustering of the input data. Results By using MAGFlow/BIgMAG, the user will be able to benchmark the MAGs obtained through different workflows or establish the quality of the MAGs belonging to different samples following the divide and rule methodology. Conclusions MAGFlow/BIgMAG represents a unique tool that integrates state-of-the-art tools to study different quality metrics and extract visually as much information as possible from a wide range of genome features.

                Background Lectins are carbohydrate-binding protein domains. The C-type lectin designates a requirement for calcium for binding. Proteins contain C-type lectin domains that have a diverse range of functions, including cell-cell adhesion, immune response to pathogens, and apoptosis. This study aimed to investigate the characters of LvCTL-encoding genes from white-leg shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei) in Central Vietnam. Methods Two PCR products (LvCTL3 and LvCTL4) were cloned and sequenced. The structure and characterization of LvCTL proteins were predicted using bioinformatics tools. Results The results showed that the LvCTL3 gene was 444 nucleotides in length and 98.87% similar to the published LvCTL3 gene (accession number: KF156943). The polypeptide sequence had 147 amino acids, which were 97.28% identical to the reference sequence (AGV68681) and the LvCTL4 gene had a length of 417 nucleotides and homology of 99.52% compared to the published gene (KM387560). The deduced polypeptide sequence had 138 amino acids, and was 100% similar to the reference sequence (AKA64754). The LvCTL3 had a molecular weight of 16.91 kDa and an isoelectric point (pI) of 4.66, while LvCTL4 had 15.75 and 4.58 kDa, respectively. The structure prediction results showed that LvCTL3 and LvCTL4 had one domain (CTLD), LvCTL3 had two α helices and nine β sheets, and LvCTL4 had two α helices and eight β sheets. Conclusions Our results provide essential information for the heterologous expression and biosynthesis production of C-type lectins.

                Background Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is an aggressive malignancy with poor clinical outcomes. Hence cost-effective drugs with fewer side effects as a standard supportive therapy might yield substantial advantages in efficacy and safety. Kadukkai maathirai (KM) is being used as a supplement in hepatocellular carcinoma. We evaluated whether KM has any preventive action on cancer progression in diethyl nitrosamine (DEN) - induced HCC in rats. Methods DEN was injected to produce HCC in rats, which was confirmed after 16 weeks. All the rats were orally administered KM for 4 weeks. Hepatoprotective potential (serum AST, ALT, ALP, Bilirubin) and anticancer efficacy (body weight, nodule count, tumor progression by histopathology, expression of GSTM1 by Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), and In-silico analysis of phytoconstituents against β catenin and LRP analysis were evaluated. Results KM prevented cancer progression against DEN-induced HCC by an increase in GSTM1, a phase II detoxifying enzyme. It significantly reversed altered nodule count, relative liver weight, body weight, and histopathological features of HCC. In silico analysis of phytoconstituents of KM showed that they modulate the intracellular transcription process by inhibiting the armadillo repeat region of β catenin. Conclusions Our results elucidate the potential of KM as a supplement in HCC by reducing nodule count, protecting the liver from further damage, GSTM1 expression, and inhibiting armadillo repeat region of β catenin.

                Alien hand syndrome (AHS) is a rare neurological phenomenon first described by Van Vleuten over a century ago. The most widely recognized variants in literature are frontal, callosal, and posterior AHS. AHS due to the corpus callosum lesion can occur alone or as part of callosal disconnection syndrome (CDS). This report presents a unique CDS case manifesting clinical features from all three AHS variants, resulting from an extensive corpus callosum infarct. Our patient exhibited various clinical features from the three AHS variants, which include grasping, groping, and difficulty releasing objects from the hand (anterior); intermanual conflict (callosal); arm levitation, mild hemiparesis, and hemisensory loss (posterior). Additionally, the extensive disruption of the corpus callosal fibers produced neurological manifestations of CDS, such as cognitive impairment, ideomotor and constructional apraxia, behavioral disorder, and transcortical motor aphasia. We employed a range of rehabilitation interventions, such as mirror box therapy, limb restraint strategy, verbal cue training, cognitive behavioral therapy, bimanual hand training, speech and language therapy, and pharmacological treatment with clonazepam. The patient showed almost complete resolution of CDS and AHS features by nine months post-stroke Our case report highlights distinctive clinical variations of AHS and the challenging correlation between clinical manifestations and neuroanatomical substrates. Future studies are necessary to explore the intricate neural connections and the precise function of the corpus callosum. This can be achieved by combining comprehensive neuropsychological testing with diffusion tensor tractography studies. It is also essential to develop a validated tool to standardize AHS assessment. Finally, the scarcity of evidence in rehabilitation interventions necessitates further studies to address the wide knowledge gap in AHS and CDS management.

                <p>by Jack M. O’Shea, Peter Doerner, Annis Richardson, Christopher W. Wood</p>

Periplasmic binding proteins (PBPs) are bacterial proteins commonly used as scaffolds for substrate-detecting biosensors. In these biosensors, effector proteins (for example fluorescent proteins) are inserted into a PBP such that the effector protein’s output changes upon PBP-substate binding. The insertion site is often determined by comparison of PBP <i>apo</i>/<i>holo</i> crystal structures, but random insertion libraries have shown that this can miss the best sites. Here, we present a PBP biosensor design method based on residue contact analysis from molecular dynamics. This computational method identifies the best previously known insertion sites in the maltose binding PBP, and suggests further previously unknown sites. We experimentally characterise fluorescent protein insertions at these new sites, finding they too give functional biosensors. Furthermore, our method is sufficiently flexible to both suggest insertion sites compatible with a variety of effector proteins, and be applied to binding proteins beyond PBPs.

                <p>by Zijian Wang, Jan Hasenauer, Yannik Schälte</p>

Amortized simulation-based neural posterior estimation provides a novel machine learning based approach for solving parameter estimation problems. It has been shown to be computationally efficient and able to handle complex models and data sets. Yet, the available approach cannot handle the in experimental studies ubiquitous case of missing data, and might provide incorrect posterior estimates. In this work, we discuss various ways of encoding missing data and integrate them into the training and inference process. We implement the approaches in the BayesFlow methodology, an amortized estimation framework based on invertible neural networks, and evaluate their performance on multiple test problems. We find that an approach in which the data vector is augmented with binary indicators of presence or absence of values performs the most robustly. Indeed, it improved the performance also for the simpler problem of data sets with variable length. Accordingly, we demonstrate that amortized simulation-based inference approaches are applicable even with missing data, and we provide a guideline for their handling, which is relevant for a broad spectrum of applications.

                <p>by Natanael Spisak, Marc de Manuel, William Milligan, Guy Sella, Molly Przeworski</p>

The rates at which mutations accumulate across human cell types vary. To identify causes of this variation, mutations are often decomposed into a combination of the single-base substitution (SBS) “signatures” observed in germline, soma, and tumors, with the idea that each signature corresponds to one or a small number of underlying mutagenic processes. Two such signatures turn out to be ubiquitous across cell types: SBS signature 1, which consists primarily of transitions at methylated CpG sites thought to be caused by spontaneous deamination, and the more diffuse SBS signature 5, which is of unknown etiology. In cancers, the number of mutations attributed to these 2 signatures accumulates linearly with age of diagnosis, and thus the signatures have been termed “clock-like.” To better understand this clock-like behavior, we develop a mathematical model that includes DNA replication errors, unrepaired damage, and damage repaired incorrectly. We show that mutational signatures can exhibit clock-like behavior because cell divisions occur at a constant rate and/or because damage rates remain constant over time, and that these distinct sources can be teased apart by comparing cell lineages that divide at different rates. With this goal in mind, we analyze the rate of accumulation of mutations in multiple cell types, including soma as well as male and female germline. We find no detectable increase in SBS signature 1 mutations in neurons and only a very weak increase in mutations assigned to the female germline, but a significant increase with time in rapidly dividing cells, suggesting that SBS signature 1 is driven by rounds of DNA replication occurring at a relatively fixed rate. In contrast, SBS signature 5 increases with time in all cell types, including postmitotic ones, indicating that it accumulates independently of cell divisions; this observation points to errors in DNA repair as the key underlying mechanism. Thus, the 2 “clock-like” signatures observed across cell types likely have distinct origins, one set by rates of cell division, the other by damage rates.

                Background "324C+1D” movements are key techniques and winning factors in Wushu competitions. It is necessary for scientific training to analyze the kinematic characteristics of “324C+1D” by using the method of sports biomechanics. Methods In this study, 3D high-speed camera and 3D motion analysis software were used to study “324C+1D” completed by three Chinese wushu first-level athletes, and the kinematic characteristics of this movement were obtained. Results The run-up speed of completing the “324C+1D” is not high; The lift Angle of the center of gravity is close to 90°. The vertical height of the center of gravity is significantly higher than the vertical height of the center of gravity when landing, and the vertical moving distance of the center of gravity in the lifting stage is significantly less than the vertical moving distance of the center of gravity in the descending stage. The vertical height of the center of gravity at departure is significantly higher than that at landing. Conclusions In the take-off stage, increase the twisting Angle of shoulders and hips, speed up the swing arm speed and squat speed of the center of gravity in the vertical direction, and shorten the take-off time. Increase the vertical speed of the center of gravity before the patting foot and the vertical moving distance between the center of gravity lifting stage and the descending stage, extend the air time, accelerate the swing speed of the right leg, move the foot patting time forward to the rapid rising stage of the center of gravity lifting, accelerate the rotational angular speed of the shoulder shaft in the air stage and improve the strength of the leg, which is conducive to the athletes to complete the movement.

                Background Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) (Chittodvega) is one among many types of mental disorders explained in Ayurveda. It can be defined as a Chitta (mind) + Udvega (anxiety)= Chittodvega- Anxious status of a mind. Celastrus paniculatus also known as Jyotishmati. stimulates and improves the digestive fire and metabolism at a cellular level (Jatharagni and Majja dhatwagni). It can be correlated to GAD. GAD is characterized by feelings of threat, restlessness, irritability, sleep disturbance, and tension, and symptoms such as palpitations, dry mouth, and sweating. It affects women more frequently than men and prevalence rates are high in midlife (prevalence in females over age 35: 10%) and older subjects. In modern medicine the first-line psychological and pharmaceutical treatments are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) like sertraline (SNRIs). Aim and objectives To evaluate the comparative efficacy of Jyotishmati versus sertraline in the management of Chittodvega. Methods In this randomized active controlled double blind equivalence trial a total of 70 patients will be enrolled and divided into two equal groups. Patients between 20–50 years age of either gender having symptoms of Chittodvega and a Hamilton anxiety rating (HAM-A) scale score less than 24 (i.e., mild to moderate) will be selected for the study. In Group A, sertraline capsules 25 mg for first 7 days and then dose increased to 50 mg at bedtime for next 53 days and in Group B Jyotishmati Capsules 500 mg will be given twice a day after food with water for 60 days. Result and observation The patients will be assessed on the HAM-A scale, serum cortisol and WHO Quality of Life on day 0, 30, 60 and 90 and data will be analyzed using paired and unpaired t-tests for continuous variables and chi-square tests for categorical variables to evaluate whether treatments are equivalent.

                Introduction The commonest type of malignancy in the head and neck region is oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Brandwein provided a risk model that includes scores for the following three factors: worst invasion pattern, lymphocytic host response and perineural invasion. This risk model accounts for overall survival and local recurrence. p53 is considered to be one of the most significant prognostic markers. Objectives To assess and correlate Brandwein-Gensler criteria with p53 immunoexpression in oral squamous cell carcinoma. Methods In this study, a total of 80 samples will be included from histopathologically diagnosed OSCC patients will be taken for the study. H&E-stained slides of all cases will be evaluated using Brandwein-Gensler criteria and then immunostaining will be done for p53 immunoexpression. A correlation between Brandwein-Gensler criteria and p53 immunoexpression will be determined. The present study will assess and correlate Brandwein-Gensler criteria with p53 immunoexpression. If the Brandwein-Gensler criteria score increases, the intensity of p53 immunoexpression will also increase. Conclusions We hypothesize that Brandwein-Gensler criteria may be significantly correlated with p53 immunoexpression in OSCC.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92095">Homeostatic regulation of rapid eye movement sleep by the preoptic area of the hypothalamus</a></h4>

              
                Rapid eye movement sleep (REMs) is characterized by activated electroencephalogram (EEG) and muscle atonia, accompanied by vivid dreams. REMs is homeostatically regulated, ensuring that any loss of REMs is compensated by a subsequent increase in its amount. However, the neural mechanisms underlying the homeostatic control of REMs are largely unknown. Here, we show that GABAergic neurons in the preoptic area of the hypothalamus projecting to the tuberomammillary nucleus (POA<sup>GAD2</sup>→TMN neurons) are crucial for the homeostatic regulation of REMs in mice. POA<sup>GAD2</sup>→TMN neurons are most active during REMs, and inhibiting them specifically decreases REMs. REMs restriction leads to an increased number and amplitude of calcium transients in POA<sup>GAD2</sup>→TMN neurons, reflecting the accumulation of REMs pressure. Inhibiting POA<sup>GAD2</sup>→TMN neurons during REMs restriction blocked the subsequent rebound of REMs. Our findings reveal a hypothalamic circuit whose activity mirrors the buildup of homeostatic REMs pressure during restriction and that is required for the ensuing rebound in REMs.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91999">Expression of modified FcγRI enables myeloid cells to elicit robust tumor-specific cytotoxicity</a></h4>

              
                Despite the central role of T cells in tumor immunity, attempts to harness their cytotoxic capacity as a therapy have met limited efficacy, partially as a result of the suppressive microenvironment which limits their migration and activation. In contrast, myeloid cells massively infiltrate tumors and are well adapted to survive these harsh conditions. While they are equipped with cell-killing abilities, they often adopt an immunosuppressive phenotype upon migration to tumors. Therefore, the questions of how to modify their activation programming against cancer, and what signaling cascades should be activated in myeloid cells to elicit their cytotoxicity have remained unclear. Here, we found that activation of IgM-induced signaling in murine myeloid cells results in secretion of lytic granules and massive tumor cell death. These findings open venues for designing novel immunotherapy by equipping monocytes with chimeric receptors that target tumor antigens and consequently, signal through IgM receptor. Nonetheless, we found that myeloid cells do not express the antibody-derived portion used to recognize the tumor antigen due to the induction of an ER stress response. To overcome this limitation, we designed chimeric receptors that are based on the high-affinity FcγRI for IgG. Incubation of macrophages expressing these receptors along with tumor-binding IgG induced massive tumor cell killing and secretion of reactive oxygen species and Granzyme B. Overall, this work highlights the challenges involved in genetically reprogramming the signaling in myeloid cells and provides a framework for endowing myeloid cells with antigen-specific cytotoxicity.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/89918">Structural characterization of ligand binding and pH-specific enzymatic activity of mouse Acidic Mammalian Chitinase</a></h4>

              
                Chitin is an abundant biopolymer and pathogen-associated molecular pattern that stimulates a host innate immune response. Mammals express chitin-binding and chitin-degrading proteins to remove chitin from the body. One of these proteins, Acidic Mammalian Chitinase (AMCase), is an enzyme known for its ability to function under acidic conditions in the stomach but is also active in tissues with more neutral pHs, such as the lung. Here, we used a combination of biochemical, structural, and computational modeling approaches to examine how the mouse homolog (mAMCase) can act in both acidic and neutral environments. We measured kinetic properties of mAMCase activity across a broad pH range, quantifying its unusual dual activity optima at pH 2 and 7. We also solved high-resolution crystal structures of mAMCase in complex with oligomeric GlcNAcn, the building block of chitin, where we identified extensive conformational ligand heterogeneity. Leveraging these data, we conducted molecular dynamics simulations that suggest how a key catalytic residue could be protonated via distinct mechanisms in each of the two environmental pH ranges. These results integrate structural, biochemical, and computational approaches to deliver a more complete understanding of the catalytic mechanism governing mAMCase activity at different pH. Engineering proteins with tunable pH optima may provide new opportunities to develop improved enzyme variants, including AMCase, for therapeutic purposes in chitin degradation.

">Cardiometabolic health, cortical thickness, and neurotransmitter systems: a large-scale multivariate study</a></h4>

              
                There is a recognized link between risk factors for non-communicable diseases and brain health. However, the specific effects that they have on brain health are still poorly understood, preventing its implementation in clinical practice. For instance, the association between such risk factors and cortical thickness (CT) has been primarily explored using univariate/bivariate methods and global/lobar measures of CT and has yielded inconsistent results. In this work, we aim to study the relationship between risk factors for non-communicable diseases and CT. In addition, we adopt a systems-level perspective to understand such relationship, by integrating several brain features including brain structure and function as well as neurotransmitter systems. Here, we analyzed latent dimensions linking a broad set of risk factors for non-communicable diseases to parcel-wise CT across the whole cortex (including raw, proportional, and brain size-corrected measures). We used a multivariate approach (regularized canonical correlation analysis (RCCA)) embedded in a machine learning framework that allows to capture inter-individual variability and to assess the generalizability of the model. The brain patterns (captured in association with risk factors) were characterized from a multi-level perspective, by comparing them with patterns of brain structure, function, and neurotransmitter systems. Analyses were performed separately in women (n=3685, 46-81 years) and in age-matched men (n=3685, 46-81 years) to avoid sex-bias on the results. We found one significant latent dimension (women: rrange=0.25-0.30, p=0.005-0.005; men: rrange=0.31-0.34, p=0.005-0.005), capturing variability in cardiometabolic health, including physical activity, body morphology/composition, basal metabolic rate, and blood pressure. This cardiometabolic health dimension was linked to a CT axis of inter-individual variability from the insula and cingulate cortex to occipital and parietal areas. Interestingly, this brain pattern was associated with the binding potentials of several neurotransmitter systems, including serotoninergic, dopaminergic, cholinergic, and GABAergic systems. Of note, this latent dimension was similar across sexes and across CT measures (raw, proportional, and brain-size corrected). We observed a robust, multi-level and multivariate link between cardiometabolic health, CT, and neurotransmitter systems. These findings support the urgency of further investigation into the interaction between brain health and physical health and contributes to the challenge to the classical conceptualization of neuropsychiatric and physical illnesses as categorical entities. Therefore, regular monitoring of cardiometabolic risk factors may reduce their adverse effects on brain health and prevent the development of brain diseases.

">The spatial layout of antagonistic brain regions are explicable based on geometric principles</a></h4>

              
                Brain activity emerges in a dynamic landscape of regional increases and decreases that span the cortex. Increases in activity during a cognitive task are often assumed to reflect the processing of task-relevant information, while reductions can be interpreted as suppression of irrelevant activity to facilitate task goals. Here, we explore the relationship between task-induced increases and decreases in activity from a geometric perspective. Using a technique known as kriging, developed in earth sciences, we examined whether the spatial organisation of brain regions showing positive activity could be predicted based on the spatial layout of regions showing activity decreases (and vice versa). Consistent with this hypothesis we established the spatial distribution of regions showing reductions in activity could predict (i) regions showing task-relevant increases in activity in both groups of humans and single individuals; (ii) patterns of neural activity captured by calcium imaging in mice; and, (iii) showed a high degree of generalisability across task contexts. Our analysis, therefore, establishes that antagonistic relationships between brain regions are topographically determined, a spatial analog for the well documented anti-correlation between brain systems over time.

">Differential Effects of Haloperidol on Neural Oscillations During Wakefulness and Sleep</a></h4>

              
                The electrical activity of the brain, characterized by its frequency components, reflects a complex interplay between periodic (oscillatory) and aperiodic components. These components are associated with various neurophysiological processes, such as the excitation-inhibition balance (aperiodic activity) or interregional communication (oscillatory activity). However, we do not fully understand whether these components are truly independent or if different neuromodulators modulate them in different ways. The dopaminergic system has a critical role for cognition and motivation, being a potential modulator of these power spectrum components. To improve our understanding of these questions, we investigated the differential effects of this system on these components using electrocorticogram recordings in cats, which show clear oscillations and aperiodic 1/f activity. Specifically, we focused on the effects of haloperidol (a D2 receptor antagonist) on oscillatory and aperiodic dynamics during wakefulness and sleep. By parameterizing the power spectrum into these two components, our findings reveal a state-dependent modulation of oscillatory activity by the D2 receptor across the brain. Surprisingly, aperiodic activity was not significantly affected and exhibited inconsistent changes across the brain. This suggests a nuanced interplay between neuromodulation and the distinct components of brain oscillations, providing insights into the selective regulation of oscillatory dynamics in awake states.

">Synchronicity transitions determine connection fluctuations in a model of coupled oscillators with plasticity</a></h4>

              
                Sleep and rest are crucial for knowledge reorganization and creativity. During these periods, synapses between neurons are plastically altered and neuronal activities are collectively synchronized, accompanied by large differences in excitation-inhibition (EI) balance. These processes are assumed to be dissimilar from the learning process during task engagement. The detailed mechanism of how synchronized neuronal activities modify neural circuits via plasticity has yet to be fully understood. The Kuramoto model is utilized to study the collective synchronization of oscillators, including neurons. We previously proposed the EI-Kuramoto model, in which the EI balance was implemented in the Kuramoto model. The model alters its synchronicity based on the EI balance of the interaction strength. In this study, we developed this EI-Kuramoto model by implementing plasticity, leading to the plastic EI-Kuramoto (pEI-Kuramoto) model. Models with high inhibition displayed desynchronized dynamics and consistent connection strengths. Models with low inhibition exhibited bistable dynamics between synchronized and desynchronized states and fluctuation of interaction strengths in middle strength connections, while the strongest connections remained stable. These results, stabilizing a few strong connections and fluctuating the other connections in low inhibition conditions, could facilitate knowledge abstraction and reorganization. Our findings shed light on how varying inhibitory effects influence network stability and coupling, offering deeper insights into synaptic networks and knowledge reshaping.

">Posterior parietal cortex maps progress along routes sharing the same meta-structure</a></h4>

              
                Neurons of posterior parietal cortex were recorded as rats performed a working memory task within a network of intersecting paths. The specific routes utilized in task performance provided opportunity to contrast responses of posterior parietal cortex sub-populations to linear and angular velocity with more complex responses that map route progress. We found evidence for the presence of posterior parietal cortex neurons that generalize in their firing patterns across routes having the same shape but opposite action series. The results indicate that posterior parietal cortex has the capacity to generalize the mapping of route progress independent of the specific actions taken to move through those routes. We suggest that such encoding can form the basis for learning the meta-structural organization of a non-random path network structure, such as that commonly found in cities.

">The UPRER governs the cell-specific response of human dopaminergic neurons to mitochondrial stress</a></h4>

              
                Mitochondrial dysfunction is thought to be central to the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease. The preferential vulnerability of dopaminergic (DA) neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta to mitochondrial stress may underlie their massive degeneration and the occurrence of motor symptoms. Using LUHMES-derived DA neurons, we demonstrated that inhibition of the mitochondrial electron transport chain resulted in a severe alteration of mitochondrial turnover, pushing the balance towards mitochondrial loss, a reduction of the maturation status of the DA population and an increased proportion of apoptotic cells. PERK-mediated Unfolded Protein Response of the Endoplasmic Reticulum (UPRER) emerged as the key coordinator of the stress response, governing the inactivation of the mitochondrial UPR (UPRmt), the initiation of mitophagy and the cell-specific expression of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). Importantly, we discovered novel lncRNAs specifically expressed in human DA neurons upon stress. Among them, we showed that lnc-SLC6A15-5 contributes to the resumption of translation after mitochondrial stress.

">Adolescent Alcohol Exposure Promotes Mechanical Allodynia and Alters Synaptic Function at Inputs from the Basolateral Amgydala to the Prelimbic Cortex</a></h4>

              
                Binge drinking is common among adolescents despite mounting evidence linking it to various adverse health outcomes that includes heightened pain perception. The prelimbic (PrL) cortex is vulnerable to insults from adolescent alcohol exposure and receives input from the basolateral amygdala (BLA) while sending projections to the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray (vlPAG) - two brain regions implicated in nociception. In this study, adolescent intermittent ethanol (AIE) exposure was carried out in male and female rats using a vapor inhalation procedure. Mechanical and thermal sensitivity, assessed throughout adolescence and into adulthood, revealed that AIE exposure induced protracted mechanical allodynia in both male and female rats. However, a carrageenan inflammatory paw pain challenge in adult rats revealed that AIE did not further augment carrageenan-induced hyperalgesia. To investigate synaptic function at BLA inputs onto defined populations of PrL neurons, retrobeads and viral labelling were combined with optogenetics and slice electrophysiology. Recordings from retrobead labelled cells in the PrL revealed AIE reduced BLA driven feedforward inhibition of neurons projecting from the PrL to the vlPAG (PrLPAG neurons), resulting in augmented excitation/inhibition (E/I) balance and increased intrinsic excitability. Consistent with this finding, recordings from virally tagged PrL parvalbumin interneurons (PVINs) demonstrated that AIE exposure reduced both E/I balance at BLA inputs onto PVINs and PVIN intrinsic excitability when assessed in adulthood. These findings provide compelling evidence that AIE and acute pain alter synaptic function and intrinsic excitability within a prefrontal nociceptive circuit.

">Static and Dynamic Cross-Network Functional Connectivity Shows Elevated Entropy in Schizophrenia Patients</a></h4>

              
                Schizophrenia (SZ) patients exhibit abnormal static and dynamic functional connectivity across various brain domains. We present a novel approach based on static and dynamic inter-network connectivity entropy (ICE), which represents the entropy of a given network's connectivity to all the other brain networks. This novel approach enables the investigation of how connectivity strength is heterogeneously distributed across available targets in both SZ patients and healthy controls. We analyzed fMRI data from 151 schizophrenia patients and demographically matched 160 healthy controls. Our assessment encompassed both static and dynamic ICE, revealing significant differences in the heterogeneity of connectivity levels across available brain networks between SZ patients and healthy controls (HC). These networks are associated with subcortical (SC), auditory (AUD), sensorimotor (SM), visual (VIS), cognitive control (CC), default mode network (DMN) and cerebellar (CB) functional brain domains. Elevated ICE observed in individuals with SZ suggests that patients exhibit significantly higher randomness in the distribution of time-varying connectivity strength across functional regions from each source network, compared to healthy control group. C-means fuzzy clustering analysis of functional ICE correlation matrices revealed that SZ patients exhibit significantly higher occupancy weights in clusters with weak, low-scale functional entropy correlation, while the control group shows greater occupancy weights in clusters with strong, large-scale functional entropy correlation. k-means clustering analysis on time-indexed ICE vectors revealed that cluster with highest ICE have higher occupancy rates in SZ patients whereas clusters characterized by lowest ICE have larger occupancy rates for control group. Furthermore, our dynamic ICE approach revealed that it appears healthy for a brain to primarily circulate through complex, less structured connectivity patterns, with occasional transitions into more focused patterns. However, individuals with SZ seem to struggle with transiently attaining these more focused and structured connectivity patterns. Proposed ICE measure presents a novel framework for gaining deeper insights into understanding mechanisms of healthy and disease brain states and a substantial step forward in the developing advanced methods of diagnostics of mental health conditions.

">A bottom-up approach identifies the antipsychotic and antineoplastic trifluoperazine and the ribose derivative deoxytubercidin as novel microglial phagocytosis inhibitors.</a></h4>

              
                Phagocytosis is an indispensable function of microglia, the brain professional phagocytes. Microglia are particularly efficient phagocytosing cells that undergo programmed cell death (apoptosis) in physiological conditions. However, mounting evidence suggests microglial phagocytosis dysfunction in multiple brain disorders. These observations prompted us to search for phagocytosis modulators (enhancers or inhibitors) with therapeutic potential. We used a bottom-up strategy that consisted on the identification of phagocytosis modulators using phenotypic high throughput screenings (HTSs) in cell culture and validation in organotypic cultures and in vivo. We performed two complementary HTS campagnes: at Achucarro, we used primary cultures of mouse microglia and compounds of the Prestwick Chemical Library; at Roche, we used human iPSC derived macrophage-like cells and a proprietary chemo-genomic library with 2,200 compounds with known mechanism-of-action. Next, we validated the more robust compounds using hippocampal organotypic cultures and identified two hits: trifluoperazine, a dopaminergic and adrenergic antagonist used as an antipsychotic and antineoplastic; and deoxytubercidin, a ribose derivative. Finally, we tested whether these compounds were able to modulate phagocytosis of apoptotic newborn cells in the adult hippocampal neurogenic niche in vivo by administering them into the mouse hippocampus using osmotic minipumps. We confirmed that both trifluoperazine and deoxytubercidin have anti-phagocytic activity in vivo, and validated our bottom-up strategy to identify novel phagocytosis modulators. These results show that chemical libraries with anotated mechanism of action are an starting point for the pharmacological modulation of microglia in drug discovery projects aiming at the therapeutic manipulation of phagocytosis in brain diseases.

">Consistent neural representation of valence in watching and recall conditions</a></h4>

              
                Recall is an act of elicitation of emotions similar to those emotions previously experienced. Unlike the past experiences where external sensory stimuli triggered emotions, recall does not require external sensory stimuli. This difference is pertinent to the key debate in affective representation, addressing whether the representation of valence is consistent across modalities (modality-general) or dependent on modalities (modality-specific). This study aimed to verify neural representations of valence irrespective of the presence of external sensory stimuli. Using neuroimaging data from video watching and recall (Chen et al., 2017) and behavioral data for valence ratings (Kim et al., 2020), a searchlight analysis was conducted with cross-participant regression-based decoding across the presence and absence of external stimuli. Multidimensional scaling was employed as a validation analysis of the results. The searchlight analysis revealed the right middle temporal and inferior temporal gyrus as well as the left fusiform gyrus. The validation analysis further exhibited significant consistent neural representations of valence in the inferior temporal gyrus and the left fusiform gyrus. This study identified the brain regions where valence is consistently represented, regardless of the presence of external sensory stimuli. These findings contribute to debate in affective representations, by comparing conditions utilized little in prior, suggesting the inferior temporal gyrus is related to representations of valence irrespective of the presence and absence of external visual stimuli.

">Disruption of the CRF1 receptor eliminates morphine-induced sociability deficits and firing of oxytocinergic neurons in male mice</a></h4>

              
                Substance-induced social behavior deficits dramatically worsen the clinical outcome of substance use disorders; yet, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Herein, we investigated the role for the corticotropin-releasing factor receptor 1 (CRF1) in the acute sociability deficits induced by morphine and the related activity of oxytocin (OXY)- and arginine-vasopressin (AVP)-expressing neurons of the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN). For this purpose, we used both the CRF1 receptor-preferring antagonist compound antalarmin and the genetic mouse model of CRF1 receptor-deficiency. Antalarmin completely abolished sociability deficits induced by morphine in male, but not in female, C57BL/6J mice. Accordingly, genetic CRF1 receptor-deficiency eliminated morphine-induced sociability deficits in male mice. Ex vivo electrophysiology studies showed that antalarmin also eliminated morphine-induced firing of PVN neurons in male, but not in female, C57BL/6J mice. Likewise, genetic CRF1 receptor-deficiency reduced morphine-induced firing of PVN neurons in a CRF1 gene expression-dependent manner. The electrophysiology results consistently mirrored the behavioral results, indicating a link between morphine-induced PVN activity and sociability deficits. Interestingly, in male mice antalarmin abolished morphine-induced firing in neurons co-expressing OXY and AVP, but not in neurons expressing only AVP. In contrast, in female mice antalarmin did not affect morphine-induced firing of neurons co-expressing OXY and AVP or only OXY, indicating a selective sex-specific role for the CRF1 receptor in opiate-induced PVN OXY activity. The present findings demonstrate a major, sex-linked, role for the CRF1 receptor in sociability deficits and related brain alterations induced by morphine, suggesting new therapeutic strategy for opiate use disorders.

">Steering From the Rear: Coordination of Central Pattern Generators Underlying Navigation by Ascending Interneurons</a></h4>

              
                Understanding how animals coordinate movements to achieve goals is a fundamental pursuit in neuroscience. Here we explore how neurons that reside in posterior lower-order regions of a locomotor system and project to anterior higher-order regions influence steering and navigation. We characterized the anatomy and functional role of a population of ascending interneurons in the ventral nerve cord of Drosophila larvae. Through electron microscopy reconstructions and light microscopy, we determined that the cholinergic 19f cells receive input primarily from premotor interneurons and synapse upon a diverse array of postsynaptic targets within the anterior segments including other 19f cells. Calcium imaging of 19f activity in isolated CNS preparations in relation to motor neurons revealed that 19f neurons are recruited into most larval motor programmes. 19f activity lags behind motor neuron activity and as a population, the cells encode spatio-temporal patterns of locomotor activity in the larval CNS. Optogenetic manipulations of 19f cell activity in isolated CNS preparations revealed that they coordinate the activity of central pattern generators underlying exploratory headsweeps and forward locomotion in a context and location specific manner. In behaving animals, activating 19f cells suppressed exploratory headsweeps and slowed forward locomotion, while inhibition of 19f activity potentiated headsweeps, slowing forward movement. Inhibiting activity in 19f cells ultimately affected the ability of larvae to remain in the vicinity of an odor source during an olfactory navigation task. Overall, our findings provide insights into how ascending interneurons monitor motor activity and shape interactions amongst rhythm generators underlying complex navigational tasks.

">Balancing complexity, performance and plausibility to meta learn plasticity rules in recurrent spiking networks.</a></h4>

              
                Synaptic plasticity is a key player in the brain's life-long learning abilities. However, due to experimental limitations, the mechanistic link between synaptic plasticity rules and the network-level computations they enable remain opaque. Here we use evolutionary strategies (ES) to meta-learn local co-active plasticity rules in large recurrent spiking networks, using parameterizations of increasing complexity. We discover rules that robustly stabilize network dynamics for all four synapse types acting in isolation (E-to-E, E-to-I, I-to-E and I-to-I). More complex functions such as familiarity detection can also be included in the search constraints. However, our meta-learning strategy begins to fail for co-active rules of increasing complexity, as it is challenging to devise loss functions that effectively constrain network dynamics to plausible solutions a priori. Moreover, in line with previous work, we can find multiple degenerate solutions with identical network behaviour. As a local optimization strategy, ES provides one solution at a time and makes exploration of this degeneracy cumbersome. Regardless, we can glean the interdependecies of various plasticity parameters by considering the covariance matrix learned alongside the optimal rule with ES. Our work provides a proof of principle for the success of machine-learning-guided discovery of plasticity rules in large spiking networks, and points at the necessity of more elaborate search strategies going forward.

">Context-dependent coordination of movement in Tribolium castaneum larvae</a></h4>

              
                Pest insects like Tribolium castaneum beetles cause 10.8% of global stored grain losses. However, how their nervous systems coordinate adaptive movements for successful infestation is unknown. Here, we assess how Tribolium larvae locomote over different substrates and analyze their gait kinematics across speeds. Unlike many hexapods, larvae employ a bilaterally symmetric, posterior-to-anterior wave gait during fast locomotion. During slow locomotion, thoracic intrasegmental coordination is disrupted, whilst intersegmental coordination is preserved. Additionally, terminal abdominal structures (pygopods) support challenging locomotion, such as climbing overhangs. The onset of pygopod engagement coincides with leg swing initiation, suggesting a stabilizing role. Surgically severing the connective between thoracic and abdominal ganglia impaired pygopod engagement and impeded flat-surface locomotion, climbing, and tunnelling without interrupting leg kinematics. These results suggest that thoracic-abdominal coordination underlies effective movement, and gait/limb recruitment is context-dependent. Our work provides the first kinematic analysis of Tribolium larval locomotion and insights into its neural control.

">Dizocilpine derivatives with neuroprotective effect lacking the psychomimetic side effects</a></h4>

              
                We aimed to prepare novel dibenzosuberane derivatives that act on N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors with potential neuroprotective effects. Our approach involved modifying the tropane moiety of MK-801, a potent open-channel blocker known for its psychomimetic side effects, by introducing a seven-membered ring with substituted base moieties specifically to alleviate these undesirable effects. Our in silico analyses showed that these derivatives should have high gastrointestinal absorption and cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Our pharmacokinetic studies in rats supported this conclusion and confirmed the ability of leading compounds 3l and 6f to penetrate the BBB. Electrophysiological experiments showed that all compounds exhibited different inhibitory activity towards the two major NMDA receptor subtypes, GluN1/GluN2A and GluN1/GluN2B. Of the selected compounds intentionally differing in the inhibitory efficacy, 6f showed high relative inhibition (~90% for GluN1/GluN2A), while 3l showed moderate inhibition (~50%). An in vivo toxicity study determined that compounds 3l and 6f were safe at 10 mg/kg doses with no adverse effects. Behavioral studies demonstrated that these compounds did not induce hyperlocomotion or impair prepulse inhibition of startle response in rats. Neuroprotective assays using a model of NMDA-induced hippocampal neurodegeneration showed that compound 3l at a concentration of 30 M significantly reduced hippocampal damage in rats. These results suggest that these novel dibenzosuberane derivatives are promising candidates for developing NMDA receptor-targeted therapies with minimal psychotomimetic side effects.

">The Role of Alpha Synuclein in Synucleinopathy: Impact on Lipid Regulation at Mitochondria ER Membranes</a></h4>

              
                The protein alpha-synuclein (Syn) plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of synucleinopathy, which includes Parkinson's disease and multiple system atrophy, and mounting evidence suggests that lipid dyshomeostasis is a critical phenotype in these neurodegenerative conditions. Previously, we identified that Syn localizes to mitochondria-associated endoplasmic reticulum membranes (MAMs), temporary functional domains containing proteins that regulate lipid metabolism, including the de novo synthesis of phosphatidylserine. In the present study, we have analyzed the lipid composition of postmortem human samples, focusing on the substantia nigra pars compacta of Parkinson's disease and controls, as well as three less affected brain regions of Parkinson's donors. To further assess synucleinopathy-related lipidome alterations, similar analyses were performed on the striatum of multiple system atrophy cases. Our data show region-and disease-specific changes in the levels of lipid species. Specifically, our data revealed alterations in the levels of specific phosphatidylserine species in brain areas most affected in Parkinson's disease. Some of these alterations, albeit to a lesser degree, are also observed multiples system atrophy. Using induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons, we show that Syn contributes to regulating phosphatidylserine metabolism at MAM domains, and that Syn dosage parallels the perturbation in phosphatidylserine levels. Our results support the notion that Syn pathophysiology is linked to the dysregulation of lipid homeostasis, which may contribute to the vulnerability of specific brain regions in synucleinopathy. These findings have significant therapeutic implications

">Low-dimensional olfactory signatures of fruit ripening and fermentation</a></h4>

              
                Odors provide an important communication channel between plants and animals. Fruits, vital nutrient sources for animals, emit a complex array of monomolecular volatiles. Animals can use the structure of these mixtures to assess properties of fruit predictive of their nutritive and reproductive value. We analyzed the statistics of fruit odor mixtures sampled across stages of ripening and fermentation to find that they fall on a low-dimensional hyperbolic map. Hyperbolic maps, with their negative curvature and an exponentially expanding state options, are adept at describing hierarchical relationships in the data such as those arising from metabolic processes within fruits. In the hyperbolic map, samples followed a striking spiral trajectory. The spiral initiated near the maps core, representing the under-ripe phase with specific profiles of monomolecular volatiles. Progressively mapping along the unfolding spiral trajectory were scent mixtures corresponding to ripening, and then rotting or fermentation. The unfolding process depended on the specific fermentation processes that dominated in the samples, determined largely by the microbes (e.g. bacteria or yeast) present in the sample. These results generalized across fruit types and describe trajectories in the natural odorant space with significant behavioral relevance for insects.

">CHD8 adulthood microglial knockout induces behavioral, morphological, and transcriptional changes in a sex-dependent manner</a></h4>

              
                Mutations in CHD8 (chromodomain-helicase-DNA binding protein 8) are highly associated with autism spectrum disorders. It has been well established that CHD8 has a prominent role in the development of neurons. However, there is little knowledge of its specific roles in microglia, and its possible roles in cellular functions after development, i.e. adulthood. In addition, while microglial dysfunction has been characterized in autism, the roles of autism-associated genes in microglial function have not been well characterized. Using conditional transgenic mouse models, we determined that adulthood deletion of CHD8 in microglia induces robust changes in behavior, including anxiety, social deficits, and depression-like behavior, in association with changes in microglial activation and robust microglial gene expression changes, including expression of cytokines. Of great interest, many of these changes were seen specifically in male deletion mice, and not female deletion mice. In contrast, adulthood neuron knockout had more subtle effects on behavior, mainly on depression-like behavior, and induced subtle changes in gene transcription related to the Wnt/Beta-Catenin pathway. These changes were also only present in male neuron knockout mice. In summary, CHD8 is particularly important for microglial function in adulthood and has cellular effects that are specific to males.

">Metabolic connectivity in ageing.</a></h4>

              
                Information transfer across the brain has a high energetic cost and requires the efficient use of glucose. Positron emission tomography (PET) studies have shown that ageing is associated with a decline in regional rates of cerebral glucose metabolism. However, until recently, it has not been possible to measure the timecourse of molecular activity within an individual using PET, preventing the study of metabolic network connectivity across the brain. Here we report the results of the first high temporal resolution functional PET study examining metabolic connectivity and cognitive function in ageing. The metabolic connectomes of 40 younger (mean age 27.9 years; range 20-42) and 46 older (mean 75.8; 60-89) adults were characterised by high connectivity strength in the frontal, temporal, motor, parietal and medial cortices. Ageing was associated with lower global integration of metabolic hub regions, indicating disrupted information transfer across the metabolic network in older adults. In younger adults, a high proportion of glucose was used to support hubs in the frontal regions. Older adults had a smaller energy budget in comparison to younger adults, and older adults used a higher proportion of energy to support mostly posterior hub regions. This difference in the metabolic network topology in older adults was associated with worse cognitive performance. We conclude that ageing is associated with reduced metabolic connectivity, an altered metabolic network topology and a high glucose cost in hub regions. Our results highlight the fundamental role that metabolism plays in supporting information transfer in the brain and the unique insights that metabolic connectivity provides into the ageing brain.

">Functional Control of Network Dynamical Systems: An Information Theoretic Approach</a></h4>

              
                In neurological networks, the emergence of various causal interactions and information flows among nodes is governed by the structural connectivity in conjunction with the node dynamics. The information flow describes the direction and the magnitude of an excitatory neuron's influence to the neighbouring neurons. However, the intricate relationship between network dynamics and information flows is not well understood. Here, we address this challenge by first identifying a generic mechanism that defines the evolution of various information routing patterns in response to modifications in the underlying network dynamics. Moreover, with emerging techniques in brain stimulation, designing optimal stimulation directed towards a target region with an acceptable magnitude remains an ongoing and significant challenge. In this work, we also introduce techniques for computing optimal inputs that follow a desired stimulation routing path towards the target brain region. This optimization problem can be efficiently resolved using non-linear programming tools and permits the simultaneous assignment of multiple desired patterns at different instances. We establish the algebraic and graph-theoretic conditions necessary to ensure the feasibility and stability of information routing patterns (IRPs). We illustrate the routing mechanisms and control methods for attaining desired patterns in biological oscillatory dynamics.

">Lateral entorhinal cortex afferents reconfigure the activity in piriform cortex circuits</a></h4>

              
                Odours are key signals for guiding spatial behaviours such as foraging and navigation in rodents. It has recently been found that odour representations in the piriform cortex (PCx) can also contain information about their spatial context. However, the precise origins of this information within the brain and its subsequent integration into the microcircuitry of the PCx remains unknown. In this study, we focus on the lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) as a candidate for carrying spatial contextual information to the PCx, to investigate how it affects the PCx microcircuit and its response to olfactory inputs. Utilising mice brain slices, we performed patch clamp recordings targeting both superficial (SP) and deep (DP) pyramidal neurons, as well as parvalbumin (PV) and somatostatin (SOM) inhibitory interneurons. Concurrently, we optogenetically stimulated excitatory LEC projections to study their impact on PCx activity. We found that LEC inputs are heterogeneously distributed in the PCx microcircuit, evoking larger excitatory currents in SP and PV neurons compared to DP and SOM neurons, respectively, due to their higher monosynaptic connectivity. Moreover, LEC inputs exert a differential effect on the inhibitory circuits, activating PV while suppressing SOM interneurons. We further studied the interaction among LEC inputs and the sensory afferent signals originating from the lateral olfactory tract (LOT) onto the PCx. Our findings demonstrated that both SP and DP neurons show a general increase in their spiking response when LEC and LOT are simultaneously activated. Notably, DP neurons exhibit a sharpening of their response attributable to LEC-induced inhibition that effectively suppresses the delayed spikes evoked by LOT stimulation. These observations suggest a regulatory mechanism whereby LEC inputs inhibit recurrent activity by activating PV interneurons. Our results show that LEC afferents reconfigure PCx activity and contribute to the understanding of how odour objects are formed within the PCx integrating both olfactory and contextual information.

">Molecular characterization of gustatory second-order neurons reveals integrative mechanisms of gustatory and metabolic information</a></h4>

              
                Animals must balance the urgent need to find food during starvation with the critical necessity to avoid toxic substances to ensure their survival. In Drosophila, specialized Gustatory Receptors (GRs) expressed in Gustatory Receptor Neurons (GRNs) are critical for distinguishing between nutritious and potentially toxic food. GRNs project their axons from taste organs to the Subesophageal Zone (SEZ) in the Central Brain (CB) of Drosophila, where gustatory information is processed. Although the roles of GRs and GRNs are well-documented, the processing of gustatory information in the SEZ remains unclear. To better understand gustatory sensory processing and feeding decision-making, we molecularly characterized the first layer of gustatory interneurons, referred to as Gustatory Second Order Neurons (G2Ns), which receive direct input from GRNs. Using trans-synaptic tracing with trans-Tango, cell sorting, and bulk RNAseq under fed and starved conditions, we discovered that G2Ns vary based on gustatory input and that their molecular profile changes with the fly's metabolic state. Further data analysis has revealed that a pair of neurons in the SEZ, expressing the neuropeptide Leucokinin (SELK neurons), receive simultaneous input from GRNs sensing bitter (potentially toxic) and sweet (nutritious) information. Additionally, these neurons also receive inputs regarding the starvation levels of the fly. These results highlight a novel mechanism of feeding regulation and metabolic integration.

">How the brain learns to parse images using an attentional, incremental grouping process</a></h4>

              
                Natural scenes usually contain a vast number of objects that need to be segmented and segregated from each other and from the background to guide behaviour. In the visual brain, object-based attention is the process by which image fragments belonging to the same objects are grouped together. The curve-tracing task is a special case of a perceptual grouping task that tests our ability to group image elements of an elongated curve. The task consists in determining which image elements belong to the same curve, and in the brain, neurons spread an enhanced activity level over the representation of the relevant curve. A previous "growth-cone model of attention" accounted for the scale invariance of tracing by proposing that the enhanced activity propagates at multiple levels of the visual cortical hierarchy. However, the precise neuronal circuitry for learning and implementing scale-invariant tracing remains unknown. We propose a new recurrent architecture for the scale-invariant labelling of curves and objects. The architecture is composed of a feedforward pathway that dynamically selects the right scale and prevents the spilling over of the enhanced activity to other curves, and a recurrent pathway for tag spreading that involves horizontal and feedback interactions, mediated by a disinhibitory loop involving VIP and SOM interneurons. We trained the network with curves up to seven pixels long using reinforcement learning and a learning rule local in time and space and we found that it generalized to curves of any length and to spatially extended objects. The network chose the appropriate scale and switched to higher or lower scales as dictated by the distance between curves, just has as been observed in human psychophysics and in the visual cortex of monkeys. Our work provide a mechanistic account of the learning of scale-invariant perceptual grouping in the brain.

">Densely sampled stimulus-response map of human cortex with single pulse TMS-EEG and its relation to whole brain neuroimaging measures</a></h4>

              
                Large-scale networks underpin brain functions. How such networks respond to focal stimulation can help decipher complex brain processes and optimize brain stimulation treatments. To map such stimulation-response patterns across the brain non-invasively, we recorded concurrent EEG responses from single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (i.e., TMS-EEG) from over 100 cortical regions with two orthogonal coil orientations from one densely-sampled individual. We also acquired Human Connectome Project (HCP)-styled diffusion imaging scans (six), resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) scans (120 mins), resting-state EEG scans (108 mins), and structural MR scans (T1- and T2-weighted). Using the TMS-EEG data, we applied network science-based community detection to reveal insights about the brain's causal-functional organization from both a stimulation and recording perspective. We also computed structural and functional maps and the electric field of each TMS stimulation condition. Altogether, we hope the release of this densely sampled (n=1) dataset will be a uniquely valuable resource for both basic and clinical neuroscience research.

">Co-Contraction Embodies Uncertainty: An Optimal Feedforward Strategy for Robust Motor Control</a></h4>

              
                Despite our environment is often uncertain, we generally manage to generate stable motor behaviors. While reactive control plays a major role in this achievement, proactive control is critical to cope with the substantial noise and delays that affect neuromusculoskeletal systems. In particular, muscle co-contraction is exploited to robustify feedforward motor commands against internal sensorimotor noise as was revealed by stochastic optimal open-loop control modeling. Here, we extend this framework to neuromusculoskeletal systems subjected to random disturbances originating from the environment. The analytical derivation and numerical simulations predict a singular relationship between the degree of uncertainty in the task at hand and the optimal level of anticipatory co-contraction. This prediction is confirmed through a single-joint pointing task experiment where an external torque is applied to the wrist near the end of the reaching movement with varying probabilities across blocks of trials. We conclude that uncertainty calls for impedance control via proactive muscle co-contraction to stabilize behaviors when reactive control is insufficient for task success.

">Dynamic changes in neuronal and glial GAL4 driver expression during Drosophila ageing</a></h4>

              
                Understanding how diverse cell types come together to form a functioning brain relies on the ability to specifically target these cells. This is often done using genetic tools such as the GAL4/UAS system in Drosophila melanogaster. Surprisingly, despite its extensive usage during studies of the ageing brain, detailed spatio-temporal characterisation of GAL4 driver lines in adult flies has been lacking. Here we show that three commonly used neuronal drivers (elav[C155]-GAL4, nSyb[R57C10]-GAL4 and ChAT-GAL4) and the commonly used glial driver repo-GAL4 all show rapid and pronounced decreases in activity over the first 1.5 weeks of adult life, with activity becoming undetectable in some regions after 30 days. In addition to an overall decrease in GAL4 activity over time, we found notable differences in spatial patterns, mostly occurring soon after eclosion. Although all lines showed these changes, the nSyb-GAL4 line exhibited the most consistent and stable expression patterns over ageing. Our findings suggest that gene transcription of key loci decreases in the aged brain, a finding broadly similar to previous work in mammalian brains. Our results also raise questions over past work on long-term expression of disease models in the brain, and stress the need to find better genetic tools for ageing studies.

">Reconfiguration of the visual code and retinal cell type complement in closely related diurnal and nocturnal mice</a></h4>

              
                How does evolution act on neuronal populations to match computational characteristics to functional demands? We address this problem by comparing visual code and retinal cell composition in closely related murid species with different behaviours. Rhabdomys pumilio are diurnal and have substantially thicker inner retina and larger visual thalamus than nocturnal Mus musculus. High-density electrophysiological recordings of visual response features in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) reveals that Rhabdomys attains higher spatiotemporal acuity both by denser coverage of the visual scene and a selective expansion of elements of the code characterised by non-linear spatiotemporal summation. Comparative analysis of single cell transcriptomic cell atlases reveals that realignment of the visual code is associated with increased relative abundance of bipolar and ganglion cell types supporting OFF and ON-OFF responses. These findings demonstrate how changes in retinal cell complement can reconfigure the coding of visual information to match changes in visual needs.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The aim of this study was to explore the pathogenesis of <i>CLCN6</i>-related disease and to assess whether its Cl<sup>−</sup>/H<sup>+</sup>-exchange activity is crucial for the biological role of ClC-6.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We performed whole-exome sequencing on a girl with development delay, intractable epilepsy, behavioral abnormities, retinal dysfunction, progressive brain atrophy, suggestive of neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCLs). We generated and analyzed the first knock-in mouse model of a patient variant (p.E200A) and compared it with a <i>Clcn6</i>
<sup>−/−</sup> mouse model. Additional functional tests were performed with heterologous expression of mutant ClC-6.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We identified a de novo heterozygous p.E200A variant in the proband. Expression of disease-causing ClC-6<sup>E200A</sup> or ClC-6<sup>Y553C</sup> mutants blocked autophagic flux and activated transcription factors EB (TFEB) and E3 (TFE3), leading to autophagic vesicle and cholesterol accumulation. Such alterations were absent with a transport-deficient ClC-6<sup>E267A</sup> mutant. <i>Clcn6</i>
<sup>E200A/+</sup> mice developed severe neurodegeneration with typical features of NCLs. Mutant ClC-6<sup>E200A</sup>, but not loss of ClC-6 in <i>Clcn6</i>
<sup>−/−</sup> mice, increased lysosomal biogenesis by suppressing mTORC1-TFEB signaling, blocked autophagic flux through impairing lysosomal function, and increased apoptosis. Carbohydrate and lipid deposits accumulated in <i>Clcn6</i>
<sup>E200A/+</sup> brain, while only lipid storage was found in <i>Clcn6</i>
<sup>−/−</sup> brain. Lysosome dysfunction, autophagy defects, and gliosis were early pathogenic events preceding neuron loss.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p><i>CLCN6</i> is a novel genetic cause of NCLs, highlighting the importance of considering <i>CLCN6</i> mutations in the diagnostic workup for molecularly undefined forms of NCLs. Uncoupling of Cl<sup>−</sup> transport from H<sup>+</sup> countertransport in the E200A mutant has a dominant effect on the autophagic/lysosomal pathway. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>We aimed to assess the impact of time to endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) on clinical outcomes in the DAWN trial, while also exploring the potential effect modification of mode of stroke onset on this relationship.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>The association between every 1-h treatment delay with 90-day functional independence (modified Rankin Scale [mRS] score 0–2), symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, and 90-day mortality was explored in the overall population and in three modes of onset subgroups (wake-up vs. witnessed vs. unwitnessed).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Out of the 205 patients, 98 (47.8%) and 107 (52.2%) presented in the 6 to 12 hours and 12 to 24 hours time window, respectively. Considering all three modes of onset together, there was no statistically significant association between time last seen well to randomization with either functional independence or mortality at 90 days in either the endovascular thrombectomy (mRS 0–2 1-hour delay OR 1.07; 95% CI 0.93–1.24; mRS 6 OR 0.84; 95% CI 0.65–1.03) or medical management (mRS 0–2 1-hour delay OR 0.98; 95% CI 0.80–1.14; mRS 6 1-hour delay OR 0.94; 95% CI 0.79–1.09) groups. Moreover, there was no significant interaction between treatment effect and time (<i>p</i> = 0.439 and <i>p</i> = 0.421 for mRS 0–2 and 6, respectively). However, within the thrombectomy group, the models that tested the association between time last seen well to successful reperfusion (modified Treatment in Cerebral Infarction ≥2b) and 90-day functional independence showed a significant interaction with mode of presentation (<i>p</i> = 0.013). This appeared to be driven by a nominally positive slope for both witnessed and unwitnessed strokes versus a significantly (<i>p</i> = 0.018) negative slope in wake-up patients. There was no association between treatment times and symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Mode of onset modifies the effect of time to reperfusion on thrombectomy outcomes, and should be considered when exploring different treatment paradigms in the extended window. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

	<p>This study explored the role of sensorimotor simulation in modulating the stress response in individuals exposed to stressful digital simulated interviews. Participants were assigned to two different versions of a Digital Social Stress Test: a simulated version with a dynamic&amp;amp;ndash;realistic examining committee (Dyn-DSST) and a version with a static examining committee (Stat-DSST). During interview preparation, behavioral indices reflecting stress regulation and resistance, response times, and electroencephalographic (EEG) and autonomic indices were collected. Higher regulation scores were found for the Stat-DSST group compared to the Dyn-DSST group, probably induced by the presence of limited external sensory input in time and space, perceived as less stressful. The EEG results revealed a distinct contribution of the low- and high-frequency bands for both groups. Dyn-DSST required greater cognitive regulation effort due to the presence of a continuous flow of information, which can enhance sensory and motor activation in the brain. The SCR increased in the Dyn-DSST group compared to the Stat-DSST group, reflecting greater emotional involvement in the Dyn-DSST group and reduced sensory stimulation in the static version. In conclusion, the results suggest that sensorimotor simulation impacts the stress response differently in dynamic interviews compared to static ones, with distinct profiles based on behavioral, EEG, and autonomic measures.</p>

	<p>Melancholia is a major and severe subtype of depression, with only limited data regarding its association with neurological phenomena. To extend the current understanding of how particular aspects of melancholia are correlated with brain activity, electroencephalographic data were collected from 100 adults (44 males and 56 females, all aged 18 y or more) and investigated for the association between symptoms of melancholia and the ratios of alpha/beta activity and theta/beta activity at parietal&amp;amp;ndash;occipital EEG sites PO1 and PO2. The results indicate differences in these associations according to the depressive status of participants and the particular symptom of melancholia. Depressed participants exhibited meaningfully direct correlations between alpha/beta and theta/beta activity and the feeling that &amp;amp;ldquo;Others would be better off if I was dead&amp;amp;rdquo; at PO1, whereas non-depressed participants had significant inverse correlations between theta/beta activity and &amp;amp;ldquo;Feeling useless and not needed&amp;amp;rdquo; and &amp;amp;ldquo;I find it hard to make decisions&amp;amp;rdquo; at PO1. The results are discussed in terms of the relative levels of fast-wave (beta) versus slow-wave (alpha, theta) activity exhibited by depressed and non-depressed participants in the parietal&amp;amp;ndash;occipital region and the cognitive activities that are relevant to that region.</p>

	<p>This study examines the impact of response and semantic inhibition on scientific reasoning using fNIRS data from 30 students (15 male, 15 female). Utilizing Go/Nogo and Stroop-like tasks within a modified speeded-reasoning task, it was found that inhibition significantly influences scientific reasoning. Specifically, slower responses and lower accuracy on incongruent statements were linked to increased activity in bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA). The research shows that both DLPFC and pre-SMA are associated with overcoming misconceptions in scientific reasoning. The findings suggest that understanding inhibitory mechanisms can enhance educational strategies to improve critical thinking and scientific literacy.</p>

	<p>Although previous behavioral studies have associated reactive aggression (RA) and proactive aggression (PA) with traditional masculinity, further investigation is needed into the traditional masculinity-linked neuroanatomical characteristics of RA and PA. This study analyzed the traditional masculinity-by-aggression interaction in 705 participants (350 men) by measuring grey matter volume (GMV). We have expanded on previous studies and found that traditional masculinity was not associated with RA and PA when not controlled for traditional femininity. However, the association appeared when controlling for it. Furthermore, we found significant traditional masculinity-by-RA interactions on the GMV in the bilateral superior frontal gyrus, a region known to be involved in cognitive control. When traditional masculinity scores were 1 standard deviation above the mean, there was a positive correlation between RA and the GMV in the bilateral superior frontal gyrus. Conversely, when traditional masculinity scores were 1 standard deviation below the mean, there was a negative correlation between RA and the GMV in the region. However, no traditional masculinity-linked neuroanatomical characteristics of PA were found. The results indicated that individuals with high/low traditional masculinity perceived RA as a different outcome (gain or loss) of self-control. The results supported an opportunity to develop prevention or intervention strategies for RA.</p>

                Circular RNAs (circRNAs), once thought to be a result of splicing errors, have been found to be involved in various molecular processes and the pathology of various diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. Additionally, circRNA expression was found to be altered by lifestyle habits, such as smoking cigarettes. Past studies have revealed that the rate of smoking remains high in people living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). In this study, we isolated total RNA from uninfected T-cells that have been exposed to cigarette smoke and compared the expression levels of circRNAs to those of T-cells that were not exposed to cigarette smoke. We identified certain circRNAs that were upregulated or downregulated in T-cells when exposed to cigarette smoke. These data indicate that the study of circRNAs is warranted within the context of HIV.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/12-114/v2?src=rss">An integrative review on physical restraint in adult critical care unit [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background Physical restraints (PRs) are frequently used in adult critical care units to protect staff and prevent self-harm, despite the fact that they represent significant safety risks. Restraint complications may have an impact on the patient’s long- and short-term outcomes. This integrative review aimed to meticulously evaluate existing evidence pertaining to physical restraint practices in adult critical care settings. The review was specifically geared towards examining the prevalence of PR, identifying influential factors, elucidating the role of nurses in PR implementation, exploring nurses’ experiences in caring for patients under restraint, and scrutinizing the complications associated with PR application Method This integrative review included the studies published between January 2009 and December 2019 and the literature search was conducted in July 2020. The databases searched included EBSCOhost, Ovid, ProQuest, PubMed, Wiley Online Library, SCOPUS, and ScienceDirect. The keywords included in the search were restraint, critical care, intensive care, ICU, mechanical ventilation, intubation, nursing, and experience. A checklist based on the CASP checklist and the JBI Critical Appraisal Tool was used to assess the methodological quality. Results The findings were evaluated and summarized into seven key topics after twenty-one publications were found to be evaluated. i) High prevalence of PR application in adult critical care unit; ii) determinants of PR applications; iii) types of PR in adult critical care units; iv) decision maker of PR; v) moral and ethical dilemma in PR application; vi) awareness and guidelines for PR applications; vii) common complications and use of sedation, analgesics, antipsychotic drugs in PR application. Conclusion The number of days PR is used is related to the risk of an adverse event. In order to standardize nursing practice, ICU nurses require greater training on the ideas of PR use. Evidence-based recommendations will assist critical care nurses in making the best judgments possible concerning the use of PR.

                Background The risk of recurrence after nephrectomy for primary clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is estimated in daily practice solely based on clinical criteria. The aim of this study was to assess the prognostic relevance of common somatic mutations with respect to tumor aggressiveness and outcomes of ccRCC patients after definitive treatment. Methods Primary tumors from 37 patients with ccRCC who underwent radical nephrectomy were analyzed for presence of somatic mutations using a 15-gene targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) panel. Associations to histopathologic characteristics and outcomes were investigated in the study cohort (n=37) and validated in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) ccRCC cohort (n=451). Results VHL was the most frequently mutated gene (51%), followed by PBRM1 (27%), BAP1 (13%), SETD2 (13%), KDM5C (5%), ATM (5%), MTOR (5%), and PTEN (3%). One-third of patients did not have any somatic mutations within the 15-gene panel. The vast majority of tumors harboring no mutations at all or VHL-only mutations (51%) were more frequently of smaller size (pT1-2) and earlier stage (I/II), whereas presence of any other gene mutations in various combinations with or without VHL was enriched in larger (pT3) and higher stage tumors (III) (p=0.02). No recurrences were noted in patients with unmutated tumors or VHL-only mutations as opposed to three relapses in patients with non-VHL somatic mutations (p=0.06). Presence of somatic mutations in PBRM1, BAP1, SETD2, KDM5C, ATM, MTOR, or PTEN genes in 451 TCGA ccRCC patients was associated with a significantly shorter disease-free survival (DFS) compared to those with unaltered tumors (q=0.01). Conclusions Preliminary findings from this ongoing study support the prognostic value of non-VHL mutations including PBRM1, BAP1, SETD2, KDM5C, ATM, MTOR, and PTEN in primary ccRCC tumors as surrogates of earlier recurrence and potential selection for adjuvant immune checkpoint inhibition.

                <p>Scientific research demands reproducibility and transparency, particularly in data-intensive fields like electrophysiology. Electrophysiology data are typically analyzed using scripts that generate output files, including figures. Handling these results poses several challenges due to the complexity and iterative nature of the analysis process. These stem from the difficulty to discern the analysis steps, parameters, and data flow from the results, making knowledge transfer and findability challenging in collaborative settings. Provenance information tracks data lineage and processes applied to it, and provenance capture during the execution of an analysis script can address those challenges. We present Alpaca (Automated Lightweight Provenance Capture), a tool that captures fine-grained provenance information with minimal user intervention when running data analysis pipelines implemented in Python scripts. Alpaca records inputs, outputs, and function parameters and structures information according to the W3C PROV standard. We demonstrate the tool using a realistic use case involving multichannel local field potential recordings of a neurophysiological experiment, highlighting how the tool makes result details known in a standardized manner in order to address the challenges of the analysis process. Ultimately, using Alpaca will help to represent results according to the FAIR principles, which will improve research reproducibility and facilitate sharing the results of data analyses.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/11/6/ENEURO.0511-23.2024?rss=1">Individualized Closed-Loop Acoustic Stimulation Suggests an Alpha Phase Dependence of Sound Evoked and Induced Brain Activity Measured with EEG Recordings</a></h4>

              
                <p>Following repetitive visual stimulation, post hoc phase analysis finds that visually evoked response magnitudes vary with the cortical alpha oscillation phase that temporally coincides with sensory stimulus. This approach has not successfully revealed an alpha phase dependence for auditory evoked or induced responses. Here, we test the feasibility of tracking alpha with scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings and play sounds phase-locked to individualized alpha phases in real-time using a novel end-point corrected Hilbert transform (ecHT) algorithm implemented on a research device. Based on prior work, we hypothesize that sound-evoked and induced responses vary with the alpha phase at sound onset and the alpha phase that coincides with the early sound-evoked response potential (ERP) measured with EEG. Thus, we use each subject&rsquo;s individualized alpha frequency (IAF) and individual auditory ERP latency to define target trough and peak alpha phases that allow an early component of the auditory ERP to align to the estimated poststimulus peak and trough phases, respectively. With this closed-loop and individualized approach, we find opposing alpha phase-dependent effects on the auditory ERP and alpha oscillations that follow stimulus onset. Trough and peak phase-locked sounds result in distinct evoked and induced post-stimulus alpha level and frequency modulations. Though additional studies are needed to localize the sources underlying these phase-dependent effects, these results suggest a general principle for alpha phase-dependence of sensory processing that includes the auditory system. Moreover, this study demonstrates the feasibility of using individualized neurophysiological indices to deliver automated, closed-loop, phase-locked auditory stimulation. </p>

                Background Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) represent a growing global health concern, necessitating comprehensive investigations into their prevalence and resistance mechanisms. This study protocol focuses on detecting carbapenemase genes, including blaVIM, blaNDM, blaKPC, blaIPM, and blaOXA-48, in clinical isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli from a tertiary hospital in Eastern India. The rise of carbapenem resistance poses challenges to effective antimicrobial therapy and infection control strategies. Methods Conducted at the Department of Microbiology, Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College, the study employs a cross-sectional design from July 2022 to December 2023. The sample size calculation follows Daniel’s formula, considering a non-response rate of 10%. Modified Carbapenem Inactivation Method (mCIM) and EDTA-Modified Carbapenem Inactivation Method (eCIM) will be used for phenotypic detection, along with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for genotypic confirmation. Antibiotic susceptibility testing using the Kirby-Bauer Disk Diffusion method will complement resistance profiling. Expected Outcome Anticipated outcomes include insights into the efficacy of mCIM and eCIM in detecting carbapenem resistance, the prevalence of carbapenemase genes in Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli, and the antibiotic resistance pattern of carbapenemase-producing CRE. This study aims to provide valuable data for guiding empirical treatment strategies and reinforcing infection control measures in the region.

                Background Obstructive airway diseases, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma, pose significant global health challenges. Early and accurate diagnosis is crucial for effective management. Although Spirometry has traditionally been the cornerstone of diagnostics, Impulse Oscillometry (IOS) has emerged as a promising alternative. This study aims to compare the diagnostic performance of Spirometry and IOS in patients attending the Respiratory Medicine Department at the Acharya Vinoba Bhave Rural Hospital, Sawangi, India. Methods A Comparative Observational Study was conducted between August 2022 and August 2024, enrolling patients who met specific inclusion criteria. Data were collected through a comprehensive medical history, clinical examination, routine blood tests, chest radiography, High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT), spirometry, and IOS. Key parameters, including Forced expiratory volume in the first second FEV1, FEV1/FVC (Forced Expiratory Volume), (Forced Expiratory Volume) FVC, (Forced Expiratory Flow) FEF 25-75 for Spirometry, and R5, R20, fres, X5, and AX for IOS, were analyzed using the Chi-Square Test and Student’s t-test with SPSS 27.0 and GraphPad Prism 7.0. Expected outcome The study included 130 participants with the primary objective of evaluating IOS’s diagnostic advantages of IOS over spirometry. Our findings demonstrate that IOS offers enhanced sensitivity for diagnosing early small airway diseases, which is a crucial factor for early diagnosis in both pediatric and adult populations.

                Background In patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) undergoing maintenance hemodialysis, intradialytic hypertension and intradialytic hypotension are the common complications. The study aimed to collect and assess intradialytic Blood Pressure (BP) complications and their association with different factors, including BP medication. Methods This was a prospective observational study, conducted at the hemodialysis center in a teaching hospital in the UAE, that provide a specialist’s care for the patients receiving ongoing hemodialysis. Patient demographics, medications used, lab data and the peridialytic BP (pre-, intra-, and post-) dialytic BP were collected for a period of 6 months. SPSS Version 29, Armonk, NY was used for statistical analysis. Pearson Chi-square test and Fischer’s Exact test were used to compare the association between categorical variables to intradialytic hypertension and hypotension. Results Blood pressure data was collected from 47 hemodialysis patients for a total of 2616 hemodialysis sessions during the 6 months study period. Beta-blockers (68%) and calcium channel blockers (66%) were the commonly used antihypertensive medications in the study population. Intradialytic hypertension events were diagnosed in 49 hemodialysis sessions and intradialytic hypotension was diagnosed in 23 hemodialysis sessions. On comparing the effect of antihypertensive medication to the occurrence of intradialytic BP complications, ARBs and alpha-1 blockers showed no association to intradialytic hypertension, but beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers use were associated with increased number of intradialytic hypertension events (p-value <0.05). On the other hand, antihypertensive medication use showed no association with intradialytic hypotension. Conclusions Patients using ARBs or alpha-1 blockers had higher intradialytic hypertension events. Beta-blocker and calcium channel users had lower intradialytic hypertension events. Antihypertensive use showed no association with intradialytic hypotension events.

                <p>by Kris Sankaran, Pratheepa Jeganathan</p>

Time series studies of microbiome interventions provide valuable data about microbial ecosystem structure. Unfortunately, existing models of microbial community dynamics have limited temporal memory and expressivity, relying on Markov or linearity assumptions. To address this, we introduce a new class of models based on transfer functions. These models learn impulse responses, capturing the potentially delayed effects of environmental changes on the microbial community. This allows us to simulate trajectories under hypothetical interventions and select significantly perturbed taxa with False Discovery Rate guarantees. Through simulations, we show that our approach effectively reduces forecasting errors compared to strong baselines and accurately pinpoints taxa of interest. Our case studies highlight the interpretability of the resulting differential response trajectories. An R package, mbtransfer, and notebooks to replicate the simulation and case studies are provided.

                <p>by MingYi Wang, Jacob G. Scott, Alexander Vladimirsky</p>

Although adaptive cancer therapy shows promise in integrating evolutionary dynamics into treatment scheduling, the stochastic nature of cancer evolution has seldom been taken into account. Various sources of random perturbations can impact the evolution of heterogeneous tumors, making performance metrics of any treatment policy random as well. In this paper, we propose an efficient method for selecting optimal adaptive treatment policies under randomly evolving tumor dynamics. The goal is to improve the cumulative “cost” of treatment, a combination of the total amount of drugs used and the total treatment time. As this cost also becomes random in any stochastic setting, we maximize the probability of reaching the treatment goals (tumor stabilization or eradication) without exceeding a pre-specified cost threshold (or a “budget”). We use a novel Stochastic Optimal Control formulation and Dynamic Programming to find such “threshold-aware” optimal treatment policies. Our approach enables an efficient algorithm to compute these policies for a range of threshold values simultaneously. Compared to treatment plans shown to be optimal in a deterministic setting, the new “threshold-aware” policies significantly improve the chances of the therapy succeeding under the budget, which is correlated with a lower general drug usage. We illustrate this method using two specific examples, but our approach is far more general and provides a new tool for optimizing adaptive therapies based on a broad range of stochastic cancer models.

Tumor microenvironments (TMEs) contain vast amounts of information on patient’s cancer through their cellular composition and the spatial distribution of tumor cells and immune cell populations. Exploring variations in TMEs between patient groups, as well as determining the extent to which this information can predict outcomes such as patient survival or treatment success with emerging immunotherapies, is of great interest. Moreover, in the face of a large number of cell interactions to consider, we often wish to identify specific interactions that are useful in making such predictions. We present an approach to achieve these goals based on summarizing spatial relationships in the TME using spatial <i>K</i> functions, and then applying functional data analysis and random forest models to both predict outcomes of interest and identify important spatial relationships. This approach is shown to be effective in simulation experiments at both identifying important spatial interactions while also controlling the false discovery rate. We further used the proposed approach to interrogate two real data sets of Multiplexed Ion Beam Images of TMEs in triple negative breast cancer and lung cancer patients. The methods proposed are publicly available in a companion R package funkycells.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23612?af=R">Dynamics of spike transmission and suppression between principal cells and interneurons in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Synaptic excitation and inhibition are essential for neuronal communication. However, the variables that regulate synaptic excitation and inhibition in the intact brain remain largely unknown. Here, we examined how spike transmission and suppression between principal cells (PCs) and interneurons (INTs) are modulated by activity history, brain state, cell type, and somatic distance between presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons by applying cross-correlogram analyses to datasets recorded from the dorsal hippocampus and medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) of 11 male behaving and sleeping Long Evans rats. The strength, temporal delay, and brain-state dependency of the spike transmission and suppression depended on the subregions/layers. The spike transmission probability of PC–INT excitatory pairs that showed short-term depression versus short-term facilitation was higher in CA1 and lower in CA3. Likewise, the intersomatic distance affected the proportion of PC–INT excitatory pairs that showed short-term depression and facilitation in the opposite manner in CA1 compared with CA3. The time constant of depression was longer, while that of facilitation was shorter in MEC than in CA1 and CA3. During sharp-wave ripples, spike transmission showed a larger gain in the MEC than in CA1 and CA3. The intersomatic distance affected the spike transmission gain during sharp-wave ripples differently in CA1 versus CA3. A subgroup of MEC layer 3 (EC3) INTs preferentially received excitatory inputs from and inhibited MEC layer 2 (EC2) PCs. The EC2 PC–EC3 INT excitatory pairs, most of which showed short-term depression, exhibited higher spike transmission probabilities than the EC2 PC–EC2 INT and EC3 PC–EC3 INT excitatory pairs. EC2 putative stellate cells exhibited stronger spike transmission to and received weaker spike suppression from EC3 INTs than EC2 putative pyramidal cells. This study provides detailed comparisons of monosynaptic interaction dynamics in the hippocampal–entorhinal loop, which may help to elucidate circuit operations.</p>

                Introduction Diarrhea is a significant health problem in the Third World. Identification of the pathogen that causes diarrhea is vital for measures to prevent and control this disease. There are also very few reports of diarrhea in Sudan. Our study aimed to determine the Prevalence of specific protozoan pathogens (Entamoeba histolytica, Cryptosporidium parvum., and Giardia spp) in children in Khartoum, Sudan. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional survey among children under five years of age who were hospitalized with acute diarrhea between April and December 2014. Diarrheal stool samples were collected and E. histolytica, C. parvum, and Giardia spp were examined using multiplex real-time PCR. Results Four hundred and thirty-seven children with acute diarrheawere included in this study; the higher Prevalence of diarrhea was in the age less than ≤ 2 years old (403,92.2%). The male-to-female ratio in this study was 1:1.7. infection with intestinal parasite was found in 155 (35.5%) cases, and co-infection was detected in 16 (10.3%) cases. Giardia spp(18.8%) and C. parvum (15.8 %) were the most frequently identified parasites, followed by E. histolytica (0.9). The parasite infection rate was highest and lowest in the under 2-year-old group (92.3%) and the 2–4-year-old group (7.3%). The infection rate was higher in boys (67.1%) than in girls (32.9%). The incidence of protozoan infection was higher in the rainy season (August to December) (92.2%), corresponding with that in the dry Season (April to June). (7.8%). Discussion Our present study demonstrated the high prevalence of Giardia spp and C. parvum in children with diarrhea in the Khartoum region and the usefulness of the multiplex real-time method in disclosing pathogenic protozoal agents. Our result highlighted the necessity of developing intervention measurement and control strategies to deal with childhood parasitic diarrhea in this region.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Approximately half of ischemic strokes (IS) in cancer patients are cryptogenic, with many presumed cardioembolic. We evaluated whether there were specific miRNA and mRNA transcriptome architectures in peripheral blood of IS patients with and without comorbid cancer, and between cardioembolic versus noncardioembolic IS etiologies in comorbid cancer.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We studied patients with cancer and IS (CS; n = 42), stroke only (SO; n = 41), and cancer only (n = 28), and vascular risk factor-matched controls (n = 30). mRNA-Seq and miRNA-Seq data, analyzed with linear regression models, identified differentially expressed genes in CS versus SO and in cardioembolic versus noncardioembolic CS, and miRNA-mRNA regulatory pairs. Network-level analyses identified stroke etiology-specific responses in CS.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 2,085 mRNAs and 31 miRNAs were differentially expressed between CS and SO. In CS, 122 and 35 miRNA-mRNA regulatory pairs, and 5 and 3 coexpressed gene modules, were associated with cardioembolic and noncardioembolic CS, respectively. Complement, growth factor, and immune/inflammatory pathways showed differences between IS etiologies in CS. A 15-gene biomarker panel assembled from a derivation cohort (n = 50) correctly classified 81% of CS and 71% of SO participants in a validation cohort (n = 33). Another 15-gene panel correctly identified etiologies for 13 of 13 CS-cardioembolic and 11 of 11 CS-noncardioembolic participants upon cross-validation; 11 of 16 CS-cryptogenic participants were predicted cardioembolic.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>We discovered unique mRNA and miRNA transcriptome architecture in CS and SO, and in CS with different IS etiologies. Cardioembolic and noncardioembolic etiologies in CS showed unique coexpression networks and potential master regulators. These may help distinguish CS from SO and identify IS etiology in cryptogenic CS patients. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

                In the 21st century, impact of social media, particularly Social Networking Sites (SNSs) has been linked to a wide range of human beliefs and expectations. Growing body of research has indicated that body image concerns along with exercise motivation and social comparison are on the rise among young adults. The present study aimed to examine the sex difference in body image, exercise motivation and social comparison among people who use Instagram in the age group 20-30. A total of 212 participants (men=106, women=106) aged 20-30 years, who are users of Instagram completed Body Self Image Questionnaire Short Form as a measure of Body image, Exercise Motivation Inventory – 2 as a measure of Exercise Motivation and Instagram as a Tool for Social Comparison as a measure of Social Comparison. Results showed that a significant difference in body image exist across gender with body image issues higher among females and significant difference in exercise motivation across gender with exercise motivation higher among males. No sex differences were seen in social comparison. It was concluded that body image concerns are higher among females and the drive for exercise is higher among males who used Instagram. It was found that body image concerns were higher among people who exercised regularly as well as among those who followed fitness related pages on Instagram as compared to those who did not. These results provide an insight into the sex differences between the variables and future directions can be aimed at conducting an in-depth analysis using body image, exercise motivation and social comparison.

                Dunot et al. identify AETA, a bioactive cleavage product of amyloid-β precursor protein, as a novel endogenous NMDA receptor regulator. AETA competes with receptor co-agonists, thereby modulating ionotropic and non-ionotropic receptor activities. Chronic AETA loss impairs synaptic plasticity and memory. These findings highlight a new mechanism regulating brain information processing.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/89025">Distance and grid-like codes support the navigation of abstract social space in the human brain</a></h4>

              
                People form impressions about others during daily social encounters and infer personality traits from others' behaviors. Such trait inference is thought to rely on two universal dimensions: competence and warmth. These two dimensions can be used to construct a ‘social cognitive map’ organizing massive information obtained from social encounters efficiently. Originating from spatial cognition, the neural codes supporting the representation and navigation of spatial cognitive maps have been widely studied. Recent studies suggest similar neural mechanism subserves the map-like architecture in social cognition as well. Here we investigated how spatial codes operate beyond the physical environment and support the representation and navigation of social cognitive map. We designed a social value space defined by two dimensions of competence and warmth. Behaviorally, participants were able to navigate to a learned location from random starting locations in this abstract social space. At the neural level, we identified the representation of distance in the precuneus, fusiform gyrus, and middle occipital gyrus. We also found partial evidence of grid-like representation patterns in the medial prefrontal cortex and entorhinal cortex. Moreover, the intensity of grid-like response scaled with the performance of navigating in social space and social avoidance trait scores. Our findings suggest a neurocognitive mechanism by which social information can be organized into a structured representation, namely cognitive map and its relevance to social well-being.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/83527">A chronic signaling TGFb zebrafish reporter identifies immune response in melanoma</a></h4>

              
                Developmental signaling pathways associated with growth factors such as TGFb are commonly dysregulated in melanoma. Here we identified a human TGFb enhancer specifically activated in melanoma cells treated with TGFB1 ligand. We generated stable transgenic zebrafish with this TGFb Induced Enhancer driving green fluorescent protein (<i>TIE:EGFP</i>). <i>TIE:EGFP</i> was not expressed in normal melanocytes or early melanomas but was expressed in spatially distinct regions of advanced melanomas. Single-cell RNA-sequencing revealed that <i>TIE:EGFP<sup>+</sup></i> melanoma cells down-regulated interferon response while up-regulating a novel set of chronic TGFb target genes. ChIP-sequencing demonstrated that AP-1 factor binding is required for activation of chronic TGFb response. Overexpression of <i>SATB2</i>, a chromatin remodeler associated with tumor spreading, showed activation of TGFb signaling in early melanomas. Confocal imaging and flow cytometric analysis showed that macrophages localize to <i>TIE:EGFP<sup>+</sup></i> regions and preferentially phagocytose <i>TIE:EGFP<sup>+</sup></i> melanoma cells compared to <i>TIE:EGFP<sup>-</sup></i> melanoma cells. This work identifies a TGFb induced immune response and demonstrates the need for the development of chronic TGFb biomarkers to predict patient response to TGFb inhibitors.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92844">Identification and characterization of intermediate states in mammalian neural crest cell epithelial to mesenchymal transition and delamination</a></h4>

              
                Epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a cellular process that converts epithelial cells to mesenchymal cells with migratory potential in developmental and pathological processes. Although originally considered a binary event, EMT in cancer progression involves intermediate states between a fully epithelial and a fully mesenchymal phenotype, which are characterized by distinct combinations of epithelial and mesenchymal markers. This phenomenon has been termed epithelial to mesenchymal plasticity (EMP), however, the intermediate states remain poorly described and it’s unclear whether they exist during developmental EMT. Neural crest cells (NCC) are an embryonic progenitor cell population that gives rise to numerous cell types and tissues in vertebrates, and their formation and delamination is a classic example of developmental EMT. However, whether intermediate states also exist during NCC EMT and delamination remains unknown. Through single-cell RNA sequencing of mouse embryos, we identified intermediate NCC states based on their transcriptional signature and then spatially defined their locations in situ in the dorsolateral neuroepithelium. Our results illustrate the importance of cell cycle regulation and functional role for the intermediate stage marker <i>Dlc1</i> in facilitating mammalian cranial NCC delamination and may provide new insights into mechanisms regulating pathological EMP.

	<p>Objective: To characterize the cognitive profile of long COVID-19 subjects and its possible association with clinical symptoms, emotional disturbance, biomarkers, and disease severity. Methods: We performed a single-center cross-sectional cohort study. Subjects between 20 and 60 years old with confirmed COVID-19 infection were included. The assessment was performed 6 months following hospital or ambulatory discharge. Excluded were those with prior neurocognitive impairment and severe neurological/neuropsychiatric disorders. Demographic and laboratory data were extracted from medical records. Results: Altogether, 108 participants were included, 64 were male (59.25%), and the mean age was 49.10 years. The patients were classified into four groups: non-hospitalized (NH, n = 10), hospitalized without Intensive Care Unit (ICU) or oxygen therapy (HOSPI, n = 21), hospitalized without ICU but with oxygen therapy (OXY, n = 56), and ICU (ICU, n = 21) patients. In total, 38 (35.18%) reported Subjective Cognitive Complaints (SCC). No differences were found considering illness severity between groups. Females had more persistent clinical symptoms and SCC than males. Persistent dyspnea and headache were associated with higher scores in anxiety and depression. Persistent fatigue, anxiety, and depression were associated with worse overall cognition. Conclusions: No cognitive impairment was found regarding the severity of post-COVID-19 infection. SCC was not associated with a worse cognitive performance, but with higher anxiety and depression. Persistent clinical symptoms were frequent independent of illness severity. Fatigue, anxiety, and depression were linked to poorer cognitive function. Tests for attention, processing speed, and executive function were the most sensitive in detecting cognitive changes in these patients.</p>

	<p>High-frequency magnetic stimulation (HFMS) applied directly to the hippocampal slice preparation in vitro induces activity-dependent synaptic plasticity and metaplasticity. In addition, changes in synaptic transmission following HFMS involve the activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate and metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR). Here, we asked whether a short period of HFMS (5 &amp;amp;times; 10 delta-burst trains, duration of ~1 min) could alter mGluR5-mediated depression at Schaffer collateral&amp;amp;ndash;CA1 synapses in the acute brain slice preparation at 30 min after HFMS. To this end, we obtained field excitatory postsynaptic potential (fEPSP) slopes from Schaffer collateral&amp;amp;ndash;CA1 synapses after HFMS or control. First, we demonstrated that activity-dependent plasticity following HFMS depends on the slice orientation towards the magnetic coil indicating specific ion fluxes induced by magnetic fields. Second, we found that the mGluR5-specific agonist (RS)-2-chloro-5-hydroxyphenylglycine reduced the field excitatory postsynaptic potential (fEPSP) slopes in control slices but rather enhanced them in HFMS-treated slices. In contrast, the compound (S)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine acting at both mGluR1 and mGluR5 reduced fEPSP slopes in both control and HFMS-treated slices. Importantly, the mGluR-dependent effects were independent from the slice-to-coil orientation indicating that asynchronous glutamate release could play a role. We conclude that a short period of HFMS inhibits subsequently evoked mGluR5-dependent depression at Schaffer collateral&amp;amp;ndash;CA1 synapses. This could be relevant for repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation in psychiatric disorders such as major depression.</p>

	<p>Background: Schizophrenia is a mental disorder affecting approximately 0.32% of the global population, according to the World Health Organization. Antipsychotic medications are used to treat this condition by inhibiting D2 dopamine and 5HT2 serotonin receptors. The selection of the appropriate mode of delivery for these drugs is based on factors such as patient adherence, clinical presentation, and patient preferences. However, additional drivers of treatment selection are required in clinical practice. Mounting evidence suggests that neuroinflammation plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. NLR, a cost-effective biomarker of inflammation, has increased in several psychiatric conditions and may represent a valid method for studying the inflammatory stage in schizophrenia, relapse, and the first episode of psychosis. The aim of this study is to evaluate whether there are any variations in NLR values between patients given oral antipsychotics and those given long-acting antipsychotics. Methods: The study included 50 individuals with schizophrenia, either acute or in the follow-up phase. NLR was obtained by calculating the ratio of absolute neutrophil count (cells/&amp;amp;mu;L) and absolute lymphocyte count (cells/&amp;amp;mu;L). Results: Patients on long-acting antipsychotics exhibited significantly lower mean NLR scores (1.5 &amp;amp;plusmn; 0.7) compared to those on oral antipsychotics (2.2 &amp;amp;plusmn; 1.3) (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). Conclusions: NLR appears promising as a neuroinflammatory biomarker. This study reveals significantly lower NLR values in patients on long-acting antipsychotics, which may signify reduced systemic inflammation and improved adherence.</p>

	<p>Cerebral amyloid angiopathy is characterized by a weakening of the small- and medium-sized cerebral arteries, as their smooth muscle cells are progressively replaced with acellular amyloid &amp;amp;beta;, increasing vessel fragility and vulnerability to microhemorrhage. In this context, an aberrant overactivation of the complement system would further aggravate this process. The surface protein CD59 protects most cells from complement-induced cytotoxicity, but expression levels can fluctuate due to disease and varying cell types. The degree to which CD59 protects human cerebral vascular smooth muscle (HCSM) cells from complement-induced cytotoxicity has not yet been determined. To address this shortcoming, we selectively blocked the activity of HCSM-expressed CD59 with an antibody, and challenged the cells with complement, then measured cellular viability. Unblocked HCSM cells proved resistant to all tested concentrations of complement, and this resistance decreased progressively with increasing concentrations of anti-CD59 antibody. Complete CD59 blockage, however, did not result in a total loss of cellular viability, suggesting that additional factors may have some protective functions. Taken together, this implies that CD59 plays a predominant role in HCSM cellular protection against complement-induced cytotoxicity. The overexpression of CD59 could be an effective means of protecting these cells from excessive complement system activity, with consequent reductions in the incidence of microhemorrhage. The precise extent to which cellular repair mechanisms and other complement repair proteins contribute to this resistance has yet to be fully elucidated.</p>

	<p>This review aims to analyze the current literature to identify articles related to the role of nurses and, in general, the nursing management of patients suffering from medication overuse headache (MOH), a globally spread disease. We specifically argue for non-pharmacological approaches to pain management, such as multidisciplinary team approaches, holistic treatment, cognitive behavioral therapy and exercise. For this review, we investigated international scientific databases, including PubMed, CINAHL, Scopus and Embase, in the period between 2000 and 2024. We observed a wealth of scientific articles related to MOH, but a poverty of articles relating to the nursing management of headache. The research included the presence of academic-level training for nurses, whereas there are few institutions that train competent professionals in both pharmacological and non-pharmacological management of MOH patients. Nursing assessment and assistance strategies are indicated to plan tailored treatment paths related to the specific needs of these patients.</p>

	<p>People seeking asylum are susceptible to head injury (HI) due to exposure to various forms of violence including war, torture, or interpersonal violence. Yet, the extents to which clinicians assess HI, and if so, what the associated characteristics are, are not well known. We analyzed 200 U.S.-based medico-legal affidavits using descriptive, multivariate regression, and thematic analysis. Head injury was documented in 38% of affidavits. Those who experienced physical violence were eight times likelier to experience HI than those who did not experience physical violence. Five themes emerged: (1) HI occurred commonly in the context of interpersonal violence (44%), followed by militarized violence (33%); (2) mechanisms of HI included direct blows to the head and asphyxiation, suggesting potential for both traumatic brain injury and brain injury from oxygen deprivation; (3) HI was often recurrent and concurrent with other physical injuries; (4) co-morbid psychiatric and post-concussive symptoms made it challenging to assess neurological and psychiatric etiologies; and (5) overall, there was a paucity of assessments and documentation of HI and sequelae. Among individuals assessed for asylum claims, HI is common, often recurrent, occurring in the context of interpersonal violence, and concurrent with psychological and other physical trauma. Physical violence is an important risk factor for HI, which should be assessed when physical violence is reported.</p>

	<p>Palatine and pharyngeal tonsil hypertrophy may lead to dysfunction of the auditory tube due to a propensity for infection, potentially giving rise to otitis media. This is a quantitative and longitudinal study, developed from 2019 to 2021, at the State University of Campinas (UNICAMP). The studied sample comprised 15 participants aged 5 to 12 years (mean 7.9 years), 12 male and 3 female, arranged into two groups: children diagnosed with pharyngeal and/or palatine tonsil hypertrophy who were candidates for surgery (G1), and children who were later evaluated after surgery (G2). As part of the test, an otoscopy and measurements of logoaudiometry, pure-tone threshold audiometry, wideband tympanometry (ambient and peak pressure), and otoacoustic emissions (TEOAEs and DPOAEs, both at ambient and peak pressure) were all performed. There were statistically significant differences between phases in pure-tone audiometry, in terms of 226 Hz tympanometry, wideband tympanometry in peak pressure conditions, in the amplitude measurement TEOAEs in both pressure conditions, in DPOAEs in ambient pressure conditions, and in the signal/noise measurement in both pressures in DPOAEs. Overall, it was found that hearing tests were different for subjects with palatine and pharyngeal tonsil hypertrophy compared to the post-surgical group.</p>

                Background Climate change, largely triggered by human-induced greenhouse gases (GHGs) emissions, seems unstoppable. There was a strong rebound of anthropogenic emissions of CO2, the preponderant GHG in terms of contribution to global warming, around the world after the COVID-19 lockdown. Also, there is still no widely accepted international treaty on curbing the anthropogenic emissions of CH4 and N2O, the second and third predominant GHG, respectively, so far. Thereby, prima facie, in respect to mitigating climate change, currently, humans have no aces up their sleeves. It seems that current temperature rise is not high enough to take alarm until the occurrence of tipping point. Policy Climate-related international treaties, such as 2016 Paris agreement, are compromises among conflicting geopolitical pressures. However, currently, the climate treaties show little mandatory binding force on the signatories who are able to violate and then get off scot-free, thus may end up like a nostrum. Throughout the European history, I find that the only way, if at all, to achieve the peace or obedience of a treaty is via balancing powers, embodied in Bismarck’s Realpolitik of Germany and Richelieu’s Raison d'état of France. Similarly, the Chinese history in East Asia proved the significance of unadulterated ideological neutrality and Darwinian adaptability in the kaleidoscope of evolving circumstances in maintaining order and enforcement of international treaties through balancing the power of rivalries to constrain ever-recurring challengers for equilibrium. Recommendations A successful policy needs to make a thorough analysis of all relevant factors to form a long-term strategic notion. Then, statesmen need to distill an array of nebulous, always contradictory options into a tenacious, controllable direction. Thereby, I suggest that, for better curbing global warming, climate agreements or climate club be incorporated into an overall geopolitical framework among the international communities.

                Background This study delves into the cultural portrayal of teachers in Vietnam, a subject critical to understanding the broader role of educators in shaping societal and educational values. Through an analysis of song lyrics, the research aims to uncover how the professional identity of teachers is reflected and shaped within the unique cultural context of Vietnam. Methods A qualitative approach underpins this study, utilizing theoretical frameworks such as Constructivist Grounded Theory, Sociocultural Theory, Symbolic Interactionism, and Hermeneutic Phenomenology. Twelve Vietnamese songs specifically about teachers were selected for analysis. These songs were carefully chosen to provide a diverse and representative sample of the cultural portrayal of teachers in Vietnam. The project spanned from January 1st until February 21st, 2024. Results The analysis revealed several key themes that collectively characterize the professional identity of Vietnamese teachers. These include ‘Sacrifice and Dedication,’ highlighting the commitment and perseverance of teachers; ‘Respect and Reverence,’ reflecting the deep societal respect for the teaching profession; ‘Nurturing and Inspiration,’ depicting teachers as cultivators of dreams and moral values; ‘Enduring Impact and Memory,’ emphasizing the long-lasting influence of teachers on their students; ‘Teacher as a Guiding Figure,’ portraying the role of teachers as key moral and cultural guides; and ‘Emotional Connection and Affection,’ underlining the deep emotional bonds between teachers and students. Conclusions The study’s findings underscore the significant role of cultural and emotional factors in shaping the professional identity of teachers in Vietnam. These themes highlight the multifaceted role of teachers that transcends academic teaching, involving personal development, cultural transmission, and emotional nurturing. The implications of these findings are far-reaching, suggesting that educational policies and teacher education programs need to consider these cultural and emotional dimensions. Additionally, the study highlights the power of cultural artifacts, like music, in reflecting and shaping societal values and professional identities.

                Introduction Cervical cancer is a significant global health concern, especially in low- and middle-income countries with limited access to preventive healthcare. India’s vast rural population amplifies the challenge, demanding immediate action. Despite advancements, cervical cancer remains prevalent among underserved rural communities, hindered by barriers to Human Papillomavirus (HPV) screening uptake, including socioeconomic and financial constraints. This study aims to evaluate the economic challenges encountered by rural women when accessing HPV screening. Methods A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 1502 women aged 30 to 45 in Pondicherry, India, utilizing the Andersen Model as a conceptual framework. Household questionnaires gathered data on HPV screening expenses, including patient travel costs, productivity loss, and companion costs. The analysis utilized regression models, to identify the factors impacting the economic challenges associated with accessing HPV screening. Results Employment status and higher education significantly increase total costs by 73.483 (p < 0.001) and 90.169 units (p < 0.001) respectively. Income level, though with a minimal coefficient (B = 0.000), shows a significant effect (p = 0.019) on total costs. Longer travel hours raise costs by 5.129 units (p < 0.001), while having a companion increases costs by 106.095 units (p = 0.004). Prolonged patient time at Primary Health Center (PHC) contributes to a 2.357-unit increase in costs (p < 0.001). Conclusions The study highlights the multifaceted economic challenges faced by rural populations accessing HPV screening for cervical cancer prevention in India. Notwithstanding diverse demographics and varying proximity to healthcare facilities, individuals encounter significant barriers such as travel time and associated costs. Addressing these challenges necessitates targeted interventions to reduce socioeconomic disparities and improve healthcare accessibility for vulnerable populations, thereby advancing cervical cancer prevention efforts and promoting health equity in rural communities.

                Objectives The primary objective of this systematic review was to identify the optimal timing for immunizing pregnant women to confer the most protection by reducing the incidence of laboratory-confirmed influenza or influenza-like illness in infants less than 6 months of age. Currently, there are gaps in research regarding the timing of administration during the gestational period to provide maximum immunogenicity to the infant. The research question being addressed is: ‘When considering immunization of pregnant mothers with the influenza vaccine, implementing a vaccination program during which trimester in pregnancy would optimize benefits for infants less than 6 months of age in terms of the incidence of laboratory-confirmed influenza and influenza-like illness?’ Design Systematic review/Meta-analysis Methods Randomized controlled trials (RCT’s) and observational studies comparing health outcomes of infants and children up to 6 months of age born to women who received inactivated influenza vaccine during pregnancy with mothers who did not receive the vaccine or received a control vaccine. The primary outcome was laboratory-confirmed influenza infection in infants. Secondary outcome measures included influenza –like illness diagnosed by a clinician and acute respiratory illness. Results 7 studies were included: 2 primary RCT’s and 5 observational studies (prospective and retrospective cohort studies).5 of the 7 studies were suitable to be included in the quantitative synthesis part and and were compared. Forrest plot analysis revealed that vaccinating pregnant mothers in the second and third trimester when compared with any trimester (1,2 and 3) (OR 0.18 vs. 0.65) conferred less protection, promoting vaccination in the first trimester. Conclusions Vaccinating pregnant mothers in the first trimester conferred greater protection to infants than any other trimester.

                A common outcome of analysing RNA-Seq data is the detection of biological pathways with significantly altered activity between the conditions under investigation. Whilst many strategies test for over-representation of genes, showing changed expression within pre-defined gene-sets, these analyses typically do not account for gene-gene interactions encoded by pathway topologies, and are not able to directly predict the directional change of pathway activity. To address these issues we have developed sSNAPPY,now available as an R/Bioconductor package, which leverages pathway topology information to compute pathway perturbation scores and predict the direction of change across a set of pathways. Here, we demonstrate the use of sSNAPPY by applying the method to public scRNA-seq data, derived from ovarian cancer patient tissues collected before and after chemotherapy. Not only were we able to predict the direction of pathway perturbations discussed in the original study, but sSNAPPY was also able to detect significant changes of other biological processes, yielding far greater insight into the response to treatment. sSNAPPY represents a novel pathway analysis strategy that takes into consideration pathway topology to predict impacted biology pathways, both within related samples and across treatment groups. In addition to not relying on differentially expressed genes, the method and associated R package offers important flexibility and provides powerful visualisation tools.

                <p>by Audrey Duval, Quentin J. Leclerc, Didier Guillemot, Laura Temime, Lulla Opatowski</p>

Small populations (e.g., hospitals, schools or workplaces) are characterised by high contact heterogeneity and stochasticity affecting pathogen transmission dynamics. Empirical individual contact data provide unprecedented information to characterize such heterogeneity and are increasingly available, but are usually collected over a limited period, and can suffer from observation bias. We propose an algorithm to stochastically reconstruct realistic temporal networks from individual contact data in healthcare settings (HCS) and test this approach using real data previously collected in a long-term care facility (LTCF). Our algorithm generates full networks from recorded close-proximity interactions, using hourly inter-individual contact rates and information on individuals’ wards, the categories of staff involved in contacts, and the frequency of recurring contacts. It also provides data augmentation by reconstructing contacts for days when some individuals are present in the HCS without having contacts recorded in the empirical data. Recording bias is formalized through an observation model, to allow direct comparison between the augmented and observed networks. We validate our algorithm using data collected during the i-Bird study, and compare the empirical and reconstructed networks. The algorithm was substantially more accurate to reproduce network characteristics than random graphs. The reconstructed networks reproduced well the assortativity by ward (first–third quartiles observed: 0.54–0.64; synthetic: 0.52–0.64) and the hourly staff and patient contact patterns. Importantly, the observed temporal correlation was also well reproduced (0.39–0.50 vs 0.37–0.44), indicating that our algorithm could recreate a realistic temporal structure. The algorithm consistently recreated unobserved contacts to generate full reconstructed networks for the LTCF. To conclude, we propose an approach to generate realistic temporal contact networks and reconstruct unobserved contacts from summary statistics computed using individual-level interaction networks. This could be applied and extended to generate contact networks to other HCS using limited empirical data, to subsequently inform individual-based epidemic models.

                <p>by Jente Willaert, Kaat Desloovere, Anja Van Campenhout, Lena H. Ting, Friedl De Groote</p>

Balance impairments are common in cerebral palsy. When balance is perturbed by backward support surface translations, children with cerebral palsy have increased co-activation of the plantar flexors and tibialis anterior muscle as compared to typically developing children. However, it is unclear whether increased muscle co-activation is a compensation strategy to improve balance control or is a consequence of reduced reciprocal inhibition. During translational perturbations, increased joint stiffness due to co-activation might aid balance control by resisting movement of the body with respect to the feet. In contrast, during rotational perturbations, increased joint stiffness will hinder balance control as it couples body to platform rotation. Therefore, we expect increased muscle co-activation in response to rotational perturbations if co-activation is caused by reduced reciprocal inhibition but not if it is merely a compensation strategy. We perturbed standing balance by combined backward translational and toe-up rotational perturbations in 20 children with CP and 20 TD children. Perturbations induced forward followed by backward movement of the center of mass. We evaluated reactive muscle activity and the relation between center of mass movement and reactive muscle activity using a linear feedback model based on center of mass kinematics. In typically developing children, perturbations induced plantar flexor balance correcting muscle activity followed by tibialis anterior balance correcting muscle activity, which was driven by center of mass movement. In children with cerebral palsy, the switch from plantar flexor to tibialis anterior activity was less pronounced than in typically developing children due to increased muscle co-activation of the plantar flexors and tibialis anterior throughout the response. Our results thus suggest that a reduction in reciprocal inhibition causes muscle co-activation in reactive standing balance in children with CP.

                <p>by Seoyoung Ahn, Hossein Adeli, Gregory J. Zelinsky</p>

Humans are extremely robust in our ability to perceive and recognize objects—we see faces in tea stains and can recognize friends on dark streets. Yet, neurocomputational models of primate object recognition have focused on the initial feed-forward pass of processing through the ventral stream and less on the top-down feedback that likely underlies robust object perception and recognition. Aligned with the generative approach, we propose that the visual system actively facilitates recognition by reconstructing the object hypothesized to be in the image. Top-down attention then uses this reconstruction as a template to bias feedforward processing to align with the most plausible object hypothesis. Building on auto-encoder neural networks, our model makes detailed hypotheses about the appearance and location of the candidate objects in the image by reconstructing a complete object representation from potentially incomplete visual input due to noise and occlusion. The model then leverages the best object reconstruction, measured by reconstruction error, to direct the bottom-up process of selectively routing low-level features, a top-down biasing that captures a core function of attention. We evaluated our model using the MNIST-C (handwritten digits under corruptions) and ImageNet-C (real-world objects under corruptions) datasets. Not only did our model achieve superior performance on these challenging tasks designed to approximate real-world noise and occlusion viewing conditions, but also better accounted for human behavioral reaction times and error patterns than a standard feedforward Convolutional Neural Network. Our model suggests that a complete understanding of object perception and recognition requires integrating top-down and attention feedback, which we propose is an object reconstruction.

                <p>by Benjamin V. Ineichen, Eva Furrer, Servan L. Grüninger, Wolfgang E. Zürrer, Malcolm R. Macleod</p>

There is an ongoing debate about the value of animal experiments to inform medical practice, yet there are limited data on how well therapies developed in animal studies translate to humans. We aimed to assess 2 measures of translation across various biomedical fields: (1) The proportion of therapies which transition from animal studies to human application, including involved timeframes; and (2) the consistency between animal and human study results. Thus, we conducted an umbrella review, including English systematic reviews that evaluated the translation of therapies from animals to humans. Medline, Embase, and Web of Science Core Collection were searched from inception until August 1, 2023. We assessed the proportion of therapeutic interventions advancing to any human study, a randomized controlled trial (RCT), and regulatory approval. We meta-analyzed the concordance between animal and human studies. The risk of bias was probed using a 10-item checklist for systematic reviews. We included 122 articles, describing 54 distinct human diseases and 367 therapeutic interventions. Neurological diseases were the focus of 32% of reviews. The overall proportion of therapies progressing from animal studies was 50% to human studies, 40% to RCTs, and 5% to regulatory approval. Notably, our meta-analysis showed an 86% concordance between positive results in animal and clinical studies. The median transition times from animal studies were 5, 7, and 10 years to reach any human study, an RCT, and regulatory approval, respectively. We conclude that, contrary to widespread assertions, the rate of successful animal-to-human translation may be higher than previously reported. Nonetheless, the low rate of final approval indicates potential deficiencies in the design of both animal studies and early clinical trials. To ameliorate the efficacy of translating therapies from bench to bedside, we advocate for enhanced study design robustness and the reinforcement of generalizability.

                <p>by Annafrancesca Rigato, Huicheng Meng, Claire Chardes, Adam Runions, Faris Abouakil, Richard S. Smith, Loïc LeGoff</p>

The polygonal shape of cells in proliferating epithelia is a result of the tensile forces of the cytoskeletal cortex and packing geometry set by the cell cycle. In the larval <i>Drosophila</i> epidermis, two cell populations, histoblasts and larval epithelial cells, compete for space as they grow on a limited body surface. They do so in the absence of cell divisions. We report a striking morphological transition of histoblasts during larval development, where they change from a tensed network configuration with straight cell outlines at the level of adherens junctions to a highly folded morphology. The apical surface of histoblasts shrinks while their growing adherens junctions fold, forming deep lobules. Volume increase of growing histoblasts is accommodated basally, compensating for the shrinking apical area. The folded geometry of apical junctions resembles elastic buckling, and we show that the imbalance between the shrinkage of the apical domain of histoblasts and the continuous growth of junctions triggers buckling. Our model is supported by laser dissections and optical tweezer experiments together with computer simulations. Our analysis pinpoints the ability of histoblasts to store mechanical energy to a much greater extent than most other epithelial cell types investigated so far, while retaining the ability to dissipate stress on the hours time scale. Finally, we propose a possible mechanism for size regulation of histoblast apical size through the lateral pressure of the epidermis, driven by the growth of cells on a limited surface. Buckling effectively compacts histoblasts at their apical plane and may serve to avoid physical harm to these adult epidermis precursors during larval life. Our work indicates that in growing nondividing cells, compressive forces, instead of tension, may drive cell morphology.

                <p>by Bianca A. Schuster, Sophie Sowden, Alicia J. Rybicki, Dagmar S. Fraser, Clare Press, Lydia Hickman, Peter Holland, Jennifer L. Cook</p>

Difficulties in reasoning about others’ mental states (i.e., mentalising/Theory of Mind) are highly prevalent among disorders featuring dopamine dysfunctions (e.g., Parkinson’s disease) and significantly affect individuals’ quality of life. However, due to multiple confounding factors inherent to existing patient studies, currently little is known about whether these sociocognitive symptoms originate from aberrant dopamine signalling or from psychosocial changes unrelated to dopamine. The present study, therefore, investigated the role of dopamine in modulating mentalising in a sample of healthy volunteers. We used a double-blind, placebo-controlled procedure to test the effect of the D2/D3 antagonist haloperidol on mental state attribution, using an adaptation of the Heider and Simmel (1944) animations task. On 2 separate days, once after receiving 2.5 mg haloperidol and once after receiving placebo, 33 healthy adult participants viewed and labelled short videos of 2 triangles depicting mental state (involving mentalistic interaction wherein 1 triangle intends to cause or act upon a particular mental state in the other, e.g., surprising) and non-mental state (involving reciprocal interaction without the intention to cause/act upon the other triangle’s mental state, e.g., following) interactions. Using Bayesian mixed effects models, we observed that haloperidol decreased accuracy in labelling both mental and non-mental state animations. Our secondary analyses suggest that dopamine modulates inference from mental and non-mental state animations via independent mechanisms, pointing towards 2 putative pathways underlying the dopaminergic modulation of <i>mental</i> state attribution: action representation and a shared mechanism supporting mentalising and emotion recognition. We conclude that dopaminergic pathways impact Theory of Mind, at least indirectly. Our results have implications for the neurochemical basis of sociocognitive difficulties in patients with dopamine dysfunctions and generate new hypotheses about the specific dopamine-mediated mechanisms underlying social cognition.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/89782">Base editing strategies to convert CAG to CAA diminish the disease-causing mutation in Huntington’s disease</a></h4>

              
                An expanded CAG repeat in the huntingtin gene (<i>HTT</i>) causes Huntington’s disease (HD). Since the length of uninterrupted CAG repeat, not polyglutamine, determines the age-at-onset in HD, base editing strategies to convert CAG to CAA are anticipated to delay onset by shortening the uninterrupted CAG repeat. Here, we developed base editing strategies to convert CAG in the repeat to CAA and determined their molecular outcomes and effects on relevant disease phenotypes. Base editing strategies employing combinations of cytosine base editors and guide RNAs (gRNAs) efficiently converted CAG to CAA at various sites in the CAG repeat without generating significant indels, off-target edits, or transcriptome alterations, demonstrating their feasibility and specificity. Candidate BE strategies converted CAG to CAA on both expanded and non-expanded CAG repeats without altering <i>HTT</i> mRNA and protein levels. In addition, somatic CAG repeat expansion, which is the major disease driver in HD, was significantly decreased in the liver by a candidate BE strategy treatment in HD knock-in mice carrying canonical CAG repeats. Notably, CAG repeat expansion was abolished entirely in HD knock-in mice carrying CAA-interrupted repeats, supporting the therapeutic potential of CAG-to-CAA conversion strategies in HD and potentially other repeat expansion disorders.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/87297">Brain age has limited utility as a biomarker for capturing fluid cognition in older individuals</a></h4>

              
                One well-known biomarker candidate that supposedly helps capture fluid cognition is Brain Age, or a predicted value based on machine-learning models built to predict chronological age from brain MRI. To formally evaluate the utility of Brain Age for capturing fluid cognition, we built 26 age-prediction models for Brain Age based on different combinations of MRI modalities, using the Human Connectome Project in Aging (n=504, 36–100 years old). First, based on commonality analyses, we found a large overlap between Brain Age and chronological age: Brain Age could uniquely add only around 1.6% in explaining variation in fluid cognition over and above chronological age. Second, the age-prediction models that performed better at predicting chronological age did NOT necessarily create better Brain Age for capturing fluid cognition over and above chronological age. Instead, better-performing age-prediction models created Brain Age that overlapped larger with chronological age, up to around 29% out of 32%, in explaining fluid cognition. Third, Brain Age missed around 11% of the total variation in fluid cognition that could have been explained by the brain variation. That is, directly predicting fluid cognition from brain MRI data (instead of relying on Brain Age and chronological age) could lead to around a 1/3-time improvement of the total variation explained. Accordingly, we demonstrated the limited utility of Brain Age as a biomarker for fluid cognition and made some suggestions to ensure the utility of Brain Age in explaining fluid cognition and other phenotypes of interest.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/89004">Sex-biased regulatory changes in the placenta of native highlanders contribute to adaptive fetal development</a></h4>

              
                Compared with lowlander migrants, native Tibetans have a higher reproductive success at high altitude though the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Here, we compared the transcriptome and histology of full-term placentas between native Tibetans and Han migrants. We found that the placental trophoblast shows the largest expression divergence between Tibetans and Han, and Tibetans show decreased immune response and endoplasmic reticulum stress. Remarkably, we detected a sex-biased expression divergence, where the male-infant placentas show a greater between-population difference than the female-infant placentas. The umbilical cord plays a key role in the sex-biased expression divergence, which is associated with the higher birth weight of the male newborns of Tibetans. We also identified adaptive histological changes in the male-infant placentas of Tibetans, including larger umbilical artery wall and umbilical artery intima and media, and fewer syncytial knots. These findings provide valuable insights into the sex-biased adaptation of human populations, with significant implications for medical and genetic studies of human reproduction.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97902">A CDK1 phosphorylation site on Drosophila PAR-3 regulates neuroblast polarisation and sensory organ formation</a></h4>

              
                The generation of distinct cell fates during development depends on asymmetric cell division of progenitor cells. In the central and peripheral nervous system of <i>Drosophila</i>, progenitor cells respectively called neuroblasts or sensory organ precursors use PAR polarity during mitosis to control cell fate determination in their daughter cells. How polarity and the cell cycle are coupled, and how the cell cycle machinery regulates PAR protein function and cell fate determination is poorly understood. Here, we generate an analog sensitive allele of CDK1 and reveal that its partial inhibition weakens but does not abolish apical polarity in embryonic and larval neuroblasts and leads to defects in polarisation of fate determinants. We describe a novel <i>in vivo</i> phosphorylation of Bazooka, the <i>Drosophila</i> homolog of PAR-3, on Serine180, a consensus CDK phosphorylation site. In some tissular contexts, phosphorylation of Serine180 occurs in asymmetrically dividing cells but not in their symmetrically dividing neighbours. In neuroblasts, Serine180 phosphomutants disrupt the timing of basal polarisation. Serine180 phosphomutants also affect the specification and binary cell fate determination of sensory organ precursors as well as Baz localisation during their asymmetric cell divisions. Finally, we show that CDK1 phosphorylates Serine-S180 and an equivalent Serine on human PAR-3 <i>in vitro</i>.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95209">A microRNA that controls the emergence of embryonic movement</a></h4>

              
                Movement is a key feature of animal systems, yet its embryonic origins are not fully understood. Here, we investigate the genetic basis underlying the embryonic onset of movement in <i>Drosophila</i> focusing on the role played by small non-coding RNAs (microRNAs, miRNAs). To this end, we first develop a quantitative behavioural pipeline capable of tracking embryonic movement in large populations of fly embryos, and using this system, discover that the <i>Drosophila</i> miRNA <i>miR-2b-1</i> plays a role in the emergence of movement. Through the combination of spectral analysis of embryonic motor patterns, cell sorting and RNA in situs, genetic reconstitution tests, and neural optical imaging we define that miR-2b-1 influences the emergence of embryonic movement by exerting actions in the developing nervous system. Furthermore, through the combination of bioinformatics coupled to genetic manipulation of miRNA expression and phenocopy tests we identify a previously uncharacterised (but evolutionarily conserved) chloride channel encoding gene – which we term <i><span class="underline">Mo</span>vement Modula<span class="underline">tor</span></i> (<i>Motor</i>) – as a genetic target that mechanistically links <i>miR-2b-1</i> to the onset of movement. Cell-specific genetic reconstitution of <i>miR-2b-1</i> expression in a null miRNA mutant background, followed by behavioural assays and target gene analyses, suggest that <i>miR-2b-1</i> affects the emergence of movement through effects in sensory elements of the embryonic circuitry, rather than in the motor domain. Our work thus reports the first miRNA system capable of regulating embryonic movement, suggesting that other miRNAs are likely to play a role in this key developmental process in <i>Drosophila</i> as well as in other species.

	<p>Rotenone (RTN) induces neurotoxicity and motor dysfunction in rats, mirroring the pathophysiological traits of Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD), including striatal oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and changes in neural structure. This makes RTN a valuable model for PD research. Berberine (BBR), an isoquinoline alkaloid recognized for its antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective properties, was evaluated for its ability to counteract RTN-induced impairments. Rats received subcutaneous RTN at 0.5 mg/kg for 21 days, resulting in weight loss and significant motor deficits assessed through open-field, bar catalepsy, beam-crossing, rotarod, and grip strength tests. BBR, administered orally at 30 or 100 mg/kg doses, one hour prior to RTN exposure for the same duration, effectively mitigated many of the RTN-induced motor impairments. Furthermore, BBR treatment reduced RTN-induced nitric oxide (NO) and lipid peroxidation (LPO) levels, bolstered antioxidative capacity, enhanced mitochondrial enzyme activities (e.g., succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), ATPase, and the electron transport chain (ETC)), and diminished striatal neuroinflammation and apoptosis markers. Notably, the co-administration of trigonelline (TGN), an inhibitor of the nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) pathway, significantly attenuated BBR&amp;amp;rsquo;s protective effects, indicating that BBR&amp;amp;rsquo;s neuroprotective actions are mediated via the Nrf2 pathway. These results underscore BBR&amp;amp;rsquo;s potential in ameliorating motor impairments akin to PD, suggesting its promise in potentially delaying or managing PD symptoms. Further research is warranted to translate these preclinical findings into clinical settings, enhancing our comprehension of BBR&amp;amp;rsquo;s therapeutic prospects in PD.</p>

                <p>Memory reactivation during sleep is thought to facilitate memory consolidation. Most sleep reactivation research has examined how reactivation of specific facts, objects, and associations benefits their overall retention. However, our memories are not unitary, and not all features of a memory persist in tandem over time. Instead, our memories are transformed, with some features strengthened and others weakened. Does sleep reactivation drive memory transformation? We leveraged the Targeted Memory Reactivation technique in an object category learning paradigm to examine this question. Participants (20 female, 14 male) learned three categories of novel objects, where each object had unique, distinguishing features as well as features shared with other members of its category. We used a real-time EEG protocol to cue the reactivation of these objects during sleep at moments optimized to generate reactivation events. We found that reactivation improved memory for distinguishing features while worsening memory for shared features, suggesting a differentiation process. The results indicate that sleep reactivation does not act holistically on object memories, instead supporting a transformation where some features are enhanced over others.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/24/e0163242024?rss=1">A Reconsideration of the Core and Matrix Classification of Thalamocortical Projections</a></h4>

              
                <p>In 1998, Jones suggested a classification of thalamocortical projections into core and matrix divisions (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B18">Jones, 1998</cross-ref>). In this classification, core projections are specific, topographical, innervate middle cortical layers, and serve to transmit specific information to the cortex for further analysis; matrix projections, in contrast, are diffuse, much less topographic, innervate upper layers, especially Layer 1, and serve a more global, modulatory function, such as affecting levels of arousal. This classification has proven especially influential in studies of thalamocortical relationships. Whereas it may be the case that a clear subset of thalamocortical connections fit the core motif, since they are specific, topographic, and innervate middle layers, we argue that there is no clear evidence for any single class that encompasses the remainder of thalamocortical connections as is claimed for matrix. Instead, there is great morphological variation in connections made by thalamocortical projections fitting neither a core nor matrix classification. We thus conclude that the core/matrix classification should be abandoned, because its application is not helpful in providing insights into thalamocortical interactions and can even be misleading. As one example of the latter, recent suggestions indicate that core projections are equivalent to first-order thalamic relays (i.e., those that relay subcortical information to the cortex) and matrix to higher-order relays (i.e., those that relay information from one cortical area to another), but available evidence does not support this relationship. All of this points to a need to replace the core/matrix grouping with a more complete classification of thalamocortical projections.</p>

                <p>General anesthetics disrupt brain network dynamics through multiple pathways, in part through postsynaptic potentiation of inhibitory ion channels as well as presynaptic inhibition of neuroexocytosis. Common clinical general anesthetic drugs, such as propofol and isoflurane, have been shown to interact and interfere with core components of the exocytic release machinery to cause impaired neurotransmitter release. Recent studies however suggest that these drugs do not affect all synapse subtypes equally. We investigated the role of the presynaptic release machinery in multiple neurotransmitter systems under isoflurane general anesthesia in the adult female <I>Drosophila</I> brain using live-cell super&ndash;resolution microscopy and optogenetic readouts of exocytosis and neural excitability. We activated neurotransmitter-specific mushroom body output neurons and imaged presynaptic function under isoflurane anesthesia. We found that isoflurane impaired synaptic release and presynaptic protein dynamics in excitatory cholinergic synapses. In contrast, isoflurane had little to no effect on inhibitory GABAergic or glutamatergic synapses. These results present a distinct inhibitory mechanism for general anesthesia, whereby neuroexocytosis is selectively impaired at excitatory synapses, while inhibitory synapses remain functional. This suggests a presynaptic inhibitory mechanism that complements the other inhibitory effects of these drugs.</p>

                <p>Acetylcholine is a robust neuromodulator of the limbic system and a critical regulator of arousal and emotions. The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the amygdala (AMY) are key limbic structures that are both densely innervated by cholinergic afferents and interact with each other for emotional regulation. The ACC is composed of functionally distinct dorsal (A24), rostral (A32), and ventral (A25) areas that differ in their connections with the AMY. The structural substrates of cholinergic modulation of distinct ACC microcircuits and outputs to AMY are thought to depend on the laminar and subcellular localization of cholinergic receptors. The present study examines the distribution of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, m1 and m2, on distinct excitatory and inhibitory neurons and on AMY-targeting projection neurons within ACC areas, via immunohistochemistry and injections of neural tracers into the basolateral AMY in adult rhesus monkeys of both sexes. We found that laminar densities of m1+ and m2+ expressing excitatory and inhibitory neurons depended on area and cell type. Among the ACC areas, ventral subgenual ACC A25 exhibited greater m2+ localization on presynaptic inhibitory axon terminals and greater density of m1+ and m2+ expressing AMY-targeting (tracer+) pyramidal neurons. These patterns suggest robust cholinergic disinhibition and potentiation of amygdalar outputs from the limbic ventral ACC, which may be linked to the hyperexcitability of this subgenual ACC area in depression. These findings reveal the anatomical substrate of diverse cholinergic modulation of specific ACC microcircuits and amygdalar outputs that mediate cognitive&ndash;emotional integration and dysfunctions underlying stress and affective disorders.</p>

                <p>Understanding the function of the human brain requires determining basic properties of synaptic transmission in human neurons. One of the most fundamental parameters controlling neurotransmitter release is the presynaptic action potential, but its amplitude and duration remain controversial. Presynaptic action potentials have so far been measured with high temporal resolution only in a limited number of vertebrate but not in human neurons. To uncover properties of human presynaptic action potentials, we exploited recently developed tools to generate human glutamatergic neurons by transient expression of Neurogenin 2 (Ngn2) in pluripotent stem cells. During maturation for 3 to 9&nbsp;weeks of culturing in different established media, the proportion of cells with multiple axon initial segments decreased, while the amount of axonal tau protein and neuronal excitability increased. Super-resolution microscopy revealed the alignment of the pre- and postsynaptic proteins, Bassoon and Homer. Synaptic transmission was surprisingly reliable at frequencies of 20, 50, and 100&nbsp;Hz. The synchronicity of synaptic transmission during high-frequency transmission increased during 9&nbsp;weeks of neuronal maturation. To analyze the mechanisms of synchronous high-frequency glutamate release, we developed direct presynaptic patch-clamp recordings from human neurons. The presynaptic action potentials had large overshoots to ~25&nbsp;mV and short durations of ~0.5&nbsp;ms. Our findings show that Ngn2-induced neurons represent an elegant model system allowing for functional, structural, and molecular analyses of glutamatergic synaptic transmission with high spatiotemporal resolution in human neurons. Furthermore, our data predict that glutamatergic transmission is mediated by large and rapid presynaptic action potentials in the human brain.</p>

                <p>Structural differences along the hippocampal long axis are believed to underlie meaningful functional differences. Yet, recent data-driven parcellations of the hippocampus subdivide the hippocampus into a 10-cluster map with anterior-medial, anterior-lateral, and posteroanterior-lateral, middle, and posterior components. We tested whether task and experience could modulate this clustering using a spatial learning experiment where male and female participants were trained to virtually navigate a novel neighborhood in a Google Street View-like environment. Participants were scanned while navigating routes early in training and after a 2&nbsp;week training period. Using the 10-cluster map as the ideal template, we found that participants who eventually learn the neighborhood well have hippocampal cluster maps consistent with the ideal&mdash;even on their second day of learning&mdash;and their cluster mappings do not deviate over the 2&nbsp;week training period. However, participants who eventually learn the neighborhood poorly begin with hippocampal cluster maps inconsistent with the ideal template, though their cluster mappings may become more stereotypical after the 2&nbsp;week training. Interestingly this improvement seems to be route specific: after some early improvement, when a new route is navigated, participants' hippocampal maps revert back to less stereotypical organization. We conclude that hippocampal clustering is not dependent solely on anatomical structure and instead is driven by a combination of anatomy, task, and, importantly, experience. Nonetheless, while hippocampal clustering can change with experience, efficient navigation depends on functional hippocampal activity clustering in a stereotypical manner, highlighting optimal divisions of processing along the hippocampal anterior-posterior and medial-lateral axes.</p>

                <p>Despite the known behavioral benefits of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, discrete neural oscillatory events in human scalp electroencephalography (EEG) linked with behavior have not been discovered. This knowledge gap hinders mechanistic understanding of the function of sleep, as well as the development of biophysical models and REM-based causal interventions. We designed a detection algorithm to identify bursts of activity in high-density, scalp EEG within theta (4&ndash;8&nbsp;Hz) and alpha (8&ndash;13&nbsp;Hz) bands during REM sleep. Across 38 nights of sleep, we characterized the burst events (i.e., count, duration, density, peak frequency, amplitude) in healthy, young male and female human participants (38; 21F) and investigated burst activity in relation to sleep-dependent memory tasks: hippocampal-dependent episodic verbal memory and nonhippocampal visual perceptual learning. We found greater burst count during the more REM-intensive second half of the night (<I>p</I> &lt; 0.05), longer burst duration during the first half of the night (<I>p</I> &lt; 0.05), but no differences across the night in density or power (<I>p</I> &gt; 0.05). Moreover, increased alpha burst power was associated with increased overnight forgetting for episodic memory (<I>p</I> &lt; 0.05). Furthermore, we show that increased REM theta burst activity in retinotopically specific regions was associated with better visual perceptual performance. Our work provides a critical bridge between discrete REM sleep events in human scalp EEG that support cognitive processes and the identification of similar activity patterns in animal models that allow for further mechanistic characterization.</p>

                <p>Genetic variants in the <I>apolipoprotein E</I> (<I>APOE</I>) gene affect the onset and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The <I>APOE</I> Christchurch (<I>APOE</I> Ch) variant has been identified as the most prominent candidate for preventing the onset and progression of AD. In this study, we generated isogenic <I>APOE3</I>Ch/<I>3</I>Ch human-induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from <I>APOE3</I>/<I>3</I> healthy control female iPSCs and induced them into astrocytes. RNA expression analysis revealed the inherent resilience of <I>APOE3</I>Ch/<I>3</I>Ch astrocytes to induce a reactive state in response to inflammatory cytokines. Moreover, cytokine treatment changed astrocytic morphology with more complexity in <I>APOE3</I>/<I>3</I> astrocytes, but not in <I>APOE3</I>Ch/<I>3</I>Ch astrocytes, indicating resilience of the rare variant to a reactive state. Interestingly, we observed robust morphological alterations containing more intricate processes when cocultured with iPSC-derived cortical neurons, in which <I>APOE3</I>Ch/<I>3</I>Ch astrocytes reduced complexity compared with <I>APOE3</I>/<I>3</I> astrocytes. To assess the impacts of tau propagation effects, we next developed a sophisticated and sensitive assay utilizing cortical neurons derived from human iPSCs, previously generated from donors of both sexes. We showed that <I>APOE3</I>Ch/<I>3</I>Ch astrocytes effectively mitigated tau propagation within iPSC-derived neurons. This study provides important experimental evidence of the characteristic functions exhibited by <I>APOE3Ch/3Ch</I> astrocytes, thereby offering valuable insights for the advancement of novel clinical interventions in AD research.</p>

                <p>Faces and bodies are processed in separate but adjacent regions in the primate visual cortex. Yet, the functional significance of dividing the whole person into areas dedicated to its face and body components and their neighboring locations remains unknown. Here we hypothesized that this separation and proximity together with a normalization mechanism generate clutter-tolerant representations of the face, body, and whole person when presented in complex multi-category scenes. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a fMRI study, presenting images of a person within a multi-category scene to human male and female participants and assessed the contribution of each component to the response to the scene. Our results revealed a clutter-tolerant representation of the whole person in areas selective for both faces and bodies, typically located at the border between the two category-selective regions. Regions exclusively selective for faces or bodies demonstrated clutter-tolerant representations of their preferred category, corroborating earlier findings. Thus, the adjacent locations of face- and body-selective areas enable a hardwired machinery for decluttering of the whole person, without the need for a dedicated population of person-selective neurons. This distinct yet proximal functional organization of category-selective brain regions enhances the representation of the socially significant whole person, along with its face and body components, within multi-category scenes.</p>

We often make choices, however, to obtain symbolic reinforcers (e.g., money, points) that are later exchanged for primary reinforcers (e.g., food, drink). Although symbolic reinforcers are ubiquitous in our daily lives, widely used in laboratory tasks because they can be motivating, mechanisms by which they become motivating are less understood. In the present study, we examined how monkeys learn to make choices that maximize fluid rewards through reinforcement with tokens. The question addressed here is how the value of a state, which is a function of multiple task features (e.g., the current number of accumulated tokens, choice options, task epoch, trials since the last delivery of primary reinforcer, etc.), drives value and affects motivation. We constructed a Markov decision process model that computes the value of task states given task features to then correlate with the motivational state of the animal. Fixation times, choice reaction times, and abort frequency were all significantly related to values of task states during the tokens task (<I>n</I> = 5 monkeys, three males and two females). Furthermore, the model makes predictions for how neural responses could change on a moment-by-moment basis relative to changes in the state value. Together, this task and model allow us to capture learning and behavior related to symbolic reinforcement.</p>

                <p>The 40&nbsp;Hz auditory steady-state response (ASSR), an oscillatory brain response to periodically modulated auditory stimuli, is a promising, noninvasive physiological biomarker for schizophrenia and related neuropsychiatric disorders. The 40&nbsp;Hz ASSR might be amplified by synaptic interactions in cortical circuits, which are, in turn, disturbed in neuropsychiatric disorders. Here, we tested whether the 40&nbsp;Hz ASSR in the human auditory cortex depends on two key synaptic components of neuronal interactions within cortical circuits: excitation via N-methyl-aspartate glutamate (NMDA) receptors and inhibition via gamma-amino-butyric acid (GABA) receptors. We combined magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings with placebo-controlled, low-dose pharmacological interventions in the same healthy human participants (13 males, 7 females). All participants exhibited a robust 40&nbsp;Hz ASSR in auditory cortices, especially in the right hemisphere, under a placebo. The GABA<SUB>A</SUB> receptor&ndash;agonist lorazepam increased the amplitude of the 40&nbsp;Hz ASSR, while no effect was detectable under the NMDA blocker memantine. Our findings indicate that the 40&nbsp;Hz ASSR in the auditory cortex involves synaptic (and likely intracortical) inhibition via the GABA<SUB>A</SUB> receptor, thus highlighting its utility as a mechanistic signature of cortical circuit dysfunctions involving GABAergic inhibition.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/24/e2260232024?rss=1">Neural Correlates of Crowding in Macaque Area V4</a></h4>

              
                <p>Visual crowding refers to the phenomenon where a target object that is easily identifiable in isolation becomes difficult to recognize when surrounded by other stimuli (distractors). Many psychophysical studies have investigated this phenomenon and proposed alternative models for the underlying mechanisms. One prominent hypothesis, albeit with mixed psychophysical support, posits that crowding arises from the loss of information due to pooled encoding of features from target and distractor stimuli in the early stages of cortical visual processing. However, neurophysiological studies have not rigorously tested this hypothesis. We studied the responses of single neurons in macaque (one male, one female) area V4, an intermediate stage of the object-processing pathway, to parametrically designed crowded displays and texture statistics-matched metameric counterparts. Our investigations reveal striking parallels between how crowding parameters&mdash;number, distance, and position of distractors&mdash;influence human psychophysical performance and V4 shape selectivity. Importantly, we also found that enhancing the salience of a target stimulus could alleviate crowding effects in highly cluttered scenes, and this could be temporally protracted reflecting a dynamical process. Thus, a pooled encoding of nearby stimuli cannot explain the observed responses, and we propose an alternative model where V4 neurons preferentially encode salient stimuli in crowded displays. Overall, we conclude that the magnitude of crowding effects is determined not just by the number of distractors and target&ndash;distractor separation but also by the relative salience of targets versus distractors based on their feature attributes&mdash;the similarity of distractors and the contrast between target and distractor stimuli.</p>

                <p>Sterile alpha and TIR motif containing 1 (SARM1) is an inducible NADase that localizes to mitochondria throughout neurons and senses metabolic changes that occur after injury. Minimal proteomic changes are observed upon either SARM1 depletion or activation, suggesting that SARM1 does not exert broad effects on neuronal protein homeostasis. However, whether SARM1 activation occurs throughout the neuron in response to injury and cell stress remains largely unknown. Using a semiautomated imaging pipeline and a custom-built deep learning scoring algorithm, we studied degeneration in both mixed-sex mouse primary cortical neurons and male human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cortical neurons in response to a number of different stressors. We show that SARM1 activation is differentially restricted to specific neuronal compartments depending on the stressor. Cortical neurons undergo SARM1-dependent axon degeneration after mechanical transection, and SARM1 activation is limited to the axonal compartment distal to the injury site. However, global SARM1 activation following vacor treatment causes both cell body and axon degeneration. Context-specific stressors, such as microtubule dysfunction and mitochondrial stress, induce axonal SARM1 activation leading to SARM1-dependent axon degeneration and SARM1-independent cell body death. Our data reveal that compartment-specific SARM1&ndash;mediated death signaling is dependent on the type of injury and cellular stressor.</p>

                Background The spirochaete Treponema pallidum subsp. pallidum, which causes the infectious disease syphilis, can be spread through sexual contact or perinatal transmission. In recent years, cases of syphilis have increased, especially among individuals engaging in behaviour that makes them more vulnerable (condomless sex and multiple sexual partners). Condylomata acuminata (external genital warts) is one of the most common viral sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Individuals who are behaviourally vulnerable are also highly prone to two or more STIs. Our case exemplifies the occurrence of two STIs in a young man who was behaviourally vulnerable to acquiring STIs. Case We report a case of a 21-year-old year old heterosexual man presenting with concomitant primary syphilis and genital warts. He presented with a painless genital ulcer and warty growths on his glans penis. Examination showed a painless indurated ulcer and multiple genital warts. Serology was positive for quantitative Venereal disease research laboratory test (1:16 titre). The patient was diagnosed with two concomitant STIs. He was treated as per the latest Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines for primary syphilis and podophyllin resin for genital warts. After four weeks, the genital ulcer showed complete healing and there was a significant reduction of genital warts. Conclusions Individuals with multiple sexual partners engaging in sexual activity without the use of prevention tools are at a greater chance of acquiring two or more STIs. To reduce concomitant transmission, preventive measures against genital ulcer diseases like syphilis, herpes, and chancroid, such as early identification and treatment, and condom distribution, must be strengthened as part of national STI prevention. Patients with two or more STIs should be followed regularly to assess the progress of infection and should be offered timely medical treatment.

                Background Tumor budding is defined as a single cell or a cluster of up to five tumor cells at the invasion front of all oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) cases. Tumor budding is considered as a marker of many important events in oral carcinoma, including the epithelial-mesenchymal transition, invasion, metastasis, and for further prognosis. Methods A total of 30 clinically and histopathologically diagnosed cases of OSCC were retrieved from the archival of the Department of Oral Pathology and Microbiology. After assessing the sections for the presence of tumor budding (TB), it is further categorized into high-intensity TB and low-intensity TB. Results We found a strong association between lymph node metastasis and histopathological grading in the current study. There was no association between TB and a patient’s survival rate. Conclusions This study emphasizes the significance of tumor budding, its relevance to prognosis, and reproducibility, as well as the significance of its evaluation and incorporation into routine surgical pathology practice in the management of OSCC. As a result, we believe that tumor budding is a crucial factor in determining tumor behavior.

                Objective This study aimed to establish the factor structure and reliability of the evaluation instrument measuring monkeypox (Mpox) knowledge, perception and beliefs of health threat in students of the health area in two universities of Peru during 2022. Methods The methodology used was psychometric in nature. The study variable on knowledge of monkeypox was based on the instrument made by Ricco et al., carried out with health professionals, adjusted to Peru and administered to 416 students. Results The results showed adequate goodness-of-fit indicators with RMSEA and SRMR coefficients lower than 0.08 and a TLI lower than 0.90 and adequate reliability values for knowledge of monkeypox (KR20=0.70 and α=0.73), with the perception of health threats being the one with the highest reliability (α=0.88 and Ω=0.89). Conclusions Having instruments that accurately reflect the knowledge, perception and beliefs of health students will make it possible to contribute significantly to the prevention, control and management of this disease and, at the same time, be prepared to address other challenges of public health in the future.

                Sebaceous carcinoma is an extremely rare malignant disease and it is more aggressive when it occurs in the eyelids and orbit. It can mimic several benign lesions, resulting in diagnostic delay. We present a case of sebaceous carcinoma in a 50-year-old male who presented with complaints of swelling of the upper eyelid, which was followed by appearance of an ulcerative growth over the eyelid. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reports showed an ulcerated mass in the left periorbital and orbital region appearing heterogeneously hyperintense. Fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) showed malignant epithelial differentiation which was followed by exenteration of the eyeball. Histopathology showed the rare diagnosis of sebaceous carcinoma. The disease has a poor prognosis as the entity is associated with increased morbidity and if not detected early it can metastasize to other organs which may be fatal sometimes.
