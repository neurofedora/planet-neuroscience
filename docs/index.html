                Shoulder dislocation of the posterior variety is a rare condition, representing less than 2% of all dislocation types of the Shoulder Joint. During the acute presentation of posterior shoulder dislocation, the rate of misdiagnosis is high 50%-80% because acute posterior shoulder dislocation is not diagnosed during the initial presentation. The causes of this high rate of misdiagnosis are a lack of clarity regarding the signs of this type of dislocation and inadequate radiological assessment. A delayed diagnosis can result in painful and stiff shoulders, leading to chronic shoulder dislocation. The resulting decrease in joint motion and loss of many activities, instability, recurrent shoulder dislocation, and delay in diagnosis may result in Osteoarthritis or AVN of the humeral head. The chronicity of posterior shoulder dislocation may necessitate a complex surgical procedure for reduction with an unpredictable rate of success. The purpose of this case series was to clarify the difficulties in the diagnosis and management of chronic posterior shoulder dislocation by presenting three cases of posterior shoulder dislocation from the Orthopaedic Department at Fallujah Teaching Hospital in Iraq.

                Background Residential investment projects play a vital economic and social role in Iraq; however, delays are a persistent problem that negatively affects project performance. Identifying and prioritizing the main causes of delay is challenging due to uncertainty and differences in expert judgment. Therefore, a systematic quantitative approach is required to evaluate these causes and their associated risks. Methods This study aimed to identify, classify, and prioritize the causes of delay in residential investment projects in Iraq. A questionnaire survey was conducted with experts specializing in residential projects. Fifteen main delay causes were identified and grouped into three categories: general causes, project parties–related causes, and resource-related causes. The Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process was applied to determine the relative importance weights of the delay causes under uncertainty. The degree of delay risk for each cause was calculated by combining its relative weight with the probability of occurrence and impact. Results The results indicated that, within the general causes category, management-related and political causes were the most significant, each accounting for 14.6%. In the project parties–related category, owner-related causes had the highest importance, with a relative weight of 50.6%. For the resource-related category, labor-related causes were found to be the most influential, with a relative importance of 61.2%. The risk assessment highlighted variations in delay severity depending on both uncertainty and impact levels. Conclusions The findings demonstrate the effectiveness of the Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process in prioritizing delay causes under uncertainty in residential investment projects. The proposed framework supports decision-makers in identifying critical delay factors, improving risk management, and reducing delays in future residential projects in Iraq.

                Background Placenta Accreta Spectrum (PAS) is a severe obstetric condition characterized by abnormal placental trophoblast invasion into the myometrium, leading to significant maternal morbidity and mortality. While imaging remains the cornerstone of prenatal diagnosis, limitations in sensitivity and availability necessitate the exploration of adjunctive biomarkers. Dysregulation of angiogenic pathways has been implicated in PAS pathogenesis. To evaluate maternal serum levels of angiogenic biomarkers—placental growth factor (PlGF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (sFlt-1)—and to compare their expression between PAS and normal pregnancies. Methods This prospective case–control study was conducted at RSUP Dr. M. Djamil Padang between March and November 2025. Eighty-eight pregnant women were enrolled, comprising 44 PAS cases and 44 gestational age–matched controls with normal placentation. Maternal serum samples were collected at 32–34 weeks of gestation and analyzed for PlGF, VEGF, and sFlt-1 using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Demographic, obstetric, ultrasound, laboratory, and neonatal data were recorded. Statistical analysis was performed using appropriate parametric and non-parametric tests, with p < 0.05 considered statistically significant. Results Maternal demographic characteristics, fetal biometric parameters, neonatal outcomes, and baseline biochemical profiles were comparable between groups. Median maternal serum PlGF and VEGF levels were significantly lower in the PAS group compared with controls (PlGF: 3.825.660 vs 4.086.680 pg/mL, p = 0.032; VEGF: 8.713.645 vs 12.524.675 pg/mL, p = 0.008). Although sFlt-1 levels showed a decreasing trend in PAS cases, the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.102). Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels did not differ significantly between groups (p = 0.114). Conclusion PAS is associated with significant reductions in maternal serum PlGF and VEGF, reflecting angiogenic dysregulation and abnormal placental invasion. These biomarkers may serve as complementary tools to imaging modalities for improving prenatal detection of PAS. Larger studies are warranted to validate their clinical utility and integration into diagnostic algorithms.

                Background Choroid plexus tumors (CPTs) are rare intraventricular neoplasms with diverse clinical and histopathological features. Their variable presentation and surgical challenges, particularly in pediatric patients, make detailed institutional experiences valuable for guiding management and understanding outcomes. Methods We retrospectively reviewed all patients treated for CPTs at the Neurosurgery Department of Habib Bourguiba University Hospital between January 2010 and December 2023. Clinical, radiological, surgical, histopathological, and outcome data were analyzed. Imaging included CT and MRI; histopathology assessed cellularity, pleomorphism, mitotic activity, necrosis, and immunohistochemistry. Surgical approach, cerebrospinal fluid diversion, perioperative complications, adjuvant therapy, and long-term outcomes were recorded. Results Seven patients were included (median age 2 years, range 2 months–28 years; 5 females). Histology revealed four choroid plexus papillomas (CPPs) and three choroid plexus carcinomas (CPCs). Tumor locations were lateral ventricles (n=5), third ventricle (n=1), and fourth ventricle/CPA (n=1). Gross total resection was achieved in all CPPs, with favorable long-term outcomes and minimal morbidity. CPCs were more vascular and complex to resect; one patient died intraoperatively, another shortly postoperatively, and the third developed severe postoperative complications before adjuvant therapy. Ki-67 indices ranged from <1% in CPPs to 40% in CPCs. CSF diversion was required in two patients. Conclusions CPTs demonstrate considerable heterogeneity in presentation, histology, and outcomes. Complete surgical resection is associated with excellent prognosis in CPPs, whereas CPCs present greater surgical and postoperative challenges. This series underscores the importance of early diagnosis, careful surgical planning, and multidisciplinary management to optimize outcomes across the CPT spectrum.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13501">Encoding syntactic objects and Merge operations in function spaces</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2507.13501v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a mathematical argument showing that, given a representation of lexical items as functions (wavelets, for instance) in some function space, it is possible to construct a faithful representation of arbitrary syntactic objects in the same function space. This space can be endowed with a commutative non-associative semiring structure built using the second Renyi entropy. The resulting representation of syntactic objects is compatible with the magma structure. The resulting set of functions is an algebra over an operad, where the operations in the operad model circuits that transform the input wave forms into a combined output that encodes the syntactic structure. The action of Merge on workspaces is faithfully implemented as action on these circuits, through a coproduct and a Hopf algebra Markov chain. The results obtained here provide a constructive argument showing the theoretical possibility of a neurocomputational realization of the core computational structure of syntax. We also present a particular case of this general construction where this type of realization of Merge is implemented as a cross frequency phase synchronization on sinusoidal waves. This also shows that Merge can be expressed in terms of the successor function of a semiring, thus clarifying the well known observation of its similarities with the successor function of arithmetic.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02885">A Mathematical Formalization of Self-Determining Agency</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2601.02885v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Defining agency is an extremely important challenge for cognitive science and artificial intelligence. Physics generally describes mechanical happenings, but there remains an unbridgeable gap between these and the acts of agents. To discuss the morality and responsibility of agents, it is necessary to model acts; whether such responsible acts can be fully explained by physical determinism remains an ongoing debate. Although we have already proposed a physical agent determinism model that appears to go beyond mere mechanical happenings, we have not yet established a strict mathematical formalism to eliminate ambiguity. Here, we explain why a physical system can follow coarse-graining agent-level determination without violating physical laws by formulating supervenient causation. Generally, supervenience including coarse graining does not change without a change in its lower base; therefore, a single supervenience alone cannot define supervenient causation. We define supervenient causation as the causal efficacy from the supervenience level to its lower base level. Although an algebraic expression composed of the multiple supervenient functions does supervenes on the base, an index sequence that determines the algebraic expression does not supervene on the base. Therefore, the sequence can possess unique dynamical laws that are independent of the lower base level. This independent dynamics creates the possibility for temporally preceding changes at the supervenience level to cause changes at the lower base level. Such a dual-laws system is considered useful for modeling self-determining agents such as humans.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06595">Energy-Aware Metaheuristics</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2602.06595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a principled framework for designing energy-aware metaheuristics that operate under fixed energy budgets. We introduce a unified operator-level model that quantifies both numerical gain and energy usage, and define a robust Expected Improvement per Joule (EI/J) score that guides adaptive selection among operator variants during the search. The resulting energy-aware solvers dynamically choose between operators to self-control exploration and exploitation, aiming to maximize fitness gain under limited energy. We instantiate this framework with three representative metaheuristics - steady-state GA, PSO, and ILS - each equipped with both lightweight and heavy operator variants. Experiments on three heterogeneous combinatorial problems (Knapsack, NK-landscapes, and Error-Correcting Codes) show that the energy-aware variants consistently reach comparable fitness while requiring substantially less energy than their non-energy-aware baselines. EI/J values stabilize early and yield clear operator-selection patterns, with each solver reliably self-identifying the most improvement-per-Joule - efficient operator across problems.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06610">Green Optimization: Energy-aware Design of Metaheuristics by Using Machine Learning Surrogates to Cope with Real Problems</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2602.06610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Addressing real-world optimization challenges requires not only advanced metaheuristics but also continuous refinement of their internal mechanisms. This paper explores the integration of machine learning in the form of neural surrogate models into metaheuristics through a recent lens: energy consumption. While surrogates are widely used to reduce the computational cost of expensive objective functions, their combined impact on energy efficiency, algorithmic performance, and solution accuracy remains largely unquantified. We provide a critical investigation into this intersection, aiming to advance the design of energy-aware, surrogate-assisted search algorithms. Our experiments reveal substantial benefits: employing a state-of-the-art pre-trained surrogate can reduce energy consumption by up to 98\%, execution time by approximately 98%, and memory usage by around 99\%. Moreover, increasing the training dataset size further enhances these gains by lowering the per-use computational cost, while static pre-training versus continuous (iterative) retraining have relatively different advantages depending on whether we aim at time/energy or accuracy and general cost across problems, respectively. Surrogates also have a negative impact on costs and accuracy at times, and then they cannot be blindly adopted. These findings support a more holistic approach to surrogate-assisted optimization, integrating energy with time and predictive accuracy into performance assessments.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06742">Structural bias in multi-objective optimisation</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2602.06742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Structural bias (SB) refers to systematic preferences of an optimisation algorithm for particular regions of the search space that arise independently of the objective function. While SB has been studied extensively in single-objective optimisation, its role in multi-objective optimisation remains largely unexplored. This is problematic, as dominance relations, diversity preservation and Pareto-based selection mechanisms may introduce or amplify structural effects.
  In this paper, we extend the concept of structural bias to the multi-objective setting and propose a methodology to study it in isolation from fitness-driven guidance. We introduce a suite of synthetic multi-objective test problems with analytically controlled Pareto fronts and deliberately uninformative objective values. These problems are designed to decouple algorithmic behaviour from problem structure, allowing bias induced purely by algorithmic operators and design choices to be observed. The test suite covers a range of Pareto front shapes, densities and noise levels, enabling systematic analysis of different manifestations of structural bias.
  We discuss methodological challenges specific to the multi-objective case and outline how existing SB detection approaches can be adapted. This work provides a first step towards behaviour-based benchmarking of multi-objective optimisers, complementing performance-based evaluation and informing more robust algorithm design.

Abstract: ISAC enables pervasive monitoring, but modern sensing algorithms are often too complex for energy-constrained edge devices. This motivates the development of learning techniques that balance accuracy performance and energy efficiency. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are a promising alternative, processing information as sparse binary spike trains and potentially reducing energy consumption by orders of magnitude. In this work, we propose a spiking convolutional autoencoder (SCAE) that learns tailored spike-encoded representations of channel impulse responses (CIR), jointly trained with an SNN for human activity recognition (HAR), thereby eliminating the need for Doppler domain preprocessing. The results show that our SCAE-SNN achieves F1 scores comparable to a hybrid approach (almost 96%), while producing substantially sparser spike encoding (81.1% sparsity). We also show that encoding CIR data prior to classification improves both HAR accuracy and efficiency. The code is available at https://github.com/ele-ciccia/SCAE-SNN-HAR.

                arXiv:2602.06405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Insect vision supports complex behaviors including associative learning, navigation, and object detection, and has long motivated computational models for understanding biological visual processing. However, many contemporary models prioritize task performance while neglecting biologically grounded processing pathways. Here, we introduce a bio-inspired vision model that captures principles of the insect visual system to transform dense visual input into sparse, discriminative codes. The model is trained using a fully self-supervised contrastive objective, enabling representation learning without labeled data and supporting reuse across tasks without reliance on domain-specific classifiers. We evaluated the resulting representations on flower recognition tasks and natural image benchmarks. The model consistently produced reliable sparse codes that distinguish visually similar inputs. To support different modelling and deployment uses, we have implemented the model as both an artificial neural network and a spiking neural network. In a simulated localization setting, our approach outperformed a simple image downsampling comparison baseline, highlighting the functional benefit of incorporating neuromorphic visual processing pathways. Collectively, these results advance insect computational modelling by providing a generalizable bio-inspired vision model capable of sparse computation across diverse tasks.

                arXiv:2602.06900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bayesian optimal experimental design (BOED) seeks to maximize the expected information gain (EIG) of experiments. This requires a likelihood estimate, which in many settings is intractable. Simulation-based inference (SBI) provides powerful tools for this regime. However, existing work explicitly connecting SBI and BOED is restricted to a single contrastive EIG bound. We show that the EIG admits multiple formulations which can directly leverage modern SBI density estimators, encompassing neural posterior, likelihood, and ratio estimation. Building on this perspective, we define a novel EIG estimator using neural likelihood estimation. Further, we identify optimization as a key bottleneck of gradient based EIG maximization and show that a simple multi-start parallel gradient ascent procedure can substantially improve reliability and performance. With these innovations, our SBI-based BOED methods are able to match or outperform by up to $22\%$ existing state-of-the-art approaches across standard BOED benchmarks.

Abstract: This study proposes a transferable encoding strategy that maps tactile sensor data to electrical stimulation patterns, enabling neural organoids to perform an open-loop artificial tactile Braille classification task. Human forebrain organoids cultured on a low-density microelectrode array (MEA) are systematically stimulated to characterize the relationship between electrical stimulation parameters (number of pulse, phase amplitude, phase duration, and trigger delay) and organoid responses, measured as spike activity and spatial displacement of the center of activity. Implemented on event-based tactile inputs recorded from the Evetac sensor, our system achieved an average Braille letter classification accuracy of 61% with a single organoid, which increased significantly to 83% when responses from a three-organoid ensemble were combined. Additionally, the multi-organoid configuration demonstrated enhanced robustness against various types of artificially introduced noise. This research demonstrates the potential of organoids as low-power, adaptive bio-hybrid computational elements and provides a foundational encoding framework for future scalable bio-hybrid computing architectures.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are a promising, energy-efficient alternative to standard Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and are particularly well-suited to spatio-temporal tasks such as keyword spotting and video classification. However, SNNs have a much lower arithmetic intensity than ANNs and are therefore not well-matched to standard accelerators like GPUs and TPUs. Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) are designed for such memory-bound workloads, and here we present a novel, fully-programmable RISC-V-based system-on-chip (FeNN-DMA), tailored to simulating SNNs on modern UltraScale+ FPGAs. We show that FeNN-DMA has comparable resource usage and energy requirements to state-of-the-art fixed-function SNN accelerators, yet it supports more complex neuron models and network topologies, and can simulate up to 16 thousand neurons and 256 million synapses per core. Using this functionality, we demonstrate state-of-the-art classification accuracy on the Spiking Heidelberg Digits, Neuromorphic MNIST and Braille tactile classification tasks.

                arXiv:2512.01249v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a new family of multi-parent recombination operators for Genetic Algorithms (GAs), based on normalized Pascal (binomial) coefficients. Unlike classical two-parent crossover operators, Pascal-Weighted Recombination (PWR) forms offsprings as structured convex combination of multiple parents, using binomially shaped weights that emphasize central inheritance while suppressing disruptive variance. We develop a mathematical framework for PWR, derive variance-transfer properties, and analyze its effect on schema survival. The operator is extended to real-valued, binary/logit, and permutation representations.
  We evaluate the proposed method on four representative benchmarks: (i) PID controller tuning evaluated using the ITAE metric, (ii) FIR low-pass filter design under magnitude-response constraints, (iii) wireless power-modulation optimization under SINR coupling, and (iv) the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). We demonstrate how, across these benchmarks, PWR consistently yields smoother convergence, reduced variance, and achieves 9-22% performance gains over standard recombination operators. The approach is simple, algorithm-agnostic, and readily integrable into diverse GA architectures.

                arXiv:2410.04010v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across various tasks. However, it remains an open question whether the default Euclidean space is the most suitable choice for LLMs. In this study, we investigate the geometric characteristics of LLMs, focusing specifically on tokens and their embeddings. Our findings reveal that token frequency follows a power-law distribution, where high-frequency tokens (e.g., the, that ) constitute the minority, while low-frequency tokens (e.g., apple, dog) constitute the majority. Furthermore, high-frequency tokens cluster near the origin, whereas low-frequency tokens are positioned farther away in the embedding space. Additionally, token embeddings exhibit hyperbolic characteristics, indicating a latent tree-like structure within the embedding space. Motivated by these observations, we propose HypLoRA, an efficient fine-tuning approach that operates in hyperbolic space to exploit these underlying hierarchical structures better. HypLoRA performs low-rank adaptation directly in hyperbolic space, thereby preserving hyperbolic modeling capabilities throughout the fine-tuning process. Extensive experiments across various base models and reasoning benchmarks, specifically arithmetic and commonsense reasoning tasks, demonstrate that HypLoRA substantially improves LLM performance.

                The bed nuclei of the stria terminalis (BST) is a center of integration for coordinating neuroendocrine, autonomic, and behavioral responses associated with maintaining homeostasis. Here, we demonstrate melanocortin 3 receptor (MC3R) neurons in the BST play a key role in modulating feeding behaviors and responses to stressful events. BSTMC3R neurons are primarily GABAergic and colocalize with neuropeptides regulating feeding and affective behaviors. Chemogenetic activation of BSTMC3R neurons drives decreases in feeding, particularly in males. Additionally, BSTMC3R neurons are robustly activated by stress and can control responses to stress and defensive behaviors in both sexes. Critically, whole-brain monosynaptic rabies tracing identified multiple sexually dimorphic inputs to BSTMC3R neurons that may contribute to the observed sexual dimorphisms. Altogether, these data reveal the BSTMC3R neural circuit is sexually dimorphic, influences feeding and defensive behaviors, affects responses to stress, and represents a potential target for stress- and eating-related disorders.

">A multi-omics atlas of human hindbrain development</a></h4>

              
                The human hindbrain controls essential motor and autonomic functions and is the site of neurodevelopmental diseases. Yet, its cellular diversity, developmental trajectories and underlying regulatory logic remain poorly understood. We present a comprehensive multi-omics atlas of human hindbrain development spanning embryonic to adult stages, encompassing 594,817 transcriptomic and 422,568 chromatin-accessibility single-nucleus profiles. This dataset resolved the cellular architecture of hindbrain cellular lineages, and delineated coordinated gene expression, cis-regulatory programs and regulatory grammar guiding their developmental trajectories. By integrating multi-omics data, we discovered context-specific roles of transcription factors across cell types and deciphered the role of HOX genes in driving divergent cellular identity in related lineages. We further leveraged the atlas to contextualize pediatric gliomas to decode how subtle yet coordinated shifts in gene expression context can define oncogenic transformation. Together, this atlas provides a foundational resource for hindbrain biology and establishes a gene-regulatory framework linking development and disease.

">The hippocampus as a small-world cognitive map</a></h4>

              
                When a mouse perceives a hawk's shadow, it may have only seconds to decide where to run, yet the safest refuge is often neither visible nor nearby. To survive, it must search its cognitive map quickly enough to choose among many possibilities, and accurately enough to avoid dead ends and hazards along the way. But what counts as "safe" changes over minutes to days as paths, refuges, and threats shift, so a cognitive map must be searchable not only over places but also over time. This highlights a core design problem: cognitive maps must preserve fine local structure for reliable action, yet remain globally searchable so that distant, useful solutions can be found efficiently in both space and time. The hippocampus is thought to support such maps, with population activity representing world states and their transitions--yet how these representations remain locally faithful while enabling efficient global search is not well understood. Here, we used a novel geometry-regularized autoencoder to model longitudinal calcium imaging from thousands of hippocampal CA1 neurons in mice learning a memory-guided navigation task. We discovered that the hippocampal population code achieves both local fidelity and global searchability through complementary mechanisms operating at different scales, yielding small-world network structure in the space of neural representations, with strong local clustering and a sparse set of long-range shortcuts that enable rapid access to distant states. At the population level, helical (rotation-plus-drift) dynamics of neural representations relative to past experience build new maps that preserve information about nearby positions in space and time while remaining distinguishable from earlier representations. At the cellular level, neurons with coordinated multi-field activity spanning distant representations create sparse, long-range shortcuts through the space of possible states. During synchronous population events in immobility, decoded activity often jumps to distant states in space, time, and task conditions, suggesting these shortcuts are engaged during offline processing. This functional organization, with implications for both neuroscience and artificial intelligence, sheds light on how hippocampal representations may be optimized for a fundamental challenge faced by intelligent systems: efficiently searching through accurate internal models of the world.

">Episodic and semantic memory contributions to imagination and creativity</a></h4>

              
                The ability to generate novel creative ideas (divergent thinking) is closely linked with our ability to imagine novel future events (episodic simulation). Here, we employed an individual differences approach to examine whether divergent thinking and episodic simulation are differentially associated with episodic and semantic retrieval ability. In response to object word cues, participants generated meanings and definitions (semantic memory), remembered a past event (episodic memory), imagined a novel future event (episodic simulation), or generated novel uses (divergent thinking). Replicating previous findings, divergent thinking ability was predicted by the number of episodic details generated during episodic simulation. When directly comparing episodic and semantic memory, the strongest predictor of divergent thinking was semantic memory. In contrast, episodic simulation ability was predicted by both episodic and semantic memory. We interpret these findings as support for the semantic scaffold hypothesis of imagination, according to which semantic memory provides the necessary scaffold or framework for flexible expressions of cognition such as divergent thinking and episodic simulation. As episodic simulation, relative to divergent thinking, was associated with both episodic and semantic retrieval, these findings are taken to reflect common reliance on event construction processes recruited during both episodic remembering and imagining.

">TRACR: an anterograde transneuronal tracing system for genetic access across synapses and longitudinal circuit analysis</a></h4>

              
                Following neural signals as they converge onto and diverge from individual neurons is central to understanding circuit function and disease-related dysfunction. However, existing approaches to map connected neurons relies on laborious structural reconstructions or functional recordings, or on cytotoxic viral tracers. To address these limitations, we adapted synthetic Notch designs to create TRanssynaptic Anterograde Circuit Readout (TRACR). Binding of the engineered ligand-receptor across synapses induces reporter transcription, enabling characterization and manipulation of postsynaptic neurons. By applying TRACR at multiple synapses in the mouse visual system, we show that TRACR labels postsynaptic partners of sensory neurons, long-range projections and local inhibitory interneurons. TRACR provides segregated genetic access to pre- and postsynaptic populations for expression of markers, sensors, or actuators. Finally, TRACR signaling is reversible and fails to activate when synapses are absent or disrupted. TRACR is an accessible, AAV-deliverable transneuronal reporting tool for longitudinal analysis of circuit assembly, organization, and degeneration.

">Spatial proteomics reveals prefrontal circuit diversity in socioemotional behaviour</a></h4>

              
                Understanding how molecular diversity across long-range neural circuits governs brain function remains a central challenge in neuroscience. Here, we developed a projection-specific spatial proteomics approach and revealed robust presynaptic molecular divergence across six projection-defined pathways of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), including efferent projections to the basolateral amygdala (BLA), nucleus accumbens (NAc), thalamus (Thal), hypothalamus (HT) and cortex (CTX), as well as the afferent projection from the BLA to the mPFC. Among these pathways, we identify BLTP2 (KIAA0100), a previously uncharacterized transmembrane protein, as highly enriched in the projection from the mPFC to the BLA. BLTP2 localizes to excitatory presynaptic terminals and is enriched at synapses that are activated during memory formation. Loss of BLTP2 impairs synaptic structure and transmission, and reduces activity-dependent remodelling, resulting in selective deficits in contextual fear memory, anxiety-related behavior, and social behavior. Mechanistically, BLTP2 promotes presynaptic assembly by recruiting Neurexin 1. These findings reveal projection-specific presynaptic molecular diversity and provide mechanistic insights into circuit-level vulnerabilities in neuropsychiatric disorders.

">Microtubule Stabilization and Biomaterial Guidance Synergize to Enhance CST Regeneration and Motor Recovery After Chronic SCI.</a></h4>

              
                Spinal cord injury (SCI) results in loss of sensory and motor function below the level of damage, with chronic injuries presenting unique challenges for regenerative therapies. While multichannel biomaterial interventions have shown promise in promoting axonal regeneration, circuit restoration, and motor recovery in acute SCI, achieving similar outcomes in chronic injury models remains challenging due to a combination of intrinsic and extrinsic factors. These include the reduced capacity of the neuronal cell body to sustain a growth-activated state and the formation of a physical and chemical barrier at the injury site, preventing axonal growth. To address these challenges and promote motor recovery after chronic injury, we investigated the combinatorial effect of two regenerative approaches: 1) the implantation of poly (lactide-co-glycolide) (PLG) biomaterial bridge to guide axonal growth through the injury site, and 2) the delivery of Epothilone B (EpoB), a microtubule stabilizer that strengthens axons to promote regrowth. We used a transgenic mouse model that selectively expresses a red fluorescent protein variant (tdTomato) reporter throughout the corticospinal tract (CST) under control of the Crym promoter (Crym-tdTomato). We demonstrated that the combination of bridge implantation 60 days after surgical hemisection at C5 with EpoB improved locomotor function. At 12 weeks post-bridge implantation, immunohistology revealed axon regeneration in mice receiving implantation, but not EpoB or no-implant controls. The addition of EpoB significantly increased the volume of both total and CST axons regenerating through the biomaterial channels. Diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DTI) analysis identified enhanced fractional anisotropy (FA), axial diffusivity (AD), and mean diffusivity (MD) in the bridge region in the combination treatment group, consistent with new intact axons. Furthermore, EpoB enhanced the myelination of regenerated axons in the bridge. Finally, we investigated the proteomic profile of corticospinal neurons ipsilateral and contralateral to the SCI lesion and bridge, comparing the effect of EpoB treatment. Mass spectrometry-based analysis of laser-captured cells in this paradigm identified activation of a regeneration program by corticospinal neurons. These findings present a novel approach to enhance regenerative neural repair and locomotor recovery in chronic SCI.

                In LGI1-linked animal models of inherited autosomal dominant lateral temporal lobe epilepsy, increased neuronal excitability is accompanied by modifications in the AMPA/NMDA receptor ratio and a large decrease in Kv1 type potassium channels. However, the mechanism which links the absence of LGI1 to reduced expression of key neuronal ion channels is unknown. We observed multiple conserved canonical ganglioside-binding domains (GBDs) within human LGI1, mainly located in the EPTP domain. We show that GT1b is co-captured from native rat brain extracts by human LGI1 antibodies and, using SPR analysis, that recombinant full length LGI1 interacted with liposomes containing GT1b and GM1, but not GM3, lyso-lactosylceramide, phosphatidylserine or phosphatidylcholine. The ganglioside binding capacity of GBD peptide sequences exposed at the surface of LGI1 were confirmed using SPR and Langmuir film balance. Our data suggest that LGI1 interacts with gangliosides and may be involved in organizing lipid membrane platforms accommodating functional protein complexes. The loss of LGI1 could destabilize these platforms and contribute to reduced expression of key ion channels in Lgi1-/- mice.

">Rapid peripheral reprogramming of myelinated afferents drives human hyperalgesia</a></h4>

              
                A small burn can render a large area of skin painfully tender. This widespread hyperalgesia protects injured tissue and is typically attributed to altered spinal cord mechanisms. Whether peripheral sensory afferents directly interact to contribute to hyperalgesia remains unclear. Using single-unit microneurography, we recorded cutaneous afferents before and after inducing localized TRPV1-mediated inflammatory flare. This triggered minutes-scale reweighting of transcriptomically defined TRPV1- afferents, with divergent effects among myelinated (A{beta}-range) classes: tactile receptors showed reduced responsiveness, whereas mechano-nociceptors underwent sensitization. These changes paralleled diminished tactile sensitivity and intensified mechanical pain. Recruitment of mechanically silent branches in A{beta}-range mechano-nociceptors produced wide-field amplification of peripheral nociceptive signaling beyond the inflamed site. These findings suggest that rapid peripheral crosstalk from TRPV1+ afferents reprograms TRPV1- A{beta}-afferents and drives human hyperalgesia.

">The sex determination gene fruitless is essential for male Aedes aegypti mosquito swarming and attraction to female flight sounds</a></h4>

              
                Aggregating male mosquitoes locate females by showing strong and innate attraction to female flight sounds, with these behaviors forming the basis of mating in the world's deadliest animal. In contrast, females do not show aggregation or sound attraction behaviors. Despite being documented for almost a century, the molecular underpinnings of these behavioral dimorphisms remain unknown. Here, we found that by disrupting the male-specific isoform of the key sex determination gene fruitless (referred to as fruM) in Aedes aegypti, mutant males behave like females. fruM mutant males show complete abolition of aggregation and sound attraction behaviors, resulting in failure to locate females for mating. We identified strong fruitless expression in control male ears, with the loss of FruM severely disrupting mutant male ability to amplify female flight sounds compared to control males. fruM mutant male ears propagate frequency-specific, sound-evoked electrical signals at about one-sixth the magnitude of control males, significantly reducing the amount of auditory information relayed to the brain. fruitless thus plays a significant role in determining proper male peripheral hearing function, which enables male hearing behaviors essential for mating. Transcriptomic analyses of mosquito ears enabled identification of essential hearing genes under the transcriptional influence of FruM. We propose that FruM fine-tunes the masculinization of mosquito ears through shaping male-specific hearing cellular machineries that support male attraction to female flight sounds. We conclude that FruM is the master regulator of male-specific reproductive behaviors in mosquitoes and propose fruitless, as well as fruitless-dependent genes, as novel targets for control strategies.

                This paper explores how smart governance can reduce financial risks in the Iraqi banking industry by focusing on the adoption of the use of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to increase financial stability and operational efficiency. The study uses a combination of quantitative indicators of the dimensions of smart governance (standards, policies, practices, information, technologies, and skills) and financial risk dimensions (market, credit, operational, and investment portfolio risks) based on the secondary data provided by the Central Bank of Iraq covering the years 2023 and 2024. The results reveal a strong progression in all aspects of smart governance during the study time in the form of the rising number of licensed electronic payment providers, the rise of the percentage of current deposits, and the further use of bank accounts and electronic wallets. Also, the human resources in the banking industry have been enhanced with expertise in professional development initiatives. In the financial risk sector, the outcomes are a decline in non-performing loans, an upward trend in the ratio of credit to deposits and an increase in total deposits and total credit facilities, hence, an indication of an improvement in the ability to handle risk. The testing of hypothesis confirms that a strong governing process, including standards, policies, practices, information management, technology adoption and development of human skills, has a positive influence on financial risk management in the AI environment. The research suggests enhancing regulatory systems, increasing digital transformation programs, investing in human-capital growth, and introducing AI-based analytical solutions to guarantee long run sustainability and stability of the financial sector.

                Background After witnessing the implementations of Banach fixed point theory which is stated that a mapping T: X→X has always a unique fixed point in X in giving the existence and uniqueness solutions for many integral and differential equations, various extensions of Banach fixed point theory were established. Consequently, the theory has evolved to encompass diverse extensions and is fruitful in many fields. One of the most significant advances in pure and applied mathematics is the discovery of solutions for linear and nonlinear systems as well fractal graphics, optimization theory, approximation theory, discrete dynamics and numerous other areas. Our main outcomes in this manuscript represent one of the most important of these extensions. Methods and Results Vital concepts such as D d ∗ -Symmetric spaces and weakly compatible maps are reviewed to establish the framework for our main results. The major objective of the present study is to investigate and verify the uniqueness of some common fixed point theorems for three pairs of self-maps under the influence of other enhanced categories of extended contractive conditions in the context of D d ∗ -Symmetric spaces. Our first main outcomes were established by applying the concepts of weak compatibility and common limit in the range property, whereas we obtained our second major results by utilizing the notion of occasionally weakly compatible mapping. Additionally, various common fixed point outcomes for the two pairs of self-maps were determined. Conclusion This manuscript explores novel outcomes regarding the uniqueness of various common fixed point theorems for three pairs of self-maps under the influence of other enhanced types of extended contractive conditions in the context of D d ∗ -Symmetric spaces. We anticipate that the discoveries in this manuscript will aid scientists in enhancing the authors on popularized extended symmetric-spaces to elevate a universal framework for their practical implementations in each advanced branches of science.

">Altered Baseline Brain Network Topology in High-Risk Individuals Progressing to Mild Cognitive Impairment</a></h4>

              
                Background: Identifying early brain-based markers of cognitive decline is critical for preventive strategies in Alzheimer's disease. Individuals with a familial risk may exhibit subtle functional brain changes years before clinical symptoms emerge. This exploratory study examined whether baseline functional brain network topology differentiates high-risk cognitively normal older adults who later progress to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) from those who remain cognitively stable. Methods: Baseline resting-state fMRI data were analyzed from 90 cognitively normal adults with a family history of Alzheimer's (PREVENT-AD cohort), classified longitudinally as converters (MCI-C; n=45) or non-converters (MCI-NC; n=45). Whole-brain functional networks were analyzed across multiple thresholds; primary results are reported at 12% network density, with robustness verified at 16% density. Group differences were assessed using ANCOVA or Rank ANCOVA (controlling for age, sex, and education) at an uncorrected threshold (p < 0.05). Predictive utility was evaluated via a 100-repetition nested cross-validation machine-learning framework on a multimodal feature set combining functional network metrics, average cortical thickness, and plasma p-tau217, with covariates included within training folds. Results: At baseline, MCI-C participants were older, had fewer years of education, exhibited higher plasma p-tau217 levels, and showed trend-level lower MoCA scores. At 12% density, MCI-C showed increased average nodal strength (F=4.50, p=0.036, p^2=0.050) and reduced global efficiency (F=4.07, p=0.046, p^2=0.045). Increased betweenness centrality within the Default Mode Network (F=4.07, p=0.046, p^2=0.045) and trend-level increases in average clustering (F=3.10, p=0.081, p^2=0.035) were observed. Initial largest connected component (LCC) showed a trend-level decrease (F=3.84, p=0.053, p^2=0.043). At 16% density, MCI-C exhibited significantly reduced initial LCC (F=4.41, p=0.038, p^2=0.049) and increased nodal strength (F=4.29, p=0.041, p^2=0.048), with directionally consistent trend-level reductions in global efficiency (F=3.74, p=0.056, p^2=0.042). In machine learning, the k-nearest neighbors classifier showed the most stable performance (nested CV accuracy=59.6%; test F1 score=0.56). Feature stability analysis identified global efficiency (selected in 25.8% of iterations) and critical drop (19.4%) as the most consistent predictors. Conclusion: Baseline disruptions in functional network integration precede clinical conversion to MCI. The consistent selection of graph-theoretical metrics, particularly global efficiency and critical drop, as top predictors suggests that functional network reorganization provides unique information for classification before widespread cortical atrophy emerges.

">Use-dependent regulation of the axonal action potential in parvalbumin-expressing interneurons</a></h4>

              
                The action potential (AP) is thought to be generated at the axon initial segment and to faithfully propagate along the axon. However, data from both invertebrate and mammalian systems show that the axon is an underappreciated locus of activity modulation and neuronal computation. We assessed axonal AP propagation in neocortical parvalbumin-expressing interneurons (PV-INs) during prolonged, high-frequency activity through paired whole-cell somatic and axon-attached patch clamp recordings in acute brain slices from mouse and human. We found that PV-IN axonal AP propagation remains robust during prolonged activity at moderate frequencies, such as during the entrainment to PV-IN firing patterns recorded in awake, behaving mice in vivo. However, prolonged, high-frequency activity during evoked trains of APs and during seizure-like events resulted in changes in the waveform of the axonal (but not somatic) AP, at least in part due to intrinsic use-dependent mechanisms. This use-dependent decrement in the axonal AP waveform is associated with decreases in calcium influx at PV-IN boutons and subsequent PV-IN-mediated synaptic transmission, indicating this phenomenon may lead to a dissociation between somatic and axonal excitability that could shape PV-IN contributions to circuit dynamics during periods of high activity.

">Coordinated activity and plasticity of infralimbic cortex GABAergic interneurons are critical for fear extinction encoding</a></h4>

              
                The ability for an organism to encode fear memories is necessary for survival. Once a threat is no longer present, organisms must suppress, or extinguish, this fear memory in favor of other adaptive behaviors. In rodents, the infralimbic cortex (IL) is a locus critical for the extinction of cued fear memory. While this role has been known for decades, the circuit mechanisms underlying its recruitment are largely unknown. By using a combination of immunohistochemistry, neural tagging, in vivo calcium imaging and optogenetics, and optogenetics-assisted brain slice electrophysiology, we revealed that the dynamic activity and plasticity of IL inhibitory interneurons is critical for encoding fear extinction. Specifically, after fear conditioning, IL parvalbumin interneurons exhibit increased activity and plasticity, driving enhanced freezing. After fear extinction, however, IL somatostatin interneurons exhibit extinction cue-associated activity and plasticity, and their activity facilitates extinction memory encoding through inhibition of parvalbumin interneuron activity and disinhibition of IL principal neurons. Further, glutamatergic projections from the basolateral amygdala undergo experience- and cell type-specific plasticity that is required to drive the dynamic recruitment of IL parvalbumin and somatostatin interneurons after fear conditioning and extinction, respectively. Overall, these results reveal the mechanisms of cued fear extinction encoding and highlight critical roles for local IL microcircuit computations in these roles.

">When can neuronal activity-dependent homeostatic plasticity maintain circuit-level properties?</a></h4>

              
                Neural circuits are remarkably robust to perturbations that threaten their function. Activity-dependent homeostatic plasticity (ADHP) is a stabilizing mechanism that supports robustness by tuning neuronal ion conductances to combat chronic over- or under-activity. Its restorative capacity has been demonstrated in the pyloric circuit of the crustacean stomatogastric ganglion, whose neurons must burst in a specific order to coordinate digestive muscles. After disruption by physical and pharmacological manipulations, this circuit reliably recovers not only the activity levels of constituent neurons, but also the proper burst order. But how could ADHP, operating only on local information about each neuron's average activity, maintain higher-order circuit properties? We explored this question in a computational model of the pyloric pattern generator. We first optimized a set of pyloric-like networks, then optimized ADHP mechanisms for each network to restore its pyloric character after parametric perturbations. This was possible for some networks and impossible for others, so we aimed to explain this disparity. We found that successful homeostatic regulators target average neural activity levels which happen to occur only among pyloric circuits and not among non-pyloric ones, within the set of reachable circuit configurations. Therefore, in subsets of parameter space where such dissociation is possible, activity carries indirect information about burst order, which ADHP can exploit to maintain pyloricness. Other subsets, whose pyloric averages are inseparable from non-pyloric ones, cannot be perfectly regulated. This separability property may explain differences in recovery capacity across perturbations and across individuals.

">Structural and dynamic embedding of the mouse functional connectome revealed by functional ultrasound imaging (fUSI)</a></h4>

              
                Functional ultrasound imaging (fUSI) is an emerging hemodynamic neuroimaging modality whose potential for connectome-scale network mapping remains largely untested. Here, we establish a non-invasive transcranial fUSI protocol and an fMRI-inspired preprocessing framework that enable robust resting-state functional connectomics in the mouse. We show that fUSI resolves canonical brain-wide cortical and subcortical networks with high spatial concordance to fMRI, including a default-mode (DMN) and a laterocortical network. Notably, fUSI networks are robustly embedded within the structural connectome, with structure-function coupling being parsimoniously described by four dominant axes that differentially relate functional systems to known anatomical substrates. We also show that, beyond static organization, fUSI reproduces hallmark resting state fMRI dynamics, including dominant anti-correlated coactivation patterns (CAPs) and a structured transition architecture that converges onto three stable attractor modes. Together, these results establish transcranial fUSI as a portable and scalable complement to fMRI for connectome-scale mapping of mouse brain networks.

">Investigating White Matter Functional Network Connectivity Across the Alzheimers Disease Spectrum Using Resting-State fMRI</a></h4>

              
                White matter (WM) has traditionally been considered structurally important but functionally inert in fMRI research. However, growing evidence indicates that WM exhibits meaningful BOLD fluctuations and participates in functional connectivity. Here, we investigate alterations in WM functional network connectivity (FNC) across the Alzheimers disease (AD) spectrum using resting-state fMRI data from the Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI 415 cognitively normal (CN), 283 mild cognitive impairment (MCI), 91 AD). We applied a guided independent component analysis (ICA) approach based on a combined multiscale template including 202 intrinsic connectivity networks (ICNs; 97 WM, 105 gray matter (GM)) to estimate subject-specific timecourses and compute static FNC (sFNC). Group differences in WMWM, GMGM, and WMGM connectivity (ADCN, ADMCI, MCICN) were assessed using two-sample t-tests with covariates for age, sex, and motion, with false discovery rate correction. Results showed robust alterations in WMWM and WMGM connectivity in AD, particularly involving WM subcortical, frontal, sensorimotor, and occipitotemporal networks. Several WMGM interactions with cerebellar and hippocampal GM networks were also disrupted, including reduced GMcerebellar:WMfrontal coupling and increased GMhippocampal to WMfrontal connectivity. Notably, MCI already showed WMGM dysconnectivity relative to CN, suggesting that functional disruption of WM circuits emerges prior to overt dementia. These findings provide converging evidence that WM functional connectivity is both measurable and selectively altered across the AD continuum. Our findings support WM sFNC as a complementary candidate biomarker to GM-based measures for staging and monitoring AD. This is, to our knowledge, the first large-scale ADNI study to jointly model WM and GM intrinsic connectivity networks and quantify WMGM dysconnectivity across CN, MCI, and AD.

">Geometric constraints in the development of primate extrastriate visual cortex</a></h4>

              
                Although the mechanisms establishing primary sensory maps are well characterized, how multiple higher-order maps with systematic spatial relationships emerge across neocortex remains unclear. Because the probability and strength of cortical connections fall off steeply with distance, cortical geometry may centrally constrain how higher-order maps are arranged. To test this possibility in a well-characterized sensory system, we develop a growth model embedded in the folded surface geometry of the macaque visual cortex, using fMRI-defined V1 retinotopy as the sole functional anchor. Cortical organization emerges through algorithmic growth from primary visual cortex, governed by distance-dependent activity correlations and competition among developing projections. Without imposing areal boundaries, map orientations, or predefined topographic layouts, this process generates multiple retinotopic maps with systematic mirror reversals and smooth gradients that reflect key structural features of fMRI-derived extrastriate maps. Growth parameters estimated from a population template generalize across individual macaques, while individual cortical geometry shapes fine-scale map variation around a shared organizational scaffold. Together, these results show that conserved growth rules acting on realistic cortical geometry produce stereotyped higher-order retinotopic organization under minimal explicit specification.

">Time perception follows Weber's law in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                The ability to perceive time is essential for adaptive behavior, enabling organisms to respond to change, coordinate actions, and predict future events in dynamic environments and during social interactions. However, its evolutionary origins and underlying neural mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, can perceive time intervals ranging from sub-second to a few seconds and use them to predict the location of potential food sources. Using a behavioral paradigm in which flies learn to associate temporal patterns of sound with food rewards, we show that their ability to discriminate between two time intervals depends on the ratio of their durations rather than their absolute difference. This proportional relationship follows Weber's law, a fundamental principle of sensory discrimination. Moreover, flies can generalize learned temporal rules to novel stimuli and across sensory modalities, suggesting they form an abstract representation of time. Finally, we identify the mushroom body as a critical neural circuit for temporal learning. These findings reveal unexpected timing capabilities in Drosophila, providing new insights into the evolutionary origin of temporal cognition and establishing Drosophila as a genetically tractable model for investigating the neural basis of time perception.

">EEG Bad-Channel Detection Using Multi-Feature Thresholding and Co-occurrence of High-Amplitude Transients</a></h4>

              
                Bad channels in electroencephalography (EEG) recordings can substantially degrade downstream analyses, particularly in high-density datasets where localized hardware or motion-related artifacts may affect groups of electrodes in a structured manner. We introduce a MATLAB Module for bad-channel quality control that emphasizes interpretability, relational structure, and human-in-the-loop validation rather than fully automated rejection. The method operates on multi-channel EEG data and combines complementary channel-level features, including time-dependent neighbor dissimilarity and amplitude- and variance-based statistics to score and pre-label channels as good, suspicious, or bad. To expose shared artifactual structure, channels are additionally grouped using a similarity measure derived from the co-occurrence of robustly detected high-amplitude transients, allowing channels to be reviewed together. Importantly, clustering is used as an exploratory tool to reveal co-artifactual patterns rather than to impose final class labels, which are confirmed through an interactive review interface supported by summary visualizations and grouped channel displays. This Module is released as a publicly available codebase with documentation, example workflows, and a supporting dataset. This Module is designed as a quality-control step preceding ICA and does not replace end-to-end data cleaning pipelines, which typically involve additional steps such as interpolation of known bad channels.

                The integration of electroencephalography (EEG) and functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) can be used to characterize temporal and spatial components of neural activity during unfolding mental experience. Here we introduce a multi-session simultaneous EEG-fMRI dataset with measures of continuous behavior and spontaneous mental experience. Data components, organized in Brain Imaging Dataset Structure (BIDS) format, include fMRI, EEG with carbon wire loop sensors for artifact removal, continuous performance task responses, experience sampling ratings, and mental health surveys, from 24 healthy adults. Tasks included the gradual-onset continuous performance task and resting state with intermittent experience sampling of 13 unique thought dimensions (36 repetitions, including 468 total ratings, per participant). The same protocol was completed on two different days, yielding approximately 1.33 hours of simultaneous EEG-fMRI data per individual. The dataset may be used to explore the behavioral and experiential relevance of brain activity during the wakeful resting state. The dataset also provides a means to study the reliability of relationships between fMRI and EEG features across sessions within individuals.

">Active gaze behavior organizes V1 activity in freely-moving marmosets</a></h4>

              
                Human and nonhuman primates rely heavily on vision to actively explore and navigate their environment. Although primate visual cortex has been studied extensively in head-fixed animals, little is known about how the primate visual system supports natural, active vision in freely moving animals. Here, we address this gap in the primary visual cortex (V1) by leveraging a head-mounted eye-tracking system while simultaneously recording the activity of ensembles of single V1 neurons in freely moving marmosets. Our results reveal that primate neural activity is tightly driven by visual input and organized by the temporal structure of natural gaze behavior, and these gaze-related responses are largely abolished in the absence of visual input. We further show that distinct phases of gaze movement, i.e. rapid redirection (gaze shift) and subsequent stabilization (fixation), engage separable suppression and enhancement of the V1 responses. The enhancement during fixation was clearly linked to visual input. These findings define the dynamics in V1 that link natural gaze behavior and stimulus-driven responses in freely moving primates. The work opens a previously inaccessible but fundamental regime of primate vision and establishes freely moving paradigms as a foundation for understanding real-world visual processing during ethologically relevant behaviors.

">Inhibition of Endocannabinoid Degradation in Astrocytes Reprograms Glial Reactivity and Prevents Seizure Sequelae</a></h4>

              
                Background: Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is the most common form of focal epilepsy and is characterized by a pathological cascade of excitotoxicity that leads to neuroinflammation, progressive neuronal loss, and subsequent cognitive decline. Despite its prevalence, effective disease-modifying therapies remain lacking. Previous studies have demonstrated that the endocannabinoid system contributes to epileptic activity. In particular, inactivation of monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL), the key rate-limiting enzyme responsible for the degradation of the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), an endogenous lipid mediator with anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties, suppresses seizures and reduces neuroinflammation. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying these protective effects remain unclear. Methods: To dissect the cellular mechanisms underlying MAGL-mediated neuroprotection, we employed a kainic acid (KA)-induced status epilepticus model in mice with global, astrocyte-specific (aKO), and neuron-specific (nKO) deletion of mgll. We combined single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) to map the transcriptomic landscape of glial responses with pharmacological interventions to validate key signaling pathways, as well as behavioral assays to assess functional recovery. Results: We demonstrated that astrocyte-specific, but not neuron-specific, mgll deletion was sufficient to attenuate seizure susceptibility and hippocampal neurodegeneration, thereby recapitulating the protective phenotype observed in global knockouts. Transcriptomic profiling revealed that astrocytic MAGL deficiency fundamentally reshaped the glial response to injury by preventing the transition to pro-inflammatory reactive astrocyte states and suppressing the activation of disease-associated microglia (DAM). Mechanistically, we identified a signaling pathway in which the neuroprotective effects of MAGL inhibition depend on cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1) activation and are mediated by downstream peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor {gamma} (PPAR-{gamma}) signaling. Either genetic deletion of CB1 or pharmacological blockade of PPAR-{gamma} abolished the protective effects. Furthermore, aKO mice exhibited reduced neuronal loss, preserved synaptic structural integrity and protection against post-seizure cognitive deficits. Conclusion: These findings reveal astrocytic MAGL as a crucial regulatory node in the epileptic brain and demonstrated that enhancing 2-AG signaling in astrocytes orchestrates neuroprotection via CB1-PPAR-{gamma} signaling pathways, thereby attenuating neuroinflammation, preserving synaptic function, and preventing the cognitive comorbidities associated with epilepsy.

">Transient activation of potent progenitor cells is required for spinal cord regeneration</a></h4>

              
                Adult zebrafish exhibit full recovery following spinal cord injury. Transient expansion of stem cell-like progenitors is thought to underlie their regenerative capacity. Yet, our understanding of the identities and contributions of the crucial stem cell populations that direct spontaneous neural repair remains limited. Moreover, while most neural regeneration research is centered on promoting proliferative repair, the regulatory mechanisms that reinstate quiescence post-repair are unknown. Here, we determined the molecular identities and cellular contributions of sox2+ progenitors during spinal cord repair. Genetic lineage tracing shows zebrafish spinal progenitors, while quiescent in uninjured tissues, self-renew and differentiate into neurons and glia after injury. By single-cell sequencing, sox2+ cells are heterogeneous and biased towards neuronal or glial fates in both homeostatic and regenerating tissues. By screening for transcription factors that are differentially expressed in acute versus chronic spinal cord injury, we find the Bach1 transcription factors control transient progenitor cell activation by acting as dual activators and repressors of sox2 expression. This study elucidates the molecular diversity and contributions of sox2 expressing cells during spinal cord repair and identifies a transcriptional regulatory switch by which progenitor cells expand after injury and restore quiescence after regeneration is completed.

">Knockout of PI4-Kinase A in GnRH Neurons Causes their Prepubertal Death</a></h4>

              
                The signaling pathways that control embryonic development, migration, and differentiation of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons, as well as the postnatal fate, function, and survival of differentiated cells, are the subject of ongoing research. Here, we examined the role of phosphoinositides in this complex multistep process by generating GnRH neuron-specific phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase alpha knockout mice. These mice were healthy and indistinguishable from their control littermates in size. However, adult knockout females and males were infertile due to underdeveloped gonads and reproductive organs. Furthermore, hypothalamic GnRH immunoreactivity was absent, and expression of the hypothalamic Gnrh1 gene and pituitary gonadotroph-specific genes was reduced. In contrast, hypothalamic kisspeptin immunoreactivity was preserved, and Kiss1 expression was modified in a nuclei specific-manner, consistent with the loss of circulating sex steroid hormones. Embryonic neurogenesis and migration of GnRH neurons were not impaired, as evidenced by normal Gnrh1 expression in the hypothalamus of neonatal animals and the presence of immunoreactive GnRH neurons in infantile mice in comparable number and distribution to age-matched controls. However, their cellular degeneration was evident, accompanied by reduced Gnrh1 expression. GnRH neuron-specific tdTomato expression confirmed their postnatal degeneration and death, whereas ectopic tdTomato cells located in the lateral septum remained unaffected. Together, these findings indicate that phosphoinositides dependent on phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase alpha activity are not critical for embryonic steps in the development of the GnRH neuronal network, but are essential for the postnatal function and survival of these cells.

">Eye tracking insights into movement preparation and execution under nonstandard visual movement feedback</a></h4>

              
                For eye-hand coordination, predictions of sensory movement consequences may already be issued, and adjusted, during action preparation. In this pre-registered study, we combined a delayed-movement paradigm with a virtual reality-based hand-eye tracking task to investigate the oculomotor correlates of planning and executing coordinated hand-eye movements under standard vs nonstandard visual hand movement feedback. We measured pupil dilation and gaze-hand tracking during action preparation and subsequent task execution, where visual movement feedback violated or matched cued expectations: Participants prepared and, after a delay period, executed hand movements. Their movements were reflected by congruent or incongruent (inverted) movements of a glove-controlled virtual hand model, which they had to follow with their gaze. In the preceding delay period, visual cues could specify the to-be-executed movement (or leave it unspecified), and the visuomotor mapping (congruent or incongruent, 75% cue validity). We found that during the delay, pupil diameter increased more strongly when the movement was pre-cued (compared to left unspecified), and when nonstandard compared to standard visual movement feedback was expected. During execution, gaze-hand tracking performance decreased under nonstandard mappings, but significantly less so when the to-be-executed movement was pre-cued. Expectation violation trials produced a strong pupil dilation, particularly when congruent (standard) visuomotor expectations were violated, but also when incongruent mappings were cued but congruent ones observed. Furthermore, expectation violation impaired tracking performance; again, stronger for pre-cued movements with standard mapping. Our results indicate that oculomotor responses during delay encode processes related to motor planning and flexible forward prediction of sensory action consequences ahead of execution, i.e. increased mental effort and expectations of sensory conflict. Moreover, the results demonstrate that the strength of these (updated) predictions affects eye-hand coordination and pupillary responses during subsequent execution of the planned action.

">Innovative Methods for Prenatal Cannabis Exposure: Vapor Inhalation Chamber and Metabolite Quantification in Prairie Voles and Rats</a></h4>

              
                The increasing prevalence of cannabis use, including among pregnant women, highlights the critical need for a deeper understanding of prenatal cannabis exposure. This study aimed to develop a standardized cross-species inhalation exposure protocol to administer the principal psychoactive component of cannabis, {Delta}9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), to prairie voles (Microtus ochrogaster) and laboratory rats (Rattus norvegicus), and to investigate the distribution of THC in maternal and fetal tissues following prenatal exposure. Using an established e-cigarette system for delivering vaporized THC, we administered THC to pregnant prairie voles and rats. THC concentrations were measured in maternal plasma and fetal brain tissue using LC-MS/MS (Liquid Chromatography coupled with Tandem Mass Spectrometry). In both species, THC levels were compared across groups to evaluate the impact of fetal position on THC uptake. We found that THC readily crossed the placental barrier in both species, resulting in significantly higher concentrations of THC in the fetal brain within the THC-exposed groups compared to the vehicle controls. Interspecies comparison revealed higher THC concentrations in rat fetal brain tissue compared to prairie voles. No significant effects of fetal position on THC levels were found for either species. The findings confirm placental transfer of THC and reveal species-specific patterns of THC distribution. Additional studies were then carried out in voles to compare plasma and brain THC levels in maternal and virgin adult prairie voles. Maternal brain THC concentrations were significantly higher than fetal brain concentrations in prairie voles. Strong positive correlations were observed between plasma and brain THC concentrations in both maternal and virgin adult prairie voles. This study establishes a translational model for investigating prenatal cannabis exposure using an aerosolized administration method in voles compared to established methods in rats. The standardized protocol and results provide a foundation for future research into the developmental consequences of prenatal cannabis exposure and offer crucial insights for informing public health policies and clinical practices in response to the global increase in cannabis use.

">The 'sex-specific effect:' Evaluating analytical approaches to sex-dependence in the behavioral and brain sciences</a></h4>

              
                Detecting a sex difference in response to a treatment or intervention, often reported as a 'sex-specific effect,' requires statistical comparison of the response across sex. Here, we investigated analytical approaches used to test for such effects in the behavioral and brain sciences. Of 200 recent articles containing terms such as 'sex-specific' or 'gender-dependent' in their titles, only 24% presented appropriate evidence supporting the claim: the effect was compared statistically across sex and results consistent with the claim were reported. In most articles (58%), no test was conducted that could have supported the title claim. Only 15% of studies on non-human animals supported the claim with appropriate evidence, which was significantly less frequently than studies on human participants (34%; p = 0.002). The use of appropriate analytical approaches was unrelated to journal rank or the citation impact of the article. We conclude that claims of sex/gender-dependent effects in the behavioral and brain sciences are only infrequently supported by appropriate evidence.

">Conserved circadian membrane rhythms arise from divergent cellular mechanisms in pacemaker neurons of mice and Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Circadian clocks align physiology and behaviour with daily environmental cycles, requiring neuronal networks that reliably encode and transmit time-of-day information. A fundamental yet unresolved question is how membrane properties support this function and whether conserved principles arise across evolutionarily distant organisms. We compared the intrinsic electrophysiological properties of identified circadian neurons from a nocturnal mammal (mouse, Mus musculus SCN VIP neurons) and a diurnal insect (fly, Drosophila melanogaster l-LNv PDF neurons) across the 24-h light-dark cycle. Despite ~700 million years of evolutionary divergence and opposite temporal niches, we found neurons from both species exhibited similar rhythmic patterns in key parameters for encoding time-of-day, including resting membrane potential, spontaneous firing rate and cell capacitance, indicating convergent strategies for generating daily variation in excitability despite dramatically different network scales (~2200 VIPs vs. 8 l-LNvs). These shared outputs arose through distinct mechanisms: flies exhibited higher input resistance, greater excitability and relatively larger A-type potassium currents, while mice displayed larger sustained outward currents and post-inhibitory rebound excitation, absent in flies. Rheobase troughs occurred during the inactive phase in both species, while other parameters did not cycle. These differences likely shape how each neuronal type integrates salient inputs, consistent with their respective roles in processing sustained daytime light (flies) versus nocturnal cues (mice). Our findings reveal conserved functional goals but divergent electrophysiological strategies in circadian neurons, reflecting evolutionary adaptation to species-specific environmental demands. Such neurophysiological diversity highlights how evolution shapes cellular mechanisms to meet the requirements of temporal niche while preserving robust circadian timekeeping.

">Allele-specific rescue of neurexin behavioral phenotypes by monoamine-targeting compounds</a></h4>

              
                Neurexins are synaptic adhesion molecules associated with vast neurologic changes in humans, including neurodevelopmental delay, autism, schizophrenia, Tourette syndrome, and seizures. The NRXN1 gene produces >100 protein isoforms through alternative promoters and extensive splicing, which are differentially impacted by NRXN1 deletions found in patients. Yet pharmacologic targeting of NRXN1 isoforms or deletions has not been comprehensively studied. Here, we developed a behavioral screening approach in C. elegans to identify small molecule compounds that modify decreased activity levels caused by isoform-specific deletions of neurexin (nrx-1). Screening 190 compounds, we discovered that monoamine-targeting drugs differentially improve behavioral phenotypes depending on which nrx-1 isoforms are disrupted. Broad modulation of monoamine signaling or antagonism of specific serotonin receptors are required to increased activity of both alleles tested. Modulation of adrenergic signaling uniquely improved loss of -isoform, and additional antagonism of dopamine signaling was required to increase activity with loss of {gamma} isoform. The FDA-approved atypical antipsychotic olanzapine was the sole validated compound achieving Z-scores >2 in both screens. In Drosophila Nrx-1 mutants, olanzapine, but not the related compound asenapine maleate, significantly improved activity deficits, demonstrating evolutionary conservation of the neurexin-monoamine relationship. Multi-behavior testing revealed pharmacological specificity: olanzapine improved both activity and social feeding phenotypes of nrx-1 alleles, while asenapine maleate improved activity, but worsened social feeding, indicating distinct modifier impacts across behavioral domains. Our findings establish monoamine modulation as a conserved compensatory mechanism for neurexin loss, identify olanzapine as a lead compound for targeting neurexin loss, and demonstrate that allele stratification and pharmacogenomic approaches are needed for precision intervention in behavioral conditions.

">Disrupted Sleep-Dependent Neural Oscillations and Transcriptomic Changes in the Cacna1g Loss-of-Function Mouse Model Implicated in Schizophrenia</a></h4>

              
                Sleep is an essential biological process for maintaining brain function, and impaired sleep microarchitecture is a well-established feature of schizophrenia (SCZ). Rare loss-of-function variants in CACNA1G, encoding the T-type calcium channel CaV3.1, confer substantial risk for SCZ, implicating sleep-regulatory circuits in disease pathophysiology. Here, we first show that among individuals with SCZ, carriers of rare CACNA1G missense variants exhibit more pronounced alterations in sleep neurophysiology than non-carriers, identifying a human phenotype suggestive of altered channel function. Motivated by this observation, we examined the consequences of Cacna1g loss of function in mice. Cacna1g deficiency produced profound disruptions in sleep microarchitecture, including reduced sleep spindles, altered slow oscillations, impaired spindle-slow oscillation coupling, and reduced cortical synchrony, closely recapitulating neurophysiological signatures observed in individuals with schizophrenia. Beyond sleep structure, Cacna1g loss disrupted the normal coordination of brain rhythms across the 24-hour cycle, most notably abolishing diurnal modulation of theta oscillations. At the molecular level, Cacna1g loss uncoupled sleep-wake state from gene and protein regulation, producing widespread, sleep-phase-biased transcriptional and synaptic alterations across brain regions and cell types, particularly in cortical excitatory neurons. These network and molecular disruptions were accompanied by behavioral hyperactivity during the active phase. Together, these findings establish CACNA1G/CaV3.1 as a key regulator linking sleep-dependent brain dynamics to molecular homeostasis and behavior, and provide a mechanistic framework through which genetic risk for SCZ may drive disease-relevant sleep and circuit dysfunction.

                <p>Dementia-causing diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), are one of the greatest health concerns facing the aging world population. A key feature of AD is excessive accumulation of amyloid-beta, leading to synapse and cell loss in brain structures, such as the hippocampus. This neurodegeneration is preceded by impaired neuron function, notably reduced synaptic inhibition. Metabotropic GABA<SUB>B</SUB> receptors (GABA<SUB>B</SUB>Rs) may be modulated by amyloid precursor protein (APP) and are reported to be progressively lost from neuronal membranes of hippocampal pyramidal neurons. However, it remains unknown whether functional GABA<SUB>B</SUB>R-mediated signaling changes over aging and whether or not pharmacological intervention can prevent receptor loss. In this study, we combine electrophysiological and biochemical analysis of hippocampal neurons in the Amyloid Precursor Protein/Presenilin-1 (APP/PS1) mouse model of AD from acute brain slices and organotypic slice cultures prepared from male and female mice to determine if functional GABA<SUB>B</SUB>Rs are lost and the effect of pharmacological modulation. Overall, we found that GABA<SUB>B</SUB>R expression decreased with age, independent of genotype, with no evidence for postsynaptic GABA<SUB>B</SUB>R loss in CA1 pyramidal cells at any age. We did observe a genotype-dependent reorganization of postsynaptic GABA<SUB>B</SUB>R-mediated IPSCs, which was independent of age. Presynaptic GABA<SUB>B</SUB>R-mediated inhibition was impaired in APP/PS1 mice, also independent of age. We observed that chronic GABA<SUB>B</SUB>R modulation differentially regulated function but was independent of genotype. Overall, our data show that functional GABA<SUB>B</SUB>R signaling is altered in APP/PS1 mice, independent of age, increasing our understanding of amyloidopathy-induced dysfunction.</p>

                Background There have been claims amongst nutrition stakeholders in Tanzania that the food basket regions, are the regions most affected by stunting among children. However, this study could not find evidence that combines food production and stunting levels, to substantiate this claim. Therefore, this study aims to compare data on stunting, food production and consumption within administrative regions of the Tanzania mainland. Methods The study used an ecological study design to show the relationship between stunting, poverty, food production and food and non-food consumption expenditure across administrative regions in Tanzania mainland. The study used data from three national wide surveys: 2017/2018 Household Budget Survey (HBS), Tanzania National Nutrition Survey (TNNS) 2018 and Agriculture Statistics for Food Security report 2018/2019. Results The study showed that there is a positive relationship between the prevalence of stunting and food production (r=0.43, p=0.03), while there is a negative relationship between stunting and the level of both the average monthly household food consumption expenditure (r = -0.51, p = 0.01) and average monthly household non-food consumption expenditure (r = -0.51, p = 0.01). It was further found that some regions which have higher levels of stunting such as Njombe, have the lowest level of basic need poverty. Conclusion The study found a positive relationship between food production and the prevalence of stunting using data across regions in mainland Tanzania. This is an indication that regional food production may not entail nutrition outcomes, hence a call for more advocacy on nutrition-sensitive agriculture.

                Background Digital transformation and artificial intelligence (AI) have become increasingly important in enhancing the effectiveness of macroeconomic policies, particularly through improved economic data management and more efficient targeting of vulnerable groups. Poverty reduction remains one of the most critical challenges for policymakers in Iraq due to its wide economic and social implications. Addressing this challenge requires a comprehensive mix of macroeconomic policies tailored to the national context. This study examines the effectiveness of key macroeconomic policy instruments in reducing poverty in Iraq during the period (2004–2024). Methods The Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) model is employed, along with the Bounds Testing approach, to investigate the existence of a long-run cointegration relationship between the absolute poverty line and major macroeconomic policy variables, including broad money supply, inflation rate, government expenditure, and per capita foreign trade. Annual time-series data for the period were analyzed to estimate both short-run and long-run dynamics. Results The results indicate a statistically significant long-run equilibrium relationship at the (1%) level between macroeconomic policy instruments and the absolute poverty line. The empirical findings show that monetary policy exerts the strongest influence on poverty levels, with broad money supply, inflation, and per capita foreign trade displaying significant effects. Government expenditure plays a meaningful role in reducing poverty in both the short and long run. Conclusions The study concludes that integrating digital transformation and AI technologies into the design and implementation of macroeconomic policies can substantially enhance their effectiveness in reducing poverty. Key recommendations include establishing a National Council for Digital Transformation and Artificial Intelligence within the Ministry of Planning, strengthening digital infrastructure through public–private partnerships, activating electronic interlinkages among ministries via unified databases, enhancing financial inclusion platforms targeting vulnerable groups, improving government spending efficiency, and encouraging investments that generate sustainable employment opportunities.

                <p>by Yu Wang, Lanxi Wu, Lin Zhang, Yongming Dong, Aaradhya Pant, Yan Liu, Jihong Bai</p>

Neuronal communication relies on neurotransmitter release from synaptic vesicles. The endocytic protein AP180 is critical for efficient vesicle recycling at presynaptic terminals, and its loss impairs neurotransmission, producing reduced release frequency, enlarged synaptic vesicles, and increased quantal amplitude. Yet how AP180 controls vesicle size and whether vesicle size influences release remains unclear. Here, we show that the C-terminal Assembly domain (AD) of AP180 determines vesicle size and thereby regulates release properties in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>. An AP180 variant lacking the AD (AP180∆AD) increases release frequency, contrasting sharply with the reduced transmission in <i>ap180</i> null mutants, yet fails to correct the vesicle size or quantal amplitude. These enlarged vesicles evade curvature-dependent inhibition by complexin, a presynaptic regulator of fusion, while remaining dependent on complexin for evoked responses. This selective escape reveals that vesicle size influences release dynamics through curvature-sensing proteins. Replacing the AP180 AD with actin-binding motifs restores normal vesicle size, quantal amplitude, and release frequency, indicating that actin interactions are both necessary and sufficient for AD function. Biochemically, we show that the intrinsically disordered AD forms condensates that enrich actin monomers and nucleate filament assembly, while full-length AP180 couples PIP2-rich membranes to actin filaments. Together, these findings reveal that the AP180 AD regulates synaptic vesicle size through actin binding, establishing vesicle morphology as a key influencer of curvature-dependent release control.

Macrophages are essential for host defense, yet how parenchyma-residing macrophages detect pathogens without direct contact remains unclear. <i>Cryptococcus neoformans</i> is an encapsulated fungal pathogen that infects the brain. Using in situ imaging of mouse model, we showed that brain-resident microglia vigilantly detect capillary-residing <i>C. neoformans</i> prior to its blood–brain barrier transmigration, but are less responsive to nonencapsulated fungi or parenchyma-injected <i>C. neoformans</i>. Microglia migrate to and enwrap leaky capillaries harboring fungi, leading to fungal uptake but not clearance, instead promoting fungal growth. Microglial response is triggered by released capsule components, rather than the assembled capsule. In particular, glucuronoxylomannan (GXM) plays a critical role by activating endothelial cells to release nucleotides which act on microglia P2Y12. Our findings revealed a novel paradigm by which microglia detect pathogens without direct contact, offering new insights for microglia-directed antifungal therapies.

                Background Sentence-embedding models transform sentences into dense vector representations that capture their semantic meanings. These representations enable deep learning to perform many tasks efficiently, such as similarity measurement, retrieval, and summarization, with improved semantic understanding. Existing sentence embedding models often struggle to capture the semantic richness and morphological complexity of Arabic, limiting their effectiveness in tasks such as semantic similarity, question answering, summarization, and information retrieval. Objectives This study aims to develop a novel sentence-embedding framework tailored for Arabic that addresses the shortcomings of current models by integrating contextual and linguistic features. Methods We propose a multimodal architecture that combines a fine-tuned Sentence-AraBERT (SAraBERT) model with pre-trained FastText embeddings. The model is evaluated on standard Arabic Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) benchmarks using the Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Pearson Correlation Coefficient. Results Experimental results show that the proposed model outperforms existing baselines, achieving lower MSE values (0.0355) and higher correlation scores (0.8053), indicating a stronger alignment with human-annotated similarity judgments on the ATrD dataset. Conclusion The findings demonstrate the effectiveness of multimodal SAraBERT-based embeddings in enhancing sentence-level semantic understanding of Arabic. This study advances Natural Language Processing (NLP) capabilities for underrepresented languages and provides a foundation for future research on Arabic language understanding using deep learning techniques.

                Background A neutrosophic ring represents an algebraic generalization of the classical ring structure by introducing an indeterminacy element I , enabling the modeling of truth, falsity, and indeterminacy simultaneously, as established within Smarandache’s neutrosophic framework. In contrast, a Boolean ring is a commutative algebraic structure in which every element is idempotent ( αI ) ² = αI reflecting the logical principles of Boolean algebras and possessing characteristic two Combining these concepts, the neutrosophic Boolean ring extends the Boolean ring by embedding neutrosophic logic parameters—truth (T), indeterminacy (I), and falsity (F)—into its elements and operations. This hybrid structure allows for the representation of algebraic uncertainty and incomplete information while preserving Boolean idempotent properties, thus providing a flexible framework for studying systems with uncertain or partially defined information in algebraic and logical contexts Methods The research defines the Indeterminacy ring R I = { α + βI : α , β ∈ R } and explores its algebraic properties through examples from integers, rationals, and reals. It then formulates the Indeterminacy Boolean Ring (B-Ring) characterized by idempotency ( αI ) ² = αI , and establishes several theorems proving its core algebraic features. Results Findings reveal that Indeterminacy B-Rings are commutative and have characteristic two, ensuring 2 αI = 0 . Each maximal Indeterminacy ideal is also prime, and these rings are semisimple and reduced, containing no nonzero nilpotent elements. Furthermore, any Indeterminacy B-Ring can be represented as a direct product of copies of Z ₂ I , known as the Indeterminacy Boolean field. The quotient rings preserve Boolean and Indeterminacy properties, confirming their structural consistency. Conclusions The study successfully extends Boolean ring theory to the Indeterminacy domain, establishing a strong algebraic foundation for modeling uncertainty. Indeterminacy B-Rings maintain the essential Boolean properties of idempotency and commutativity while incorporating indeterminate behavior through I ² = I . These results open new perspectives for future applications in neutrosophic logic, fuzzy systems, and abstract algebra dealing with indeterminate information.

                Background Oxidative stress and inflammation are mutually reinforcing physiological processes. The transcription factor Nrf2 (Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2) acts as the master regulator of redox homeostasis and anti-inflammatory signaling. To overcome the off-target limitations of conventional electrophilic Nrf2 activators, this study investigates selective peptide-based modulators. We present data indicating that an innate defense regulator (IDR)-1002 peptide is able to activate the Nrf2-mediated antioxidant response and mitigate inflammation in an endothelial cell model. Methods We first screened several IDR peptides IDR-1 (Lys-Ser-Arg-Ile-Val-Pro-Ala-Ile-Pro-Val-Ser-Leu-Leu), IDR-1018 (Val-Arg-Leu-Ile-Val-Ala-Val-Arg-Ile-Trp-Arg-Arg), HH2 (Val-Gln-Leu-Arg-Ile-Arg-Val-Ala-Val-Ile-Arg-Ala) and IDR-1002 (Val-Gln-Arg-Trp-Leu-Ile-Val-Trp-Arg-Ile-Arg-Lys) for their ability to induce Nrf2 nuclear translocation in HEK293 and bovine endothelial cells (BEC) via Western blot and ELISA. Transcriptional activity was assessed in HepG2 cells using an ARE (Antioxidant Response Element)-luciferase reporter assay to determine the EC50. Downstream expression of antioxidant enzymes, including HO-1 (Heme Oxygenase-1), NQO1 (NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1), and GCLM (Glutamate-Cysteine Ligase Modifier Subunit), was quantified by ELISA. GST (Glutathione S-Transferase) activity induced by IDR-1002 was measured using a CDNB-GSH conjugation assay. Finally, the functional capacity to reduce H2O2-induced ROS (Reactive Oxygen Species) and TNF-stimulated inflammation was measured in BECs. Results Among the tested peptides, IDR-1002 induced the most potent concentration-dependent nuclear translocation of Nrf2 in both cell lines. IDR-1002 activated ARE-dependent transcription with an EC50 of 18.57 μM. This activation led to a significant time-dependent increase in HO-1, NQO1, and GCLM protein levels, alongside enhanced GST activity. Functionally, IDR-1002 pre-treatment resulted in a dose-dependent reduction of intracellular ROS (up to 5.4-fold at 50 μM) and a significant decrease in TNF-α expression in stimulated BECs. Conclusions IDR-1002 acts as a potent dual-function regulator that simultaneously activates the Nrf2 antioxidant response and inhibits NF-κB-mediated inflammation. These findings highlight IDR-1002 as a promising therapeutic candidate for chronic diseases characterized by the interplay between oxidative stress and inflammation.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-203/v1?src=rss">A Unified Validation Framework for Assessing Green Skills Implementation from Basic to Vocational Education: A Measurement Invariance Approach [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                The transition toward greener economies has heightened the need for education systems to cultivate green skills from early schooling through vocational pathways. Despite growing interest, existing assessments remain fragmented and lack validation across educational levels. This study develops and validates a unified measurement framework for assessing green skills implementation across basic, lower-secondary, and vocational education. A multi-phase quantitative design was employed, including item development, expert review, exploratory factor analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, and multi-group measurement invariance testing. The final instrument comprised 36 items across six constructs: environmental awareness, sustainable behaviour, critical sustainability thinking, sustainability participation, resource management skills, and technical green practices. Using data from 215 students, the six-factor CFA model demonstrated excellent fit (CFI = .953; RMSEA = .052) and strong reliability and convergent validity across all constructs. Multi-group CFA supported configural and metric invariance, while partial scalar invariance was achieved after freeing four intercepts, enabling valid latent mean comparisons across educational levels. Results indicated a clear developmental progression of green skills, with foundational competencies stronger in primary education and technical competencies highest in vocational students. These findings confirm that green skills evolve along a continuum and can be measured consistently across schooling stages. The validated framework provides a robust tool for curriculum alignment, professional development, and monitoring sustainability competencies within national education systems. This study advances psychometric approaches in sustainability education and offers empirical guidance for policymakers seeking coherent strategies to support future green workforces.

                Introduction Long COVID, or post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), is characterized by persistent or new symptoms lasting three months or more after acute infection. Approximately 4% of U.S. adults are affected, with fatigue and muscle weakness among the most common symptoms. Chronic inflammation and nutritional imbalances are thought to contribute to long-COVID symptomatology. The Long-COVIDiet Study was designed to test the effectiveness of a whole-diet approach—grounded in the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020–2025—that emphasizes nutrient-dense, anti-inflammatory foods and select supplements. The trial evaluates the impact of this dietary intervention, quantified through a diet quality score, on fatigue, muscle strength, physical function, and biomarkers of nutritional and inflammatory status in older adults with long COVID. Methods and analysis Fifty-six participants aged ≥50 years with long COVID, moderate-to-severe fatigue, and suboptimal diet quality will be recruited from the Baltimore, Maryland area. Participants will be randomized 1:1 to either a dietary intervention arm or an attention-control arm. The intervention includes individualized dietary counseling (eight biweekly sessions) and 16 weekly online group sessions with a registered dietitian, emphasizing anti-inflammatory and nutrient-rich foods. The control group attends matched weekly sessions on non-dietary healthy aging topics. Primary outcomes are fatigue and diet quality, assessed at baseline, 12 weeks, and 16 weeks. Secondary outcomes include muscle mass, grip strength, and physical function; exploratory outcomes include nutritional and inflammatory biomarkers. Analyses will follow the intention-to-treat principle, with linear regression and mixed-effects models evaluating changes across timepoints. Ethics and dissemination The study was approved by the University of Maryland, Baltimore Institutional Review Board (HP-00106745). Written informed consent will be obtained from all participants. Results will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications, scientific conferences, and plain-language summaries on the study website. Trial registration number ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT05977179.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-201/v1?src=rss">Photoinitiator Systems in Dental Resin-Based Composites: Mechanisms, Performance, and Clinical Implications [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                This review summarizes current knowledge on both the most used photoinitiator system in dental resin (camphorquinone) and the alternative photoinitiator systems employed in dentistry. The review focuses on polymerization mechanisms, in vitro evaluation techniques, and factors that influence the degree of conversion and hardness of dental resin-based materials. A comprehensive electronic literature search was performed using PubMed, Google Scholar, and Elsevier databases, covering publications from 1984 to 2025. More than 30 articles were selected based on their relevance to the scope of this review. Light-activated dental resin-based composites (RBCs) represent the most widely used restorative materials in clinical practice. However, effective polymerization of each photoinitiator system depends on the use of a compatible light-curing unit with an appropriate emission spectrum. Changes in the photoinitiator system can markedly affect the biomechanical properties of dental resins, including degree of conversion, hardness, and biocompatibility. This review provides a comparative analysis of RBCs formulated with different photoinitiators, such as camphorquinone, benzophenone, 1-phenyl-1,2-propanedione, trimethylbenzoyl-diphenylphosphine oxide, and benzoyl peroxide. The main objective of this article was to highlight alternative photoinitiators capable of overcoming the color drawbacks of camphorquinone, particularly yellow discoloration, while maintaining comparable mechanical performance. Although current evidence suggests that no alternative photoinitiator fully matches the effectiveness of camphorquinone, certain systems—such as benzoyl germanium derivatives and novel acylphosphine oxide photoinitiators used in combination with camphorquinone—appear promising for enhancing esthetic properties and increasing the degree of conversion of dental RBCs.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-200/v1?src=rss">The E-Learning System and its Role in Promoting Digital Culture An analytical study of the opinions of a sample of faculty members at the University of Fallujah [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                E-learning has become increasingly important, especially after the pandemic and the changes it brought about, forcing educational institutions to adopt unconventional methods to accomplish their missions. We seek in this research to understand the role of the e-learning system in promoting digital culture at the University of Fallujah to help it spread and enhance its digital culture, by supporting, identifying, and establishing appropriate mechanisms that can enable it to perform its essential role in the era of digitizing human resources. The researchers used the descriptive analytical method in completing their research, for this purpose, a questionnaire was prepared consisting of 41 questions covering the research variables distributed over a sample of these academics at the university, numbering 296 teaching staff. The researchers used the method of random intentional sampling by distributing 85 questionnaires, of which 82 were retrieved, to constitute 96% of the questionnaires valid for statistical analysis. A set of statistical methods was used to analyze the study data using the statistical package (SPSS). The research reached a set of conclusions, including that e-learning systems have a major role in enhancing digital culture within the university, especially in light of the digital orientation of universities, which requires them to spread a digital culture on a large scale so that the teaching staff can perform their duties without fear or complaint about the future and the fluctuations and rapid changes it brings, thus enhancing the university’s ability to catch up with international universities that have made great strides in this field.

                High-flow priapism is a rare, non-ischemic penile erection due to unregulated arterial inflow, usually from trauma. We report a 48-year-old male who developed high-flow priapism one day after vesicolithotripsy, with no trauma history. Despite pseudoephedrine, symptoms persisted. Examination showed a rigid, non-ischemic erection; a proximal shunt was performed after conservative measures failed. This case highlights a rare iatrogenic cause, possibly due to arterial injury from instrumentation or Foley removal. In settings without embolization access, surgical shunting remains a valid treatment. Early recognition is key to prevent complications and preserve erectile function.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-198/v1?src=rss">Gender Differences in Balance Among Physically Active Young Adults: Analysis of Anterior, Posterior, and Central Stability Tendencies [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Purpose This study aimed to investigate the effect of gender on balance performance among physically active young adults by analyzing anterior, posterior, and central stability tendencies. While balance is a multifactorial ability influenced by sensory integration and neuromuscular coordination, evidence regarding gender-specific postural strategies remains inconsistent. Methods Fifty-two healthy participants (26 males and 26 females, aged 18–25 years) who engaged in regular exercise were assessed using the Sigma Balance System (CosmoGamma, Italy). Balance performance was evaluated through a dynamic limit of stability test, and the percentage of time spent in anterior, posterior, and central zones was calculated. Independent samples t-tests and Welch’s t-tests were applied depending on variance homogeneity, with a significance level of p<.05. Results No significant gender differences were observed in anterior or posterior sway tendencies (p>.05). However, females demonstrated significantly higher centering performance than males (p=.0246, R2=.1477), indicating a moderate effect size. These findings suggest that although the general mechanisms of postural control are similar across genders, central stability strategies differ, potentially reflecting distinct neuromotor adaptations. Conclusion The results highlight that females employ more precise neuromuscular control to maintain balance within the central stability zone. This advantage may offer performance benefits in sports requiring static or semi-dynamic postures, while emphasizing the need for gender-specific balance training and rehabilitation approaches. Overall, the study contributes to understanding how gender-related biomechanical and neuromotor factors shape postural control among physically active young adults.

                Liver cancer frequently exhibits chemoresistance in clinical settings. Zhang et al. report that a member of the serine protease inhibitor family, SERPINA3, mediates this resistance primarily by inhibiting the protease cathepsin G (CTSG), which is released by chemotherapy-induced neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). Targeting SERPINA3 sensitized liver cancer cells to chemotherapy.

                By recording cellular-resolution neural activity across multiple cortical regions, Kiyooka, Oomoto et al. show that brain networks become more segregated into modules during sleep and anesthesia, driven by moderately connected neurons. Despite this functional separation, these modules are not spatially clustered but remain physically intermixed, indicating a complex organizational principle.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/109075">Glycolysis-dependent sulfur metabolism orchestrates morphological plasticity and virulence in fungi</a></h4>

              
                Fungi exhibit remarkable morphological plasticity, which allows them to undergo reversible transitions between distinct cellular states in response to changes in their environment. This phenomenon, termed fungal morphogenesis, is critical for fungi to survive and colonize diverse ecological niches and establish infections in a variety of hosts. Despite significant advancements in the field with respect to understanding the gene regulatory networks that control these transitions, the metabolic determinants of fungal morphogenesis remain poorly characterized. In this study, we uncover a previously uncharacterized, conserved dependency between central carbon metabolism and de novo biosynthesis of sulfur-containing amino acids that is critical for fungal morphogenesis in two key fungal species. Using a multidisciplinary approach, we demonstrate that glycolytic flux is crucial to drive fungal morphogenesis in a cAMP-independent manner and perturbation of this pathway leads to a significant downregulation in the expression of genes involved in de novo biosynthesis of sulfur-containing amino acids. Remarkably, exogenous supplementation of sulfur-containing amino acids robustly rescues the morphogenesis defect induced by the perturbation of glycolysis in both <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> and <i>Candida albicans</i>, underscoring the pivotal role of de novo biosynthesis of sulfur-containing amino acids as a downstream effector of morphogenesis. Furthermore, a <i>C. albicans</i> mutant lacking the glycolytic enzyme, phosphofructokinase-1 (Pfk1), exhibited significantly reduced survival within murine macrophages and attenuated virulence in a murine model of systemic candidiasis. Overall, our work elucidates a previously uncharacterized coupling between glycolysis and sulfur metabolism that is critical for driving fungal morphogenesis, contributing to our understanding of this conserved phenomenon.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/108742">Suppression of interferon signaling via small-molecule modulation of TFAM</a></h4>

              
                The mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM) is essential for mitochondrial genome maintenance. It binds to mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and determines the abundance, packaging, and stability of the mitochondrial genome. Because its function is tightly associated with mtDNA, TFAM has a protective role in mitochondrial diseases, and supportive studies demonstrate reversal of disease phenotypes by TFAM overexpression. In addition, TFAM deficiency has been shown to cause release of mtDNA into the cytosol and activation of the cGAS/STING innate immune response pathway. As such, TFAM presents as a unique target for therapeutic intervention, but limited efforts for activators have been reported. Herein, we disclose novel TFAM small-molecule modulators with sub-micromolar activity. Our results demonstrate that these compounds result in an increase of TFAM protein levels and mtDNA copy number. This results in inhibition of a mtDNA stress-mediated inflammatory response by preventing mtDNA escape into the cytosol. Furthermore, we see beneficial effects in cellular disease models in which boosting TFAM activity has been advanced as a disease-modifying strategy including improved energetics in MELAS cybrid cells and a decrease of fibrotic markers in systemic sclerosis fibroblasts. These results highlight the therapeutic potential of using small-molecule TFAM activators in indications characterized by mitochondrial dysfunction.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/108485">Heterochronic transcription factor expression drives cone-dominant retina development in 13-lined ground squirrels</a></h4>

              
                Evolutionary adaptation to diurnal vision in ground squirrels has led to the development of a cone-dominant retina, in stark contrast to the rod-dominant retinas of most mammals. The molecular mechanisms driving this shift remain largely unexplored. Here, we perform single-cell RNA sequencing and chromatin accessibility profiling (scATAC-Seq) across developmental retinal neurogenesis in the 13-lined ground squirrel (13LGS) to uncover the regulatory basis of this adaptation. We find that 13LGS cone photoreceptors arise not only from early-stage neurogenic progenitors, as seen in rod-dominant species like mice, but also from late-stage neurogenic progenitors. This extended period of cone generation is driven by a heterochronic shift in transcription factor expression, with cone-promoting factors such as <i>Onecut2</i>, <i>Pou2f1</i>, and <i>Zic3</i> remaining active in late-stage progenitors, and factors that promote cone differentiation such as <i>Thrb</i>, <i>Rxrg</i>, and <i>Mef2c</i> expressed precociously in late-stage neurogenic progenitors. Functional analyses reveal that <i>Zic3</i> and <i>Mef2c</i> are sufficient to promote cone and repress rod photoreceptor-specific gene expression and act through species-specific regulatory elements that drive their expression in late-stage progenitors. These results demonstrate that modifications to gene regulatory networks underlie the development of cone-dominant retinas and provide insight into mechanisms of sensory adaptation and potential strategies for cone photoreceptor regeneration in vision disorders.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101510">A single microRNA miR-195 rescues the arrested B cell development induced by EBF1 deficiency</a></h4>

              
                Accumulated studies have reported that hematopoietic differentiation was primarily regulated by transcription factors. Early B cell factor 1 (EBF1) is an essential transcription factor for B lymphopoiesis. Contrary to the canonical notion, we found that a single miRNA, miRNA-195 (<i>Mir195</i>) transduction let <i>Ebf1</i>-deficient hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) express CD19, carry out V(D)J recombination and class switch recombination, which implied that B cell matured without EBF1. A part of the mechanism was caused by FOXO1 accumulation via inhibition of FOXO1 phosphorylation pathways in which targets of <i>Mir195</i> are enriched. These results suggested that some miRNA transductions could function as alternatives to transcription factors.

                <p>The dorsomedial striatum (DMS) is critical for both motivating and inhibiting behavioral responses. The region integrates inputs from the cortex, thalamus, and other subcortical structures including midbrain dopamine neurons. Though less studied, serotonin neurons from the dorsal raphe nucleus also richly innervate the DMS, which expresses nearly all 14 serotonin receptor subtypes. Slice electrophysiology shows that the serotonin 1B receptor (5-HT1BR) impacts DMS physiology and plasticity, and behavioral experiments show that 5-HT1BR expression modulates impulsivity and other DMS-dependent reward-related behaviors. In these studies, our goal was to investigate the effects of 5-HT1BR on the DMS in vivo. Using a genetic 5-HT1BR loss-of-function mouse model, we examined calcium activity of individual medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in the DMS of both males and females during operant tasks focusing on responses to actions, reward, and waiting. We found that knock-out of 5-HT1BRs resulted in different effects on MSN calcium activity depending on behavioral state. Specifically, mice lacking 5-HT1BRs showed significantly more inhibition of MSN calcium activity during the rewards, but more cells with excitatory calcium responses during the delay period of the trial. This suggests that serotonin, acting via 5-HT1BRs, may recruit MSN activity in response to reward but inhibit MSN activity during waiting. These results highlight the importance of in vivo studies for understanding the functional role of DMS serotonin in reward-related behavior. Overall our results demonstrate that serotonin can modulate the DMS in a behavioral state-specific manner, potentially providing a mechanism for how serotonin effects on behavior are context dependent.</p>

                <p>Gamma oscillations (40&ndash;140&nbsp;Hz) play a fundamental role in neural coordination and cognitive functions in the medial entorhinal cortex (mEC). While previous studies suggest that pyramidal&ndash;interneuron network gamma (PING) and interneuron network gamma (ING) mechanisms contribute to these oscillations, the precise role of inhibitory circuits remains unclear. Using optogenetic stimulation and whole-cell electrophysiology in acute mouse brain slices, we examined synaptic input and spike timing in neurons across layer II/III mEC. We found that fast-spiking interneurons exhibited robust gamma-frequency firing, while excitatory neurons engaged in gamma cycle skipping. Stellate and pyramidal cells received minimal recurrent excitation, whereas fast-spiking interneurons received strong excitatory input. Both excitatory neurons and fast-spiking interneurons received gamma-frequency inhibition, emphasizing the role of recurrent inhibition in gamma rhythms. Gamma activity was reduced but persisted after AMPA/kainate receptor blockade, indicating that interneurons can sustain oscillations via an ING mechanism. Selective activation of PV+ interneurons confirmed their ability to sustain fast gamma inhibition autonomously. To further assess the interplay of excitation and inhibition, we developed computational network models constrained by our experimental data. Simulations revealed that weak excitatory input to interneurons supports fast ING-dominated rhythms (~100&ndash;140&nbsp;Hz) while strengthening excitatory drive induces a transition to slower PING-dominated oscillations (60&ndash;100&nbsp;Hz), although this regime shift was not observed consistently after AMPA/kainate receptor block. These findings highlight the dominant role of inhibitory circuits in sustaining gamma rhythms, demonstrate how excitation strength tunes the oscillatory regime, and refine models of entorhinal gamma oscillations critical for spatial memory processing.</p>

                <p>by Yun Zuo, Chenyi Zhang, Ge Hua, Qiao Ning, Xiangrong Liu, Xiangxiang Zeng, Zhaohong Deng</p>

In drug discovery and therapeutic research, the prediction of drug-disease associations (DDAs) holds significant scientific and clinical value. Drug molecules exert their effects by precisely identifying disease-related biological targets, systematically modulating the entire pharmacological process from absorption, distribution, and metabolism to final efficacy. Accurate prediction of drug-disease associations not only facilitates an in-depth understanding of molecular mechanisms of drug action but also provides critical theoretical foundations for drug repositioning and personalized medicine. While traditional prediction methods based on in vitro experiments and clinical statistics yield reliable results, they suffer from inherent drawbacks such as long development cycles, substantial resource consumption, and low throughput. In contrast, emerging machine learning techniques offer a promising solution to these bottlenecks, enabling the intelligent and efficient discovery of potential drug–disease association networks and significantly improving drug development efficiency. However, it is noteworthy that existing machine learning methods still face significant challenges in practical applications: the complexity of feature construction raises the threshold for data processing; data sparsity constrains the depth of information mining; and the pervasive issue of sample imbalance poses a severe challenge to the model’s predictive accuracy and generalization performance. In this study, we developed an efficient and accurate framework for drug-disease association prediction named FKSUDDAPre. The model employs a multi-modal feature fusion strategy: on one hand, it leverages an ensemble of Mol2vec and K- BERT to deeply capture the semantic features of drug molecular fingerprints; on the other hand, it integrates Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) with DeepWalk to effectively reduce the dimensionality of disease features while preserving their relational structure. To address the class imbalance problem, FKSUDDAPre designed an optimization algorithm called AMDKSU, which combined clustering with an improved distance metric strategy, significantly enhancing the discriminative power of the sample set. For data processing, F-test was employed for feature importance ranking, effectively reducing data dimensionality and improving model generalization. For the predictive architecture, FKSUDDAPre proposed a novel ensemble framework composed of XGBoost, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and HyperFast. By employing a dynamic weight allocation strategy, this ensemble effectively harnesses the complementary strengths of these models to achieve significantly enhanced predictive performance. Rigorous validation demonstrated the system’s outstanding performance across multiple evaluation metrics, with an average AUC of 0.9725, improving the AUC by approximately 3.88% compared to the best-performing baseline model. In the prediction of Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease, 80% and 60% of the top 10 candidate drugs recommended by FKSUDDAPre, respectively, had been confirmed by literature, demonstrating the model’s good practical application potential. Furthermore, we conducted a LIME-based feature importance analysis on the model’s predictions, visualizing the correlations between features and the target variable to demonstrate the model’s interpretability. A cross-platform, user-friendly visualization tool had also been developed using the PyQt5 framework.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3003600">Human newborns form musical predictions based on rhythmic but not melodic structure</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Roberta Bianco, Brigitta Tóth, Felix Bigand, Trinh Nguyen, István Sziller, Gábor P. Háden, István Winkler, Giacomo Novembre</p>

The ability to anticipate rhythmic and melodic structures in music is considered a fundamental human trait, present across all cultures and predating linguistic comprehension in human development. Yet, it remains unclear the extent to which this ability is already developed at birth. Here, we used temporal response functions to assess rhythmic and melodic neural encoding in newborns (<i>N</i> = 49) exposed to classical monophonic musical pieces (real condition) and control stimuli with shuffled tones and inter-onset intervals (shuffled condition). We computationally quantified context-based rhythmic and melodic expectations and dissociated these high-level processes from low-level acoustic tracking, such as local changes in timing and pitch. We observed encoding of probabilistic <i>rhythmic</i> expectations only in response to real but not shuffled music. This proves newborns’ ability to rely on rhythmic statistical regularities to generate musical expectations. We found no evidence for the tracking of <i>melodic</i> information, demonstrating a downweighting of this dimension compared to the rhythmic one. This study provides neurophysiological evidence that the capacity to track statistical regularities in music is present at birth and driven by rhythm. Melodic tracking, in contrast, may receive more weight through development with exposure to signals relevant to communication, such as speech and music.

                <p>by Shotaro Numano, Chris Frith, Masahiko Haruno</p>

Bargaining is a fundamental social behavior in which individuals often accept unfair offers. Traditional behavioral models, based solely on choice data, typically interpret such acceptance as simple reward-maximization. However, regulating inequity aversion may also play a critical role in these decisions. Incorporating response time alongside choice data allows us to quantify participants’ internal mental effort when deciding to accept unfair offers. We conducted functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while participants played the ultimatum game, deciding within 10 s whether to accept or reject monetary offers from a proposer. Using the drift diffusion model (DDM), we quantified decision-making dynamics based on both choice and response time. Participants with lower levels of behavioral disadvantageous inequity (DI) aversion (reflected by a lower DDM weight for DI) showed stronger neural representations of DI in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC). Functional connectivity analysis revealed a negative correlation between the dACC and bilateral ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC) when DI was high. This connectivity predicted both rejection rates and response times associated with the acceptance of DI offers. Furthermore, robust linear regression showed that only dACC-vlPFC connectivity—not reward-related activity—explained both the rejection rates and response times. Finally, right vlPFC activity correlated with amygdala activity under high DI conditions. These findings suggest that the dACC plays a key role in regulating responses to DI, thereby facilitating the acceptance of unfair offers.

                Background Rising health expenditure has become a persistent challenge in middle-income economies. Rapid industrial growth, expanding financial systems, and weak environmental controls place growing pressure on public and private healthcare budgets. Understanding how finance, governance related channels, and environmental stress interact with health spending remains limited. Motivation You need evidence that links economic structure, environmental pressure, and financial development to health expenditure over the long run. This study responds to that gap by examining lower-middle- and upper-middle-income countries over the period 1995 to 2023, with attention to asymmetric and cross-country dynamics. Findings Health expenditure rises with industrialisation, foreign direct investment, carbon dioxide emissions, financial development, and trade openness. A 10 percent increase in industrial output raises health spending by about 1.8 percent. The same increase in foreign direct investment and trade openness increases health spending by roughly 1.5 percent and 1.6 percent. Carbon dioxide emissions exert the strongest effect. A 10 percent increase raises healthcare costs by nearly 6.7 percent. Renewable energy consumption reduces health expenditure. A 10 percent increase lowers health spending by about 1.7 percent. Results remain stable under DCE, DCE-IV, and asymmetric NARDL estimations. Implications You should treat health expenditure as a downstream outcome of financial expansion, environmental stress, and governance related policy choices. Stronger environmental regulation, cleaner energy transition, and finance aligned with sustainability can ease long-run healthcare burdens. Integrating health, energy, and financial policies can support fiscal stability and sustainable development in middle-income economies.

                Abstract* Background The fashion industry is undergoing a digital transformation, creating a pressing demand for digital fashion skills in Green TVET. However, a comprehensive mapping of sustainability-oriented digital fashion skills and their relationship to vocational teacher competency frameworks is still limited. The research conducted in this paper aims to map trends in existing research and identify key digital fashion skills that should be taught in Green TVET, which will be used in designing a digital fashion skills framework for future vocational teachers. Methods The method used was a systematic literature review (SLR) using the PRISMA 2020 guidelines. Additionally, bibliometric analysis was used to examine research patterns and the evolution of themes. As a result, 62 peer-reviewed journal articles indexed in Scopus and published between 2021 and 2025 were included according to predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Results The core skill domains identified in the digital fashion world for future vocational education teachers in Green TVET resulted in eight skills: 1) Digital Design Skills, 2) Digital Pattern Skills, 3) Digital Production Skills, 4) Digital Sustainability Skills, 5) Digital Ethics & Data Security Skills, 6) Digital Learning & Pedagogy Skills, 7) Digital Communication & Marketing Skills, and 8) Digital Entrepreneurship Skills. Overall, these domains form a competency framework that encompasses the technical, cognitive, and pedagogical dimensions of sustainability-oriented vocational fashion teachers. Conclusion This study provides a robust, evidence-based foundation for transforming the fashion vocational curriculum, creating professional development schemes, and strengthening policy measures targeting the development of digital and green skills in vocational education and training (TVET). The proposed framework paves the way for training the next generation of fashion teachers who are ready to face the challenges of digitalization and sustainability.

                Background The study is intended to assess the effects of the professional development program on the competence of vocational teachers, which is implemented by the Directorate General of Vocational Education, Ministry of Primary and Secondary Education in Indonesia (MoPSE) from 2020 to 2023. The study aimed to gather teachers’ perspectives on their perceptions of motivation, skills, values, and attitudes following the training program. The participants engaged in three cycles of training development programs. This study will regard the levels of the Kirkpatrick model as equivalent, without any hierarchical distinction. Method The research employed a quantitative design utilising a longitudinal approach. The three stages of Kirkpatrick assessment were utilised to assess the program’s impacts, progressing from level 1 to level 3. The data is gathered by a survey method with a Likert-scale questionnaire. A total of 944 educators engaged in this survey. They originated from 34 provinces in Indonesia. The data was evaluated utilising percentage data analysis. Result The results indicated that, across level 1 - reaction, level 2 - skill, and level 3 - values and attitudes, the majority of participants fell within the positive spectrum (strongly agree and agree). The level of concordance among all assessed indices exceeded 90%. The conducted training programs were highly acceptable to the majority of participants. The participants believe that the training significantly enhances their motivation and skills, positively influencing their values and attitudes. Conclusion The results indicate that the programs had significant effects on the participants. Such initiatives should not be executed as one-time interventions but rather as components of a continuous, systematic strategy designed to enhance vocational teachers’ competencies over time.

                Background Many randomized trials measure a continuous outcome simultaneously at baseline and after taking the drug. For a single continuous post-treatment outcome, the sample size calculation is simple, but if there are assessments at multiple time point post-treatment then this longitudinal data may give more insights by analyzing the data using the repeated measures method. Also, if the sample size is calculated using the single time-point method for longitudinal data, it may lead to a larger than required sample size, increasing the cost and time. Methods In this research, an effort is made to determine the size of the sample for repeated measures case and then compare with the single post-baseline case. The sample sizes were examined under different scenarios for the continuous type of response variable. Under ‘Mean contrast’ and ‘Diff contrast’ the sample sizes were calculated with different correlations. These two scenarios were again examined under compound symmetry as well as discrete Auto regressive of order 1 type of correlation structure in longitudinal data. The graphical presentation is given for better visualization of the scenarios. Results The sample size required for highly correlated longitudinal data using the multi-timepoint sample size derivation method led to a smaller sample size requirement compared to the single timepoint sample size calculation method. Conclusions This study will help researchers to make better decisions in choosing the right method for sample size determination which may reduce the time and cost of conducting the experiment. Additionally, it is crucial to carefully evaluate and choose the appropriate method when the correlation is weak, as this can significantly impact the accuracy of the results. More complex correlation structures are not studied in this article but can be studied in the same fashion.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-1470/v2?src=rss">Can ChatGPT write better scientific titles? A comparative evaluation of human-written and AI-generated titles [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background Large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 are increasingly used in scientific writing, yet little is known about how AI-generated scientific titles are perceived by researchers in terms of quality. Objective To compare the perceived alignment with the abstract content (as a surrogate for perceived accuracy), appeal, and overall preference for AI-generated versus human-written scientific titles. Methods We conducted a blinded comparative study with 21 researchers from diverse academic backgrounds. A random sample of 50 original titles was selected from 10 high-impact general internal medicine journals. For each title, an alternative version was generated using GPT-4.0. Each rater evaluated 50 pairs of titles, each pair consisting of one original and one AI-generated version, without knowing the source of the titles or the purpose of the study. For each pair, raters independently assessed both titles on perceived alignment with the abstract content and appeal, and indicated their overall preference. We analyzed alignment and appeal using Wilcoxon signed-rank tests and mixed-effects ordinal logistic regressions, preferences using McNemar’s test and mixed-effects logistic regression, and inter-rater agreement with Gwet’s AC. Results AI-generated titles received significantly higher ratings for both perceived alignment with the abstract content (mean 7.9 vs. 6.7, p-value <0.001) and appeal (mean 7.1 vs. 6.7, p-value <0.001) than human-written titles. The odds of preferring an AI-generated title were 1.7 times higher (p-value =0.001), with 61.8% of 1,049 paired judgments favoring the AI version. Inter-rater agreement was moderate to substantial (Gwet’s AC: 0.54–0.70). Conclusions AI-generated titles were rated more favorably than human-written titles within the context of this study in terms of perceived alignment with the abstract content, appeal, and preference, suggesting that LLMs may enhance the effectiveness of scientific communication. These findings support the responsible integration of AI tools in research.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-194/v1?src=rss">Physicians shortage in primary care: a protocol for updating a systematic review of recruitment and retention strategies [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background The global shortage of primary care physicians (PCPs) poses a critical threat to healthcare accessibility and system performance in high-income countries. Previous reviews have documented a wide range of recruitment and retention (R&R) strategies, but the evidence base remains fragmented, outdated, and geographically uneven. In light of demographic transitions, the increasing burden of multimorbidity, and evolving models of care accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, an updated synthesis is needed to guide sustainable and context-sensitive workforce policies. Methods This systematic review will follow PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) 2020 guidelines and is registered with PROSPERO (International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews) (CRD420251008508). MEDLINE (via PubMed), Embase, and CENTRAL (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials), will be searched for quantitative studies published from February 2015 onward, without language restrictions. Eligible studies will evaluate interventions designed to improve the recruitment and/or retention of PCPs, medical students, or residents in high-income countries. Primary outcomes will include the number of physicians recruited or retained and the duration of retention. Secondary outcomes will cover career intentions, cost-effectiveness, physician satisfaction and well-being, and workforce stability. Two reviewers will independently conduct study selection, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment using validated NIH (National Institutes of Health) quality assessment tools. Findings will be synthesized narratively, with thematic grouping by intervention type, career stage, and contextual factors (e.g., rurality, health system model). Discussion This review will provide an updated and comprehensive assessment of R&R strategies for PCPs in high-income countries. By examining intervention logic, outcomes, and contextual modifiers, it will identify which approaches are most effective under specific conditions. The results aim to inform policymakers, educators, and workforce planners in designing targeted, scalable, and context-sensitive strategies to strengthen primary care workforce resilience. Systematic Review Registration: PROSPERO registration number: CRD420251008508.

                Background The non-coding RNAs, particularly microRNA-181a-5p target the expression of tumor necrosis factor alpha-induced protein 3 (TNFAIP3) a key negative regulator of NF-κB signaling and affect the levels of macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) and chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) in chronic myeloid leukamia (CML). Methods The study included 57 individuals with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and 33 healthy individuals. Hematological parameters (Hb, RBCs, WBCs and platelets) were assessed. The serum levels of MIF, TNFAIP3 and CXCR4 were measured using ELISA Technique. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was performed to assess miR-181a expression. The potential targets and immune associated pathways of miR-181a were predicted using bioinformatics tools including TargetScan, miRTarBase, STRING, DAVID, and Enrichr. Statistical analysis included ROC curve evaluation, Pearson correlation, and t-tests. Results Compared to controls, CML patients exhibited reduced platelets, Hb and RBC while elevated WBCs recorded. There were significantly elevated serum levels of MIF and CXCR4, and reduced levels of TNFAIP3 (p<0.01) in CML patients compared to control. Moreover, higher miR-181a expression (2.28 fold, p=0.0001) recorded in CML compared to control. Positive correlations were observed between miR-181a expression and both MIF and CXCR4 levels while TNFAIP3 exhibited a reverse correlation. ROC analysis showed that MIF (AUC = 0.873) and CXCR4 (AUC = 0.929) exhibited strong diagnostic performance while TNFAIP3 (AUC = 0.142) and miR-181a-5p (AUC = 0.201) demonstrated weak accuracy consistent with their opposite expression patterns between CML patients and healthy controls. Conclusion The findings of this study suggested that increased miR-181a expression may be associated with reduced TNFAIP3 levels and modified NF-κB related inflammatory signaling in CML. These findings support the hypothesis in which miR-181a, MIF, and CXCR4 may contribute to immune dysregulation in CML as well as diagnostic biomarkers and promising therapeutic target.

                Background Writing a medication prescription is a multifaceted skill expected of all junior doctors. However, many medical students feel a lack of preparedness and confidence after graduation. Separating the teaching of practical and clinical components may enhance understanding of the practical skills to complete a prescription. This study aimed to: (1) assess whether additional pharmacist-led multimodal education interventions change the prescribing skills of Australian final-year medical students, (2) evaluate knowledge retention a year later in the same participants as junior doctors, and (3) determine whether there is an association between self-perceived confidence to prescribe and their practical ability to write safe and legal prescriptions. This manuscript details the methods used in this novel longitudinal study. Methods This non-randomised pre-post longitudinal study was conducted in two phases. The intervention was additional pharmacist-led multimodal education on prescription writing skills for final-year medical students. The intervention group completed the pre-post and follow-up tests. This study was approved by the James Cook University Human Research Ethics Committee (approval number H9114). Discussion This paper presents the methods and protocol of an approved and funded non-randomised longitudinal study investigating the potential of additional education led by pharmacist educators to improve prescribing knowledge and skills among final-year medical students in Australia. Prescribing skills education for medical students may reduce the probability of potentially incorrect or unsafe prescribing habits as junior doctors. Education standards do not acknowledge adherence to local legal regulations when prescribing and do not recommend mandatory teaching or assessment criteria. This study reviews the effectiveness of and need for additional education on the practical skill of writing a medication prescription. If positive, the findings of this study will have practical and policy impacts that may result in long-term improvements in safe medicine practice and ultimately benefit patient care.

                Background Traumatic injuries remain critical public health concerns, placing psychosocial and economic burdens on individuals, families, and healthcare systems. Despite being a leading cause of morbidity and mortality globally, especially in low-and middle-income countries, few studies have examined predictors of injury severity in pre-hospital settings. Most research focuses on injury incidence, with limited attention to pre-hospital factors. We aimed assessing the prevalence of severe injuries and their associated factors among patients managed by pre-hospital emergency services. Methods This cross-sectional study utilized medical registry data from 1,162 RTI victims. Demographic, epidemiological, and clinical information were collected, with injuries categorized as severe or non-severe based on the Injury Severity Score. Bivariate and multivariable logistic regression models were conducted to indicate associated factors of severe injury. Results Among 1162 victims, 165 (14%) experienced severe injury. Our results showed that females were less likely to experience severe injury (aOR=0.47, 95%CI:0.26–0.79) than males. Regarding trauma mechanism, car-to-pedestrian collisions (aOR=2.3, 95%CI:1.25–4.1), car-to-motorcycle collisions considerably increased the likelihoods of severe injury (aOR=3.88, 95%CI:1.16–13.05) compared to car-only crashes. Alcohol users were more likely to experience severe injury (aOR=3.37; 95%CI: 2.04-5.56) than non-users. Those who travelled distance ranged 21-40 km had higher likelihoods (aOR=2.91, 95%CI:1.27–6.63), while those with more than 40 km faced higher likelihoods of severe injury (aOR=2.64, 95% CI:1.11–6.25) than individuals with less than 20 km to reach to a healthcare facility. Those with extremity injuries (aOR=0.28, 95% CI:0.15–0.52), chest injuries (aOR=0.40, 95%CI:0.23–0.71, p=.002) had lower likelihoods of severe injury than those with head trauma. Conclusion This study provides valuable insights into the factors influencing injury severity in the pre-hospital setting. The findings underscore the importance of strengthening early identification and rapid stabilization of high-risk patients during pre-hospital care. Future research using prospective longitudinal designs is recommended to confirm causality.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-192/v1?src=rss">Mapping Research Trends in AI-Based Tourism and Hospitality Marketing: A Bibliometric and Thematic Review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Artificial intelligence (AI) has fundamentally transformed tourism and hospitality marketing through enhanced data-driven decision-making, personalized customer experiences, and intelligent destination management. However, the field lacks a comprehensive synthesis of its intellectual landscape and thematic evolution, limiting understanding of research trajectories and emerging directions. Methods A systematic literature review following the SPAR-4-SLR procedure was conducted on 320 peer-reviewed papers published between 2003 and 2025, sourced from the Scopus database. Publication trends, leading journals, prolific authors, trending areas, and bibliographic coupling of documents and countries were visualized using bibliometric analysis tools (VOSviewer and Biblioshiny). Thematic analysis employed keyword co-occurrence networks to identify emerging research themes. Results Academic publications on AI in tourism and hospitality demonstrated a significant surge during 2017–2020, reflecting the industry’s growing emphasis on smart marketing applications. Thematic analysis identified four major research clusters: (i) Digital Influence and Tourist Behaviour Analytics; (ii) AI-Enabled Smart Tourism and Commerce Ecosystems; (iii) Technology-Driven Hospitality and Experience Innovation; and (iv) Data-Driven Decision Making in Predictive Tourism Modelling. Conclusions This bibliometric and thematic assessment reveals the evolving intellectual landscape of AI applications in tourism and hospitality marketing, documenting substantive research growth and the emergence of distinct thematic clusters that shape current and future research agendas in this dynamic field.

                Concrete-Filled Double Skin Steel Tubes (CFDST) have emerged as a promising composite structural system that integrates the mechanical advantages of steel and concrete while achieving enhanced energy dissipation, reduced weight, and improved post-fire resilience. Over the past two decades, substantial experimental and numerical efforts have focused on understanding the torsional and thermal performance of CFDST and related CFST members. However, an integrated synthesis of these findings under a unified systematic framework has been lacking. This study conducts a comprehensive systematic review of 37 selected experimental and analytical studies addressing the torsional and fire behavior of CFDST and CFST members, following PRISMA guidelines “the PRISMA methodology, a standardized framework for conducting systematic reviews that ensures transparency, rigorous screening, and unbiased selection of relevant studies through a structured flowchart process”. The review identifies key influencing factors, including section geometry, wall thickness, concrete type, steel grade, axial load level, and fire exposure duration. Comparative analysis reveals that torsional resistance increases with lower hollow ratios, thicker outer tubes, and confined concrete cores, while elevated temperatures significantly reduce torsional stiffness and residual strength. Despite considerable research on CFST under fire and torsion separately, the coupling effect of post-fire torsional performance remains underexplored. Based on the identified research gaps, a new experimental program is proposed to investigate the pre- and post-fire torsional performance of CFDST columns with varying cross-sections and steel thicknesses. The study concludes with future research recommendations focused on developing constitutive models, hybrid materials, and fire-torsion interaction design equations for CFDST systems.
