                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Adolescent intermittent ethanol (AIE) exposure leads to persisting increases in glial markers and significantly decreases the neurogenic niche in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. Our previous study indicated that donepezil (DZ), a cholinesterase inhibitor, can reverse the AIE effect of decreased doublecortin (DCX), a neurogenic marker, and increased cleaved caspase 3, a marker of apoptosis, in the dentate gyrus of male rats. However, to date, no studies have assessed the effects of DZ on AIE effects in females. The purpose of this study was to determine whether DZ can reverse neuroimmune, neurogenic, and neuronal death effects in adulthood after AIE in female rats. Adolescent female rats were given 14 doses of ethanol (5 g/kg) over 24 days by intragastric gavage. Seventeen days later, DZ (2.5 mg/kg, 1.88 mL/kg, i.g., in water) was then administered daily for 4 days prior to sacrifice. Immunohistochemical techniques were utilized to determine the effects of DZ on AIE-induced changes in neurogenesis, cell death, glial, and neuroimmune markers. As expected, AIE decreased the neurogenic markers DCX, SOX2, and Ki-67 in the dentate gyrus and also caused an increase in the glial markers GFAP and Iba-1 in the hippocampus. The effects of AIE on neurogenic and glial markers were reversed by DZ treatment, but the reversal of AIE effects on glial markers was regionally specific within the hippocampus. Overall, these findings indicate that systemic DZ in adult female rats ameliorates the effects of AIE on neurogenesis, neuronal cell death, neuroimmune markers, and glial activation markers. Future studies will determine if DZ alters hippocampally driven behaviors, as well as the mechanisms underlying donepezil's effects.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12471">Explainable AI-Driven Neural Activity Analysis in Parkinsonian Rats under Electrical Stimulation</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2502.12471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motor dysfunction and abnormal neural oscillations. These symptoms can be modulated through electrical stimulation. Traditional neural activity analysis in PD has typically relied on statistical methods, which often introduce bias owing to the need for expert-driven feature extraction. To address this limitation, we explore an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) approach to analyze neural activity in Parkinsonian rats receiving electrical stimulation. Electrocorticogram (ECoG) signals were collected before and after electrical stimulation using graphene-based electrodes that enable less-invasive monitoring and stimulation in PD. EEGNet, a convolutional neural network, classified these ECoG signals into pre- and post-stimulation states. We applied layer-wise relevance propagation, an XAI technique, to identify key neural inputs contributing to the model's decisions, incorporating the spatial electrode information matched to the cortex map. The XAI analysis highlighted area-specific importance in beta and gamma frequency bands, which could not be detected through mean comparison analyses relying on feature extraction. These findings demonstrate the potential of XAI in analyzing neural dynamics in neurodegenerative disorders such as PD, suggesting that the integration of graphene-based electrodes with advanced deep learning models offers a promising solution for real-time PD monitoring and therapy.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12935">Neuro-oscillatory models of cortical speech processing</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2502.12935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this review, we examine computational models that explore the role of neural oscillations in speech perception, spanning from early auditory processing to higher cognitive stages. We focus on models that use rhythmic brain activities, such as gamma, theta, and delta oscillations, to encode phonemes, segment speech into syllables and words, and integrate linguistic elements to infer meaning. We analyze the mechanisms underlying these models, their biological plausibility, and their potential applications in processing and understanding speech in real time, a computational feature that is achieved by the human brain but not yet implemented in speech recognition models. Real-time processing enables dynamic adaptation to incoming speech, allowing systems to handle the rapid and continuous flow of auditory information required for effective communication, interactive applications, and accurate speech recognition in a variety of real-world settings. While significant progress has been made in modeling the neural basis of speech perception, challenges remain, particularly in accounting for the complexity of semantic processing and the integration of contextual influences. Moreover, the high computational demands of biologically realistic models pose practical difficulties for their implementation and analysis. Despite these limitations, these models provide valuable insights into the neural mechanisms of speech perception. We conclude by identifying current limitations, proposing future research directions, and suggesting how these models can be further developed to achieve a more comprehensive understanding of speech processing in the human brain.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12771">Mind the Gap: Aligning the Brain with Language Models Requires a Nonlinear and Multimodal Approach</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2502.12771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-supervised language and audio models effectively predict brain responses to speech. However, traditional prediction models rely on linear mappings from unimodal features, despite the complex integration of auditory signals with linguistic and semantic information across widespread brain networks during speech comprehension. Here, we introduce a nonlinear, multimodal prediction model that combines audio and linguistic features from pre-trained models (e.g., LLAMA, Whisper). Our approach achieves a 17.2% and 17.9% improvement in prediction performance (unnormalized and normalized correlation) over traditional unimodal linear models, as well as a 7.7% and 14.4% improvement, respectively, over prior state-of-the-art models. These improvements represent a major step towards future robust in-silico testing and improved decoding performance. They also reveal how auditory and semantic information are fused in motor, somatosensory, and higher-level semantic regions, aligning with existing neurolinguistic theories. Overall, our work highlights the often neglected potential of nonlinear and multimodal approaches to brain modeling, paving the way for future studies to embrace these strategies in naturalistic neurolinguistics research.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12847">Characterizing the Interaction of Cultural Evolution Mechanisms in Experimental Social Networks</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2502.12847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding how cognitive and social mechanisms shape the evolution of complex artifacts such as songs is central to cultural evolution research. Social network topology (what artifacts are available?), selection (which are chosen?), and reproduction (how are they copied?) have all been proposed as key influencing factors. However, prior research has rarely studied them together due to methodological challenges. We address this gap through a controlled naturalistic paradigm whereby participants (N=2,404) are placed in networks and are asked to iteratively choose and sing back melodies from their neighbors. We show that this setting yields melodies that are more complex and more pleasant than those found in the more-studied linear transmission setting, and exhibits robust differences across topologies. Crucially, these differences are diminished when selection or reproduction bias are eliminated, suggesting an interaction between mechanisms. These findings shed light on the interplay of mechanisms underlying the evolution of cultural artifacts.

                arXiv:2502.12977v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gradient-based attribution methods aim to explain decisions of deep learning models but so far lack identifiability guarantees. Here, we propose a method to generate attribution maps with identifiability guarantees by developing a regularized contrastive learning algorithm trained on time-series data plus a new attribution method called Inverted Neuron Gradient (collectively named xCEBRA). We show theoretically that xCEBRA has favorable properties for identifying the Jacobian matrix of the data generating process. Empirically, we demonstrate robust approximation of zero vs. non-zero entries in the ground-truth attribution map on synthetic datasets, and significant improvements across previous attribution methods based on feature ablation, Shapley values, and other gradient-based methods. Our work constitutes a first example of identifiable inference of time-series attribution maps and opens avenues to a better understanding of time-series data, such as for neural dynamics and decision-processes within neural networks.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18587">Emergence and maintenance of modularity in neural networks with Hebbian and anti-Hebbian inhibitory STDP</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2405.18587v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The modular and hierarchical organization of the brain is believed to support the coexistence of segregated (specialization) and integrated (binding) information processes. A relevant question is yet to understand how such architecture naturally emerges and is sustained over time, given the plastic nature of the brain's wiring. Following evidences that the sensory cortices organize into assemblies under selective stimuli, it has been shown that stable neuronal assemblies can emerge due to targeted stimulation, embedding various forms of synaptic plasticity in presence of homeostatic and/or control mechanisms. Here, we show that simple spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) rules, based only on pre- and post-synaptic spike times, can also lead to the stable encoding of memories in the absence of any control mechanism. We develop a model of spiking neurons, trained by stimuli targeting different subpopulations. The model satisfies some biologically plausible features: (i) it contains excitatory and inhibitory neurons with Hebbian and anti-Hebbian STDP; (ii) neither the neuronal activity nor the synaptic weights are frozen after the learning phase. Instead, the neurons are allowed to fire spontaneously while synaptic plasticity remains active. We find that only the combination of two inhibitory STDP subpopulations allows for the formation of stable modules in the network, with each subpopulation playing a distinctive role. The Hebbian subpopulation controls for the firing activity, while the anti-Hebbian neurons promote pattern selectivity. After the learning phase, the network settles into an asynchronous irregular resting-state. This post-learning activity is associated with spontaneous memory recalls which turn out to be fundamental for the long-term consolidation of the learned memories.

                arXiv:2502.07429v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Humans effortlessly communicate their thoughts through intricate sequences of motor actions. Yet, the neural processes that coordinate language production remain largely unknown, in part because speech artifacts limit the use of neuroimaging. To elucidate the unfolding of language production in the brain, we investigate with magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG) the neurophysiological activity of 35 skilled typists, while they typed sentences on a keyboard. This approach confirms the hierarchical predictions of linguistic theories: the neural activity preceding the production of each word is marked by the sequential rise and fall of context-, word-, syllable-, and letter-level representations. Remarkably, each of these neural representations is maintained over long time periods within each level of the language hierarchy. This phenomenon results in a superposition of successive representations that is supported by a hierarchy of dynamic neural codes. Overall, these findings provide a precise computational breakdown of the neural dynamics that coordinate the production of language in the human brain.

                arXiv:2410.12866v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) have enabled the decoding of lexical tones from intracranial recordings, offering the potential to restore the communication abilities of speech-impaired tonal language speakers. However, data heterogeneity induced by both physiological and instrumental factors poses a significant challenge for unified invasive brain tone decoding. Traditional subject-specific models, which operate under a heterogeneous decoding paradigm, fail to capture generalized neural representations and cannot effectively leverage data across subjects. To address these limitations, we introduce Homogeneity-Heterogeneity Disentangled Learning for neural Representations (H2DiLR), a novel framework that disentangles and learns both the homogeneity and heterogeneity from intracranial recordings across multiple subjects. To evaluate H2DiLR, we collected stereoelectroencephalography (sEEG) data from multiple participants reading Mandarin materials comprising 407 syllables, representing nearly all Mandarin characters. Extensive experiments demonstrate that H2DiLR, as a unified decoding paradigm, significantly outperforms the conventional heterogeneous decoding approach. Furthermore, we empirically confirm that H2DiLR effectively captures both homogeneity and heterogeneity during neural representation learning.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10425">Neuron Platonic Intrinsic Representation From Dynamics Using Contrastive Learning</a></h4>

Abstract: The Platonic Representation Hypothesis suggests a universal, modality-independent reality representation behind different data modalities. Inspired by this, we view each neuron as a system and detect its multi-segment activity data under various peripheral conditions. We assume there's a time-invariant representation for the same neuron, reflecting its intrinsic properties like molecular profiles, location, and morphology. The goal of obtaining these intrinsic neuronal representations has two criteria: (I) segments from the same neuron should have more similar representations than those from different neurons; (II) the representations must generalize well to out-of-domain data. To meet these, we propose the NeurPIR (Neuron Platonic Intrinsic Representation) framework. It uses contrastive learning, with segments from the same neuron as positive pairs and those from different neurons as negative pairs. In implementation, we use VICReg, which focuses on positive pairs and separates dissimilar samples via regularization. We tested our method on Izhikevich model-simulated neuronal population dynamics data. The results accurately identified neuron types based on preset hyperparameters. We also applied it to two real-world neuron dynamics datasets with neuron type annotations from spatial transcriptomics and neuron locations. Our model's learned representations accurately predicted neuron types and locations and were robust on out-of-domain data (from unseen animals). This shows the potential of our approach for understanding neuronal systems and future neuroscience research.

                arXiv:2502.12164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Water distribution systems (WDSs) are an important part of critical infrastructure becoming increasingly significant in the face of climate change and urban population growth. We propose a robust and scalable surrogate deep learning (DL) model to enable efficient planning, expansion, and rehabilitation of WDSs. Our approach incorporates an improved graph neural network architecture, an adapted physics-informed algorithm, an innovative training scheme, and a physics-preserving data normalization method. Evaluation results on a number of WDSs demonstrate that our model outperforms the current state-of-the-art DL model. Moreover, our method allows us to scale the model to bigger and more realistic WDSs. Furthermore, our approach makes the model more robust to out-of-distribution input features (demands, pipe diameters). Hence, our proposed method constitutes a significant step towards bridging the simulation-to-real gap in the use of artificial intelligence for WDSs.

                arXiv:2502.12172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hyperparameter optimization (HPO) is of paramount importance in the development of high-performance, specialized artificial intelligence (AI) models, ranging from well-established machine learning (ML) solutions to the deep learning (DL) domain and the field of spiking neural networks (SNNs). The latter introduce further complexity due to the neuronal computational units and their additional hyperparameters, whose inadequate setting can dramatically impact the final model performance. At the cost of possible reduced generalization capabilities, the most suitable strategy to fully disclose the power of SNNs is to adopt an application-oriented approach and perform extensive HPO experiments. To facilitate these operations, automatic pipelines are fundamental, and their configuration is crucial. In this document, the Neural Network Intelligence (NNI) toolkit is used as reference framework to present one such solution, with a use case example providing evidence of the corresponding results. In addition, a summary of published works employing the presented pipeline is reported as possible source of insights into application-oriented HPO experiments for SNN prototyping.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12174">Robust blue-green urban flood risk management optimised with a genetic algorithm for multiple rainstorm return periods</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2502.12174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flood risk managers seek to optimise Blue-Green Infrastructure (BGI) designs to maximise return on investment. Current systems often use optimisation algorithms and detailed flood models to maximise benefit-cost ratios for single rainstorm return periods. However, these schemes may lack robustness in mitigating flood risks across different storm magnitudes. For example, a BGI scheme optimised for a 100-year return period may differ from one optimised for a 10-year return period. This study introduces a novel methodology incorporating five return periods (T = 10, 20, 30, 50, and 100 years) into a multi-objective BGI optimisation framework. The framework combines a Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) with a fully distributed hydrodynamic model to optimise the spatial placement and combined size of BGI features. For the first time, direct damage cost (DDC) and expected annual damage (EAD), calculated for various building types, are used as risk objective functions, transforming a many-objective problem into a multi-objective one. Performance metrics such as Median Risk Difference (MedRD), Maximum Risk Difference (MaxRD), and Area Under Pareto Front (AUPF) reveal that a 100-year optimised BGI design performs poorly when evaluated for other return periods, particularly shorter ones. In contrast, a BGI design optimised using composite return periods enhances performance metrics across all return periods, with the greatest improvements observed in MedRD (22%) and AUPF (73%) for the 20-year return period, and MaxRD (23%) for the 50-year return period. Furthermore, climate uplift stress testing confirms the robustness of the proposed design to future rainfall extremes. This study advocates a paradigm shift in flood risk management, moving from single maximum to multiple rainstorm return period-based designs to enhance resilience and adaptability to future climate extremes.

                arXiv:2502.12196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In light of the rapid expansion of civil aviation, addressing the delays and congestion phenomena in the vicinity of metroplex caused by the imbalance between air traffic flow and capacity is crucial. This paper first proposes a bi-level optimization model for the collaborative flight sequencing of arrival and departure flights in the metroplex with multiple airports, considering both the runway systems and TMA (Terminal Control Area) entry/exit fixes. Besides, the model is adaptive to various traffic scenarios. The genetic algorithm is employed to solve the proposed model. The Shanghai TMA, located in China, is used as a case study, and it includes two airports, Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport and Shanghai Pudong International Airport. The results demonstrate that the model can reduce arrival delay by 51.52%, departure delay by 18.05%, and the runway occupation time of departure flights by 23.83%. Furthermore, the model utilized in this study significantly enhances flight scheduling efficiency, providing a more efficient solution than the traditional FCFS (First Come, First Served) approach. Additionally, the algorithm employed offers further improvements over the NSGA II algorithm.

                arXiv:2502.12536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the mechanisms of neural encoding and decoding has always been a highly interesting research topic in fields such as neuroscience and cognitive intelligence. In prior studies, some researchers identified a symmetry in neural data decoded by unsupervised methods in motor scenarios and constructed a cognitive learning system based on this pattern (i.e., symmetry). Nevertheless, the distribution state of the data flow that significantly influences neural decoding positions still remains a mystery within the system, which further restricts the enhancement of the system's interpretability. Based on this, this paper mainly explores changes in the distribution state within the system from the machine learning and mathematical statistics perspectives. In the experiment, we assessed the correctness of this symmetry using various tools and indicators commonly utilized in mathematics and statistics. According to the experimental results, the normal distribution (or Gaussian distribution) plays a crucial role in the decoding of prediction positions within the system. Eventually, an algorithm board similar to the Galton board was built to serve as the mathematical foundation of the discovered symmetry.

                arXiv:2502.12555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several practical applications of evolutionary computation possess objective functions that receive the design variables and externally given parameters. Such problems are termed contextual optimization problems. These problems require finding the optimal solutions corresponding to the given context vectors. Existing contextual optimization methods train a policy model to predict the optimal solution from context vectors. However, the performance of such models is limited by their representation ability. By contrast, warm starting methods have been used to initialize evolutionary algorithms on a given problem using the optimization results on similar problems. Because warm starting methods do not consider the context vectors, their performances can be improved on contextual optimization problems. Herein, we propose a covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy with contextual warm starting (CMA-ES-CWS) to efficiently optimize the contextual optimization problem with a given context vector. The CMA-ES-CWS utilizes the optimization results of past context vectors to train the multivariate Gaussian process regression. Subsequently, the CMA-ES-CWS performs warm starting for a given context vector by initializing the search distribution using posterior distribution of the Gaussian process regression. The results of the numerical simulation suggest that CMA-ES-CWS outperforms the existing contextual optimization and warm starting methods.

                arXiv:2502.12690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tiny machine learning (TinyML) promises to revolutionize fields such as healthcare, environmental monitoring, and industrial maintenance by running machine learning models on low-power embedded systems. However, the complex optimizations required for successful TinyML deployment continue to impede its widespread adoption. A promising route to simplifying TinyML is through automatic machine learning (AutoML), which can distill elaborate optimization workflows into accessible key decisions. Notably, Hardware Aware Neural Architecture Searches - where a computer searches for an optimal TinyML model based on predictive performance and hardware metrics - have gained significant traction, producing some of today's most widely used TinyML models. Nevertheless, limiting optimization solely to neural network architectures can prove insufficient. Because TinyML systems must operate under extremely tight resource constraints, the choice of input data configuration, such as resolution or sampling rate, also profoundly impacts overall system efficiency. Achieving truly optimal TinyML systems thus requires jointly tuning both input data and model architecture. Despite its importance, this "Data Aware Neural Architecture Search" remains underexplored. To address this gap, we propose a new state-of-the-art Data Aware Neural Architecture Search technique and demonstrate its effectiveness on the novel TinyML ``Wake Vision'' dataset. Our experiments show that across varying time and hardware constraints, Data Aware Neural Architecture Search consistently discovers superior TinyML systems compared to purely architecture-focused methods, underscoring the critical role of data-aware optimization in advancing TinyML.

                arXiv:2305.00543v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural network-based decisions tend to be overconfident, where their raw outcome probabilities do not align with the true decision probabilities. Calibration of neural networks is an essential step towards more reliable deep learning frameworks. Prior metrics of calibration error primarily utilize crisp bin membership-based measures. This exacerbates skew in model probabilities and portrays an incomplete picture of calibration error. In this work, we propose a Fuzzy Calibration Error metric (FCE) that utilizes a fuzzy binning approach to calculate calibration error. This approach alleviates the impact of probability skew and provides a tighter estimate while measuring calibration error. We compare our metric with ECE across different data populations and class memberships. Our results show that FCE offers better calibration error estimation, especially in multi-class settings, alleviating the effects of skew in model confidence scores on calibration error estimation. We make our code and supplementary materials available at: https://github.com/bihani-g/fce

                arXiv:2502.12203v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mechanism design has long been a cornerstone of economic theory, with traditional approaches relying on mathematical derivations. Recently, automated approaches, including differentiable economics with neural networks, have emerged for designing payments and allocations. While both analytical and automated methods have advanced the field, they each face significant weaknesses: mathematical derivations are not automated and often struggle to scale to complex problems, while automated and especially neural-network-based approaches suffer from limited interpretability. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel framework that reformulates mechanism design as a code generation task. Using large language models (LLMs), we generate heuristic mechanisms described in code and evolve them to optimize over some evaluation metrics while ensuring key design criteria (e.g., strategy-proofness) through a problem-specific fixing process. This fixing process ensures any mechanism violating the design criteria is adjusted to satisfy them, albeit with some trade-offs in performance metrics. These trade-offs are factored in during the LLM-based evolution process. The code generation capabilities of LLMs enable the discovery of novel and interpretable solutions, bridging the symbolic logic of mechanism design and the generative power of modern AI. Through rigorous experimentation, we demonstrate that LLM-generated mechanisms achieve competitive performance while offering greater interpretability compared to previous approaches. Notably, our framework can rediscover existing manually designed mechanisms and provide insights into neural-network based solutions through Programming-by-Example. These results highlight the potential of LLMs to not only automate but also enhance the transparency and scalability of mechanism design, ensuring safe deployment of the mechanisms in society.

Abstract: We simulate hadrons impinging on a homogeneous lead-tungstate (PbWO4) calorimeter to investigate how the resulting light yield and its temporal structure, as detected by an array of light-sensitive sensors, can be processed by a neuromorphic computing system. Our model encodes temporal photon distributions as spike trains and employs a fully connected spiking neural network to estimate the total deposited energy, as well as the position and spatial distribution of the light emissions within the sensitive material. The extracted primitives offer valuable topological information about the shower development in the material, achieved without requiring a segmentation of the active medium. A potential nanophotonic implementation using III-V semiconductor nanowires is discussed. It can be both fast and energy efficient.

Abstract: Associative memory or content addressable memory is an important component function in computer science and information processing and is a key concept in cognitive and computational brain science. Many different neural network architectures and learning rules have been proposed to model associative memory of the brain while investigating key functions like pattern completion and rivalry, noise reduction, and storage capacity. A less investigated but important function is prototype extraction where the training set comprises pattern instances generated by distorting prototype patterns and the task of the trained network is to recall the correct prototype pattern given a new instance. In this paper we characterize these different aspects of associative memory performance and benchmark six different learning rules on storage capacity and prototype extraction. We consider only models with Hebbian plasticity that operate on sparse distributed representations with unit activities in the interval [0,1]. We evaluate both non-modular and modular network architectures and compare performance when trained and tested on different kinds of sparse random binary pattern sets, including correlated ones. We show that covariance learning has a robust but low storage capacity under these conditions and that the Bayesian Confidence Propagation learning rule (BCPNN) is superior with a good margin in all cases except one, reaching a three times higher composite score than the second best learning rule tested.

                arXiv:2412.20694v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Solving NP-hard problems traditionally relies on heuristics, yet manually designing effective heuristics for complex problems remains a significant challenge. While recent advancements like FunSearch have shown that large language models (LLMs) can be integrated into evolutionary algorithms (EAs) for heuristic design, their potential is hindered by limitations in balancing exploitation and exploration. We introduce Quality-Uncertainty Balanced Evolution (QUBE), a novel approach that enhances LLM+EA methods by redefining the priority criterion within the FunSearch framework. QUBE employs the Quality-Uncertainty Trade-off Criterion (QUTC), based on our proposed Uncertainty-Inclusive Quality metric, to evaluate and guide the evolutionary process. Through extensive experiments on challenging NP-complete problems, QUBE demonstrates significant performance improvements over FunSearch and baseline methods. Our code are available at https://github.com/zzjchen/QUBE\_code.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12807">GBO:AMulti-Granularity Optimization Algorithm via Granular-ball for Continuous Problems</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2303.12807v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optimization problems aim to find the optimal solution, which is becoming increasingly complex and difficult to solve. Traditional evolutionary optimization methods always overlook the granular characteristics of solution space. In the real scenario of numerous optimizations, the solution space is typically partitioned into sub-regions characterized by varying degree distributions. These sub-regions present different granularity characteristics at search potential and difficulty. Considering the granular characteristics of the solution space, the number of coarse-grained regions is smaller than the number of points, so the calculation is more efficient. On the other hand, coarse-grained characteristics are not easily affected by fine-grained sample points, so the calculation is more robust. To this end, this paper proposes a new multi-granularity evolutionary optimization method, namely the Granular-ball Optimization (GBO) algorithm, which characterizes and searches the solution space from coarse to fine. Specifically, using granular-balls instead of traditional points for optimization increases the diversity and robustness of the random search process. At the same time, the search range in different iteration processes is limited by the radius of granular-balls, covering the solution space from large to small. The mechanism of granular-ball splitting is applied to continuously split and evolve the large granular-balls into smaller ones for refining the solution space. Extensive experiments on commonly used benchmarks have shown that GBO outperforms popular and advanced evolutionary algorithms. The code can be found in the supporting materials.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17002">A Closer Look at Mortality Risk Prediction from Electrocardiograms</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2406.17002v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Several recent studies combine large private ECG databases with AI to predict patient mortality. These studies typically use a few, highly variable, modeling approaches. While benchmarking these approaches has historically been limited by a lack of public ECG datasets, this changed with the 2023 release of MIMIC-IV, containing 795,546 ECGs from a U.S. hospital system, and the 2020 release of Code-15, containing 345,779 ECGs collected during routine care in Brazil. We benchmark over 500 AI-ECG survival models predicting all-cause mortality on Code-15 and MIMIC-IV with 2 neural architectures, 4 Deep-Survival-Analysis approaches, and classifiers predicting mortality at 4 time horizons. We extend the highest-performing approach to a dataset from Boston Children's Hospital (BCH, 225,379 ECGs). Models train with and without demographics (age/sex) and evaluate across datasets. The best performing Deep-Survival-Analysis models trained with ECG and demographics yield good median Concordance Indices (Code-15: 0.82, MIMIC-IV: 0.78, BCH: 0.76) and AUPRC scores (median 1-yr/5-yr, Code-15: 0.07/0.15; MIMIC-IV: 0.45/0.55; BCH: 0.04/0.13) considering the percentage of ECGs linked to mortality (1-yr/5-yr, Code-15: 1.2%/3.4%; MIMIC-IV: 14.8%/24.5%; BCH: 0.9%/4.8%). Contrasting with Deep-Survival-Analysis models, classifier-based AI-ECG models exhibit significant, site-dependent sensitivity to the choice of time horizon (median Pearson's R, Code-15: 0.69, p<1E-5; MIMIC-IV: -0.80 p<1E-5). Demographic-only models perform surprisingly well on Code-15. Concordance drops 0.03-0.24 on external validation. We recommend Deep-Survival-Analysis over Classifier-Cox approaches and the inclusion of demographic covariates in ECG survival modeling. Comparisons to demographic-only and baseline models is crucial. External evaluations support fine-tuning models on site-specific data.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11687">State-space models can learn in-context by gradient descent</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2410.11687v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep state-space models (Deep SSMs) are becoming popular as effective approaches to model sequence data. They have also been shown to be capable of in-context learning, much like transformers. However, a complete picture of how SSMs might be able to do in-context learning has been missing. In this study, we provide a direct and explicit construction to show that state-space models can perform gradient-based learning and use it for in-context learning in much the same way as transformers. Specifically, we prove that a single structured state-space model layer, augmented with multiplicative input and output gating, can reproduce the outputs of an implicit linear model with least squares loss after one step of gradient descent. We then show a straightforward extension to multi-step linear and non-linear regression tasks. We validate our construction by training randomly initialized augmented SSMs on linear and non-linear regression tasks. The empirically obtained parameters through optimization match the ones predicted analytically by the theoretical construction. Overall, we elucidate the role of input- and output-gating in recurrent architectures as the key inductive biases for enabling the expressive power typical of foundation models. We also provide novel insights into the relationship between state-space models and linear self-attention, and their ability to learn in-context.

	<p>Background/Objectives: Bilateral steno-occlusive disease of the internal carotid artery (ICA) carries an increased stroke risk with associated high morbidity and mortality. Management of these patients is often complex. In this study, we evaluate the value of non-invasive optimal vessel analysis quantitative magnetic resonance angiography (NOVA-qMRA) for studying flow and collateral patterns in patients with bilateral carotid steno-occlusive disease. Methods: Patients with bilateral ICA-stenosis &amp;amp;ge; 50% who received NOVA-qMRA were included in this study. The volume flow rates (VFRs) of the A2-segment of the anterior cerebral artery (A2-ACA), M1-segment of the middle cerebral artery (M1-MCA), and P2-segment of the posterior cerebral artery (P2-PCA) were analyzed. Demographic, clinical, and treatment data were collected. Results: Twenty-two patients (mean age &amp;amp;plusmn; SD: 68 &amp;amp;plusmn; 10 years) were included. Nineteen patients (86%) were symptomatic. Thirteen patients (59%) were revascularized; among them, M1-VFR was significantly lower (p-value = 0.01) on the side selected for revascularization (88 mL/min &amp;amp;plusmn; 53) compared to the contralateral one (130 mL/min &amp;amp;plusmn; 56). P2-VFR was significantly higher (p-value = 0.04) in the treated subgroup (108 mL/min &amp;amp;plusmn; 41) than in the non-treated one (83 mL/min &amp;amp;plusmn; 34). Conclusions: The present study supports the use of NOVA-qMRA to study flow and collateral patterns in patients with bilateral steno-occlusive carotid disease, especially M1- and P2-VFR. This information may be helpful for decision-making and to tailor revascularization treatment.</p>

                Background There is a need to go beyond mere measures of time used on social media. Existing tools inadequately capture the multidimensional nature of social media use, leaving a gap for concise yet comprehensive assessment tools. Aims This study aimed to develop a short questionnaire addressing three critical dimensions of social media use: self-presentation, negative experiences, and problematic use. The association between these dimensions and symptoms of anxiety and depression was also investigated. Methods This study uses two independent datasets of adolescents aged 16+ years in Norway. Using Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) analyses, a pool of 31 social media items was analyzed to investigate factor structure and associations with symptoms of anxiety and depression. For model development, the “LifeOnSoMe”-study was employed (>3,500 participants), and data from a pilot study (~500 participants) was used for external validation. Results Based on ACO-analyses, a 20-item six-factor model was identified, encompassing social comparison and self-presentation (five items), and three items for each of the following domains: negative experiences (Negative acts and Unwanted attention from others) and problematic use (Subjective overuse, Social obligations, and Source of concern). Confirmatory factor analyses demonstrated very good to excellent fit in both datasets, and consistent associations between the six different domains and symptoms of anxiety and depression. Discussion The suggested 20-item questionnaire provides a robust and succinct tool for evaluating social media’s impact on mental health, offering substantial explanatory power for variance in anxiety and depression symptoms. This can serve as meaningful tool for assessing the potential impact of social media use for mental health and related outcomes.

                Background Dental identification methods are employed to determine a person’s identity in forensic odontology. Additionally, analyzing a person’s teeth can provide insights into their socioeconomic status, which may assist in the process of identification. Our study aimed to assess the correlation between dental health status and SES among individuals, with a focus on identifying predictors of SES based on dental health indicators Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted to evaluate the correlation between dental health status and socioeconomic status among 135 individuals. who had visited the Department of Oral Medicine for various forms of dental care. SES was measured according to a modified Kuppuswamy scale. The associations between SES and dental health indicators were analyzed using chi-square tests for categorical variables and t-tests for continuous variables. Results Dental caries is more common in lower SES groups, attributed to factors like poor nutrition and hygiene. Partial and complete edentulism are also more prevalent in lower SES populations, often due to financial constraints and lack of awareness, leading to extractions rather than restorations. However, urban populations, regardless of SES, show greater utilization of dental restorations, likely due to the concentration of dentists in cities and access to community-based dental camps offering low-cost treatments. Periodontal diseases further reflect SES disparities. Studies show that individuals from lower SES backgrounds report more severe periodontal issues, such as gingival swelling, while higher SES groups report milder symptoms like gingival bleeding, indicating earlier intervention. Conclusion SES plays a vital role in shaping health and lifestyle outcomes. The findings in our study demonstrate the value of incorporating SES indicators, such as education, occupation, marital status, and residence, into forensic investigations to enhance the precision of identification processes.

                Abstract Background Food-related illnesses have become more prevalent globally over time, having a detrimental impact on the health and economic prosperity of both emerging and developed nations. A large percentage of these diseases are caused by food-borne infections, both globally and locally. Objective To determine food safety and hygiene practices of food vendors in the Bibiani Municipality. Method A descriptive cross-sectional design was employed in this study. A quota sampling technique was used to select 152 food vendors from Bibiani. The community was divided into three parts: Bibiani, Anwhiaso, and Bekwai. The data collection tool was structured questionnaires and exported into Statistics and Data 15.0 (STATA 15.0). The data were analyzed descriptively and presented as frequency counts, simple percentages, and tables. Results Out of 152 respondents, 89.5% put leftover foods in the refrigerator for preservation, 4.6% put food pans in water, 76.3% used a serving spoon when dishing food, 5.3% used bear hands, 64.5% used soap and water during hand washing, and 73.0% had done a medical examination; 82.2% wore aprons as well as hair covers during the cooking and serving of food. Conclusion The majority of respondents had satisfactory safety and hygiene practices, while some still had several unsafe hygienic practices. Recommendation The government of Ghana and MMDAs should establish the pre-requisite standard operating procedures for all institutions undertaking hospitality regarding food safety and hygiene.

                Background The COVID-19 pandemic has profoundly affected global health systems and daily life, exacerbating vulnerabilities, particularly in Indonesia. This study investigates the impact of anxiety and education level on mental health, with spiritual intelligence as an intervening variable among post-COVID-19 patients in Indonesia. Methods Utilizing a cross-sectional design, data were collected from 390 post-COVID-19 patients in Indonesia. Structured questionnaires assessed anxiety, education level, spiritual intelligence, and mental health. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) was used to analyze the relationships among these variables. Results The findings indicate that anxiety significantly affects both spiritual intelligence and mental health, with spiritual intelligence acting as a mediating factor. Additionally, higher educational attainment is positively associated with enhanced spiritual intelligence and improved mental health outcomes. Conclusions The study underscores the importance of incorporating spiritual development practices into mental health interventions and educational programs to boost resilience and overall well-being in the post-pandemic era. While these findings are promising, the cross-sectional design limits causal inferences, and future research should consider longitudinal studies to examine these relationships over time. These practices can help mitigate the adverse effects of anxiety and educational disparities on mental health.

                Heavy metal contamination has gradually become a very much important significant global issue due to its continual existence in the environment and bioaccumulation in the ecosystems, posing deleterious risks to human health. This review aims to investigate the sources, pathways, and toxicological impacts of heavy metals such as cadmium, lead, mercury, and arsenic, elucidating their health consequences and plausible mitigation strategies. Furthermore, the review explores the dual origins of heavy metal contamination; natural geological processes and anthropogenic activities such as industrial emissions, mining, and agricultural practices. These heavy metals sip into soil, water, and food chains, leading to bioaccumulation, bio-magnification and causing significant health risks, including cardiovascular diseases, neurological disorders, and reproductive toxicity. Additionally, the addition of indigenous case studies from Nigeria, such as lead poisoning in Zamfara State and contamination in the Great Kwa River of Cross Rivers State underscores the disproportionate impact of heavy metal pollution in developing nations. These case studies reveal the socio-economic and environmental dimensions of the issue, providing a contextual understanding of region-specific vulnerabilities and health outcomes. To address these problems, the review evaluates already existing mitigation strategies, including chelation therapy and phytoremediation, while proposing sustainable, cost-effective solutions for reducing exposure and mitigating impacts. It emphasizes the importance of integrative approaches involving policy, community engagement, and technological innovations to fight heavy metal contamination effectively. In conclusion, this seminar contributes to the understanding of heavy metal toxicity, giving and showcasing very much important insights into the sources and health implications of contamination. By integrating theoretical perspectives with practical solutions, this review provides a robust framework for informing policy makers and advancing sustainable environmental management practices.

                Chickenpox is an extremely contagious disease; caused by the varicella-zoster virus primary infection. The most common symptom of chickenpox is a vesicular rash that appears on the scalp, back, and front of the neck, face, and scapulae and then disseminates distally to the limbs. A 27-year-old adult Black African male health care worker presented with severe headache, intermittent weakness and inability to walk, intermittent nausea, fever, nocturnal polydipsia, shortness of breath, itching, pruritus (intensely pruritic erythematous macules), lesions with pus on the skin, sleep disturbances, and nightmares for two days. In this case report, the patient face, neck and scapulae were the most infected areas of the body and the rest of the body except the legs, hands, genital areas and buttocks, were also highly infected. Acyclovir 800 mg orally, five times a day, was given for ten days to treat chickenpox infection because acyclovir inhibits varicella zoster virus replication. It is typically unable to eradicate varicella-zoster virus from the latent state in neurons.

                Background Microalgae-based products offer a sustainable solution for food, fuel, and agricultural inputs, presenting environmental benefits and economic opportunities. A comprehensive assessment is needed to understand their potential in supporting sustainability goals, considering the complex interplay between production methods, energy sources, and environmental impacts. Methods This study evaluated the environmental impacts of three microalgae-derived products – biodiesel, fish feed, and biofertilizer – through a comprehensive life cycle assessment. Nine scenarios were explored comparing three electricity profiles (current Thai mix, 50% renewable/50% current mix hybrid, 100% renewable) across the three products. The assessment evaluated environmental impacts and potential economic benefits of transitioning to these microalgae-based alternatives. Results and discussion All products demonstrated potential for significant environmental benefits under increased renewable energy scenarios. Fish feed consistently exhibited the lowest environmental impacts across all categories examined, showing substantial improvements with increased renewable energy use. With an annual demand of 0.4 million tonnes, fish feed could generate USD 560 million in revenue and reduce CO2 emissions by 1.1 million tonnes. Fulfilling the projected biodiesel demand of 4,015 million liters per year through microalgae production could yield approximately USD 3.5 billion in revenue and reduce CO2 emissions by 30 million tonnes compared to conventional fossil-based diesel. Additionally, algal biofertilizer production could meet a 5 million tonnes annual demand, offering USD 2 billion in revenue while reducing CO2 emissions by 6 million tonnes yearly. Collectively, these products could offset 37 million tonnes of CO2, representing about 14% of Thailand’s total CO2 emissions, contributing significantly to the country’s Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) target of 20-30% greenhouse gas emissions reduction. Conclusion Transitioning to microalgae-based products could transform the aquaculture, energy, and agricultural sectors, potentially supporting the national climate change mitigation goals, if implemented.

                There is room on the inside. In this paper, we lay out a novel model of neuroplasticity in the form of a horizontal-vertical integration model of neural processing. The horizontal plane consists of a network of neurons connected by adaptive transmission links. This fits with standard computational neuroscience approaches. Each individual neuron also has a vertical dimension with internal parameters steering the external membrane-expressed parameters. These determine neural transmission. The vertical system consists of (a) external parameters at the membrane layer, divided into compartments (spines, boutons) (b) internal parameters in the sub-membrane zone and the cytoplasm with its protein signaling network and (c) core parameters in the nucleus for genetic and epigenetic information. In such models, each node (=neuron) in the horizontal network has its own internal memory. Neural transmission and information storage are systematically separated. This is an important conceptual advance over synaptic weight models. We discuss the membrane-based (external) filtering and selection of outside signals for processing. Not every transmission event leaves a trace. We also illustrate the neuron-internal computing strategies from intracellular protein signaling to the nucleus as the core system. We want to show that the individual neuron has an important role in the computation of signals. Many assumptions derived from the synaptic weight adjustment hypothesis of memory may not hold in a real brain. We present the neuron as a self-programming device, rather than passively determined by ongoing input. We believe a new approach to neural modeling will benefit the third wave of AI. Ultimately we strive to build a flexible memory system that processes facts and events automatically.

Single-cell spatial omics analysis requires consideration of biological functions and mechanisms in a microenvironment. However, microenvironment analysis using bioinformatic methods is limited by the need to detect histological morphology and extend it to the surrounding area. In this study, we developed SpatialKNifeY (SKNY), an image-processing-based toolkit that detects spatial domains that potentially reflect histology and extends these domains to the microenvironment. Using spatial transcriptomic data from breast cancer, we applied the SKNY algorithm to identify tumor spatial domains, followed by clustering of the domains, trajectory estimation, and spatial extension to the tumor microenvironment (TME). The results of the trajectory estimation were consistent with the known mechanisms of cancer progression. We observed tumor vascularization and immunodeficiency at mid- and late-stage progression in TME. Furthermore, we applied the SKNY to integrate and cluster the spatial domains of 14 patients with metastatic colorectal cancer, and the clusters were divided based on the TME characteristics. In conclusion, the SKNY facilitates the determination of the functions and mechanisms in the microenvironment and cataloguing of the features.

                <p>by Laura M. Gunsalus, Michael J. Keiser, Katherine S. Pollard</p>

The investigation of chromatin organization in single cells holds great promise for identifying causal relationships between genome structure and function. However, analysis of single-molecule data is hampered by extreme yet inherent heterogeneity, making it challenging to determine the contributions of individual chromatin fibers to bulk trends. To address this challenge, we propose ChromaFactor, a novel computational approach based on non-negative matrix factorization that deconvolves single-molecule chromatin organization datasets into their most salient primary components. ChromaFactor provides the ability to identify trends accounting for the maximum variance in the dataset while simultaneously describing the contribution of individual molecules to each component. Applying our approach to two single-molecule imaging datasets across different genomic scales, we find that these primary components demonstrate significant correlation with key functional phenotypes, including active transcription, enhancer-promoter distance, and genomic compartment. Also, we find that some bulk trends exist at the single-cell level, but only in a small fraction of cells, suggesting that critical changes in genome organization may be driven by specific rare subpopulations rather than occurring uniformly across all cells. ChromaFactor offers a robust tool for understanding the complex interplay between chromatin structure and function on individual DNA molecules, pinpointing which subpopulations drive functional changes and fostering new insights into cellular heterogeneity and its implications for bulk genomic phenomena.

                <p>by Nicolas Banholzer, Keren Middelkoop, Juane Leukes, Ernest Weingartner, Remo Schmutz, Kathrin Zürcher, Matthias Egger, Robin Wood, Lukas Fenner</p>

The risk of <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb)</i> transmission can be high in crowded clinics. We developed a spatiotemporal model of airborne <i>Mtb</i> transmission based on the Wells-Riley equation. We collected environmental, clinical and person-tracking data in a South African clinic during COVID-19, when community or surgical masks were compulsory and ventilation was increased. We matched person movements with clinical records to identify the spatiotemporal location of infectious TB patients. We modeled the concentration of infectious doses (quanta) and estimated the individual risk of infection. Over five days, video sensors tracked 1,438 clinic attendees. CO<sup>2</sup> levels were low (median 431 ppm, IQR 406 ppm–458 ppm); the quanta concentration was higher in the morning than in the afternoon, and highest in the waiting room. The estimated risk of infection per clinic attendee was 0.05% (80%-credible interval (CrI) 0.01%–0.06%). It increased with the number of close contacts with infectious patients and the time spent in the clinic, and was 1.3-fold (95%-CrI 1.2–1.4) higher in scenarios without mask use and 2.1-fold (95%-CrI 0.9–5.0) higher with pre-pandemic ventilation rates, emphasizing the importance of ventilation. Spatiotemporal modeling can identify high-risk areas and evaluate the impact of infection control measures in clinics.

                <p>by Rachel Russell, Nik J Cunniffe</p>

The resources available for managing disease epidemics – whether in animals, plants or humans – are limited by a range of practical and financial constraints. Optimal control has been widely explored for optimising allocation of these resources to maximise their impact. The most common approach assumes a deterministic, continuous model to approximate the epidemic dynamics. However, real systems are stochastic and so a range of outcomes are possible for any given epidemic situation. The deterministic models are also known to be poor approximations in cases where the number of infected hosts is low – either globally or within a subset of the population – and these cases are highly relevant in the context of control. Hence, this work explores the effectiveness of disease management strategies derived using optimal control theory when applied to a more realistic, stochastic form of disease model. We demonstrate that the deterministic optimal control solutions are not optimal in cases where the disease is eradicated or close to eradication. The range of potential outcomes in the stochastic models means that optimising the deterministic case will not reliably eradicate disease – the required rate of control is higher than the deterministic optimal control would predict. Using Model Predictive Control, in which the optimisation is performed repeatedly as the system evolves to correct for deviations from the optimal control predictions, improves performance but the level of control calculated at each repeated optimisation is still insufficient. To demonstrate this, we present several simple heuristics to allocate control resources across different locations which can outperform the strategies calculated by MPC when the control budget is sufficient for eradication. Our illustration uses examples based on simulation of the spatial spread of plant disease but similar issues would be expected in any deterministic model where infection is driven close to zero.

Once a suitable reference sequence has been generated, intra-species variation is often assessed by re-sequencing. Variant calling processes can reveal all differences between strains, accessions, genotypes, or individuals. These variants can be enriched with predictions about their functional implications based on available structural annotations, i.e., gene models. Although these functional impact predictions on a per-variant basis are often accurate, some challenging cases require the simultaneous incorporation of multiple adjacent variants into this prediction process. Examples include neighboring variants which modify each other’s functional impact. The Neighborhood-Aware Variant Impact Predictor (NAVIP) considers all variants within a given protein coding sequence when predicting the effect. As a proof of concept, variants between the <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> accessions Columbia-0 and Niederzenz-1 were annotated. NAVIP is freely available on GitHub (https://github.com/bpucker/NAVIP) and accessible through a web server (https://pbb-tools.de).

                <p>by Xueda Shen, Aaron Rumack, Bryan Wilder, Ryan J Tibshirani</p>

We propose, implement, and evaluate a method for nowcasting the daily number of new COVID-19 hospitalizations, at the level of individual US states, based on de-identified, aggregated medical insurance claims data. Our analysis proceeds under a hypothetical scenario in which, during the Delta wave, states only report data on the first day of each month, and on this day, report COVID-19 hospitalization counts for each day in the previous month. In this hypothetical scenario (just as in reality), medical insurance claims data continues to be available daily. At the beginning of each month, we train a regression model, using all data available thus far, to predict hospitalization counts from medical insurance claims. We then use this model to nowcast the (unseen) values of COVID-19 hospitalization counts from medical insurance claims, at each day in the following month. Our analysis uses properly-versioned data, which would have been available in real-time at the time predictions are produced (instead of using data that would have only been available in hindsight). In spite of the difficulties inherent to real-time estimation (e.g., latency and backfill) and the complex dynamics behind COVID-19 hospitalizations themselves, we find altogether that medical insurance claims can be an accurate predictor of hospitalization reports, with mean absolute errors typically around 0.4 hospitalizations per 100,000 people, i.e., proportion of variance explained around 75%. Perhaps more importantly, we find that nowcasts made using medical insurance claims are able to qualitatively capture the dynamics (upswings and downswings) of hospitalization waves, which are key features that inform public health decision-making.

Background <p>Growing evidence supports the importance of characterizing the organizational patterns of various cellular constituents in the tumor microenvironment in precision oncology. Most existing data on immune cell infiltrates in tumors, which are based on immune cell counts or nearest neighbor-type analyses, have failed to fully capture the cellular organization and heterogeneity.</p> Methods <p>We introduce a computational algorithm, termed Tumor-Immune Partitioning and Clustering (TIPC), that jointly measures immune cell partitioning between tumor epithelial and stromal areas and immune cell clustering versus dispersion. As proof-of-principle, we applied TIPC to a prospective cohort incident tumor biobank containing 931 colorectal carcinoma cases. TIPC identified tumor subtypes with unique spatial patterns between tumor cells and T lymphocytes linked to certain molecular pathologic and prognostic features. T lymphocyte identification and phenotyping were achieved using multiplexed (multispectral) immunofluorescence. In a separate hepatocellular carcinoma cohort, we replaced the stromal component with specific immune cell types—CXCR3<sup>+</sup>CD68<sup>+</sup> or CD8+—to profile their spatial relationships with CXCL9<sup>+</sup>CD68<sup>+</sup> cells.</p> Results <p>Six unsupervised TIPC subtypes based on T lymphocyte distribution patterns were identified, comprising two cold and four hot subtypes. Three of the four hot subtypes were associated with significantly longer colorectal cancer (CRC)-specific survival compared to a reference cold subtype. Our analysis showed that variations in T-cell densities among the TIPC subtypes did not strictly correlate with prognostic benefits, underscoring the prognostic significance of immune cell spatial patterns. Additionally, TIPC revealed two spatially distinct and cell density-specific subtypes among microsatellite instability-high colorectal cancers, indicating its potential to upgrade tumor subtyping. TIPC was also applied to additional immune cell types, eosinophils and neutrophils, identified using morphology and supervised machine learning; here two tumor subtypes with similarly low densities, namely ‘cold, tumor-rich’ and ‘cold, stroma-rich’, exhibited differential prognostic associations. Lastly, we validated our methods and results using The Cancer Genome Atlas colon and rectal adenocarcinoma data (n = 570). Moreover, applying TIPC to hepatocellular carcinoma cases (n = 27) highlighted critical cell interactions like CXCL9-CXCR3 and CXCL9-CD8.</p> Conclusions <p>Unsupervised discoveries of microgeometric tissue organizational patterns and novel tumor subtypes using the TIPC algorithm can deepen our understanding of the tumor immune microenvironment and likely inform precision cancer immunotherapy.</p>

                <p>by Caroline Vachias, Camille Tourlonias, Louis Grelée, Nathalie Gueguen, Yoan Renaud, Parvathy Venugopal, Graziella Richard, Pierre Pouchin, Emilie Brasset, Vincent Mirouse</p>

Gap junctions allow the exchange of small molecules between cells. How this function could be used to promote cell growth is not yet fully understood. During <i>Drosophila</i> ovarian follicle development, germ cells, which are surrounded by epithelial somatic cells, undergo massive growth. We found that this growth depends on gap junctions between these cell populations, with a requirement for Innexin4 and Innexin2, in the germ cells and the somatic cells, respectively. Translatomic analyses revealed that somatic cells express enzymes and transporters involved in amino acid metabolism that are absent in germ cells. Among them, we identified a putative amino acid transporter required for germline growth. Its ectopic expression in the germline can partially compensate for its absence or the one of Innexin2 in somatic cells. Moreover, affecting either gap junctions or the import of some amino acids in somatic cells induces P-bodies in the germ cells, a feature usually associated with an arrest of translation. Finally, in somatic cells, innexin2 expression and gap junction assembly are regulated by the insulin receptor/PI3K kinase pathway, linking the growth of the two tissues. Overall, these results support the view that metabolic transfer through gap junction promotes cell growth and illustrate how such a mechanism can be integrated into a developmental program, coupling growth control by extrinsic systemic signals with the intrinsic coordination between cell populations.

                <p>by P. Githure M’Angale, Adrienne Lemieux, Yumeng Liu, Shuhao Wang, Max Zinter, Gimena Alegre, Alfred Simkin, Vivian Budnik, Brian A. Kelch, Travis Thomson</p>

Transposons are parasitic genome elements that can also serve as raw material for the evolution of new cellular functions. However, how retrotransposons are selected and domesticated by host organisms to modulate synaptic plasticity remains largely unknown. Here, we show that the Ty1 retrotransposon <i>Copia</i> forms virus-like capsids in vivo and transfers between cells. <i>Copia</i> is enriched at the <i>Drosophila</i> neuromuscular junction (NMJ) and transported across synapses, and disrupting its expression promotes both synapse development and structural synaptic plasticity. We show that proper synaptic plasticity is maintained in <i>Drosophila</i> by the balance of <i>Copia</i> and the <i>Arc1</i> (activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein) homolog. High-resolution cryogenic-electron microscopy imaging shows that the structure of the Copia capsid has a large capacity and pores like retroviruses but is distinct from domesticated capsids such as dArc1. Our results suggest a fully functional transposon mediates synaptic plasticity, possibly representing an early stage of domestication of a retrotransposon.

                <p>by Lijun Dai, Jiannan Wang, Lanxia Meng, Xingyu Zhang, Tingting Xiao, Min Deng, Guiqin Chen, Jing Xiong, Wei Ke, Zhengyuan Hong, Lihong Bu, Zhentao Zhang</p>

Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by the death of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra and the formation of Lewy bodies that are composed of aggregated α-synuclein (α-Syn). However, the factors that regulate α-Syn pathology and nigrostriatal dopaminergic degeneration remain poorly understood. Previous studies demonstrate cholesterol 24-hydroxylase (CYP46A1) increases the risk for PD. Moreover, 24-hydroxycholesterol (24-OHC), a brain-specific oxysterol that is catalyzed by CYP46A1, is elevated in the cerebrospinal fluid of PD patients. Herein, we show that the levels of CYP46A1 and 24-OHC are elevated in PD patients and increase with age in a mouse model. Overexpression of CYP46A1 intensifies α-Syn pathology, whereas genetic removal of CYP46A1 attenuates α-Syn neurotoxicity and nigrostriatal dopaminergic degeneration in the brain. Moreover, supplementation with exogenous 24-OHC exacerbates the mitochondrial dysfunction induced by α-Syn fibrils. Intracerebral injection of 24-OHC enhances the spread of α-Syn pathology and dopaminergic neurodegeneration via elevated X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1) and lymphocyte-activation gene 3 (LAG3) levels. Thus, elevated CYP46A1 and 24-OHC promote neurotoxicity and the spread of α-Syn via the XBP1–LAG3 axis. Strategies aimed at inhibiting the CYP46A1-24-OHC axis and LAG3 could hold promise as disease-modifying therapies for PD.

                Background Staphylococcus hyicus is a zoonotic pathogen primarily associated with animal infections. Human infections are exceedingly rare, with only six cases documented in the literature. The pathogen’s role in chronic osteomyelitis of long bones has not been previously reported, presenting unique diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. Case Report We report the first case of chronic osteomyelitis of long bones caused by methicillin-resistant S. hyicus in a 34-year-old male farmer with a history of recurrent osteomyelitis following trauma and livestock exposure. The patient presented with purulent discharge from two fistulae on the medial aspect of the right thigh. Imaging studies revealed bony sequestration, periosteal reaction, and multiple fistulous tracts consistent with Cierny-Mader stage III chronic osteomyelitis. Microbiological identification of coagulase-negative methicillin-resistant S. hyicus was achieved via culture and phenotypic analysis of aspirates from the fistulae and intraoperative samples, with confirmation via matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). A multidisciplinary treatment strategy was implemented, combining extensive surgical debridement and dead space management with a 24-week tailored antibiotic regimen. The regimen included intravenous teicoplanin and ciprofloxacin for 14 days, followed by oral ciprofloxacin and cotrimoxazole. The patient achieved sustained remission with no recurrence at 2.5 years of follow-up. Conclusion This case underscores the zoonotic potential of S. hyicus and highlights its capacity to cause severe, persistent infections in humans, particularly in individuals with occupational or environmental exposure to livestock. Advanced diagnostic techniques such as MALDI-TOF MS are essential for accurate identification, mitigating the risk of misdiagnosis due to phenotypic similarities with other staphylococcal species. Clinicians should consider S. hyicus in the differential diagnosis of chronic osteomyelitis in patients with relevant exposure histories to enable timely and targeted therapeutic interventions.

                The information systems for the Maternal and Perinatal Death Surveillance and Response (MPDSR) program have been digitalized in Bangladesh since 2014. This study aimed to investigate the availability of information systems for measuring the status of an MPDSR program and the planning process and actions developed based on real-time information. This study explored innovative information systems designed to easily monitor and measure the impact of health programs. The study included both the primary and secondary data. Key informant interviews were conducted to explore the enablers and strengths of information systems. Secondary data were collected from government websites and approved MPDSR action plans. This study highlights the potential and challenges of governmental health information systems in notifying maternal and neonatal deaths. The study reveals that the existing death notification rates are not up to national standards. It is encouraging to see health managers develop action plans and address this issue. The MPDSR information system serves as an essential tool for health managers, enabling them to assess variations in maternal and perinatal mortality rates while facilitating the development of interventions tailored to local needs. However, several obstacles must be addressed, such as insufficient data, lack of monitoring, and irregularities in MPDSR review meetings. By finding ways to overcome these challenges, we can unlock the full potential of MPDSR and improve maternal and neonatal health outcomes. The success of an MPDSR program relies on how the information is utilized to take action and measure the outcome. Advanced information systems, such as health dashboards, scorecards, and administrative data, can play a vital role in measuring the progress and impact of a program. The primary challenge lies in capturing all deaths, including their causes, and having the capacity to analyze the data effectively to develop action plans for health managers.

                Kucharski et al. identify a new signaling pathway in mitosis whereby Aurora kinase A phosphorylates BOD1L1 to increase protein phosphatase activity toward kinetochore substrates to facilitate high mitotic fidelity. This pathway provides the mechanism for adaptive resistance in cancer cells to an agonist of microtubule depolymerase.

                Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is an autoimmune disorder characterized by CD4+ T cell accumulation in synovial fluid (SF). Mocholi et al. identify glycolysis as key player in driving disease-specific H3K27 acetylation and transcription in JIA CD4+ T cells. Targeting glycolysis or PDH reverses JIA-associated gene expression changes, offering therapeutic potential.

                Goodman et al. demonstrate that adipose tissue from mice with overfeeding-induced obesity has a secreted proteome distinct from equally obese ad libitum-fed mice. They additionally find that fat from overfed mice releases intact mitochondria, which are enriched in lipogenic enzymes, suggesting the preferential release of mitochondrial subpopulations.

                Hainzl et al. structurally explain the mechanism of promiscuous (sequence-independent) inhibition of Listeria virulence activator PrfA by environmental oligopeptides. Parallel and antiparallel β sheet-like interactions mediate nonspecific peptide docking at the binding site of the PrfA-activating cofactor, glutathione (GSH). Side-chain contacts afford inhibitory selectivity for peptides containing two adjacent hydrophobic residues.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/104233">Mechanisms of PP2A-Ankle2 dependent nuclear reassembly after mitosis</a></h4>

              
                In animals, mitosis involves the breakdown of the nucleus. The reassembly of a nucleus after mitosis requires the reformation of the nuclear envelope around a single mass of chromosomes. This process requires Ankle2 (also known as LEM4 in humans) which interacts with PP2A and promotes the function of the Barrier-to-Autointegration Factor (BAF). Upon dephosphorylation, BAF dimers cross-bridge chromosomes and bind lamins and transmembrane proteins of the reassembling nuclear envelope. How Ankle2 functions in mitosis is incompletely understood. Using a combination of approaches in <i>Drosophila</i>, along with structural modeling, we provide several lines of evidence that suggest that Ankle2 is a regulatory subunit of PP2A, explaining how it promotes BAF dephosphorylation. In addition, we discovered that Ankle2 interacts with the endoplasmic reticulum protein Vap33, which is required for Ankle2 localization at the reassembling nuclear envelope during telophase. We identified the interaction sites of PP2A and Vap33 on Ankle2. Through genetic rescue experiments, we show that the Ankle2/PP2A interaction is essential for the function of Ankle2 in nuclear reassembly and that the Ankle2/Vap33 interaction also promotes this process. Our study sheds light on the molecular mechanisms of post-mitotic nuclear reassembly and suggests that the endoplasmic reticulum is not merely a source of membranes in the process, but also provides localized enzymatic activity.

                Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a respiratory illness caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that displays great variability in clinical phenotype. Many factors have been described to be correlated with its severity, and microbiota could play a key role in the infection, progression, and outcome of the disease. SARS-CoV-2 infection has been associated with nasopharyngeal and gut dysbiosis and higher abundance of opportunistic pathogens. To identify new prognostic markers for the disease, a multicentre prospective observational cohort study was carried out in COVID-19 patients divided into three cohorts based on symptomatology: mild (n = 24), moderate (n = 51), and severe/critical (n = 31). Faecal and nasopharyngeal samples were taken, and the microbiota was analysed. Linear discriminant analysis identified <i>Mycoplasma salivarium</i>, <i>Prevotella dentalis</i>, and <i>Haemophilus parainfluenzae</i> as biomarkers of severe COVID-19 in nasopharyngeal microbiota, while <i>Prevotella bivia</i> and <i>Prevotella timonensis</i> were defined in faecal microbiota. Additionally, a connection between faecal and nasopharyngeal microbiota was identified, with a significant ratio between <i>P. timonensis</i> (faeces) and <i>P. dentalis</i> and <i>M. salivarium</i> (nasopharyngeal) abundances found in critically ill patients. This ratio could serve as a novel prognostic tool for identifying severe COVID-19 cases.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98522">An adaptable, reusable, and light implant for chronic Neuropixels probes</a></h4>

              
                Electrophysiology has proven invaluable to record neural activity, and the development of Neuropixels probes dramatically increased the number of recorded neurons. These probes are often implanted acutely, but acute recordings cannot be performed in freely moving animals and the recorded neurons cannot be tracked across days. To study key behaviors such as navigation, learning, and memory formation, the probes must be implanted chronically. An ideal chronic implant should (1) allow stable recordings of neurons for weeks; (2) allow reuse of the probes after explantation; (3) be light enough for use in mice. Here, we present the ‘Apollo Implant’, an open-source and editable device that meets these criteria and accommodates up to two Neuropixels 1.0 or 2.0 probes. The implant comprises a ‘payload’ module which is attached to the probe and is recoverable, and a ‘docking’ module which is cemented to the skull. The design is adjustable, making it easy to change the distance between probes, the angle of insertion, and the depth of insertion. We tested the implant across eight labs in head-fixed mice, freely moving mice, and freely moving rats. The number of neurons recorded across days was stable, even after repeated implantations of the same probe. The Apollo implant provides an inexpensive, lightweight, and flexible solution for reusable chronic Neuropixels recordings.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93099">Wide transition-state ensemble as key component for enzyme catalysis</a></h4>

              
                Transition-state (TS) theory has provided the theoretical framework to explain the enormous rate accelerations of chemical reactions by enzymes. Given that proteins display large ensembles of conformations, unique TSs would pose a huge entropic bottleneck for enzyme catalysis. To shed light on this question, we studied the nature of the enzymatic TS for the phosphoryl-transfer step in adenylate kinase by quantum-mechanics/molecular-mechanics calculations. We find a structurally wide set of energetically equivalent configurations that lie along the reaction coordinate and hence a broad transition-state ensemble (TSE). A conformationally delocalized ensemble, including asymmetric TSs, is rooted in the macroscopic nature of the enzyme. The computational results are buttressed by enzyme kinetics experiments that confirm the decrease of the entropy of activation predicted from such wide TSE. TSEs as a key for efficient enzyme catalysis further boosts a unifying concept for protein folding and conformational transitions underlying protein function.

                Most visual tasks involve looking for specific object features. But we also often perform property-based tasks where we look for specific property in an image, such as finding an odd item, deciding if two items are same, or if an object has symmetry. How do we solve such tasks? These tasks do not fit into standard models of decision making because their underlying feature space and decision process is unclear. Using well-known principles governing multiple object representations, we show that displays with repeating elements can be distinguished from heterogeneous displays using a property we define as visual homogeneity. In behavior, visual homogeneity predicted response times on visual search, same-different and symmetry tasks. Brain imaging during visual search and symmetry tasks revealed that visual homogeneity was localized to a region in the object-selective cortex. Thus, property-based visual tasks are solved in a localized region in the brain by computing visual homogeneity.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97682">Multiplexed assays of human disease-relevant mutations reveal UTR dinucleotide composition as a major determinant of RNA stability</a></h4>

              
                Untranslated regions (UTRs) contain crucial regulatory elements for RNA stability, translation and localization, so their integrity is indispensable for gene expression. Approximately 3.7% of genetic variants associated with diseases occur in UTRs, yet a comprehensive understanding of UTR variant functions remains limited due to inefficient experimental and computational assessment methods. To systematically evaluate the effects of UTR variants on RNA stability, we established a massively parallel reporter assay on 6555 UTR variants reported in human disease databases. We examined the RNA degradation patterns mediated by the UTR library in two cell lines, and then applied LASSO regression to model the influential regulators of RNA stability. We found that UA dinucleotides and UA-rich motifs are the most prominent destabilizing element. Gain of UA dinucleotide outlined mutant UTRs with reduced stability. Studies on endogenous transcripts indicate that high UA-dinucleotide ratios in UTRs promote RNA degradation. Conversely, elevated GC content and protein binding on UA dinucleotides protect high-UA RNA from degradation. Further analysis reveals polarized roles of UA-dinucleotide-binding proteins in RNA protection and degradation. Furthermore, the UA-dinucleotide ratio of both UTRs is a common characteristic of genes in innate immune response pathways, implying a coordinated stability regulation through UTRs at the transcriptomic level. We also demonstrate that stability-altering UTRs are associated with changes in biobank-based health indices, underscoring the importance of precise UTR regulation for wellness. Our study highlights the importance of RNA stability regulation through UTR primary sequences, paving the way for further exploration of their implications in gene networks and precision medicine.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/102409">The conserved ATPase PCH-2 controls the number and distribution of crossovers by antagonizing their formation in Caenorhabditis elegans</a></h4>

              
                Meiotic crossover recombination is essential for both accurate chromosome segregation and the generation of new haplotypes for natural selection to act upon. This requirement is known as crossover assurance and is one example of crossover control. While the conserved role of the ATPase, PCH-2, during meiotic prophase has been enigmatic, a universal phenotype when <i>pch-2</i> or its orthologs are mutated is a change in the number and distribution of meiotic crossovers. Here, we show that PCH-2 controls the number and distribution of crossovers by antagonizing their formation. This antagonism produces different effects at different stages of meiotic prophase: early in meiotic prophase, PCH-2 prevents double-strand breaks from becoming crossover-eligible intermediates, limiting crossover formation at sites of initial double-strand break formation and homolog interactions. Later in meiotic prophase, PCH-2 winnows the number of crossover-eligible intermediates, contributing to the designation of crossovers and ultimately, crossover assurance. We also demonstrate that PCH-2 accomplishes this regulation through the meiotic HORMAD, HIM-3. Our data strongly support a model in which PCH-2’s conserved role is to remodel meiotic HORMADs throughout meiotic prophase to destabilize crossover-eligible precursors and coordinate meiotic recombination with synapsis, ensuring the progressive implementation of meiotic recombination and explaining its function in the pachytene checkpoint and crossover control.

">Perceptual decision-making during whisker-guided navigation causally depends on a single cortical barrel column</a></h4>

              
                Perceptually driven behavioral choices ae thought to develop gradually from sensation to perception in somatosensory cortex to guide decision-making in higher order cortical areas. Primary somatosensory cortex wS1 of rodents related to their mystacial whiskers has been a model system to study this information flow. However, the role of wS1 in this process is often debated based on controversial results of loss-of-function behavioral experiments that often require prolonged training and movement restraints. Here, to elucidate the role of wS1 in decision-making, we develop an ethological whisker-guided virtual reality (VR) paradigm that closely mimics natural navigation in underground burrows. Untrained mice are navigating at high speed the left and right turns by sensing VR walls with just a pair of their C2 whiskers. We inactivate less than 200 neurons in layer 4 of C2 barrel that results in loss of ability to produce turns contralateral to the lesion. Using probabilistic model of collision avoidance in the presence of noise and uncertainties we hypothesize that wS1 is involved in a feedback control loop that requires continuous updates and predictions to infer the optimal path for collision avoidance.

">Quantifying state-dependent control properties of brain dynamics from perturbation responses</a></h4>

              
                The brain can be conceptualized as a control system facilitating transitions between states, such as from rest to motor activity. Applying network control theory to measurements of brain signals enables characterization of brain dynamics through control properties, including controllability. However, most prior studies that have applied network control theory have evaluated brain dynamics under unperturbed conditions, neglecting the critical role of external perturbations in accurate system identification, which is a fundamental principle in control theory. The incorporation of perturbation inputs is therefore essential for precise characterization of brain dynamics. In this study, we combine a perturbation input paradigm with a network control theory framework and propose a novel method for estimating the controllability Gramian matrix in a simple, theoretically grounded manner. This method provides insights into brain dynamics, including overall controllability (quantified by the Gramian's eigenvalues) and specific controllable directions (represented by its eigenvectors). As a proof of concept, we applied our method to transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)-induced electroencephalographic (EEG) responses across four motor-related states and two resting states. We found that states such as open-eye rest, closed-eye rest, and motor-related states were more effectively differentiated using controllable directions than overall controllability. However, certain states, like motor execution and motor imagery, remained indistinguishable using these measures. These findings indicate that some brain states differ in their intrinsic control properties as dynamical systems, while others share similarities that make them less distinguishable. This study underscores the value of control theory-based analyses in quantitatively how intrinsic brain states shape the brain's responses to stimulation, providing deeper insights into the dynamic properties of these states. This methodology holds promise for diverse applications, including characterizing individual response variability and identifying conditions for optimal stimulation efficacy.

">Developmental gene expression patterns driving species-specific cortical features</a></h4>

              
                The cerebral cortex shows species-specific variations in size and organization, likely accounting for distinct behavioral abilities. These structural differences may reflect evolutionary changes in the developmental expression of shared genes. To investigate this possibility, we compared cell-type-specific developmental gene expression across species in the developing mouse and human neocortex, and human cortical organoids, by developing a shared transcriptional reference framework. This identified genes with conserved/divergent expression patterns, providing a molecular foundation to interrogate species-specific cellular properties. Using this resource, we discovered that the transcription factor JUNB is expressed in human but not mouse progenitors. Through cell-typespecific gain- and loss-of-function experiments in mice and human organoids, we demonstrate that JUNB bidirectionally controls human cortical features, including progenitor proliferation rates, neuronal production timing, and total neuronal output. This reveals how cell-type-specific regulation of shared genes during development can drive species-specific cortical features, providing a framework for understanding the molecular basis of cortical evolution.

">Behavioural separation of face memory and face perception</a></h4>

              
                A long-standing debate in neuropsychology concerns whether perception and memory function as independent systems or interact to support cognition. To investigate this, we developed the Face Memory and Perception (FMP) task, a novel paradigm designed to systematically disentangle whether and how these processes interact under different conditions. Across four independent datasets with over 800 participants in total, we observed consistent evidence that face perception and working memory operate independently when task demands are low, but in more complex conditions, these processes interact. Notably, this interaction emerged only when the interference directly involved face-processing mechanisms. This interaction did not arise from a general increase in cognitive load but rather was driven by a shift from holistic to feature-based face processing as a result of maintenance-disrupting interference. These results underscore both the fundamental independence of perception and working memory while also highlighting conditions under which they interact, contributing to a richer understanding of face processing.

">A biophysical model of synaptic tagging-and-capture based on actin dynamics</a></h4>

              
                According to the synaptic tagging-and-capture hypothesis, long-lasting (late-phase) plasticity requires the synthesis of plasticity-related proteins and the setting of a synaptic tag at the stimulated synapse. It has been hypothesized that this tag is implemented by the complex interplay between dendritic spine geometry and the scaffolding protein actin. To test this, we propose a biophysically-grounded model of late-phase synaptic plasticity considering dynamic and stable actin pools and the size of the PSD in the synapse. In our model, the tag corresponds to the imbalance between the spine volume determined by actin and the volume that would be expected for the current PSD size. We demonstrate the viability of the proposed model by showing that it can account for the experimentally observed synaptic plasticity induced by stimulation of a single synapse, as well as tag-resetting protocols, and heterosynaptic plasticity protocols involving two synapses. Moreover, for the interaction of two consecutive stimuli at the same synapse within around up to an hour, plastic changes stack non-linearly, reminiscent of the spacing effect found in learning and memory studies. In summary, our model both matches experiments and extrapolates well to a wide range of stimulation protocols. Thus, it will be ideally suited to serve as a basis to predict the plasticity effects emerging from the complex activity patterns in recurrent networks.

">Neural and Behavioral Adaptation to Listening with a Unilateral Cochlear Implant (CI)</a></h4>

              
                The human auditory system must encode sounds and separate relevant input from noise. Hearing loss hurts both processes, but profound hearing loss and deafness can be treated with a Cochlear Implant (CI). Here, we probe the human brains adaptation to electrical hearing with a CI in unilaterally implanted CI users with normal or aided contralateral hearing, in the first and seventh month after CI activation. In addition to clinical measures of speech comprehension, electroencephalography (EEG) recordings during passive listening to amplitude-modulated (AM) sounds and an active spatial listening task with competing talkers were analyzed. We demonstrate that, first, adaptation to hearing with a CI is accompanied by decreasing cortical overrepresentation and increasing auditory temporal coding fidelity: After six month of CI use, auditory phase-locking during passive listening relatively decreased for 4-Hz AM sounds but increased for 40-Hz AM sounds. Second, strongest benefits of listening with the CI (i.e., CI on vs. off) in the spatial-listening task occurred when the CI ear was primarily exposed to target sound. Here, the power of lateralized alpha oscillations (~10 Hz) served as a robust signature of spatial attention, independent of time (1st vs 7th month) and listening modality (with vs. without CI). Stronger lateralized alpha modulation in the hemisphere contralateral to the non-implanted ear suggests asymmetrical allocation of auditory spatial attention, operating preferentially on the input to the non-implanted ear. These findings highlight CI-related plasticity in auditory perception and a persistent attentional bias toward the non-implanted ear, emphasizing the need to consider bilateral auditory input in CI rehabilitation.

">Reduced Fast Periodic Visual Stimulation Oddball Responses to Threatening Faces Associated with Anxiety</a></h4>

              
                Facial expression processing is crucial for social communication and survival, with anxiety disorders often linked to alterations in attentional biases toward threat-related stimuli. While previous studies using event-related potentials (ERPs) have yielded conflicting findings regarding threat sensitivity in anxiety, Fast Periodic Visual Stimulation (FPVS) offers a high signal-to-noise, implicit alternative for assessing emotion processing. This study utilized FPVS to investigate neural responses to facial expressions in individuals with anxiety compared to healthy controls. Forty-one adults participated, with 17 classified into the anxiety group based on self-reported diagnosis or PROMIS Anxiety scores. EEG responses were recorded while participants viewed sequences of neutral faces interspersed with emotional oddball expressions (angry, fearful, happy, and sad). Results revealed robust individual- and group-level neural responses, with significantly reduced summed baseline-corrected amplitudes (BCA) in central-parietal regions for angry and happy faces in the anxiety group. These findings suggest that anxious individuals exhibit attenuated discrimination of emotional expressions, particularly in higher-order processing regions, which may reflect cognitive avoidance of threat or general disengagement from emotional stimuli. The study highlights the potential of FPVS as a clinically relevant tool for objectively assessing emotion processing in anxiety and related disorders.

">Morphological and functional alteration of light perception circuits in AD patients</a></h4>

              
                Disruption of sleep and circadian rhythms is one of the earliest symptoms of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Circadian entrainment and the modulation of alertness are non-visual responses to light driven by intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs). However, little is known about ipRGCs in the context of AD. To explore structural and functional changes of ipRGCs and ipRGC circuits, we analyzed the retinas and brains of 13 elderly patients (9 males, 4 females, aged 69-103) ranging from normal to neuropathologically defined AD. We performed extracellular electrophysiological recordings on freshly harvested retinas using multi-electrode arrays. While rod and cone responses were moderately affected, we found a decreased density of ipRGCs in donors with advanced AD pathology, which was confirmed by immunostaining. The remaining ipRGCs displayed morphological alterations as well as abnormal responses to light, including hyperexcitability. These changes appeared to be subtype-specific and correlated with the advancement of the disease. Altered ipRGCs circuits and function could contribute to the disruption of sleep and circadian rhythms reported in AD patients. The measurement of ipRGC-dependent responses to light could constitute a promising tool to predict or monitor pathological changes in the brain.

">Path integration impairments reveal early cognitive changes in Subjective Cognitive Decline</a></h4>

              
                Path integration, the ability to track one's position using self-motion cues, is critically dependent on the grid cell network in the entorhinal cortex, a region vulnerable to early Alzheimer's disease pathology. In this study, we examined path integration performance in individuals with subjective cognitive decline (SCD), a group at increased risk for Alzheimer's disease, and healthy controls using an immersive virtual reality task. We developed a Bayesian computational model to decompose path integration errors into distinct components. SCD participants exhibited significantly higher path integration error, primarily driven by increased memory leak, while other modelling-derived error sources, such as velocity gain, sensory and reporting noise, remained comparable across groups. Our findings suggest that path integration deficits, specifically memory leak, may serve as an early marker of neurodegeneration in SCD and highlight the potential of self-motion-based navigation tasks for detecting pre-symptomatic Alzheimer's disease-related cognitive changes.

">Evidence of functional connectivity disruptions between auditory and non-auditory regions in adolescents living with HIV</a></h4>

              
                Children with perinatally acquired HIV (CPHIV) exhibit hearing impairments and language delays despite combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). Efficient sound processing depends on the peripheral and central auditory systems (PAS, CAS), yet studies of HIV's effects have mainly focused on the PAS. Language processing also relies on interactions between CAS and non-auditory brain regions. This study used resting-state fMRI to map functional connectivity (FC) in 11-year-old CPHIV, focusing on CAS and its links to non-auditory regions, within a Bayesian framework. Graph theory analyzed regional network properties, and relationships between FC and neurocognitive outcomes were examined. We hypothesized that CPHIV would show disrupted FC within the CAS and between CAS and non-auditory regions, altered network properties, and links between these changes and neurocognitive outcomes. Findings revealed lower FC in the primary auditory cortex (PAC) of CPHIV, with disrupted connections between CAS regions (including the PAC) and non-auditory regions such as the hippocampus, lingual gyrus, and basal ganglia. Network analysis showed reduced nodal degree and efficiency in CAS regions like the cochlear nucleus/superior olivary complex and inferior colliculus. In CPHIV, associations between middle temporal and superior frontal nodal efficiency and working memory (delayed recall) were absent. These findings highlight CAS FC alterations and network disruptions in CPHIV, linking them to hearing and language impairments. They offer insights into how HIV affects auditory and broader brain function in this population.

">No Disconnection Syndrome after Near-Complete Callosotomy</a></h4>

              
                Much of the sensory-motor processing in the human brain is lateralized to either hemisphere, with the corpus callosum integrating these distinct processes into a seemingly unified conscious experience. The corpus callosum is thought to be topographically organized, with different subregions along its anterior-to-posterior axis involved in integrating information across different sensory modalities and cognitive domains. In complete callosotomy patients, where the corpus callosum is fully severed, this integration is typically disrupted across these domains. But which types of inter-hemispheric integration can still be preserved with small posterior callosal remnants? We studied four callosotomy patients-three complete and one partial with approximately 1 cm of preserved splenium-using an array of lateralized visual, tactile, visuospatial, and language tasks. While complete callosotomy patients showed the expected behavioral disconnection effects-performing poorly on tasks requiring inter-hemispheric integration but well on intra-hemispheric ones-the partial callosotomy patient with a preserved portion of the splenium showed no disconnection effects across all tasks. The splenium is traditionally implicated in visual transfer, yet our findings show that minimal splenial preservation maintains functional integration across multiple perceptual and cognitive domains. This is at odds with the presumed topographical organization of the corpus callosum, suggesting a broader inter-hemispheric integrative capacity of the posterior callosal fibers. Structure-function relationships in brain networks are known to be complex and nonlinear-these findings provide novel insights into flexible structural mechanisms for inter-hemispheric communication enabling a variety of integrated behaviors.

">Long-term offspring loss in lactating rats: Neurobiological and emotional consequences in a novel animal model</a></h4>

              
                The maternal bond is a vital social connection that supports the survival and well-being of both the caregiver and offspring. Disruption of this bond, particularly following offspring loss, can result in profound trauma with long-lasting consequences. While considerable research has focused on the impact of maternal separation on offspring development, the biological effects of offspring loss on the mother remain largely unexplored. In this study, we examined the long-term effects of offspring loss on neuroplasticity, the oxytocin (OXT) and corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) systems, and stress-coping behaviors in Sprague-Dawley rat mothers. We compared mothers that experienced one day of motherhood followed by 19 days of offspring loss, mothers that were with their pups throughout the 20 days, and naive virgin rats. Our results reveal that mothers who lost their pups expressed increased oxytocin receptor binding and decreased dendritic spine density in limbic brain regions, with no changes in estrogen receptor  or calbindin cells. Additionally, separated mothers showed increased passive stress-coping behaviors in the forced swim test and elevated plasma corticosterone levels. Remarkably, the passive stress-coping behavior was rescued by central CRF receptor blockade but not by oxytocin treatment, suggesting that the CRF system plays a key role in the grieving process following offspring loss, and highlights the suitability of the rat model for studying maternal grief. This research provides insights into the complex neurobiology of grief, and suggests potential directions for future studies.

">Astrocytic contribution to sensory hypersensitivity in a mouse model of fragile X syndrome</a></h4>

              
                Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common form of inherited intellectual disability and a leading cause of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). FXS is caused by mutations in the fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein gene 1 (FMR1), which result in complete or partial loss of expression of its protein product, fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein (FMRP). Neuronal impairments in the absence of FMRP have been extensively characterized. However, much less is known about the impact that loss of FMRP has on the physiology and function of astrocytes and the implications for behavior. A common behavior exhibited by both FXS and ASD patients is hypersensitivity to sensory stimuli, but how astrocytes contribute to hypersensitivity in the context of FXS remains unknown. Using mice with astrocyte-specific reduction of Fmr1 (Fmr1 conditional KO (cKO)) and mice with astrocyte-specific expression of Fmr1 (Fmr1 cON), we demonstrated that reduction in astrocytic FMRP is sufficient but not necessary to confer susceptibility to audiogenic seizures, an indication of auditory hypersensitivity. In addition, reduction of astrocytic FMRP impacts neuronal activity, resulting in spontaneous seizures. Using a whisker stimulation assay, we found that reduction in astrocytic FMRP does not contribute to tactile hypersensitivity. Our results reveal that astrocytes lacking FMRP contribute to auditory hypersensitivity and spontaneous seizures.

">The Human Cerebello-Hippocampal Circuit Across Adulthood</a></h4>

              
                Direct communication between the hippocampus and cerebellum has been shown via coactivation and synchronized neuronal oscillations in animal models. Further, this novel cerebello-hippocampal circuit may be impacted by sex steroid hormones. The cerebellum and hippocampus are dense with estradiol and progesterone receptors relative to other brain regions. Females experience up to a 90% decrease in ovarian estradiol production after the menopausal transition. Postmenopausal women show lower cerebello-cortical and intracerebellar FC compared to reproductive aged females. Sex hormones are established modulators of both memory function and synaptic organization in the hippocampus in non-human animal studies. However, investigation of the cerebello-hippocampal (CB-HP) circuit has been limited to animal studies and small homogeneous samples of young adults as it relates to spatial navigation. Here, we investigate the CB-HP circuit in 138 adult humans (53% female) from 35-86 years of age, to define its FC patterns, and investigate its associations with behavior, hormone levels, and sex differences therein. We established robust FC patterns between the CB and HP in this sample. We predicted and found negative relationships between age and CB-HP FC. As expected, estradiol levels exhibited positive relationships with CB-HP. We found lower CB-HP FC with higher levels of progesterone. We provide the first characterization of the CB-HP circuit across middle and older adulthood and demonstrate that connectivity is sensitive to sex steroid hormone levels. This work provides the first clear CB-HP circuit mapping in the human brain and serves as a foundation for future work in neurological and psychiatric diseases.

">Single-cell multiomics of neuronal activation reveals context-dependent genetic control of brain disorders</a></h4>

              
                Despite hundreds of genetic risk loci identified for neuropsychiatric disorders (NPD), most causal variants/genes remain unknown. A major hurdle is that disease risk variants may act in specific biological contexts, e.g., during neuronal activation, which is difficult to study in vivo at the population level. Here, we conducted a single-cell multiomics study of neuronal activation (stimulation) in human iPSC-induced excitatory and inhibitory neurons from 100 donors, and uncovered abundant neuronal stimulation-specific causal variants/genes for NPD. We surveyed NPD-relevant transcriptomic and epigenomic landscape of neuronal activation and identified thousands of genetic variants associated with activity-dependent gene expression (i.e., eQTL) and chromatin accessibility (i.e., caQTL). These caQTL explained considerably larger proportions of NPD heritability than the eQTL. Integrating the multiomic data with GWAS further revealed NPD risk variants/genes whose effects were only detected upon stimulation. Interestingly, multiple lines of evidence support a role of activity-dependent cholesterol metabolism in NPD. Our work highlights the power of cell stimulation to reveal context-dependent "hidden"genetic effects.

">Timing matters: modeling the effects of gestational cannabis exposure on social behavior and microglia in the developing amygdala</a></h4>

              
                Cannabis is the most frequently used illicit drug during pregnancy, with use steadily increasing in the United States as legalization and decriminalization expand to more states. Many pregnant individuals use cannabis to reduce adverse symptoms of pregnancy, considering it to be less harmful than other pharmaceuticals or alcohol. The primary psychoactive component of cannabis, delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), acts on the endocannabinoid (eCB) system, yet whether it perturbs neural development of the fetus is poorly understood. Previously we have shown that androgen mediated eCB tone in the developing amygdala promotes microglial phagocytosis of newborn astrocytes which has enduring consequences on the neural circuits regulating sex differences in social behavior. Microglia are the resident immune cells of the brain and express both receptors of the eCB system, CB1R and CB2R, making them likely targets of modulation by THC. It is also plausible that exposure to THC at differing gestational timepoints can result in distinct outcomes, as is the case with alcohol exposure. To model human cannabis use during either late or early pregnancy, we exposed rodents to THC either directly during the early postnatal period via intraperitoneal (IP) injection or in utero during the prenatal period via dam IP injection respectively. Here we show that postnatal THC exposure results in sex specific changes in microglial phagocytosis during development as well as social behavior during the juvenile period. Interestingly prenatal exposure to THC resulted in inverse changes to phagocytosis and social behavior. These findings highlight the differential effects of THC exposure across gestation.

">Shared brain basis of aggression in clinical, forensic, and healthy samples: A meta-analysis</a></h4>

              
                Aggression, violence, and antisocial behaviour constitute a large-scale societal problem. Aggression is common in incarcerated offenders and psychiatric conditions, but also healthy and noninstitutionalized populations vary in violent and aggressive behaviour. The brain basis of aggression has been studied extensively in the past, but the similarities between criminal, pathological and everyday aggression in the brain remain elusive. We conducted an activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis of 406 neuroimaging studies with 28 968 subjects using structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), positron emission tomography (PET) and single photon emission tomography (SPECT). The included studies had either i) measured haemodynamic responses during aggression-related functional tasks, ii) compared the brain structure, molecular organization, or function between aggressive forensic and psychiatric populations and control groups, or iii) addressed the effects of trait aggression on brain structure or function. Aggression was consistently associated with altered function and structure in the amygdala, hippocampus, basal ganglia, anterior cingulate cortex, and the dorsolateral and orbitofrontal cortices. Functional coactivation analysis suggested that these regions are most consistently associated with emotional and reward function as well as their regulation. The results were comparable in healthy subjects as well as forensic and psychiatric populations. Our results show that aggression is linked with alterations in multiple neurocognitive systems forming a common network for aggressiveness. Particularly the neural systems implicated in reward, emotions and regulation were commonly associated with aggression. The established network is involved in the whole continuum of aggression from benign variations in healthy volunteers to forensic subjects and violent clinical populations, suggesting a common aggression network whose severe perturbations may be linked with criminal behaviour or pathological aggression.

	<p>Background/Objectives: Since high frequencies are susceptible to disruption in various types of hearing loss, a symptom which is common in people with tinnitus, the aim of the study was to investigate EEG cortical auditory evoked and P300 responses to both a high- and low frequency-centered oddball paradigm to begin to establish the most suitable cognitive physiologic testing conditions for those with both unimpaired hearing and those with hearing impairments. Methods: Cortical auditory evoked potential (CAEP) P1, N1, P2 and P300 (subtraction wave) peaks were identified in response to high- (standard: 6000 Hz, deviant: 8000 Hz) and low frequency (Standard: 375 Hz, Deviant: 500 Hz) oddball paradigms. Each paradigm was presented at various intensity levels. Latencies and amplitudes were then computed for each condition to assess the effects of frequency and intensity. Results: Stimulus intensity had no effect on either the high- or low frequency paradigms of P300 characteristics. In contrast, for the low frequency paradigm, intensity influenced the N1 latency and P2 amplitude, while for the high frequency paradigm intensity influenced P1 and P2 latency and P2 amplitude. Conclusions: Obligatory CAEP components responded more readily to stimulus frequency and intensity changes, and one possible consideration is that higher frequencies could play a role in the response characteristics exhibited by N1 (except for N1 amplitude) and P2, given their involvement in attentional processes linked to the detection of warning cues. P300 latency and amplitude were not influenced by such factors. These findings support the hypothesis that disentangling the cognitive from the more sensory-based response is possible, even in those with hearing loss, provided that the patient&amp;amp;rsquo;s hearing loss is considered when determining the presentation level. While the present study was performed in participants with unimpaired hearing, these data set up future studies investigating the effectiveness of using similar methods in hearing-impaired persons.</p>

                Background Surface modifications of titanium alloys used in dental implants can significantly change the implants’ micro and nano topography and composition. These alterations can lead to substantial improvements in mechanical properties, hydrophilicity, osseointegration, and antibacterial performance, as well as positively influencing osteoblast activity and bone formation processes. This paper investigates the effect of the combination of acid etching on titanium alloys’ surface morphology, roughness, and hydrophilicity. Methods A titanium alloy (Ti6Al4V) disc with a diameter of 12 mm and thickness of 2 mm was sandblasted using aluminum oxide Al2O3 by particle sizes 100 μm, 250 μm, and 500 μm and followed by acid etching. Acid etching was carried out on these samples using different combinations of acid, i.e., hydrofluoric acid (HF), hydrochloric acid (HCL), and sulfuric acid (H2SO4), with the same temperature and time exposure. All titanium surfaces were characterized using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) and contact profilometer. Results This study showed that the type of acid combination influenced the surface morphology and roughness profile. After sandblast and acid etching, the titanium alloy has roughness between 1.369 μm – 4.304 μm. There is no significant difference in surface roughness between using a combination of HF, HCL, H2SO4 and only the combination of HCL and H2SO4. Conclusions Titanium alloy has achieved the desired morphology and roughness after sandblasting with Al2O3 250 μm and acid-etching with HCL and H2SO4. Acid etching with a combination of HCL and H2SO4 at 120 degrees can produce micro-topography in a shorter duration.

                Background Death due to hanging is commonly seen. Sometime the ligature mark will be very prominent and in some cases it might not. In those cases, the post-mortem examination with its gross morphological findings and histopathological analysis, becomes significantly important. Objective: The objective of this study was to identify the patterns of epidemiological, gross morphological, and histopathological features in hanging cases. Methods The study was conducted on 46 cases of hanging and was carried out from February 2023 to June 2024. Their sociodemographic features were collected. Gross morphological analysis of the ligature mark and various measurements were taken. Later tissue from the ligature mark was sent for histopathological analysis. Statistical analysis was performed on the collected parameters. Results Significant male preponderance was observed in hanging cases. The maximum number of cases of hanging were observed in the fourth decade of life. Daily wage workers were the most significantly affected population. Depression was cited as the cause of suicide in most cases. Carotid intimal tears and injuries to bony and cartilaginous structures were present in smaller numbers. Vital reaction was observed in all 46 cases. Classification of wound vitality showed a correlation to known time since injury. Conclusion The results of the present study showed that socio-demographic factors play a significant role in the circumstances leading to suicidal deaths. Therefore, in reducing the burden of suicidal deaths, these factors must be addressed. To identify the cause of death as hanging analysis of various gross features and histopathology are very important and should be conducted carefully.

                Background Over the past three decades, Portugal has invested significantly in doctoral training. However, there is a lack of up-to-date information on the success of scholarship holders in obtaining the degree or on their subsequent career paths. Methods This study analysed four cohorts of scholarship holders funded by the Foundation for Science and Technology between 1995 and 2012. The professional situation at different points in time after the Ph.D. (5, 10, 15 and 20 years) was studied. Results The success rate for obtaining the degree was 88%, which is comparable to other European countries for doctorates completed with funding over a period of 3-4 years. The average time to obtain the degree was 5.06 years. The time to degree was influenced by the scientific field, the nationality of the scholarship holder, and the location of the institution awarding the degree (in Portugal or abroad). The gender or age range of the scholarship recipients did not influence the time required for graduation. The analysis of the career and sector of activity of these graduates at different points in time after obtaining the Ph.D. revealed that approximately 60% percent of the graduates were engaged in R&D activities at some point in their career paths, but this percentage diminished from the oldest to the most recent cohorts. In 2020, 63% of the graduates were engaged in R&D activities, and almost half were employed in higher education as teachers, researchers, or scholarship holders. Conclusions This study showed that there are still challenges to address concerning the integration of doctoral graduates into non-academic research positions. On the other hand, it has demonstrated an efficient use of public funds, with high success rates and a time to degree that is within the average of other European countries.

                Background Trade openness shows a positive impact on economic growth, supported by economic theory, and export diversification and economic complexity show a positive dynamic in trade openness in the world; however, a specificity is generated in South American countries. Therefore, the objective of the research is to analyse the macroeconomic determinants of trade openness in Latin American countries. Methods The research approach was quantitative and explanatory using panel data methodology from the databases of the World Bank, Harvard University and the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean for the period 2000-2020. Results The fixed effects panel data model showed that the variables that had a negative impact on trade openness were GDP, the economic complexity index and the logistic performance index, while the variables that had a positive impact were exports of high-tech products (a proxy for innovation), exports, imports, research and development expenditure and interregional trade in goods. Conclusions Therefore, during the analysis period of 2000-2020 in South America, based on the panel data analysis under fixed effects, a total of 8 countries had a negative impact on trade openness, and only the economies of Chile, French Guiana, and Brazil had a positive impact on trade openness; these economies are characterized by their better performance in the economic complexity index, their higher percentage of budget for research and development expenses, and their trade policies oriented towards the industrialization of their value-added products.

                Background Dentigerous cysts are benign, non-inflammatory odontogenic cysts that form over unerupted or partially erupted teeth. They are the second most common type of odontogenic cysts and can cause various complications if left untreated. Methods We report a rare case of bilateral dentigerous cysts in the mandible of a 13-year-old boy. Radiographic examination revealed two cysts on each mandibular side, associated with developing third molars and unerupted permanent second premolars. Histopathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of dentigerous cysts. Results The patient underwent surgical enucleation of all cysts and extraction of unerupted teeth under general anesthesia. The postoperative course was uneventful, with no recurrence observed over a 2-year follow-up period. Conclusions Dentigerous cysts are rare in children and even rarer in bilateral presentation. Early diagnosis and treatment are essential to prevent potential complications such as infection, tooth displacement, jaw fracture, or malignant transformation. This case illustrates the importance of radiographic examination and histopathological confirmation in the management of dentigerous cysts.

                Background “Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI)” is a heterogeneous group of inherited disorders involving collagen type I with a 10–30% incidence of bleeding diathesis placing these individuals at an increased risk of bleeding. Our study aims to ascertain the risk factors that increase the propensity of perioperative blood transfusions in pediatric population. Methods A single center retrospective observational study of patients aged <18 years undergoing orthopedic surgeries at our tertiary care hospital from January 2016 to August 2024 were included and each surgery was analyzed as a discrete event. Age, type of OI, number of osteotomies, and number of bones operated simultaneously were recorded. The fall in hemoglobin, requirement for blood transfusions and associated factors were analyzed. Results Amongst 53 individuals who underwent surgery, 141 procedures were analyzed. The mean age was 11.07± 5.29 years, majority (n=33;62.2%) were phenotypically type III OI, and 42/53 (79%) patients underwent multiple osteotomies. Significant hemoglobin fall was observed after surgery (p<0.001) and was considerable in patients undergoing various osteotomies (p=0.002). Older children showed a smaller drop in hemoglobin level. Patients with type III OI showed significant hemoglobin fall (1.82 ± 0.86 g/dL). The transfusion requirement was seen in 23 (16.3%) surgeries besides it was significant in those undergoing multiple osteotomies (p= <0.05). Conclusion Our study inferred that the fall in hemoglobin was significant postoperatively in OI patients and was associated with younger age, type III OI, and multiple osteotomies. Before performing orthopedic surgeries on patients with OI, surgeons might consider the latter risk factors to explore therapeutic options aimed at reducing hemorrhage and improving outcomes.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-659/v2?src=rss">Marital Bargaining and Assortative Mating on Fertility Preference : Evidence based on Cross-sectional Data in China [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background Decisions regarding child-bearing are among the most consequential ones within families, as child-rearing necessitates the active involvement of both partners. This dynamic suggests that individuals may seek partners with similar fertility preferences, leading to assortative mating based on these shared preferences. Data and Methods This study investigates second-child fertility decisions using data from the 2018 China Family Panel Studies and applies the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression. Furthermore, it examines assortative matching based on fertility preferences, utilizing the 2020 provincial-level sex ratio for individuals aged 20–39 as a proxy for women’s bargaining power in the marriage market. Results The results, based on a sample of 2,351 household-level observations, indicate that spouses’ preferences are complementary. When a husband (or wife) desires a second child, their own preference has a stronger impact on the actual decision to have a second child if their partner also expresses the same desire. Additionally, the findings reveal evidence of assortative mating in terms of preferences for the desired number of children: when a husband’s (or wife’s) ideal number of children increases by one, the wife (or husband) prefers 0.32 (0.49) additional children. Moreover, in provinces with higher male-to-female sex ratios—indicating stronger bargaining power for women—a wife’s preference is more strongly aligned with her husband’s preference. For men, however, a husband’s preference aligns with his wife’s preference regardless of the sex ratio, suggesting that men’s bargaining power in the marriage market is relatively weak. Conclusions The findings have two key implications. First, shared fertility preferences between spouses exert a complementary effect, increasing the likelihood of having a second child. Second, marriage matching is not random, as individuals are more likely to partner with those who share similar fertility preferences. Additionally, women with greater bargaining power positively influence their husbands’ desired family size.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-630/v2?src=rss">Demand-side barriers and economic burden in accessing Human Papillomavirus screening for cervical cancer prevention in rural India: Evidence from a cross-sectional study [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction Cervical cancer is a significant global health concern, especially in low- and middle-income countries with limited access to preventive healthcare. India’s vast rural population amplifies the challenge, demanding immediate action. Despite advancements, cervical cancer remains prevalent among underserved rural communities, hindered by barriers to Human Papillomavirus (HPV) screening uptake, including socioeconomic and financial constraints. This study aims to evaluate the economic challenges encountered by rural women when accessing HPV screening. Methods A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 1502 women aged 30 to 45 in Pondicherry, India, utilizing the Andersen Model as a conceptual framework. Household questionnaires gathered data on HPV screening expenses, including patient travel costs, productivity loss, and companion costs. The analysis utilized regression models, to identify the factors impacting the economic challenges associated with accessing HPV screening. Results The study found that employment status significantly influenced healthcare costs, with employed women incurring ₹65.78 more than unemployed women (p < 0.001). Education level was also a significant predictor, with each additional year of education leading to a ₹108.45 increase in costs (p < 0.001). Travel time had a positive association with healthcare costs, with every additional minute spent traveling increasing costs by ₹5.98 (p < 0.001). Income and companion accompaniment were also significant predictors, while distance to the PHC and age did not show significant associations with total healthcare. Conclusions The study highlights the multifaceted economic challenges faced by rural populations accessing HPV screening for cervical cancer prevention in India. Notwithstanding diverse demographics and varying proximity to healthcare facilities, individuals encounter significant barriers such as travel time and associated costs. Addressing these challenges necessitates targeted interventions to reduce socioeconomic disparities and improve healthcare accessibility for vulnerable populations, thereby advancing cervical cancer prevention efforts and promoting health equity in rural communities.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>We investigated whether the use of antihypertensive medication (AHM) is associated with <i>in vivo</i> Alzheimer's Disease (AD) pathologies in older adults with hypertension and examined if the effect differs by drug-class and blood–brain barrier (BBB) permeability of the drug.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This cross-sectional study recruited participants from the Korean Brain Aging Study for the Early Diagnosis and Prevention of Alzheimer's Disease. Participants comprised both cognitively normal and impaired older adults diagnosed with hypertension (n = 408). All participants underwent comprehensive clinical assessment and [<sup>11</sup>C] Pittsburgh Compound B positron emission tomography (PET) for measurement of cerebral β-amyloid (Aβ) deposition. Additionally, a subset of participants (n = 120) was subjected to [<sup>18</sup>F] AV-1451 PET to assess tau deposition.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The AHM group (n = 227) exhibited significantly lower Aβ deposition (B [SE] = −0.104 [0.037], <i>p</i> = 0.006) compared to the non-AHM group (n = 181), even after controlling for age, sex, apolipoprotein E ε4-positivity, vascular risk factors, and mean arterial blood pressure. Further analysis by AHM class showed an association between the use of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RASi) and less Aβ deposition (B [SE] = −0.143[0.049], <i>p</i> = 0.004). No significant relationships were observed between the use of BBB-permeable AHM and Aβ deposition. Additionally, associations between AHM use and tau deposition did not reach statistical significance.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our findings suggest that AHM use may be associated with lower Aβ burden in older adults with hypertension. Further studies exploring the underlying mechanism, particularly related to RASi, may provide insights into new therapeutic targets for AD. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                <p>Transient focal neurological episodes (TFNE), often associated with convexity subarachnoid hemorrhage (cSAH), are common in cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), but their pathophysiology remains incompletely understood. In six patients with unremitting TFNE, using high-resolution post-contrast magnetic resonance imaging and vessel wall imaging (VWI), we found various combinations of transient leptomeningeal, parenchymal and vessel wall enhancement; in 5 of 6 the enhancement included regions corresponding anatomically to symptoms. Three patients had resolution of TFNE and enhancement (2 with corticosteroid treatment, 1 without). Our observations suggest that inflammation might contribute to the pathophysiology of CAA-related TFNE and cSAH, with potential wider relevance for the associated high risks of recurrent ICH in CAA more generally.

                <p>The long-term clinical outcomes and associated prognostic factors in contactin-associated protein-like 2 (CASPR2)-antibody diseases are unknown. A total of 75 participants with CASPR2 antibodies were longitudinally assessed for disability, quality-of-life, and chronic pain. Although most symptoms improved within 6 months of treatment, neuropathic pain and fatigue were the most immunotherapy refractory, and persisted for up to 6 years. Furthermore, these two factors—but not CASPR2 antibody levels or subclasses—independently predicted worse disability and quality-of-life at 24 months. Quality-of-life varied widely for any given modified Rankin Scale score, indicating a divergence between patient and clinician assessed outcomes. Further work should study the relative importance of these measures, and the immunopathogenesis underlying intractable symptoms. ANN NEUROL 2025;97:521–528</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Rehabilitation is thought to reduce ataxia severity in individuals with hereditary cerebellar ataxia (HCA). This multicenter, randomized controlled superiority trial aimed to examine the efficacy of a 30-week goal-directed rehabilitation program compared with 30 weeks of standard care on function, ataxia, health-related quality of life, and balance in individuals with an HCA.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Individuals with an autosomal dominant or recessive ataxia (aged ≥15 years) were enrolled at 5 sites in Australia. Participants were randomized (1:1) to receive rehabilitation (6 weeks of outpatient physiotherapy followed by a 24-week home exercise program) (n = 39) or continued their usual activity (n = 37). The primary outcome measure was the motor domain of the Functional Independence Measure (mFIM) at 7 weeks. Secondary outcomes included the Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA) and the SF-36v2, assessed at 7, 18, and 30 weeks. Outcome assessors were blinded to treatment allocation.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Seventy-one participants (rehabilitation, 37; standard-care, 34) were included in the intention-to-treat analysis. At 7 weeks, mFIM (mean difference 2.26, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.26 to 4.26, <i>p</i> = 0.028) and SARA (−1.21, 95% CI: −2.32 to −0.11, <i>p</i> = 0.032) scores improved after rehabilitation compared with standard care. Compared with standard care, rehabilitation improved SARA scores at 30 weeks (mean difference −1.51, 95% CI: −2.76 to −0.27, <i>p</i> = 0.017), but not mFIM scores (1.74, 95% CI: −0.32 to 3.81, <i>p</i> = 0.098). Frequent adverse events in both groups were fatigue, pain, and falls.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Goal-directed rehabilitation improved function at 7 weeks, with improvement in ataxia and health-related quality of life maintained at 30 weeks in individuals with HCA, beyond that of standard care. ANN NEUROL 2025;97:409–424</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Intravascular lymphoma is a rare subtype of B-cell lymphoma characterized by a clonal proliferation restricted to the lumen of small vessels. Over 50% of patients exhibit central nervous system (CNS) involvement, but diagnosis is often delayed due to the lack of distinctive features. We aimed to identify key phenotypic features for early diagnosis of intravascular lymphoma with CNS involvement through an in-depth cohort study.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We built up a multicenter retrospective cohort of 17 patients recruited in collaboration with the French Expert Network for Oculo-Cerebral Lymphomas (LOC network), and retrospectively analyzed data from medical records.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In this cohort, 15 of 17 (88%) patients developed focal neurological episodes, often fluctuating and/or recurrent, with a sudden onset in 68% of episodes, suggesting a vascular origin. Rapid cognitive deterioration occurred in 15 of 17 (88%) patients, psychiatric manifestations in 8 of 17 (47%), and “B signs” in 14 of 17 (82%). Brain MRI showed polymorphic FLAIR hyperintensities in 14 of 16 (87%) patients, and DWI-positive lesions in 13 of 16 (81%) of patients, which accumulated over time and had unusual characteristics for ischemic lesions (progressive growth, persistent DWI-hyperintensity over 1 month, surrounded by a wider FLAIR hyperintensity). Early-onset inflammatory syndrome, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels were observed in over 90% of cases. Mild and inconsistent meningitis contrasted with a nearly-constant hyperproteinorachia. An increased interleukin 10/6 ratio over 0,7 was found in 4 of 7 (57%) patients, and skin biopsy led to a pathological diagnosis in 3 of 6 (50%) patients.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The results of this study highlight “red flags” that could help accelerate the diagnosis of intravascular lymphoma involving the CNS. ANN NEUROL 2025;97:435–448</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To identify biochemical changes in individuals at higher risk of developing amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) or frontotemporal dementia (FTD) via <i>C9orf72</i> hexanucleotide repeat expansion (HRE) heterozygosity.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Cross-sectional observational study of 48 asymptomatic <i>C9orf72</i> HRE carriers, 39 asymptomatic non-carrier controls, 19 people with sporadic ALS, 10 with <i>C9orf72</i> ALS, 14 with sporadic FTD, and 10 with <i>C9orf72</i> FTD. Relative abundance of 30 pre-defined cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers of ALS and FTD were compared in asymptomatic <i>C9orf72</i> HRE carriers and age-matched non-carrier controls. Differential abundance of these proteins was quantified using data independent acquisition mass spectrometry or electro chemiluminescent assay for neurofilament light chain. Unbiased analysis of the entire cerebrospinal fluid proteome was then carried out.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Ubiquitin carboxyl-hydrolase isozyme L1 levels were higher in asymptomatic <i>C9orf72</i> HRE carriers compared with age-matched non-carriers (log<sub>2</sub>fold change 0.20, FDR-adjusted <i>p</i>-value = 0.034), whereas neurofilament light chain levels did not significantly differ. Ubiquitin carboxyl-hydrolase isozyme L1 levels remained elevated after matching of groups by neurofilament levels (<i>p</i> = 0.011), and after adjusting for age, sex, and neurofilament levels. A significant difference was also observed when restricting analysis to younger participants (&lt;37) matched by neurofilament level (<i>p</i> = 0.007).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Elevated cerebrospinal fluid ubiquitin carboxyl-hydrolase isozyme L1 levels in <i>C9orf72</i> HRE carriers can occur in the absence of increased neurofilament levels, potentially reflecting either compensatory or pathogenic mechanisms preceding rapid neuronal loss. This brings forward the window on changes associated with the <i>C9orf72</i> HRE carrier state, with potential to inform understanding of penetrance and approaches to prevention.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Subclinical vascular brain injury is an increasingly recognized risk factor for stroke and dementia. Despite well-established sex differences in vascular risk and disease prevalence, the impact of sex on drivers of subclinical vascular brain injury remains unclear, presenting a barrier to developing sex-specific prevention guidelines. We aimed to establish the extent to which sex moderates associations between vascular risk factors and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures of subclinical brain injury in stroke-free older adults.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We leveraged cross-sectional data from 1,579 stroke- and dementia-free Framingham Heart Study Offspring participants at exam 8 (age 65.7 ± 8.8 years, 53% women). Vascular risks were assessed using components of the Framingham Stroke Risk Profile (FSRP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP). White matter hyperintensity volume (WMH), total cerebral brain volume (TBV), and covert brain infarcts were quantified using MRI. We examined whether vascular risk factors were associated with MRI measures across the combined cohort, and then determined whether sex modified these associations.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Higher FSRP and specifically systolic blood pressure (SBP) were associated with greater WMH. These associations were stronger in women and remained after adjusting for menopause age and hormone therapy use. By contrast, diabetes and lower DBP were associated with smaller TBV primarily in men. The DBP-atrophy relationship was only observed in men with declining DBP or prior hypertension.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our findings highlight differential vulnerability to the impact of vascular risk factors on white matter health in women and global atrophy in men, supporting the development of sex-specific guidelines to better preserve vascular brain health in aging.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27136?af=R">Cerebrovascular Function in Sporadic and Genetic Cerebral Small Vessel Disease</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Cerebral small vessel diseases (SVDs) are associated with cerebrovascular dysfunction, such as increased blood–brain barrier leakage (permeability surface area product), vascular pulsatility, and decreased cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR). No studies assessed all 3 functions concurrently. We assessed 3 key vascular functions in sporadic and genetic SVD to determine associations with SVD severity, subtype, and interrelations.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In this prospective, cross-sectional, multicenter INVESTIGATE-SVDs study, we acquired brain magnetic resonance imaging in patients with sporadic SVD/cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL), including structural, quantitative microstructural, permeability surface area product, blood plasma volume fraction, vascular pulsatility, and CVR (in response to CO<sub>2</sub>) scans. We determined vascular function and white matter hyperintensity (WMH) associations, using covariate-adjusted linear regression; normal-appearing white matter and WMH differences, interrelationships between vascular functions, using linear mixed models; and major sources of variance using principal component analyses.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We recruited 77 patients (45 sporadic/32 CADASIL) at 3 sites. In adjusted analyses, patients with worse WMH had lower CVR (<i>B</i> = −1.78, 95% CI −3.30, −0.27) and blood plasma volume fraction (<i>B</i> = −0.594, 95% CI −0.987, −0.202). CVR was worse in WMH than normal-appearing white matter (eg, CVR: <i>B</i> = −0.048, 95% CI −0.079, −0.017). Adjusting for WMH severity, SVD subtype had minimal influence on vascular function (eg, CVR in CADASIL vs sporadic: <i>B</i> = 0.0169, 95% CI −0.0247, 0.0584). Different vascular function mechanisms were not generally interrelated (eg, permeability surface area product~CVR: <i>B</i> = −0.85, 95% CI −4.72, 3.02). Principal component analyses identified WMH volume/quantitative microstructural metrics explained most variance in CADASIL and arterial pulsatility in sporadic SVD, but similar main variance sources.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Vascular function was worse with higher WMH, and in WMH than normal-appearing white matter. Sporadic SVD-CADASIL differences largely reflect disease severity. Limited vascular function interrelations may suggest disease stage-specific differences. ANN NEUROL 2025;97:483–498</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Among patients with acute stroke, we aimed to identify those who will later develop central post-stroke pain (CPSP) versus those who will not (non-pain sensory stroke [NPSS]) by assessing potential differences in somatosensory profile patterns and evaluating their potential as predictors of CPSP.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In a prospective longitudinal study on 75 acute stroke patients with somatosensory symptoms, we performed quantitative somatosensory testing (QST) in the acute/subacute phase (within 10 days) and on follow-up visits for 12 months. Based on previous QST studies, we hypothesized that QST values of cold detection threshold (CDT) and dynamic mechanical allodynia (DMA) would differ between CPSP and NPSS patients before the onset of pain. Mann–Whitney <i>U</i>-tests and mixed analysis of variances with Bonferroni corrections were performed to compare z-normalized QST scores between both groups.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In total, 26 patients (34.7%) developed CPSP. In the acute phase, CPSP patients showed contralesional cold hypoesthesia compared to NPSS patients (<i>p</i> = 0.04), but no DMA differences. Additional exploratory analysis showed NPSS patients exhibit cold hyperalgesia on the contralesional side compared to the ipsilesional side, not seen in CPSP patients (<i>p</i> = 0.011). A gradient-boosting approach to predicting CPSP from QST patterns before pain onset had an overall accuracy of 84.6%, with a recall and precision of 75%. Notably, both in the acute and the chronic phase, approximately 80% of CPSP and NPSS patients showed bilateral QST abnormalities.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Cold perception differences between CPSP and NPSS patients appear early post stroke before pain onset. Prediction of CPSP through QST patterns seems feasible. ANN NEUROL 2025;97:507–520</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Mitochondrial dysfunction is one of the earliest pathological events observed in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The aim of this study is to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP), a mild mitochondrial uncoupler, in an ALS mouse model to provide preclinical proof-of-concept evidence of using DNP as a potential therapeutic drug for ALS.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>hSOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice were treated with 0.5–1.0 mg/kg DNP through daily oral gavage from presymptomatic stage or disease onset until 18 weeks old. Longitudinal behavioral studies were performed weekly or biweekly from 6 to 18 weeks old. In situ muscle contraction measurements in <i>extensor digitorum longus</i> muscles were conducted to evaluate the preservation of contractile force and motor unit numbers in hSOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice following DNP treatment. Muscle innervation and inflammatory markers were assessed using immunostaining. Extent of protein oxidation and activation of Akt pathway were also examined.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>DNP delayed disease onset; improved motor coordination and muscle performance in vivo; preserved muscle contractile function, neuromuscular junction morphology, and muscle innervation; and reduced inflammation and protein oxidation at 18 weeks old in hSOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice. Strikingly, symptomatic hSOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice exhibited a period of recovery in running ability at 20 cm/s several weeks after 2,4-dinitrophenol treatment started at disease onset, offering the first observation in disease phenotype reversal using a small molecule.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our results strongly support that micro-dose DNP may be used as a potential novel treatment for ALS patients, with a possibility for recovery, when used at optimal doses and time of intervention. ANN NEUROL 2025;97:542–557</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Monoallelic variants in the transient receptor potential melastatin-related type 3 gene (<i>TRPM3</i>) have been associated with neurodevelopmental manifestations, but knowledge on the clinical manifestations and treatment options is limited. We characterized the clinical spectrum, highlighting particularly the epilepsy phenotype, and the effect of treatments.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We analyzed retrospectively the phenotypes and genotypes of 43 individuals with <i>TRPM3</i> variants, acquired from GeneMatcher and collaborations (n = 21), and through a systematic literature search (n = 22). We included all patients with a pathogenic <i>TRPM3</i> variant.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The median age at the time of the study was 10 years, with a preponderance of girls (60%) versus boys (40%). Frequent findings were developmental delay and/or intellectual disability (93%), global or axial hypotonia (77%), ocular involvement (70%), musculoskeletal anomalies (65%), and dysmorphic features (58%). Epilepsy was diagnosed in 31 patients (72%), classified in all as developmental and epileptic encephalopathy with or without spike wave activation in sleep (DEE/DEE-SWAS). Patients with the variant p.Val1002Met (n = 24) significantly more often had developmental delay and epilepsy. The most effective anti-seizure medication was primidone. All treated patients showed an improvement in seizure frequency, motor and speech development, and/or learning capability with this drug.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Developmental delay/intellectual disability and epilepsy are dominant phenotypic features in patients with <i>TRPM3</i> variants. Given that epilepsy can negatively impact development, screening for awake and sleep electroencephalogram abnormalities and other manifestations are essential to offer early intervention. The TRPM3 channel blocker primidone has shown promising effects and should be considered in every child with a <i>TRPM3</i> gain-of-function variant. ANN NEUROL 2025;97:561–570</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>B-cell–depletion via CD20 antibodies is a safe and effective treatment for active relapsing multiple sclerosis (RMS). Both ocrelizumab (OCR) and ofatumumab (OFA) have demonstrated efficacy in randomized controlled trials and are approved for treatment of RMS, yet nothing is known on their comparative effectiveness, especially in the real-world setting.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This prospective cohort study includes patients that were started on either OCR or OFA between September 2021 and December 2023. Patients were followed until June 2024 and recruited at 3 large tertiary centers in Germany (Duesseldorf, Essen, and Giessen). Propensity-score-matching was used to address baseline imbalances among patients. Clinical relapses, presence of new or enlarging MRI lesions and 6-month confirmed disability worsening were evaluated. Non-inferiority of OFA compared to OCR was evaluated through comparison of Kaplan–Meier-estimates.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 1,138 patients were initially enrolled in the cohort. Following patient selection and propensity-score-matching, 544 OCR and 417 OFA patients were included in the final analysis. In our primary analysis, OFA was non-inferior to OCR in terms of relapses, disability progression, and accrual of MRI lesions. Subgroup analyses confirmed findings in previously naïve and platform-treated patients. Potential differences between OFA and OCR were seen in patients switching from S1P receptor modulators or natalizumab.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>We here provide comparative data on the effectiveness of OCR and OFA in patients with active RMS. OFA was non-inferior to OCR in the overall cohort. Potential differences observed in patients switching from S1P receptor modulators or natalizumab require further validation. ANN NEUROL 2025;97:583–595</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>We examined the impact of the rs10191329 genetic risk variant on neuroaxonal damage as measured by serum neurofilament light chain (sNfL) levels, and disability progression in people with multiple sclerosis (pwMS).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In a cohort of pwMS (n = 740), 658 participants were prospectively monitored every 2 years for less than a decade while 82 of 740 pwMS were monitored retrospectively for up to 40 years. We investigated associations between rs10191329 variants and clinical outcome, including Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), disability accrual (defined by EDSS-increase of at least 1.5 for patients starting at EDSS 0, at least 1.0 EDSS-points for patients with an initial EDSS between 1 and 4.5 and at least 0.5 points for patients starting with an EDSS equal or greater than 5) and progression to secondary progressive MS (SPMS). Clinical outcomes were analyzed using Kaplan–Meier and Cox proportional hazards analyses. Disability accumulation over time was depicted using a generalized mixed-effect model. Single-molecule array was used to assess sNfL levels.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Homozygous, heterozygous, and non-carriers of the rs10191329 risk variant displayed comparable sNfL levels indicating similar neuroaxonal damage at the time of diagnosis. Importantly, in homozygous carriers we found highest sNfL levels in follow-up visits preceding elevated disease progression later in the disease course, a steeper increase in overall disability measures and higher probability of SPMS development.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>These findings highlight how genetic variants may serve as new biomarkers for disease progression and can be used for personalized medicine and risk assessment in MS. ANN NEUROL 2025;97:596–605</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>In autosomal recessive spastic ataxia of Charlevoix-Saguenay (ARSACS) disease, severity and age of onset vary greatly, hindering to objectively measure and predict clinical progression. Thickening of the retinal nerve fiber layer is distinctive of ARSACS patients, as assessed by optical coherence tomography, whereas conventional brain magnetic resonance imaging findings include both supratentorial and infratentorial changes. Because longitudinal imaging studies in ARSACS patients are not available to define these changes as biomarkers of disease progression, we aimed to address this issue in the ARSACS mouse model.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We performed longitudinal retinal OCT and brain MRI in the <i>Sacs</i>
<sup>−/−</sup> ARSACS mouse model, alongside motor and coordination assessment in the beam walking test. We also investigated visual function and the molecular mechanisms underlying RNFL increased thickness by histology and immunofluorescence.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We demonstrated that RNFL thickening by OCT gradually increases in the early stages of pathology in the <i>Sacs</i>
<sup>−/−</sup> mouse model, reflecting the progression of motor impairment, and later reaches a plateau when thinning of the posterior corpus callosum becomes detectable by MRI. Mechanistically, we unveiled that RNFL thickening is associated with aberrant accumulation of non-phosphorylated neurofilament H and glial fibrillary acidic protein. We also uncovered mild signs of myelin pathology coherent with increased latency of visual evoked potentials, and altered retinal activation by photopic electroretinography.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>We show that both RNFL thickening and MRI changes may represent biomarkers of disease progression in the <i>Sacs</i>
<sup>−/−</sup> mouse model. Our data gathers knowledge instrumental to clinical studies, holding potential as readout for treatment efficacy. ANN NEUROL 2025;97:425–434</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To analyze long-term clinical and biomarker features of anti-contactin-1 (CNTN1) autoimmune nodopathy (AN).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Patients with anti-CNTN1<sup>+</sup> autoimmune nodopathy detected in our laboratory from which clinical information was available were included. Clinical features and treatment response were retrospectively collected. Autoantibody, serum neurofilament light chain (sNfL), and serum CNTN1 levels (sCNTN1) were analyzed at baseline and follow up.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 31 patients were included. Patients presented with progressive sensory motor neuropathy (76.7%) with proximal (74.2%) and distal involvement (87.1%), ataxia (71.4%), and severe disability (median INCAT at nadir of 8). A total of 11 patients (35%) showed kidney involvement. Most patients (97%) received intravenous immunoglobulin, but only 1 achieved remission with intravenous immunoglobulin. A total of 22 patients (71%) received corticosteroids, and 3 of them (14%) did not need further treatments. Rituximab was effective in 21 of 22 patients (95.5%), with most of them (72%) receiving a single course. Four patients (12.9%) relapsed after a median follow up of 25 months after effective treatment (12–48 months). Anti-CNTN1 titers correlated with clinical scales at sampling and were negative after treatment in all patients, but 1 (20/21). sNfL levels were significantly higher and sCNTN1 significantly lower in anti-CNTN1<sup>+</sup> patients than in healthy controls (sNfL: 135.9 pg/ml vs 7.48 pg/ml, sCNTN1: 25.03 pg/ml vs 22,186 pg/ml, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001). Both sNfL and sCNTN1 returned to normal levels after successful treatment.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Patients with anti-CNTN1<sup>+</sup> autoimmune nodopathy have a characteristic clinical profile. Clinical and immunological relapses are infrequent after successful treatment, suggesting that continuous treatment is unnecessary. Anti-CNTN1 antibodies, sNfL, and sCNTN1 levels are useful to monitor disease status in these patients. ANN NEUROL 2025;97:529–541</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27145?af=R">Towards a Unified Set of Diagnostic Criteria for Multiple Sclerosis</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The 2017 McDonald criteria continued the separation of diagnostic criteria for relapsing–remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) and primary progressive MS (PPMS) for historical, rather than biological, reasons. We aimed to explore the feasibility of a single, unified set of diagnostic criteria when applied to patients with suspected PPMS.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We retrospectively identified patients evaluated for suspected PPMS at 5 European centers. The 2017 McDonald PPMS criteria was the gold standard against which the 2017 McDonald RRMS dissemination in space (DIS) and dissemination in time criteria were evaluated. We also investigated modified RRMS DIS criteria, including: (i) optic nerve lesions; (ii) ≥2 spinal cord lesions; and (iii) higher fulfilment of DIS criteria alone (lesions in ≥3 regions) without dissemination in time/positive cerebrospinal fluid, for a diagnosis of PPMS.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 282 patients were diagnosed with PPMS using the 2017 McDonald criteria, and 40 with alternate disorders. The 2017 McDonald RRMS DIS criteria and the modified DIS criteria including the optic nerve or ≥2 spinal cord lesions performed well in PPMS diagnosis when combined with dissemination in time/positive cerebrospinal fluid (sensitivity 92.9–95.4%, specificity 95%, accuracy 93.2–95.3%). A diagnosis of PPMS based on high fulfillment of modified RRMS DIS criteria had high specificity, but low sensitivity. A diagnostic algorithm applicable to patients evaluated for suspected MS is proposed.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The 2017 McDonald RRMS criteria and modifications to DIS criteria, currently under consideration, performed well in PPMS diagnosis. Forthcoming revisions to the McDonald criteria should consider a single, unified set of diagnostic criteria for MS. ANN NEUROL 2025;97:571–582</p>

                Oral contraceptive use, vaccination for Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection are risk factors for venous thromboembolism. Branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO) generally develops mid-60s patients. Herein, we present a case of superotemporal BRVO caused by the above mentioned risk factors in a young woman. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report about superotemporal BRVO associated with oral contraceptives, COVID-19 vaccination, and SARS-CoV-2. A 21-year-old woman presented with loss of visual acuity in her right eye for 10 days. She had been receiving oral contraceptives for 2 years for oligomenorrhea before noticing ophthalmological symptoms. Despite having received two doses of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, she contracted COVID-19 and developed fever, sore throat, cough, low back pain, and general malaise about 40 days before the initial visit. However, only cough persisted for more than a month. The right eye showed superotemporal BRVO with macular edema (ME). She did not smoke nor had diabetes or hypertension. Blood test results, including cardiolipin antibody IgG, were normal. She was treated with an intravitreal aflibercept injection. ME in the fundus showed rapid improvement and resolution. Although more than 20 months have passed since the first injection, there has been no relapse of ME. The combination of oral contraceptive use, COVID-19 vaccination, and subsequent SARS-CoV-2 infection could induce the development of venous thromboembolism, thereby leading to superotemporal BRVO. Given that cases of COVID-19 have increased globally, patients with retinal vein occlusion who use oral contraceptives are likely to be encountered more frequently.

                Villari et al. present the generation of a luminescent reporter for a β1 integrin activation sensor (β1IAS). A siRNA HTS on β1IAS KI endothelial cells revealed previously uncharacterized regulators of β1 integrin activation: the E3 ubiquitin ligase Pja2, which promotes kindlin-2 degradation, and the VEGF-B, which stabilizes β1 integrin inactive conformation.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/87930">De novo identification of universal cell mechanics gene signatures</a></h4>

              
                Cell mechanical properties determine many physiological functions, such as cell fate specification, migration, or circulation through vasculature. Identifying factors that govern the mechanical properties is therefore a subject of great interest. Here, we present a mechanomics approach for establishing links between single-cell mechanical phenotype changes and the genes involved in driving them. We combine mechanical characterization of cells across a variety of mouse and human systems with machine learning-based discriminative network analysis of associated transcriptomic profiles to infer a conserved network module of five genes with putative roles in cell mechanics regulation. We validate in silico that the identified gene markers are universal, trustworthy, and specific to the mechanical phenotype across the studied mouse and human systems, and demonstrate experimentally that a selected target, <i>CAV1</i>, changes the mechanical phenotype of cells accordingly when silenced or overexpressed. Our data-driven approach paves the way toward engineering cell mechanical properties on demand to explore their impact on physiological and pathological cell functions.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94982">Maintenance of cell wall remodeling and vesicle production are connected in Mycobacterium tuberculosis</a></h4>

              
                Pathogenic and nonpathogenic mycobacteria secrete extracellular vesicles (EVs) under various conditions. EVs produced by <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> (<i>Mtb</i>) have raised significant interest for their potential in cell communication, nutrient acquisition, and immune evasion. However, the relevance of vesicle secretion during tuberculosis infection remains unknown due to the limited understanding of mycobacterial vesicle biogenesis. We have previously shown that a transposon mutant in the LCP-related gene <i>virR</i> (<i>virR<sup>mut</sup></i>) manifested a strong attenuated phenotype during experimental macrophage and murine infections, concomitant to enhanced vesicle release. In this study, we aimed to understand the role of VirR in the vesicle production process in <i>Mtb</i>. We employ genetic, transcriptional, proteomics, ultrastructural, and biochemical methods to investigate the underlying processes explaining the enhanced vesiculogenesis phenomenon observed in the <i>virR<sup>mut</sup></i>. Our results establish that VirR is critical to sustain proper cell permeability via regulation of cell envelope remodeling possibly through the interaction with similar cell envelope proteins, which control the link between peptidoglycan and arabinogalactan. These findings advance our understanding of mycobacterial extracellular vesicle biogenesis and suggest that these set of proteins could be attractive targets for therapeutic intervention.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91011">Development and assessment of a sustainable PhD internship program supporting diverse biomedical career outcomes</a></h4>

              
                A doctoral-level internship program was developed at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill with the intent to create customizable experiential learning opportunities for biomedical trainees to support career exploration, preparation, and transition into their postgraduate professional roles. We report the outcomes of this program over a 5-year period. During that 5-year period, 123 internships took place at over 70 partner sites, representing at least 20 academic, for-profit, and non-profit career paths in the life sciences. A major goal of the program was to enhance trainees’ skill development and expertise in careers of interest. The benefits of the internship program for interns, host/employer, and supervisor/principal investigator were assessed using a mixed-methods approach, including surveys with closed- and open-ended responses as well as focus group interviews. Balancing stakeholder interests is key to creating a sustainable program with widespread support; hence, the level of support from internship hosts and faculty members were the key metrics analyzed throughout. We hypothesized that once a successful internship program was implemented, faculty culture might shift to be more accepting of internships; indeed, the data quantifying faculty attitudes support this. Furthermore, host motivation and performance expectations of interns were compared with results achieved, and this data revealed both expected and surprising benefits to hosts. Data suggests a myriad of benefits for each stakeholder group, and themes are cataloged and discussed. Program outcomes, evaluation data, policies, resources, and best practices developed through the implementation of this program are shared to provide resources that facilitate the creation of similar internship programs at other institutions. Program development was initially spurred by National Institutes of Health pilot funding, thereafter, successfully transitioning from a grant-supported model, to an institutionally supported funding model to achieve long-term programmatic sustainability.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96839">Behavioural pharmacology predicts disrupted signalling pathways and candidate therapeutics from zebrafish mutants of Alzheimer’s disease risk genes</a></h4>

              
                By exposing genes associated with disease, genomic studies provide hundreds of starting points that should lead to druggable processes. However, our ability to systematically translate these genomic findings into biological pathways remains limited. Here, we combine rapid loss-of-function mutagenesis of Alzheimer’s risk genes and behavioural pharmacology in zebrafish to predict disrupted processes and candidate therapeutics. <a href="https://github.com/francoiskroll/FramebyFrame">FramebyFrame</a>, our expanded package for the analysis of larval behaviours, revealed that decreased night-time sleep was common to F0 knockouts of all four late-onset Alzheimer’s risk genes tested. We developed an online tool, <a href="https://francoiskroll.shinyapps.io/zoltar/">ZOLTAR</a>, which compares any behavioural fingerprint to a library of fingerprints from larvae treated with 3677 compounds. ZOLTAR successfully predicted that <i>sorl1</i> mutants have disrupted serotonin signalling and identified betamethasone as a drug which normalises the excessive day-time sleep of <i>presenilin-2</i> knockout larvae with minimal side effects. Predictive behavioural pharmacology offers a general framework to rapidly link disease-associated genes to druggable pathways.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101802">Statistical learning beyond words in human neonates</a></h4>

              
                Interest in statistical learning in developmental studies stems from the observation that 8-month-olds were able to extract words from a monotone speech stream solely using the transition probabilities (TP) between syllables (Saffran et al., 1996). A simple mechanism was thus part of the human infant’s toolbox for discovering regularities in language. Since this seminal study, observations on statistical learning capabilities have multiplied across domains and species, challenging the hypothesis of a dedicated mechanism for language acquisition. Here, we leverage the two dimensions conveyed by speech –speaker identity and phonemes– to examine (1) whether neonates can compute TPs on one dimension despite irrelevant variation on the other and (2) whether the linguistic dimension enjoys an advantage over the voice dimension. In two experiments, we exposed neonates to artificial speech streams constructed by concatenating syllables while recording EEG. The sequence had a statistical structure based either on the phonetic content, while the voices varied randomly (Experiment 1) or on voices with random phonetic content (Experiment 2). After familiarisation, neonates heard isolated duplets adhering, or not, to the structure they were familiarised with. In both experiments, we observed neural entrainment at the frequency of the regularity and distinct Event-Related Potentials (ERP) to correct and incorrect duplets, highlighting the universality of statistical learning mechanisms and suggesting it operates on virtually any dimension the input is factorised. However, only linguistic duplets elicited a specific ERP component, potentially an N400 precursor, suggesting a lexical stage triggered by phonetic regularities already at birth. These results show that, from birth, multiple input regularities can be processed in parallel and feed different higher-order networks.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101882">Mapping kinase domain resistance mechanisms for the MET receptor tyrosine kinase via deep mutational scanning</a></h4>

              
                Mutations in the kinase and juxtamembrane domains of the MET Receptor Tyrosine Kinase are responsible for oncogenesis in various cancers and can drive resistance to MET-directed treatments. Determining the most effective inhibitor for each mutational profile is a major challenge for MET-driven cancer treatment in precision medicine. Here, we used a deep mutational scan (DMS) of ~5764 MET kinase domain variants to profile the growth of each mutation against a panel of 11 inhibitors that are reported to target the MET kinase domain. We validate previously identified resistance mutations, pinpoint common resistance sites across type I, type II, and type I ½ inhibitors, unveil unique resistance and sensitizing mutations for each inhibitor, and verify non-cross-resistant sensitivities for type I and type II inhibitor pairs. We augment a protein language model with biophysical and chemical features to improve the predictive performance for inhibitor-treated datasets. Together, our study demonstrates a pooled experimental pipeline for identifying resistance mutations, provides a reference dictionary for mutations that are sensitized to specific therapies, and offers insights for future drug development.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95952">Identification of nonsense-mediated decay inhibitors that alter the tumor immune landscape</a></h4>

              
                Despite exciting developments in cancer immunotherapy, its broad application is limited by the paucity of targetable antigens on the tumor cell surface. As an intrinsic cellular pathway, nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) conceals neoantigens through the destruction of the RNA products from genes harboring truncating mutations. We developed and conducted a high-throughput screen, based on the ratiometric analysis of transcripts, to identify critical mediators of NMD in human cells. This screen implicated disruption of kinase SMG1’s phosphorylation of UPF1 as a potential disruptor of NMD. This led us to design a novel SMG1 inhibitor, KVS0001, that elevates the expression of transcripts and proteins resulting from human and murine truncating mutations in vitro and murine cells in vivo. Most importantly, KVS0001 concomitantly increased the presentation of immune-targetable human leukocyte antigens (HLA) class I-associated peptides from NMD-downregulated proteins on the surface of human cancer cells. KVS0001 provides new opportunities for studying NMD and the diseases in which NMD plays a role, including cancer and inherited diseases.

">Disentangling Rhythmic and Aperiodic Neural Activity: Investigating the Role of GABA Modulation in Sensorimotor Beta Oscillations</a></h4>

              
                Beta oscillations (13-30 Hz) in the sensorimotor cortex are fundamental to motor control and are disrupted in motor disorders such as Parkinson's disease and stroke. Animal studies and pharmacological research in humans have implicated GABAergic mechanisms in modulating these oscillations. Here, we explored the impact of GABAergic modulation on sensorimotor beta oscillations using magnetoencephalography (MEG) during a finger abduction task, with participants administered gaboxadol and zolpidem, two GABA-A positive allosteric modulators. We combined traditional oscillatory analyses with spectral parametrisation methods to separate periodic and aperiodic neural components. Time-frequency representations (TFRs) showed that gaboxadol induced a stronger modulation of beta dynamics than zolpidem, leading to deeper beta desynchronisation during movement and a more pronounced post-movement beta rebound. When accounting for aperiodic activity, gaboxadol showed modest effects limited to movement initiation, with increased beta power during movement onset but no significant impact during post-movement rebound. In contrast, zolpidem significantly enhanced beta power and altered aperiodic components, suggesting differential influences on GABAergic modulation and excitation-inhibition balance. These results underscore the necessity of distinguishing between periodic and aperiodic signals in spectral measures to improve the interpretation of neural oscillatory data.

">Evidence for abstract codes in parietal cortex guiding prospective working memory</a></h4>

              
                The recent past helps us predict and prepare for the near future. Such preparation relies on working memory (WM) which actively maintains and manipulates information providing a temporal bridge. Numerous studies have shown that recently presented visual stimuli can be decoded from fMRI signals in visual cortex (VC) and the intra-parietal sulcus (IPS) suggesting that these areas sustain the recent past. Yet, decoding concrete, sensory signals leaves open how past information is transformed into the abstract codes critical for guiding future cognition. Here, human participants used WM to maintain a separate spatial location in each hemifield wherein locations were embedded in a star-shaped sequence. On each trial, participants made a sequence-match decision to a spatial probe and then updated their WM with the probe. The same abstract star-shaped sequence guided judgments in each hemifield allowing us to separately track concrete spatial locations (hemifield-specific) and abstract sequence positions (hemifield-general), while also tracking representation of the past (last location/position) and future (next location/position). Consistent with previous reports, concrete past locations could be decoded from VC and IPS. Moreover, in anticipation of the probe, representations shifted from past to future locations in both areas. Critically, we observed abstract coding of future sequence positions in the IPS whose magnitude related to speeded performance. These data suggest that the IPS sustains abstract codes to facilitate future preparation and reveal the transformation of the sensory past into the abstract future.

">Comparative molecular landscapes of immature neurons in the mammalian dentate gyrus across species reveal special features in humans</a></h4>

              
                Immature dentate granule cells (imGCs) arising from adult hippocampal neurogenesis contribute to plasticity, learning and memory, but their evolutionary changes across species and specialized features in humans remain poorly understood. Here we performed machine learning-augmented analysis of published single-cell RNA-sequencing datasets and identified macaque imGCs with transcriptome-wide immature neuronal characteristics. Our cross-species comparisons among humans, monkeys, pigs, and mice showed few shared (such as DPYSL5), but mostly species-specific gene expression in imGCs that converged onto common biological processes regulating neuronal development. We further identified human-specific transcriptomic features of imGCs and demonstrated functional roles of human imGC-enriched expression of a family of proton-transporting vacuolar-type ATPase subtypes in development of imGCs derived from human pluripotent stem cells. Our study reveals divergent gene expression patterns but convergent biological processes in the molecular characteristics of imGCs across species, highlighting the importance of conducting independent molecular and functional analyses for adult neurogenesis in different species.

">AAV-mediated peripheral single chain variable fragments administration to reduce cerebral tau in adult P301S transgenic mice: mono- vs combination therapy</a></h4>

              
                Tau is a primary target for immunotherapy in Alzheimer s disease. Recent studies have shown the potential of anti-tau fragment antibodies in lowering pathological tau levels in vitro and in vivo. Here, we compared the effects of single-chain variable fragments (scFv) derived from the well-characterized monoclonal antibodies PHF1 and MC1. We used adeno-associated virus 1 (AAV1) to deliver scFvs to skeletal muscle cells in eight-week-old P301S tau transgenic mice. We evaluated motor and behavioral functions at 16 and 23 weeks of age and measured misfolded, soluble, oligomeric and insoluble brain tau species. Monotherapy with scFv-MC1 improved motor and behavioral functions more effectively than scFv-PHF1 or combination therapy. Brain glucose metabolism also benefited from scFv-MC1 treatment. Surprisingly, combining scFvs targeting early (MC1) and late (PHF1) tau modifications did not produce additive or synergistic effects. These results confirm that intramuscular AAV1-mediated scFv-MC1 gene therapy holds promise as a potential treatment for Alzheimer s disease. Our findings also suggest that combining scFvs targeting different tau epitopes may not necessarily enhance efficacy if administered together in a prevention paradigm. Further research is needed to explore whether other antibodies combinations and/or administration schedules could improve the efficacy of scFv-MC1 alone.

">Reversable Acute Sedation Response of Phosphorothioate Antisense Oligonucleotides Following Local Delivery to the Central Nervous System</a></h4>

              
                Antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) locally delivered to the central nervous system (CNS) are being approved as therapies for neurological diseases. After intrathecal injection of some ASOs, transient toxicities have been reported, but considerable inconsistencies remain in classifying them and their underlying mechanisms. Here, we characterize an acute sedation response that can include loss of lower spinal reflexes, hypoactivity, paresis, sedation and ataxia, peaking ~3 hours post-intrathecal injection of some phosphorothioate ASOs and reversing by 24 hours with no sequelae. Acute sedation is distinct from acute activation, which is hyperactivity and muscle cramping that occurs immediately after administering oligonucleotides. Acute sedation translates across species from rodents to non-human primates and is sequence-, dose-, and chemistry dependent. Acute sedation can be mitigated by strategic placement of phosphorothioate backbone linkages in ASOs and by avoiding G-rich sequences. The acute sedation response can be modeled in primary neural cultures, with good predictability of in vivo response. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that acute sedation is caused by high extracellular ASO concentrations inhibiting synaptic transmission, which reverses as ASO is cleared from the extracellular space and taken up into cells. Our results provide a comprehensive framework for quantifying and mitigating acute sedation caused by some phosphorothioate ASOs.

">The 5-HT1F Receptor Agonist Lasmiditan improves Cognition and Ameliorates Associated Cortico-Hippocampal Pathology in Aging Parkinsonian Mice</a></h4>

              
                While the etiopathology of Parkinsons disease (PD) is complex, mitochondrial dysfunction is established to have a central role. Thus, mitochondria have emerged as targets of therapeutic interventions aiming to slow or modify PD progression. We have previously identified serotonergic 5-HT1F receptors as novel mediators of mitochondrial biogenesis (MB) - the process of producing new mitochondria. Given this, here, we assessed the therapeutic potential of the FDA-approved 5-HT1F receptor agonist, lasmiditan, in a chronic progressive PD model (Thy1-aSyn line 61 mice). It was observed that systemic lasmiditan exhibited robust brain penetration and reversed cognitive deficits in young (4-5.5 months old) Thy1-aSyn mice (1mg/kg, every other day). Anxiety-like behavior was also improved while motor function remained unaffected. These behavioral changes were associated with enhanced MB and mitochondrial function, paired with reduced alpha-synuclein aggregation particularly in cortico-hippocampal regions. Furthermore, in older (10-11.5 months old) mice, although the effects were milder, daily lasmiditan administration increased MB and bettered cognitive abilities. In essence, these findings indicate that repurposing lasmiditan could be a potent strategy to address PD-related cognitive decline.

">Delayed transplantation of neural stem cells improves initial graft survival following stroke</a></h4>

              
                Neural stem cell therapies hold great promise for improving stroke recovery, but the hostile stroke microenvironment can hinder the initial graft survival. It has long been well documented that the microenvironment evolves over time, making it crucial to identify the optimal transplantation window to maximize therapeutic efficacy. However, it remains uncertain whether acute or delayed local cell transplantations better supports graft viability after stroke. Here, we show that delayed intracerebral transplantation of neural progenitor cells (NPCs) derived from human induced pluripotent cells (iPSCs) at 7 days post stroke significantly enhances graft proliferation and survival, compared to acute transplantation at 1 day post stroke, in a mouse model of large cortical stroke. Using in vivo bioluminescence imaging over a 6-week period post-transplantation, we observe a more than 5-fold increase in bioluminescence signal in mice that received delayed NPC therapy, compared to those that underwent acute NPC transplantation. The increased number of cell grafts in mice receiving delayed NPC transplantation was driven by increased proliferation rates early after transplantation, which subsequently declined to similarly low levels in both groups. Notably, we found that the majority of transplanted NPCs differentiated into neurons after 6 weeks, with no significant differences in the neuron-to-glia ratio between acute and delayed transplantation groups. These findings suggest that delayed NPC transplantation improves early graft survival and proliferation, which could help identify the optimal therapeutic window for maximizing the effectiveness of NPC-based therapies in stroke.
